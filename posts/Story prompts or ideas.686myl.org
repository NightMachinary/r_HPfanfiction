I, personally, know I'm not a good writer, but I have a ton of ideas that I don't know what to do with. I couldn't find or think of any other places to post them so I thought I'd put them here. Feel free to use them or post your own ideas here.

1) A story that starts out as a generic self insert with a female protagonist who was reincarnated into Tom Riddle's Era and goes to Hogwarts with him and seems to be setting up a crappy romance thing where she falls in love with Tom or whatever. But it turns out that Tom is also a self insert/is a reincarnation of a HP fan as well (but a more realistic one instead of a pseudo Mary Sue) and has to do damage control for her doing stupid stuff, keep his past life a secret and deal with Grindelwald. I guess the POV would alternate between the two of them.

2) In which the Philosophers Stone is sentient and doesn't want to be destroyed/wants to see the world outside its Gringotts vault so it fuses into Harry's hand at the end of the first book to provide snarky commentary, advice and healing magic (ie the elixir of life is actually a powerful healing potion that can even heal damage done by old age. ).

3) Slytherin had to enslave the Basilisk with control magic which Harry breaks at the end of his second year so now he has a giant snake who knows all the secrets of Hogwarts and everything that's happened in it for nearly a millennia.

4) A student (OC or OOC) is bad at any magic that involves wands to cast spells but is a genius in something else. For example, a history of magic expert who is also an excellent strategist or a Herbology expert who uses plants to lay traps or a potions master who finds out how to create potions that bestow magical abilities (such as making people Parselmouths or Metamorphs).

So yeah, sorry if these are bad, but feel free to use these ideas if any resonate with you or add your own if you want to.


** 1) Harry's "Harem." That is to say to protect certain women from having to marry Draco/Crabbe/Goyle, Harry "marries" them adding them to his harem. Except he has no actual intention of sexing them up or such and the feeling is very much mutual. Many of the girls end up dating boys outside the harem who are in on it (two girls in the Harem might possibly even date each other). This of course would lead to some blatant lies as Harry's wives and their actual lovers start to have children;

Draco: I know that Daphne's child can't be yours.

Harry: And well why not?

Draco: He's /black./

Harry: What does that have to do with anything? I thought wizards were supposed to be enlightened about race. Can't two white people have a black child? Honestly, Draco.

Draco: Alright, well, I know Hermione isn't being faithful to you. I saw her snogging Ron Weasley.

Harry: We enjoy polyjuice play from time to time. Ron was kind enough to loan me some of his hair.

Draco: But you're Lord Potter-Black! Why would you want to pretend to be Ron Weasley?

Harry: What goes on in the bedroom stays between me and Hermione...and Luna...and Daphne...and Padma...and Parvati...and Susan...and Hannah...and Tracey...and Ginny...and Cho...and Fleur

Draco: And on that! Hannah's child looks exactly like Neville. And you hiring Neville as a live-in babysitter? Come on, you can't keep up this pretense. You're going to have to admit some of these wives have been unfaithful to you and annul their marriages so that some of us can actually get wives of our own.

Harry: I'm offended at the supposition that Frank Naginikiller Herbology Potter is anything but my son and that any of my wives have been unfaithful. And I hired Neville because he's great with kids.

Draco: Hannah and Neville have been spotted holding hands.

Harry: Neville is also an excellent hand-holder and it is included among the many services I pay him for.

Draco: You don't even live in the same country as Luna anymore!

Harry: She was interested in magical creatures so I hired one of the American Scamanders to take her as a multi-year apprentice. Honestly, just because she's one of my many wives doesn't mean she can't have interests of her own.

Draco: She's had children more than nine months after she left on this apprenticeship.

Harry: Potter sperm is /very/ hardy, it can survive months in the bloodstream before it strikes.

Etcetera, etcetera.

2)

Canon! Harry Potter, Slytherin! Harry Potter, Fem! Ravenclaw! Potter, and Hufflepuff! Metamorphagus! Harry Potter go on an interdimensional Horocrux hunt to defeat Dark Lord! Harry Potter where they meet other Harry Potters such as Harmony! Harry Potter.

3)

Muggleborn Genius who tries to modernize Hogwarts and the Wizarding world runs into some trouble when it turns out there are actually a lot of good reasons for some of the weirdness of the wizarding world (i.e quills help with wand movements).

** When Salazar Slytherin leaves Hogwarts, he founds his own school, which doesn't accept muggleborns. Many anti-muggle families send there students to Slytherins school, though there are some who are not blood supremacists. Dumbledore is sent to Slytherin's school. We end up with a darker grey, but still well intentioned Dumbledore who becomes the Headmaster of Slytherin's school. Grindelwald is not imprisoned, but an uneasy peace is formed between magical schools. Tom Riddle, being an orphan of unknown heritage, would not be able to go to Slytherin's School. He goes to Hogwarts, and is sorted into Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. He begins to gather followers, under a different banner than blood supremacy, but intends to rule the world all the same. Perhaps when he discovers his heritage he transfers to Slytherin''s school. Someone else becomes headmaster of Hogwarts. (McGonagall? Flitwick? Flamel?) With the help of Sirius Black and Arthur Weasley, two of Slytherin School's professors that aren't anti-muggle, Dumbledore is able to slowly change things. Arthur is more subtle in his support of muggles, and Sirius more subtle in his disagreements with his family. By Harry's time, there are a fair amount of Slytherin School students and families who are pro-tradition, and while not necessarily welcoming of muggles, are at least not in support of slaughtering them. Snape is sorted into either Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, and maintains his friendship with Harry. He does not fight as much with James and Remus. (Who do not have Sirius as a childhood friend) Lily and James still die, and Remus or Snape, Harry's godfather, is sent to Azkaban. The other teaches at Hogwarts. Or perhaps James and Lily never meet, and Neville is the BWL? The Triwizard Tournament includes both schools, and Harry is Hogwart's Champion while Neville is Slytherin's, though they become good friends during the year.

** In which Tom Riddle Senior finds himself in the city of Yharnam after going to sleep, and when he wakes up from this vivid nightmare where he died so many times, and what he remembers the most of is the intoxicating taste of blood and the echoes of those he slain under his blade ringing in his head, Tom Riddle will never look the world with the same eyes of the man he was rather of a Hunter. Bloodborne x HP(Any Character can fill the role of the hunter except Harry Potter)
