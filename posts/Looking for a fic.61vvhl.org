The story was at least 300-400k words long. It was Harry!Harem. If I remember correctly, Luna, Narcissa, Lily Moon, and maybe Tonks were part of the harem. Harry was locked up in a tower at Hogwarts early in the story, and Luna got him out of the tower. I'm pretty sure the reason he was locked in the tower was because he cursed Draco on the Hogwarts Express.
