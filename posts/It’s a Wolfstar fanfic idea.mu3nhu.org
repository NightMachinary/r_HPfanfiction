Alright, I would write this myself but I'm Shit at writing romance so I'm giving the idea away.

Fifteen year old Remus Lupin was nothing special. Besides the fact that he was a werewolf of course. No friends, just him at Hogwarts, and all for the better if you ask him. If you keep people close, they find out about things that should be kept hidden. Like the fact that you have lycanthropy, for example. He's a loner, always has been, and he likes it that way.

Now Sirius Black is a different story. Sirius Black is never lonely, what with his very best friend and Quidditch sensation James Potter, and all his admiring fans and friend wannabes. His list of girlfriends and boyfriends is much longer than his completed assignments, and only the best last for more than a week. Now, every Monday, his previous date being dumped the day before unless they were extremely lucky, he chose a new one. Everybody knew what happened, and they all vied for the position, save for a few, led by the fearless Lily Evans. One day, a small, fair haired, scarred boy catches Sirius's attention. But he has to choose the one boy who'd rather just be left alone.

Hmm?


** Sorry you're getting downvoted - this sub isn't always friendly to slash. Luckily, [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] is a thing too. Join us! This fic is very good, and it's fairly close to what you described if you're interested in a recommendation:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2543330/chapters/5654189][*Dating Remus Lupin*]] *by Children_of_the_Shadows:* Remus Lupin is a mystery to the whole school; the boy who's quiet, aloof, and cold. He also happens to be queer, which is enough to gain Sirius's interest. What Sirius never realised that dating Remus Lupin wasn't quite as easy as it looked.

*** I read that! It's great!. And this idea isn't really slash, more romantic. It's really funny how a Sirius randomly declares that they're dating

**** Interesting... I was under the impression that the term "slash" is used for any male/male pairing, romantic or sexual, these days. I know it used to be the stricter definition you're using - maybe that's still the case and I just misread things! The sub at least is definitely not focused solely on mature and explicit fics.

Yeah, it's not exactly what you described but it had enough overlap that I thought it was worth linking. I enjoyed that bit too. :)

***** Sorry, I guess my definition was a bit off. It's more romantic, but nothing that's really inappropriate. Like a kiss, but not anything further.

****** Oh, you're fine! Like I said, I may have misinterpreted too. I'm a terrible fiction writer so it won't be me, but I hope someone else picks up your idea because it would be a really cute fic. You could also try cross-posting to [[/r/Wolfstar][r/Wolfstar]].
