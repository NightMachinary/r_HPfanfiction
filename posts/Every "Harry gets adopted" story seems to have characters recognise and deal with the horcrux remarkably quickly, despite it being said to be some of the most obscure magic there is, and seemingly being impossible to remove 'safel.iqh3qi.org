#+TITLE: Every "Harry gets adopted" story seems to have characters recognise and deal with the horcrux remarkably quickly, despite it being said to be some of the most obscure magic there is, and seemingly being impossible to remove 'safely'. This plot misses out on a TON of drama. So without further ado:

  Snape walked up to Dumbledore's office, answering a summons. But strangely, he walked with a smile on his face. Students gawked as he passed, more terrified of his happiness than his anger. When he announced himself in Dumbledore's office, he caught the old wizard in the middle of pouring two sets of tea. He straightened up, looking guilty.

  “Hello, Severus. Rather fast, aren't you? I couldn't have summoned you more than a few minutes ago.”

  “I'm quite eager to hear what you have to say.”

  Dumbledore's eyes widened. “Truly? You always tell me these visits are among your worst memories.”

  “I don't remember saying that.”

  “Oh, yes, you told me I was a rotten old man. You said I had scabs.”

  “That doesn't sound like something I'd say.”

  “Well, regardless.” Dumbledore finished pouring the tea and fumbled around for a moment, seemingly not sure what to do with his hands. It got awkward. “So, about Harry.”

  “Ah,” Severus cut in eagerly. “Well, reticent as I am to take direction from others, I must admit that in this case, you have guided me well. At first I resisted when you told me to bond with the boy, but as it happens, we've grown rather close. We are like... father and son, you could say. Or something that comes close. Truly, I am as dependent upon him as he is upon me---and I consider his dependence an honour. I feel closer to Lily than ever. I feel, perhaps, that... that she might be proud of the man I have become.”

  “Ah.” Dumbledore said starkly, face stiff as wax. “Is that so?”

  “Yes. And I have you to thank. For your encouragement. But anyway, what did you need? Is something the matter with Harry?”

  Dumbledore stared at him for a long time, hands wringing atop the desk. “Well, the fact of the matter is---ahem, well... Look, why don't you take a seat?” With that, he lowered himself into his seat with a creak. Hesitant, Severus followed him.

  “Try the tea,” Dumbledore said urgently. It was unusual. Severus knew he was scrambling for some way to stall.

  They stared at each other.

  “Look,” Dumbledore said eventually, holding his hands up in submission. “Cards on the table, there's been a major cock-up, okay? On my part. Yes, hindsight is a bitch, or however that saying goes. But, you see---cards on the table---what's done is done and there's no taking it back. I thought it best if we sat down and discussed it, and figured out what to do from here.”

  Severus held his tea still. “Okay...”

  “This might come as quite a shock to you. You might want to have some more of your tea, make sure you're in the right headspace.”

  “No, I'm fine,” Severus said quickly, becoming frustrated now. “What is it?”

  Dumbledore squinted and hissed through his teeth as though experiencing something incredibly unpleasant. “Well, alright, here's the situation,” he said in a tight voice. “Horcruxes, right? Who needs ‘em. Not me. Anyway. What I'm trying to say is, ah, you remember how I said there were multiple, hiding anywhere, must be destroyed?”

  “Yes. I'm not sure why this is relevant, Albus.”

  Dumbledore gasped as if wounded. “Ah! Well, see, I may know where one of them is...”

  Snape leapt to his feet. “You've found one?”

  “Not ‘found'. I've known the location of this one for quite some time.”

  “Well, where is it? It must be destroyed.”

  Dumbledore winced. “Well, yes, that's what I'm trying to talk to you about. See. That horcrux might, maybe, perhaps... be inside young Harry Potter. And killing him might be the only way to destroy it.”

  They stared at each other even more. Severus' frowned, uncomprehending.

  “Well.” Dumbledore claps his hands. “There's no ‘maybe' about it. There's definitely a horcrux in Harry, and killing him is definitely the only way to remove it.”

  “You're joking,” Severus said thinly, faltering back a step.

  “No, yeah, I'm really not. Uh, do you want to sit back down?”

  “No!” he snapped. Dumbledore's hands went up again.

  “Okay, okay, I can see you're upset. I've already admitted it, yeah, the egg is really on my face this time---”

  "Albus!" Severus snapped, his mouth taut in a snarl. "You will not stand there and --- and ---"

  "Look," said Albus, "in retrospect, I really should've told you. I admit it, okay? The egg ---"

  "He had become a son to me! Lily's boy!" Snape cried, brandishing his wand.

  "Okay, yeah, I can see that. My bad, okay? If I could go back I'd change it, but seriously, what's done is done."
