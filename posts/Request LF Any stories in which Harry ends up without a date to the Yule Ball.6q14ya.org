** I can imagine a 'plan b' where a date-less Harry opens the ball for everyone, spinning and cartwheeling his way onto the center stage like a gymnant before waving a ribbon on a stick to wave in the champion couples.

Alternatively, if he's less athletic, he could adopt a military-esque or brass-band uniform, carrying a flag and a marching drum and blowing a little whistle as he marches and drums in the rest of the school after him.

** Dragon Lily [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/11517235]]

I love this fic, although this is abandoned and I do not like the subplot of the world and the loss of magic and deather supers op ... But the romance and interactions are so fucking amazing.

And does not get date for the yule party...

****** What's it with this taboo? I really don't get it, sure it's not the norm, but if a child is not the goal (children born from incest are very likely to suffer from genetic illnesses after all) and BC is used, it's IMHO not something to condemn (can you control who you fall in love with? Do you like being in love and not acting on it because society condemns you if it gets out? - No? I thought so!)

I mean there have been cases of siblings separated at birth who fucking ended up married and are now in prison because they refused to stay away from each other! Sorry, but I just can't condemn love! I can't and I won't!

** Ok why is this even a thing... This can't even be a trope...

Or may be it's deeper thing? Harry without a date to Yule Ball... Means nobody likes to be seen with Harry... Means he is isolated? Why? Did he kill someone? Is he psychopath?

This request is so pointless. It's a minor plot point and as long as there is no catastrophic point leading to it or a major character development happening because of this incident, it shouldn't even be in a fic.

To each his own, I guess.

***** Well... He may had planed to spend that day in the other side of the world dancing naked, who knows.. The point is that Christmas is a day that many plan for, and Harry may not appreciate having his plans fucked up by a school ball.

****** Of course the guy who can't even independently decode to spend holidays in his preferred location (because an old man couldn't keep his hands off the chosen one) has plans to spend Christmas somewhere else when whole school and magical world is expecting him to attend an event as contender of triwizard tournament.

It's possible that he might have plans. But that would mean his character developed far too different than canon or typical fanon. Even the most independent and edge lord Harry won't miss this chance to mingle with powerful people.

Unless he is spending night with 20 Veelas, killing someone vital or going to resurrect his mom (because he is angry that Ginny - who reminds him of his mom - is dating someone else) his reasons don't make sense.
