:END:
I know there was a goblin raised, a canon, a Slytherin girl, a Harry who still had family, and a girl whose twin brother was Harry but he died. They all could listen into each other's heads, and there was some prophecy about bringing death to Voldemort sevenfold. I THINK the Slytherin potter also got the shield of Slytherin?


** Might be Keystone Council. Not sure, though. Been a while since I read it.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.
