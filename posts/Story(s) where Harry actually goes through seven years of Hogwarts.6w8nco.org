I swear, Harry never finishes Hogwarts. Just look at HPMOR. He only finishes one year. I really want one where he completes 7 years. I don't care too much about other aspects of the story, I just need this completion. Thanks :)

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: the Trio still went back to School despite the Carrows being there. Why they could afford to do that will be explained very thoroughly in the story. Both Harry and Ron finished their Year 7.
