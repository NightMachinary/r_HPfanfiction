I've had this idea of exploring divergent histories between the muggle and magical world in my head for awhile. The idea of people existing in both worlds but by different names and known for different deeds (or the same deeds just with vastly different surviving perspectives) fascinates me. We often see the idea in fan fiction with historical figures who are known in both worlds and the stories are roughly the same, but the magical side has more knowledge or is used to explain the "miracles" the muggles attribute to them. For instance I have seen quite a few stories doing this with Joan of Arc.

I give you the following: Hippocrates of Kos father of muggle western medicine and medical ethics, is Herpo the Foul parselmouth, horcrux creator, and "father of the dark arts".

During the spring/summer of their 17th year it was tradition for the wizards of ancient Greece to travel to Delphi and seek an audience with the Pythia, the head oracle at the Temple of Apollo.

I ask you to follow the journey of a 17 year old Hippocrates, schooled in healing magics by his father and grand-father, to Delphi, and from there explain how he came to be know as a great physician and father of medical ethics to the muggles, and a powerful feared dark wizard to the magical world.

**** I am working on finishing up at least part of my attempt of it. It may be awhile still, I'm struggling to get the right tone.
