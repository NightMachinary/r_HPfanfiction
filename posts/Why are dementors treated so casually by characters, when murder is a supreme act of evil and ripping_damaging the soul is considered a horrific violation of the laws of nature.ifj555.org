:END:
So I was contemplating a story idea where Harry is traumatized by nearly having his soul eaten by a dementor in his third year and starts looking into Horcruxes and other dark magic to try and protect his soul, when I got thinking; is it just me, or are characters in the Harry Potter books a bit too casual about soul-eating monsters and the existence of the Dementor's Kiss?\\
 \\
Like, when Harry first learns about what the Dementor's Kiss does from Lupin, his reaction is that it's bad but the oh-so-evil Sirius Black deserves it. Later on after discovering Sirius's innocence and nearly being kissed by a dementor, Harry seems to just bounce back afterwards, and he cares more about Sirius being innocent (though that is important) than about the ethics of the dementor's kiss.\\
On the Ministry side of things, Fudge is entirely too casual about the soul-destroying dementor's kiss. He's not even gleeful about it, just treating the act like business-as-normal. When Barty Crouch Jr. /does/ get the dementor's kiss in the next book, nobody seems concerned that a soul was destroyed, just that Crouch won't be able to testify as to what happened. Next book after that, Umbridge sends a couple of dementors after Harry, in lieu of other assassination options.\\
 \\
It just seems very strange to me. Why is taking someone's life (making a horcrux, killing a unicorn, etc) considered a serious evil act, but taking someone's soul (dementor's kiss, maybe destroying horcruxes) is considered acceptable? Are souls replaceable or reconstitutable in the Harry Potter universe or something?


** I'm not sure I agree - in GoF Harry thinks the Dementors kiss is worse than death.

#+begin_quote
  Harry felt a chill in his stomach, as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the Dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. *He was worse than dead.*
#+end_quote

McGonagall also has strong reactions

#+begin_quote
  Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were angry blotches of colour in her cheeks, her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
#+end_quote

It's also notable that AFAIK Barty Crouch Jr is the only person from both wars who is executed.

*** My head canon for why the Dementors kiss would be worse than death is because your soul doesn't move onto the afterlife. It'd either be an eternity of sitting in a Dementors stomach or slowly feeling your soul dissolve as it gets digested.

Harry Potter, the setting, seems to heavily imply there is some kind of afterlife. To many people never being able to see their friends and loved ones again would be a fate worse than death

That colors almost everything - the Ministry controls them by /giving them what they want/ just enough for them not to rebel (and then they do anyway by the time Voldemort's ready to take over). To them, it's business-as-usual because they can't treat it any other way without going mad.

In Year 4, it's shown that the teachers absolutely abhor the Dementors. McGonagall looks furious and scarred in a way that Harry never saw before when she witnessed the Kiss happening.

  Why is taking someone's life (making a horcrux, killing a unicorn, etc) considered a serious evil act, but taking someone's soul (dementor's kiss, maybe destroying horcruxes) is considered acceptable?
#+end_quote

Presumably for the same reason that in societies where execution is permitted, murder is considered wrong but executing people is considered fine. Or, for societies without execution, why kidnapping is considered wrong but sticking someone in prison is considered fine.

Basically: in most modern societies, the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. The state can do things that individuals cannot. The double standard doesn't really have much to do with the nature of the act itself. It's about who is doing it, and to whom.

Also, for the sake of completeness, I should note that we don't know what happens to souls after they are sucked out of your body by a Dementor. All we know is that it is "gone forever... lost". I had always assumed that this meant the soul moved on, the same as when you die, and it was only when I started reading fanfiction that I found that some people had read it as the soul being destroyed or consumed.

Well, Dumbledore and Lupin both describe it as 'a fate worse than death', so I think that's where people get the impression that the soul is destroyed, or at least irretrievably trapped inside the dementor.\\
If not for that description of the Kiss, and dementors being described as soulless, evil, and amongst the foulest creatures to walk the earth...you could probably flavour dementors as being not-bad reaper-esque entities; their presence recalling the normal grief and stress people feel when encountering death, their kiss functioning to painlessly extract the soul and banish it to the afterlife with no chance of a malevolent spirit returning.

***** When I read the books as a child, I thought that they made a person brain dead. The worse than dead part I took as meaning that the process of it happening was unimaginably horrible and, perhaps, that if there was an afterlife other than becoming a ghost in HP, that they don't go there and just stop existing. Which, I suppose to a religious person, would be quite horrible. I was never religious, though, so I didn't think about that too much.

***** In mage the awakening, when you lose your soul you first become depressed, then soon after you become catatonic, you're still aware, but deeply miserable because that which brings you joy no longer brings you anything, so you don't do anything but eat, sleep, and breathe basically because you just can't find the motivation. That's roughly how I've always pictured it.

Plus being brain dead isn't worse than death, it's pretty much equivalent.

But here's another possibility: the worse than death doesn't refer to the fate of the body at all. And the soul isn't destroyed but trapped within the dementor until it fades away.

It's the same with HP. Dementors are horrible creatures but they aren't human. The acts they commit may be terrible but don't carry the same moral weight that a human's action does. Murder is a crime, but a bear killing a human is only a tragic accident.

** Don't we say that criminals deserve the death penalty for their cruelty? I guess that if we want to go for an equivalent, it's practically the same thing. Curle, depraved criminals deserve to have their soul sucked out. Of course, some people oppose the death penalty in real life for multiple reasons (they think it's too cruel or they think it's an easy way out). I'd imagine some are opposed for various different reasons as well. However, for advocates of the kiss, you see how the Dementors were unleashed on the general populace in book 6, you'd understand why they want them cooper up with prisoners as bait, there's the added stink of fear in there too. Not because of the prisoners but because of the Dementors themselves.

Take Arthur's reaction as an example: Mr Weasley is part of the general populace, and he's so affected by it, you can still hear his caution through his dialogue. You hear Fred and George talk about how affected he was, and why they're terrifying to them. Hermione tells Harry that Black will be back with the Dementors and 'serves him right'. I think that the gravity of his supposed crimes are really undermined by some. Sirius purportedly:

a) betrayed the Potters and was an important spy. This is more understandable once you consider the first war's nature about whom you couldn't trust, everybody was a spy or under the Imperius. That, in and of itself, is terrifying enough.

b) murdered 13 people with a single spell, and only a great number of Hit Wizards could supposedly subdue such a powerful wizard on the crime scene. He also laughed a 'mirthless laugh', imagine the situation he was thrust into, it looked really really bad for Sirius. To outsiders, this is a lunatic.

c) broke the Statute of Secrecy which they've worked hard to maintain in the first war, more than usual, when they also need a long while and extra effort to maintain.

d) Now imagine the Alcatraz escapees went and lingered around a school with a knife, people would be chanting for their death.

Now factor in disgusting people like Bellatrix, wouldn't people want her to die? Some would be opposed, of course. I myself do not like the death penalty, I think prisoners should never get the easy way out, and have to suffer for their actions. Not that a prison is like the suffering Bellatrix for example caused Alice and Frank before they went insane. It makes it even more terrifying that they're respected and well liked aurors and people in the community.

Crouch was malevolent. Whether his year in Azkaban and his time under the Imperius curse did affect his brain (which I wholeheartedly believe they did), he deserves to suffer either way. As for why it's so casually treated, maybe the kissed prisoners are used as experimentation, a foray into souls and their relation to magic. I wouldn't be shocked if the Department of Mysteries had one such room where they studied the soul, and Crouch was simply transported there to observe the effects. It still doesn't make sucking out a soul and preventing passage into the afterlife excusable, but it's understandable within the community.

** Hm. The destruction of the soul is an interesting thing in HP Canon. We know directly of two ways that it can happen: one absolute via dementors universally and one non-universally from usage of magic to kill. The easy, Watsonian answer is that the vast majority of witches and wizards never even think about souls and their manipulation. Perhaps it is like higher order physics and mathematics are for us muggles. Sure, some people know that murder fractures the soul. The majority? It's an, "he's dead, Tom." moment.

** Doylist answer: because they're children's books. I think this leads to three distinct consequences that combine to create this backwards portrayal.

- Fantastic (and bloodless) violence in children's media usually gets more of a pass with editors/censors than realistic violence.
- JKR didn't want to delve into anything /worse/ that murder in a children's series (even though there's plenty to choose from), so she set the bar for the ultimate evil there by fiat.
- The few times she /did/ touch on something worse, she glossed over it enough that the appropriate reactions (and they /are/ there) are pushed into the background (at least in comparison). See also: the Cruciatus Curse.

** Because it's government sanctioned, the Dementor's Kiss is considered justice. Until quite recently, a cop who shot someone was justified, while a civilian who killed someone was a murderer. People assumed that the Ministry had the best interests of the entire magical world in mind, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. They didn't revolt when known Death Eaters got off free after Voldemort's first war, so why would they question whether the Dementor's Kiss is a fair and moral punishment?

** The same reason why a lot of things are treated so casually.

The ability to mind-read, poly juice potions, love potions, Harry's childhood, all the trauma Harry and others should've had, Ginny's diary incident, Dumbledore sending thirteen year olds on a deadly time traveling mission, etc.

Properly fleshing out and exploring the implications and consequences of all the magical things in HP was not one of the goals of the series.

***** Oh, right. That was an idea I had, I don't know if such a story exists yet.\\
 \\
It'd be a pretty interesting premise, though; at the end of 2nd year, Dumbledore explains how Tom Riddle's diary was a Horcrux, then in his 3rd year, Harry nearly gets his soul eaten by a dementor.\\
Shaken by the near-miss and horrified that murder now looks forgivable by comparison, Harry hesitantly starts looking into the creation of Horcruxes and other soul-manipulating magics to try and protect himself should the worst happen.\\
Unable to immediately reassure or discourage him, a reluctant Dumbledore ends up mentoring Harry as the latter delves into the darkest of Dark Magics, reluctantly committing violations of the laws of nature in hopes of preventing the worst violation of all.\\
 \\
...Or maybe Dumbledore designs a magic mask and Harry sticks it to his face with a charm so that dementors can't get to his mouth to kiss him.\\
I dunno, do you think that sounds like a crossover with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask][The Mask]], or a coronavirus-themed crack fic about trying to get everyone in magical Britain to wear masks to avoid the dementor cootievirus?

** A human has not committed the crime of taking that soul, whereas using the Killing Curse/etc is considered worse because it's an active action that a person does. There's no degree of separation so you can't pretend it's not the result of someones decision. Dementors have some level of sentience as well, so it's PLAUSIBLE (though as demonstrated in canon, not common) that they just... decided to go rogue and have a snack. In that case, it would be like a shark biting a swimming human because they thought they were a fish, and the human dying because of it. Tragic, but blameless because it's in their nature.

** Dementors are scary, but familiar. Everyone knows about them, they're not going anywhere; they're a fact of life, like a dangerous river with a dam that you don't swim in. And maybe you use it to execute the occasional murderer, but that's beside the point. They're distant, and probably deserved it!

But humans? Tearing souls? Killing each other with intention of invoking dark rituals?? That's like taking normal people to the top of the dam and chucking them over on purpose!

** There was more to horcrux creation to just killing. Initial proposals of the ritual involved eating the body of the victim, but it was edited out for obvious reasons. It was extremely unnatural and quite horrifying.

I guess it's easier for them to see dementors as normal, natural things because they're creatures that people have accepted the existence of. There was quite a bit of talk about how ghastly it was to live without a soul, something about being an empty husk, alive and not alive at the same time.

But then, I guess people just see it similar to how they would see getting burned by a dragon or bitten by a basilisk.

*** Enter the Dragon takes an interesting view of Horcrux creation, that it's a perversion of an ancient marriage bond ritual; the original ritual was supposed to soul-bond you to someone, but instead you kill them and transfer the bond to an object. Snape considers this to be the most likely explanation for James Potter getting a quick and clean death; Voldemort needed Lily Potter to be single in order to use her for his Horcrux preparations, so he was willing to be efficient instead of taking time to play.

** The Dementors in my mind have always been just the wizard it world's version of the death sentence. It's only reserved for prisoners who have been sentenced to death. I'm from South Carolina, one of the only couple of states in the U.S. that still offer the electric chair and a form of execution. To the general wizard population, they probably see/think of dementors about as often as I see an electric chair.

For Harry, I suppose it's just one more trauma on the trauma-train. For sure he came out with C-PTSD when the war ended. Some people don't get it, but we see how upset he is in 4th/5th year.

** It might have seemed unrealistic but people are way more blasé about prison guards IRL, not caring if people in jail/prison are treated awfully (at least in the US).

It's the mentality of "if you're in prison you're an awful person anyways, and I'm a good person so I'll never have to worry about it". Torture is also justified under similar premises.

** Many characters, including harry, describe it in the book as a fate much worse than death. Harry cares so much about Sirius' innocence because he doesn't want him to suffer this terrible fate. As for Fudge's nonchalance about the dementors, he sees them as entirely under his own control as MOM and part of his power. Although Fudge is a pretty problematic character, I doubt he would be gleeful about a dementors kiss.

** Coming from a D&D background, I take the perspective that harming a soul is, by default, one of the most utterly vile and depraved things someone can do. Using that as a standard form of execution is monstrous, but hardly surprising when /all/ convicts (and at least two innocent men, one of whom wasn't even charged with anything) are punished not just with incarceration but also continuous torture.
