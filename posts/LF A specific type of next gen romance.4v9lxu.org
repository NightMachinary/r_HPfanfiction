I want fics with the pairings Rose/James or Rose/Albus Severus (yes, cousincest, don't judge). I really liked the 'A Rose for Albus' Series by Summer Leigh Wind. linkffn(10867786)

EDIT: I'd also prefer if they weren't smut and had an actual story!

  What they had wasn't right, but in a world full of people who wanted you for all the wrong reasons, it seemed to them that finding love at all mattered a lot more than with whom. -- One-Shot. The third story in the "A Rose for Albus" series and sequel to "In Someday I Believe".

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** Most countries in the world, including UK, allow first cousin marriages: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/4texbi/the_legality_of_firstcousin_marriage_in_the_world/]]

But look at the mess the US is in regarding this matter.

**** It's a social taboo in most places, and it greatly raises the risk of birth defects. But I can imagine pureblood extremists often resorting to first cousin marriages, with mentally deranged psychos such as the Gaunts, Lestranges, Carrows, and Selwyns (Umbridge) produced as a result.
