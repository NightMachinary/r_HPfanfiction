i go there when i'm feeling anxious or having a depressive episode. when body dysmorphia be playing on my mind and i go to tell myself it's ok to eat.

i go there to feel warm and fuzzy and whole again. i go here to feel accepted and cared about in a way i never have before.

i go there to help me sleep, or on long car rides, or on sunny friday afternoons.

i cannot explain to you have this place has actually saved my life, grounding me in a place of hope and tranquility.

you may be confused about this post, wondering what in the wild world of hpfanficion this has to do with anything.

well, a fanficion was written by a talented person who goes by Waspabi, they wrote a fic called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][hermione grangers hogwarts crammer for delinquents on the run]].

in chapter 5 and 6 they find a place of comfort they always makes my heart warm. Jane and Cynthia's chapters are my happy place.

i've never felt more at home than at their house. this may be due to my issues with my parents, in never feeling accepted, but jesus fucking christ this place is home and i can't even understand it myself.
