No major anti-muggle attacks from the magical side, and surprisingly apart from a handful religious extremists in Saudi Arabia and Alabama not too much anti wizard hate. Success, right?

But then muggles start buying potions to cure their various ailments. Turns out there's a lot of muggles demanding a lot of potions requiring a lot of ingredients, and the griffin breeders can't supply that many claws. Because griffins take quite some time to reach maturity, increasing the population can't be done that quickly. The same thing goes for pretty much every potion that requires parts of magical creatures: Demand goes way up, but the supply stays limited.

The obvious result: Prices skyrocket. Both muggle and magical governments try to limit the market to prevent catastrophe, but the trade simply moves to the black markets. Turns out the muggle economy is way larger than the magical one, and there's a lot of rich muggles who can spend millions on a single vial of potion. Brewers and ingredient suppliers rake in the cash, but the average witch or wizard just can't afford anything anymore.

St. Mungo's and other hospitals run out of potions and money. Wizard governments ask Gringotts to coin more to save their patients, but the result is Weimar-level inflation and devaluation of the galleon, leading to what Grindelwald and Voldemort failed to accomplish: Turning the entire wizarding world - or at least those who aren't making millions - against the muggles.
