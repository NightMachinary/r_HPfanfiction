Just curious if there are any works out there with Hagrid as the main character.


** Have a fucking upvote man! We all need more Hagrid in our lives. I remember one such fic with Hagrid mentoring Harry, and long story short the power he knew not turned out to be a brick.

**** Found it. It's called lessons with Hagrid. Linkffn id: 7512124 and it's even better than what you thought. Summary from ffn: Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Half-Giant's Wand Rights by ZebJeb). Hagrid himself doesn't appear in this one, but he's central to the story.

linkffn(Hiding in Plain Sight by Bil).

linkffn(YAAASSS QUEEN: Queer Eye Comes to Hogwarts by MotherofBulls).

  AU. CoS oneshot. So you're telling me that in a school full of nosey kids, not to mention the famous Dumbledore, no one notices that Hagrid's hiding an acromantula? How's that work? HP, RH.

  The Fab Five face their greatest challenge yet: Rubeus Hagrid. He's got no closet, no bathroom, a bad recipe for rock cakes, a fifty-year-old moleskin coat, and an overgrown beard. Along the way, the Fab Five realize that Hogwarts itself seems to need their help just as much as Hagrid. YAAASSS QUEEN!
