Premise

Dark and Light side are flipped. Dumbledore is the head of a tyrannical regime and Voldemort is a freedom fighter leading a vigilante group to bring down the established order.

In his youth rather than having a wakeup call Dumbledore agrees with Grindelwald and continues with him down the dark path. Their dreams of world domination don't quite come to fruition, but they are divisive figures nonetheless.

Once Gellert acquires the Eldar wand Albus becomes increasingly distrustful of his old friend. (And perhaps a little bit jealous.) In 1945 he betrays and defeats his longtime partner, takes the wand for his own and establishes himself as the new lord of the magical world.

Albus does not see himself as evil -- rather he simply takes “For the Greater Good” to its utmost extreme. He is still wise, clever, intelligent and frighteningly powerful. And many indeed see him as a benevolent lord. He certainly sees himself as force for good. And whatever evils and sufferings the world has to endure under his rule, are simply necessary for the Future Glories to come.

Voldemort also grows up following a different path. One of the changes that Grindelwald and Dumbledore enact is for all magical children to be raised in the magical world. Muggleborns and orphans included. Thus, Tom's early life is very different indeed. He grows up loved, surrounded by smart and intelligent foster family. From early age he learns that secretly, they do not support nor agree what is happening.

He hates the order and its stifling nature. Where everything is regulated and must conform. From early on he starts planning to fight against it, to destroy it, or at the very least make a dent. Spread dissent against the regime. He takes up his alias to hide his who he is from Dumbledore's Order. Only his closest and most trusted know his true identity.

He still fears Dumbledore (and with a good reason) yet like in canon he is still highly successful in his campaign. Yet despite it all he is nowhere near toppling Dumbledore. People still see him as a terrorist, buying into the propaganda...

As for Harry -- he is still the main hero. Caught in a fight between Dumbledore and “terrorist” Voldemort he has to make a choice. Both sides see him as prophesized child and both Voldemort and Dumbledore believe Harry to be the key to defeating the other ...
