** It's because everyone will be in their teens and it won't be too weird to broach the subject of romance after 4th year.

I think skipping years can make or break a story. My story, for example, should actually begin in 7th year but my premise of Sirius surviving the Battle of DoM meant I had to write about 6th year too. In the space of a year, things can happen that change the characteristics of individuals and it would be too jarring to just drop all the nuances and find yourself with an Ooc character whose motivations make no sense to their canon characterization.

But of course, if you think you can make it work, there's no reason why you couldn't.

**** I think it should suffice to summarise the first couple of years just to show where the character stands in terms of social circles and opinions and then go ahead to the meat of the plot if not a lot has changed from canon.

**** Then start on sixth year. The readers can learn about your character as things move along. It's also more interesting for the readers since they get to explore the au elements of the story.

A good rule of thumb when it comes to story starts is to start as close to the ending as possible. You don't want to bog down the readers with useless plot points. In your shoes I'd start the story with your character's first assassination attempt that undoubtedly fails for whatever reason. This would make the readers think your character is evil, but then you can slowly weave in the circumstances that lead them to this point throughout your plot and therefore create an engaging story with a fleshed out protagonist.

But again, that's just one possibility. Do what feels right to you as the author first and foremost.

** Fourth year is a great place to start because the Triwizard Tournament offers a lot of structure to your story, more than any other year. I think that structure helps a lot of authors pace their story a little better. It's also the year where I personally am comfortable with a start to romance. Any younger than 14 just is a little weird. 4th year is also the resurrection of Voldemort and sets up the next years.

Other common places to start a fic are 5th year after Triwizard Tournament or after Sirius death (end of 5th or start of 6th) since they provide major traumatic events in Harry's life that can lead to a big change.

  Btw, I worded my title a bit weirdly. This question isn't just limited to Harry's experiences at Hogwarts, it's just a question for fics in general. Sorry for any confusion :)
#+end_quote

For non-Harry fics I'd say fourth year (Triwizard), fifth year (Umbridge) and seventh year (Snape as headmaster and Death Eaters as teachers) are the most interesting. First and sixth year are not that big in terms of big events happening throughout the year that you can anchor the story to. Second year is also a possibility if you explore the fear and uncertainty surrounding CoS opening.

** I typically prefer fifth year onward; especially for a romance-centred plot, as any earlier just feels weird. This time period in general I think works best for most fics, the characters are mature enough that having them act like adults isn't too unreasonable.

It definitely depends on the premise of the fic though, if there's something neat which can be accomplished by having the characters start earlier, I don't mind seeing first years. Usually '[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][for want of a nail]]' fics do this and it tends to suit them well.

That said, I absolutely cannot stand it when these fics change something rather major, yet /somehow/, everything remains the same as canon up to fifth year or so. If nothing has changed from canon, the author should really just focus on summarizing things, as if we wanted to reread canon, we'd just pick up the original books. Though I do love fics where the author puts a lot of effort into seeing how small changes affect the world, and seeing how everything changes from that.

**** Ah gotcha, guess I read so many Harry-centric stories I forget others exist! ðŸ˜‚

Don't try and pad out your story with unnecessary chapters, as I find that a common pitfall authors tend to step in is feeling obligated to tell us every single moment of a character's life, or dedicate multiple chapters to each Hogwarts year, even if nothing much happens in them. A story becomes boring really quickly when the plot disappears. I've dropped quite a few otherwise well-written stories for this exact reason.

So basically, start your story at the /story's/ beginning. Though if they're important, you could flesh out your character's relationships by including an unrelated plot point at the beginning introducing us to the character and her relationships. Sort of like the bits at the beginning of the /Indiana Jones/ films. This would definitely be a more interesting read than a three paragraph summary/list of a character at the beginning, which I have seen some authors do.

** I don't think you can get a singular answer to this because it depends entirely on the story. As I've seen said before, you start the story where the story starts. Sounds unhelpful, but it's true.

Where is the meat of the story? Where's the action? - It doesn't matter whether that "action" is actual action, romance, a mystery, or whatever.

If the focus of the fic is about a romance with a muggle that Harry meets during the summer after Sirius dies, then starting the fic in the first year is practically guaranteed to be a boring rehash. Start it at that summer, or a little before. You don't want readers to have to wade through 10,000+ words before you even arrive at the focus of the story.

If there are important divergences or other details from previous years that the reader should be aware of, they can be covered with flashbacks, through dialogue, or actually seeing the results of the change.

** The usual rule is to ask yourself if you're writing about the most interesting part of the character's life, and if not, write about that instead. Rowling did a tiny prologue but then the story was about Harry's life between finding out he was a wizard and him killing the bad guy. And then no epilogue because she'd have messed it up. #ewe

That same rule applies with fanfic. If you want to go completely AU you have to set up a world so start with that. If you're changing Harry's reaction to something in Canon, start with that. I always liked what [[/u/Starfox5]] did with Patron which starts at the interesting bit and flicks back to fill in the gaps.

I think stories have got better at this over time. Authors realised that people don't want to read yet another rehash of first year but where Neville goes to confront Voldemort too, or other tiny changes.

** The biggest benefit to fourth year is that there won't be any Quidditch (unless you actually decide to write the entire World Cup again, in which case may God have mercy on your soul).

That said, I'm going to be that guy and say that the best year is first year. The wonder of seeing Hogwarts, the interactions with the Dursleys, and the Trio (or whatever pseudo-OCs you have planned for Harry's new social circle) meeting and making friends is the best part of the series.

** A lot of authors make the mistake of thinking that the point of divergence from cannon is where they need to start their fic. This is wrong and can kill a fic for the reader. I don't need to read about the Dursleys hating Harry for the 1000th time nor see Voldemort kill Lily. Many amazing fantasy universes will throw a reader in with barely any preamble and let them gain understanding of the world as they go. Start respecting the readers ability to infer things and stop explicitly telling them.

** 1st year for a different childhood. 2nd for a different student getting the diary. Third year with classes, but no one has any clue of what they do in the other electives. 4th year or later with romance as well as the Triwizard. 5th year for prefect position as well as ministry ignorance. Sixth year Dumbledore not being cursed. 7th being going back to Hogwarts or a different horcrux hunt.

** The first three years often aren't that important because their outcome doesn't change much about 4th year. The Triwizard happens regardless of how the chamber of secrets plot got resolved or how the Sirius/Peter confrontation ended. The later years all hinge on the end of the 4th year.
