** No guarantee of quality, but there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter]] community that does its best to add all of the stories with the Fem!Harry tag. Just sort by favorites and you should be able to find quite a few.

EDIT: This includes crossovers, just so you know.

** Alexandra Potter by Taure is excellent. Though I don't think she is the Girl-Who-Lived, and that can be a turn off to some readers. Linkffn(8299839)

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
