*** While it's the best long fic I've ever read, it's not without a little romance stuff.

**** That's true, I suppose there were a couple relationships but they weren't central to the plot nor centered on the main character. I suppose I assumed op wouldn't mind people being in relationships in the fic, as long as that wasn't the focus, which is my bad.

** Linkffn(basilisk born) has fantastic world-building and no real romance. Make sure to give it a few chapters though, I think at like 7-8ish it really gets going

  What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to save him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
