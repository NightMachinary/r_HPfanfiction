** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4393256/chapters/9973940][Harry's Cousins]] is the only one I know of. I enjoyed it but it hasn't updated in almost two years. It does end at a decent stopping point for a first book though.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

Narcissa Militant starts off with Harry moving in with the Malfoys, and goes from there. It helps that Lady Malfoy is actually a badass ninja assassin and whatnot.

  AU. Narcissa is actually the source of the Malfoy family's wealth---and not because she inherited the Black fortune, either. She's an in-demand spy and assassin. But now she's retired, and intent on using all her skills to make sure her baby boy gets what he wants. If that's Harry Potter, then Harry Potter he shall have.

  What if Narcissa Malfoy was the mother that had helped Harry Potter at King's Cross Station on September 1st instead of Molly Weasley? After all, the Malfoys are apt to latch onto anything remotely useful to them and use it. And if she wants another son, then who is anyone to deny her that? After all, how much could that possibly change?

** linkffn(8008839) is interesting because Harry ends up very similar to canon Draco, while Draco rebels against his family.
