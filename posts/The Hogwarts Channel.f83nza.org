There's already been plenty of talk about having Gordon Ramsay teach Potions at Hogwarts, and I'm fairly certain I've seen the idea floated of Steve Irwin meeting Hagrid and bonding over their love of (dangerous) wildlife. What other TV personalities would fit in at Hogwarts? Can we build a complete faculty using nothing but?

My proposals:

*Headmaster:* Mr. Rogers\\
*Astronomy:* Carl Sagan\\
*Charms and Transfiguration:* Adam Savage and Jaime Heineman, trading off occasionally

LeVar Burton is my best pick for Runes, or maybe Jim Henson. David Attenborough really should be there somewhere, but Care is already taken.


** - Mythbusters teach DADA - creative uses of spells, the other team can rotate in for their specialties. One year, they offer extra credit to whoever can make the biggest explosion with a single spell...
- Mrs. Frizzle teaches Muggle Studies, uses her bus for field trips for other classes.
- Indiana Jones teaches Ancient Runes ("ah, now this Mayan cluster - I've seen some very nasty traps using it... *goes off describing one of his adventures*).
- History of Magic - the Doctor.
- Arithmancy - Paul Erdos

*** Instead of Indiana Jones, just make it a very confused Harrison Ford who the wizarding world thinks is Indiana Jones, who almost broke the Statute of Secrecy by making a "documentary" of his curse-breaking adventures, but managed to get away with it by making the Muggles think it was fiction.

** David Attenborough can do the theory portion for COMC!
