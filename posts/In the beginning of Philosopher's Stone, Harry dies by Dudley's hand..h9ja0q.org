So, remember the part where they drive out to a hotel trying to escape the letters, and Harry sits on the window and looks out over the highway and the cars and stuff? Well, what if Dudley woke up, and for some reason (maybe he has more sadistic tendencies, idk) just pushes him off. Or he doesn't actually die and is saved by magic or something.

I just thought it would be a cool idea!


** Certainly would make the series a lot shorter lol.

*** Yes, totally! I don't even know how to continue from here, so I didn't write it, but maybe the clever people of [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] will have a good idea.

**** I mean, there are a lot of ways you could take it. For example, he could survive with amnesia (typical soap opera trope, but i don't see it as much in HP fanfics), or he could die but revive as Scarcrux!Harry, OR the Horcrux could get pushed out and Harry resuscitated.

To be 100% honest, it's been so long since I've read the books/seen the 1st movie i have no recollection of the scene in question!

***** I do like a fic where early on, the Horcrux gets pushed out. Good idea with the amnesia! I wonder if he would act like Tom Riddle, like Seventh Horcrux, an iconic fanfiction.

** Or they could use Neville if Harry doesn't survive the fall as he is the other one of the prophecy
