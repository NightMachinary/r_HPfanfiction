Iniga, I want to say thank you for such a wonderful story. Truly I do not exaggerate when I say "The Bureaucratic Error" was a wonderful piece and my absolute favorite story of 2020. My heart broke when I heard that that it was taken down and the reason behind it. It hurts to see such a talented writer decide to stop writing because of cruel, cowardly people who hide behind anonymity. I understand that pain of horrible "reviews", but I hope that one day you feel comfortable enough to come back.

To those weak, inconsiderate people who thought they were so terribly clever in attacking this person, I would like to say that you should be ashamed of yourself. You are not strong, you are not clever, and I can guarantee that you are not nearly as skilled of a writer as Iniga was. Shame on you.


** I don't understand nasty reviews to that point. I started reading The Bureaucratic Error and it wasn't for me. So I stopped reading. Is this not the normal response?

*** I did that too. It wasn't even badly written, I just couldn't enjoy Harry repeatedly barking up the wrong tree /because he's had his memory modified/. That's not a strike against the author's skills, it's a rather clever plot twist actually, it just wasn't my kind of story. Not a reason to be nasty to anyone, least of all the author who wrote it for free.

** There was nothing wrong with it. I imagine the criticism involved the author not taking the easy way out with the ending, and some other gut wrenching, but very well-written consequences from changing the timeline (Karkaroff vs Harry, ouch).

The author also warned ahead of time that Harry wasn't going the be the focus or the hero, and I think something about him not being op, and that certain characters wouldn't make it.

** While The Bureaucratic Error didn't pop off the page like it has for so many others and I eventually abandoned it, no part of the venture seemed worthy of personal criticism.

And further to that, any story that an author manages to complete makes it exceptional in the vast sea of unfinished stories. How disappointing. Poor Iniga.

** I just checked to see if the story was still up, she did take it down. She's such a talented writer, and her story was very creative. The way she managed to explore Sirius and Remus, as well as give Tonks some depth was such a breath of fresh air.

Why are people flaming her?

*** Getting hate because of a dumb youtube comment you left on a video, fine.

But getting hate on a piece of creative work that you sunk hundreds of hours into making and bravely put out for people to just ridicule it? Yeah, I completely understand why they took it down. It's a cruel thing to berate someones art. God know's I couldn't write a cohesive 100 chapter story, they're incredible for doing that!

**** I'm totally appreciative of the authors but I would think that they would be more stubborn after all the work they put in.

Sure assholes on the internet will keep spewing shit but what's new there?

***** Have you ever written anything? Or posted art online?

Yeah, one or two negative comments you can brush off. But 50? 100? They're always louder than the positive comments no matter how hard you try to see past them.

Your comment is justifying the assholes? And giving out to the author for not taking it? When surely we should be giving out to the assholes for being fucking assholes?

No person deserves to be made feel insignificant. Especially by faceless dickheads online. So when someone clearly gets hurt by one, you don't give out to the person you stand by them.

Otherwise you're just opening the door to assholes and saying it's ok for them to spout bullshit. And it's not.

****** I'm saying that by reacting in the way the trolls want basically allows them to win. I hate trolls and anything that allows them to win sucks.

I guess authors should all move to ao3, it has much better comment moderation.
