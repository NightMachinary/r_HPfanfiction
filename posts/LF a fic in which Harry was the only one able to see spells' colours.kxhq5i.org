:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It wasn't even anything central to the plot (so far); Harry was just describing a particular spell as "a few shades lighter than the killing curse" or something along the lines, then was told by the others that you couldn't see spells.

I'm fairly certain it was a WIP set in 6th year. Also, after the brains attacked him during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, Ron had to take medication for months after and wasn't allowed to have pumpkin?

Thank you!


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/690222][Petrichor]], definitely. I really loved this fic.

**** Yeah, I really want more of this too, but I'm kinda hopeful, I mean, the last update was last year, I think there will be more.

I haven't found something else that was similar yet.

  In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
