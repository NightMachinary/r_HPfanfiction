The details might not be quite right, but here's what I remember from it:

 

It might start with Harry noticing that something is up with Hermione, and he asks her about it. She denies, he insists, then Hermione takes Harry to some long abandoned classroom to talk. She more or less confesses that she has feelings for him, but immediately goes into a rant about why it couldn't possibly work and that she would get over it and things like that. She's very ramble-y and nervous about it.

I'm not sure what all Harry says back, but he says that he's also interested and that part of the reason he hasn't said anything is because they're already so close that asking her on a date would feel silly. Like: "We're in each other's company most of the time every day, do you want to also get together another day?" Or something.

They agree to date. They leave the classroom and find a few people (definitely Neville, maybe Seamus & Dean) drinking butterbeers and just chilling. It's mentioned that Harry & Hermione are basically coated in dust. They quickly make excuses and leave. The perspective sticks with the guys and they all think it's about time the two properly got together, and that everyone had been expecting it. Neville figures that's the first time they've done anything, the others think that they've just been keeping it secret for a long time.

The guys make fun of the two for having silly/unreasonable insecurities. For Hermione, there was something along the lines of "But I've got so much hair! All this hair on my head! Who could possibly ever be attracted to a girl with /hair/ on her /head/!?"

 

Does anyone recognize this?

  Something's up with Hermione Granger. Well, more than the usual, at any rate. And Harry Potter, having bestowed upon him the exclusive privilege of bearing the brunt of her strange moods, has reached the point of being jolly well fed up with it. It's high time to get to the bottom of this all but insoluble mystery...
