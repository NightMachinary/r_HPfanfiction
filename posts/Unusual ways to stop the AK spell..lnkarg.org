What unusual ways have you seen in fics, or can think of, to stop Avada Kedavra? I personally remember two:

1) [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/234][/Beyond Boundaries/]] by [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/153][Rachel A. Prongs]] (pre-OotP). Harry realizes the spell homes in on the body cells to shut them down, so he creates a spell to conjure a separate layer of skin cells, and then lower the real body's temperature. As a result, the temporary cells are the ones homed in on and killed. Of course, it needs to be recast after every use.

2) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1610433/1/Warrior-Mage][Warrior Mage]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/453460/Lolly-Phoenix][Lolly Phoenix]]. Harry is taught some anti-AK shield no one else has the power to use... and after the first hit, realizes that the spell is only unstoppable because people believe it to be (which was the plan of its inventor). Once you don't, it can be stopped by just about any shield.


** One idea I've come up with but not had occasion to use is that pure gold (and it has to be /real/ gold, not conjured or transfigured) can reflect the AK. We see Voldemort's AK bounce off the piece of statue in the Ministry Atrium and cause the wand-check station to burst into flames, so something about that statue was protective.

There's actually support for the idea in the ideas of alchemy that explain why a Philosopher's Stone could both grant immortality and turn base metals into gold: It was about perfection. Gold was considered to be the perfected form of metal due to its near-total immunity to corrosion, while a perfected human would be immortal. This association between the incorruptibility of gold and immortality in humans could explain the AK bouncing. Of course, this protection would be specific to the Killing Curse - anything else would just treat the gold like the soft, weak metal it is.

** There was a whole thread a while back about being able to use a frying pan to deflect spells like the Killing Curse. Proper ones are solid metal, so they've got a lot of structure and heft to them, and you can swing 'em nicely if you've got good arm muscles, so they'd work quite well. :)

Plus, then you have something to hit the shocked magical person over the head with, and pans make such satisfying 'donk' sounds. :D

It'd be a pretty damn good defensive tactic - Elves popping in, swinging their skillet, then popping back out again to reappear somewhere else. Get magicals on brooms doing similar things and you'd probably get some decent outrider-meets-picket-line action going.

Though if something like you're picturing did happen, it'd be an amusingly out-of-left-field ending for an America-Fuck-Yeah! Fic, that's for certain.

I'm also picturing cracker jacks and ball park franks exploding out of the end of the bat when a spell gets whacked well. In my mind, the cheesy stadium music is 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game', Jimmi Hindrix's rendition of the National Anthem, and Toby Keith's 'Boot in your Ass' song he had after 9/11. Combating terrorists, different terrorists, but still. If we're doing an "American Pride" crack fic, why not? The US Air Force do a fly over in formation and a NASCAR announcer doing commentary. Oh, God, have Ward Burton do commentary! His accent was so jumbled and slurred /other/ rednecks couldn't understand him.

*********** Lol, if we're writing a crack fic, we gotta go all out, right? No wishy washy cow patties.

I'm actually not a fan of baseball. Once the players are old enough to start knowing what they're doing it bores me. Like golf, I can't near to watch golf. I like hockey, though, but hockey is too international for our crack fic. We could make use of monster trucks!

I like the idea that McGonagal see a guy with a blue face and assumes he's Scottish, but when he turns to face her only half of his face is blue and the other side is halted again with red and white like the Texas state flag.

I don't see why the Thunderbirds can't be sky writers. Before the battle, when all the DE are grouped without any Order combatants, have a couple crop duster planes go over with topically applied sleep potion to thin out enemy numbers. Might not work overly well, but you never know.

Or the football players are tasked with neutralizing the giants, NY Giants @ Real Giants, hut hut hike. I /very/ much enjoy the Tolkian imagery there with the eagles, especially if we combine the two. The eagles paratroop the footballers onto the giants. The athlete sticks firework filled pigskin into the giant's ear, but the red fireworks are stunner spells to see if the inner ear is impervious to spells like the regular skin on giants a ogres. Pull a ring like a hand grenade and the eagle ubber picks the athlete back up to do the next one.

Dallas Cowboys Veela cheerleaders. Or as I like to call them: flying, fire flinging females. .

You're totally right though. No wishy washy cow patties in crack fic writing. :)

Yeah. Hockey definitely isn't right for this. If we wanted to use Hockey, we'd have to write a Canadian Crack Fic. :)

Monster Trucks would be fun - though a sentient truck like Arthur's Anglia would be very weird. Possibly a little too Stephen King, but I think it could work. :D

That does remind me - how would we get NASCAR into this? That's another hella American thing, right? :)

I always forget that States have flags too. All we hear on the international news is the obsession about the 'Stars and Stripes', so that one always slips my mind. Could be fun to have a bunch of them loaded up into giant t-shirt cannons to fire them into the Death Eaters. :D

Ooooh, I like the synchronicity there. If we hadn't already decided no hockey, I'd say we should get Gritty from the Philadelphia Flyers in there too. Maybe give him some Aviators and have him be the Air Force General? You'd just need to add the Top Gun theme to the Stadium Rock from before and he'd be set. :D

Just, don't judge me please, I think you know me well enough to know I'm not racist like my neighbor across the way. And if the cow's patty is wishy washy, she's sick. Quarantine her from the herd and check her diet.

I read Stephen King's car book in the 3rd grade and loved it! I can't remember what it's called now but I had a Wrangler Jeep I used to joke was sentient like that car... but less... bloodthirsty. I'm picturing Grave Digger and the Scooby Doo monster truck tag teaming to chase down the spiders with the Anglia showing the quickest route there. Oh, and if we have sentient cars, we have to have the iconic movie cars like General Lee and Baby from Supernatural.

NASCAR's easy, now that I think about it. Emergency transport. First to evacuate non-combatants and bring in more fighters and healers like our other athletes, then the drivers transports their pit crews around picking up the injured and bring them to Madame Pomphrey and the healers. If the pit crews can swap out 4 tires in a minute, they can put a dying (wo)man in the back of an ambulance. Maybe put a healer in the ambulances and have an auror ride shotgun so we can have multiple traveling hospitals. But yes, NASCAR is hella American and holds its roots from liquor smugglers back in the day.

I wanna put a lethifold in a t-shirt cannon and shoot Umbridge in the face now. Just saying.

OMG!!! We gotta get Gunny! We gotta get Gunny! Idc if he's Marine, not Air Force, we gotta have him! He was still alive in May 1998, I'm sure if it. And hell yeah, Top Gun, let's pull in Robin Williams and 'Good Morning Vietnam' and the whole crew from M.A.S.H. too. I want the actors and the music. Especially when the soldiers sing Mickey Mouse in Full Metal Jacket. I'm also requesting Indiana Jones, please. I know, I know, the Ark took place during WWII not Vietnam so we're skewing war themed movies, but Top Gun wasn't Vietnam either so I'm striving for balance here.

*** I had a similar thought. Use a bag with an extension charm inside of it (like Hermione's beaded bag, but much longer) but with an opening in the bottom and the top. Use one end to catch the killing curse, and point the other end back at the person who shot it at you.

Of course, trying to catch a spell is pretty stupid, since really you should be trying to not get hit.

*** We can't really tell that well if gravity affects spells since most "beam of light flying towards enemy" spells we see are over relatively short distances and they move pretty quickly. During the battle of Hogwarts when they bombard the big shield charm it looks like there's gravity. Of course some spells don't have a beam of light, some move almost instantly, and some seem to interact with the air and float up like balloons. Patroni seem to fly freely through the air or walk on the ground, ignoring gravity.

"Conjure a swarm of butterflies/birds/whatever in the path of the Killing Curse" seems to be a pretty popular idea, I've seen it in several fics already. Makes sense if you postulate that AK can only kill one living being at a time.

** Currently I'm rewriting one of my fanfics but also making a lore guide for it my idea was the AK can only kill one soul per use so if you have 2 magically enhanced souls residing in one body the AK gets nullified by the other soul which also revives the killed soul and also acting like a laser pointer to a mirror

** In my fic, Elune's Pebble, I had a ~thousand word section in the latest chapter explaining the mechanics of the method I'm using. Since Rowling doesn't explain much about magic I'm mostly pulling on the crosover's system of magic.

Essentially, Harry's group is creating a tattoo that stores magic that is in direct opposition to the energy used by the killing curse. If you're in a fight you 'tap' the tattoo and the magic floods your system and you can survive up to five AK's. (Less if you're facing the big V himself.)

While still in development, animal testing has proved it works. (All those poor, delicious deer.) Development is just being held up by all the other stuff they want in 'Potter's Mark,' like a tracking charm, etc.

** In “The Prince of Slytherin” ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3]] linkFFN(11191235)), there's the obvious “sufficiently durable transfiguration” choice, but also Fiendfyre diverts the spell about 2 degrees right, so it could theoretically be used as a defense

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** An idea I have been playing with is a weak defensive spell called Testudus. It creates a thin shell of mud/dirt/clay to stop minor hexes and jinxes.

It can't stop Avada Kedavra per se. Powerful spells, including AK, just smash through the shell super easily. It's just dirt after all.

The trick is the shell created by Testudus is a large and opaque hemispherical wall, so you can break line of sight and an AK aimed right at the shell might go right past you as a result. Basically: Cast it and use it as cover to get out of the way.

** It's rather out-of-left-field, but in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27701308/chapters/67795897][Harry Tano]], it is noted that Lumos disrupts the spell matrix of the AK, which is why the AK fell out of favor soon after the founding of Hogwarts. However, the effect was forgotten and so when the AK was rediscovered, it became feared until someone rediscovered the Lumos effect again.

** In one fic I read, Master of Death Harry is transported to the marauders era and becomes their new DADA professor. The first method of counteracting the AK curse that he does is by throwing a glass of water onto a student's face. Not really unusual and might not be effective against Voldy himself but it's a hilarious image. Harry's point is that the incantation takes a few seconds to say out loud so wizards can and should do anything within that timeframe to avoid getting hit.
