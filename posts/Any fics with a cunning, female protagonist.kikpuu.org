Like in linkffn(New Blood)

edit: preferably in Slytherin and lasting all 7 years but I am not picky ;)


** Linkffn(The Blood Of Your Veins: Calista Snape Volume II) All 7 years with last 3 years canon overlap from Slytherin female OC POV. Complete.

Linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) Cunning female OC set in TMR era.

Linkao3(Dying is a delicate moment) Cunning Hermione in 1940's influencing TMR.

Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) Another slytherin Hermione.

Linkffn(Certain Dark Things) Slytherin Fem!Harry in a dark AU.

Linkffn(Felix Fortuna) MC has precognition capable of achieving almost any goal. What would a 13 year old do with such power? Similar premise: linkffn(Path to victory-A Severus Snape Story)

Linkao3(Rose Petal Red) Likely the most cunning of them all. MC is an SI with a costly precognitive power. Takes over Slytherin.

  Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
