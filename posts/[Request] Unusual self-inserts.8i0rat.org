For instance Goblins, Elves, the Sorting Hat, the Basilisk or similar. Peggy Sues also could be neat - Actually, how does a Dobby Peggy sue sound? That'd be fairly cool.


** Self insert, you mean when a person in our world gets transported into the story? :) I would love to see a lot of super creative and different forms of that, yes like the self insert person being in the body of a goblin or a character like dean or dobby or something like you said. Also what is a peggy sue?

** I just found linkao3(Rose Petal Red) and... well, honestly it isn't that unusual in premise (Reincarnated as Ginny's twin, has lots of OP abilities) but it /is/ unusual in that it's actually /good/.

Edit: btw the summary isn't very good, read the first chapter before making an opinion on it lol

Edit again: Actually it is kind of unusual in that there is a bunch of world building that, while not directly contradicting canon, I think makes this an AU because [[/spoiler][there have been other reincarnated people, though it isn't clear if they were from RL]]. And putting SIs into AUs is pretty rare honestly.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that? I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister. Oh god. (Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)

*** Hmm, linkffn(In Bad Faith) is another conventional female sibling SI that isn't all that bad. Will have a look at your suggestion, but the usual plots seem overdone at this point.

** Here you go. I typed until I got bored with it.

SI as Hogwarts Ghost!

--------------

Jason woke up flying through what he assumed was a wormhole. He was expecting something like that because he also went to sleep in that very same wormhole. Why did he think it was a wormhole? Because he was falling endlessly through a twisting tunnel that he vaguely remembered the wormholes on Farscape looked like.

Before this he was on the road in his car. The smell of the sandwich he was handed through the fast food window minutes earlier was the only thing on his mind as he routinely checked his rear view for traffic. After his eyes snapped back to the road he had only a split second to see himself drive right into a huge blue portal that the other cars were passing through unaware and unaffected. Unaware as he was, unlike the other cars he was not unaffected.

The engine of the car revved quickly as the wheels were suddenly no longer in contact with the ground. He let off the gas and just looked around bewildered. Confused as he was Jason did not seem to notice the lack of gravity until his sandwich bumped into his arm. Setting the sandwich back on the seat, uselessly as it did not stay there, he rolled the window down slightly to confirm that he was not about to die in some kind of vacuum. The sound of wind greeted his ears confirming that there was indeed gravity and air outside. Jason was secured to his seat by a seat belt in a car free falling through an endless vortex.

Jason didn't really begin to panic until after his car began to drift slowly and half of his engine compartment disintegrated when it grazed the walls of the tunnel. A loud bang sounded and his car died from violent mechanical failure right when it happened.

"Oh shit!" Was all he could say to that. With wide eyes he quickly unbuckled his seat after fumbling in panic for a moment. The wall of death was getting closer. He kicked out of the drivers seat over to the passenger side in time to see the drivers side door disappear. With a last moment of heart pumping terror he flung the passenger door open, grabbed his sandwich, and lept into the open tunnel.

Some force he could slightly feel over the rushing wind dragged him to the center of the tunnel. Despite his amateur fumbling Jason managed to angle himself to catch the last of his car disintegrating as it left the tunnel. He felt a sense of loss and despair as he had managed to pay the damn car off only a month ago. It was just him and the sandwich now.

Hours later, one sandwich lighter, and with an empty bladder Jason was bored with his free skydiving experience and decided to turn it into a free skysleeping experience. That brings us up to date on the brave hero.

It wasn't much later after waking up that Jason began to notice that was now falling toward a bright light. The wind kicked up as his speed increased and before he knew it everything changed. A new world snapped into view and he found himself sitting on a toilet in a stall. He didn't have much time contemplate why he was wearing glassed or a skirt when he heard a lot of hissing and grinding of stone outside of the stall.

Opening the door to figure out what the hell was going on he noticed some kid dressed like Harry Potter standing in front of a giant hole in the middle of a bathroom. "What the f..." he started to say before he cut himself off. That wasn't his voice. He looked down at his body in confusion momentarily before looking back up at the boy and the goddamn gigantic snake eye that was now in front of him. Then Jason died.

+##+ THE GREAT BEYOND +##+

The great beyond looks a lot like that bathroom he just died in Jason thought to himself. And there's a dead girl on the floor in here. Okay that's ... not good. It was about that time that Jason noticed he was flying above said dead girl. He just as soon fell to the floor letting out an "oof".

Standing up and suprisingly pain free for falling four feet and landing face first, he noticed a huge mirror across the room. He could see a real ghost standing next to the dead girl! He walked over to see better. That was her in the mirror! It was him! He reached out to touch the reflection and the mirror iced as it met his finger. "Oh!" he gasped.

Hearing his, rather her now, new voice again Jason decided a test was in order. "Bah wheep gra nah wheep ni ni bon. Do ray mi. La la la." Man he sounded like a chipmunk he concluded. Is this how he really sound or is this just his head voice and everyone else hears something different? Do ghosts have a head voice? He heard a crinkling sound and noticed the sinks were also icing over where he has unconsciously grasped them to lean in closer.

He backed away uncertainly. "Wait holy shit I'm Moaning Myrtle!" Jason realized. Walking back over the stiff to investigate Jason noticed that despite starting on the toilet she had still managed to piss herself in death. That's just embarrassing but that's dead Myrtles fault not his. No wait, he's dead Myrtle. The other one. The one that's not him, err, her. There.

Still though, he... she should find a way to clean this up. "Any house elves around?"

/pop/ "Mipsy be... AAAAAAHHHHHH!" /pop/

Facepalming at the skittish thing's actions, Jason tried again. "Any house elves that handle the Slytherin dorms around?"

/pop/ "Someone is calling Sivi?" A new elf appeared that didn't seem all that surprised at the sight of a corpse.

"Yea I died and pissed myself." He said to the house elf. Great job Jason, very descriptive. The epitome of feminine grace he thought to himself. "Could you clean up the mess before the teachers find my body?" Jason asked. She knew it was petty but come on. It's not like forensic investigation of the crime scene is going to reveal the culprit.

"Sivi be having experience doing so's. Is miss be wanting fresh makeup on her corpse?" Sivi asked.

Wow not even a blink. This must be an old hat for this elf. "Yes." Jason confirmed. Well, Myrtle now she thought to herself. It's probably best if Jason... Myrtle adjusted to her new circumstances. Myrtle Myrtle Myrtle Myrtle. There, that should do it. Wait is Myrtle her first name or her last name? Who the hell names a kid Myrtle anyways? It's definitely a last name. That means she needed a new first name because for the life of her she couldn't recall what Myrtle's first name is. She was damn sure it's not going to be Moaning at least.

Xena? Buffy? Alice, Nicole, Jessica, Wonder Woman... Diana? Meh, she liked Alice better. Alice Myrtle. There, done. A new name for a new life. If someone asks she'll just say her real name died with her like its some kind of secret of the afterlife or some hogwash. What are they going to call her out on it?

Now what is there to do? Why did Myrtle become a ghost anyways? People don't become ghosts for no reason. Regrets in life, revenge on people they hate, and fear of death seem to be the reasons. Alright so find out why Myrtle is a ghost now. She should feel some kind of pull shouldn't she?

Alice closed her eyes to concentrate on nothing. It was both easier and more difficult than she was expecting. Why did Myrtle come back? Why was she here? Clear mind, breathe, she was one with The Force.

"What in... AIEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Came an ear splitting screech followed by a thud.

Alice' eyes snapped open. She noticed she was now floating in the air and as soon as she did promptly fell flat and landed on her face again. Why does the toast always land butter side down she lamented as she got back to her feet. She's a damn ghost! She should be able to fly god damn it!

She walked over the the now unconscious girl laying near the entrance to the toilets. Alice' first thought was that to get to where she was the girl must have seen the strange ghost floating in the bathroom but a body makes her faint? She chalked it up to wizards being wizards. Maybe there are a lot of random ghosts around?
