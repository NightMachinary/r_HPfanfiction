I like fics which explore the Veil, because it's a perfect divergence point. The DOM's best guess is a portal to the afterlife, but even they don't /really/ know what's behind it.

Usually, it's used as either a time machine to copypaste the books while changing Harry to Hadrian, or as a dimension portal to copypaste the books but snarky and calling Dumbledore a poopyhead.

Are there any fics though which make it something more interesting? Here's some examples of what I mean:

- The Veil is in actuality a broken [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/stargate/images/5/56/Fullsize-sgu0110-0165xb.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110602082108][Stargate]] whose computer system bugged out and got stuck in a perpetual loop of connecting to random parts of the network (Essentially, a Stargate is a device that can connect to other gates in the same galaxy, and they're all older than humankind ever was), which resulted in the Ministry sending dark wizards to various planets around the galaxy. This could be a cool crossover with the other franchise where a team of elite aurors enter the gate and cleanse the galaxy of evil in the form of dark wizards allowed to grow without interference, goa'uld with magic, etc.

- The Veil is a portal to the Underworld, but you don't die - you enter it while being alive. This could result in a story worthy of Greek or Egyptian mythology where Harry follows his godfather into the Underworld and bargains with Hades or Osiris for his release.

- The Veil is a portal to another dimension, but not an identical one. Maybe it's one of the many Inbetween realms that serve various functions, or it connects to other worlds more directly, like Alfheim, or Nidavellir, or a forest realm, etc. It's simply a portal to some place in the greater multiverse, which isn't made of copies of the same world.

Just things with that feel. I don't want fics which have it be a portal to another franchise, that just feels like a cheap plot device. So don't link the Darth Marrs star wars fic. Not that I want to read that anyways, it's too fucking uncomfortable.


** This first story isn't exactly what you want but it is a very humorous short one shot concerning the Veil. It's called Harry Potter and the Questionable Rites by jukehero461

linkffn(12610809)

Now the problem is I can recall a story that had the Veil be a device of judgement. And if your crimes/sins were greater than your good deeds then the Veil keeps you and you're dead. If you're "good" the Veil "spits you out. In this case in this story there is a second veil in a floor below the "known" Veil. It's here where Sirius is spit out (petrified). I believe mandrake potion revives him.

There is another story where the Veil was made by the Black Family and includes a "hack" for members of the Black family. When they are sent through they just get transported to another veil. In this story Sirius ends up in Japan. Now he still allows himself to be "dead" which allows Harry to take over the Black family and be emancipated.

The big problem is I don't remember the titles of either story and I haven't been able to find them in the quick search through my files.

*** That was fun. I always liked Terry's Death, he's a character that stays consistent in every reference and piece of fiction he appears in.

**** I found the second story eg veil is a portal and Sirius ends up in Japan. However it is a tiny portion of the story (warning mostly smut). Harem of the Ancient House of Potter by SSJ04 Mewtwo

I'm still looking for the other.

  In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort.

linkffn(2431736)

And it looks like a need to use the full url for the bot for aff

So linkaff(hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600026063) Looks like i can't get the bot to work for this one.

** *Harry Potter and the Stargate* - linkffn(13052799) - Veil is a stargate.\\
Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny bashing. The Dumbledore bashing at the end goes so over the top it's near champion's champion level. ANYWHO~ Harry ends up on a planet with the star Sirius as the sun. Some survival for a bit, some battles, and then return to earth. Some more battles, teaching, and political stuff. Then the dramatic finish.

*** The first one is shit. Sorry, but it is. There's absolutely no reason for it to be a crossover, as it doesn't factor in at all once he's on earth. The way he threatens Hermione with making her life hell and demands to be called "Lord Potter-Peverell" by everyone made me a bit sick as well.

Thanks for the rec, it fits, but it's a very bad story.
