*** I have that in my queue to read. It's better than most mass effect crossovers where harry's an immortal demigod that is humanity's first choice for spectre but refuses it then only deigns to travel with fem!shepard so he can use his vast knowledge to solve everything to get in her knickers.

*** Magic should be able to craft an eye that isn't electric blue in the books iirc or a protruding eye strapped to an eyepatch as in the films.

Imagine a crossover between harry potter and the six million dollar man where harry losts both legs and an arm and gets prosthetics that look real but have enhanced combat abilities leading to him becoming a new generation of spy/super soldier.

****** Lol what? Electric blue is an eye color, and even if it wasn't people wear weirder contacts every day

And even at that...who cares about going out in Muggle London? That sure as hell isn't going to stop me from getting some sick-ass cybernetic implants when the day comes. If they look just like regular flesh then what even is the point?

Sounds pretty mainstream for someone looking for a cyborg story

  The Kyuubi Chakra was split into two halves and sealed into Naruto's sisters, the Yang into Erza, and the Yin into Mito. But there was another being there that night, and three possible hosts. Minato was able to survive the sealing by changing the seal at the last minute, not realizing his mistake until years later. Adopted from Jinx777.

  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.
