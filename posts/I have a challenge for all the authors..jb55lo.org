The challenge is to write a fanfiction where you put yourself in the movies and books. You create how you want yourself to be. You get to interact with the gang. You can be a wizard or anything. This is your story. The only rules I will say there is will be no character bashing. Too be honest, you can be half blood who uses both wands and guns. Anything you can write, the sky is the limit.


** But who would want to read a self-insert about someone who can't fight muggle style and isn't too hot at magic either!?

*** Again you can write the story of how you want it, the gun thing is just an idea. How do you see yourself in the world of Harry Potter. Also, to answer your question in another way, you can try to make your story interesting. What this prompt is trying to be is a create your own story. Create your own character. Nothing else.

** Finally, an excuse to write my wish-fulfillment fic as an eleven year old who's as skilled as Albus Dumbledore and becomes the ruler of the world.
