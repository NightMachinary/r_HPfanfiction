Did they ever establish how Dobby found Harry during the summer of CoS? Am I forgetting this from canon? Bc Dobby is not only able to find harry, but he can apparate into his room and interact w him. If it's just elf!magic does that mean Voldemort could have used a house elf to track Harry down and kidnap him from Privet Drive?


** Because he is a house elf. :) House elves have different magic from humans, so he just...found him. They seem to be very good at that in general, with Kreacher finding Mundungus with nothing to go off of in like a week. :)

** Dobby had no intention of harming Harry. Not then, anyway. I imagine a house-elf sent by Voldemort to kidnap him would be stopped by the protective charm.

*** Oh, that's interesting! I wonder if it's only intent that matters, then. In that case, I wonder if Voldemort would've been able to trick a house elf, like Dobby, into taking Harry by convincing them it was to protect him, and then getting Harry that way.

**** We don't really get any real details on it. My comment was pretty much pure speculation. I think, though, given that there presumably wasn't a loophole around the Curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, at least not one that Dumbledore could find, that magic is itself sentient enough to not be fooled in such a way, and that as Dobby's actions would still be linked back to Voldemort, which the charm specifically protects against, then Dobby would also be stopped, no matter his own intentions.

**** Dumbledore is the type of wizard to trust intent based protection. Like the mirror of Erised for example. So it's likely that the protection on Privet Drive are also intent based, allow people like Dobby or Padfoot (beginning of PoA in dog form) to enter if they don't want to harm Harry.

** On the last point; he probably could have done that from a canon perspective but Voldemort is unlikely to consider using a lowly house elf for anything.

I did recently read an interesting fic where it was a small plot line that Dobby used to be a Potter elf but could not bind with Harry because he was too young. With the elder Potters dead the remaining elves went crazy and died and only Dobby was eventually (barely) able to find a new family with the Malfoys. Because he used to be a Potter elf he was able to find Harry at Privet Drive in CoS and warm him. It was a small plot point, but it's a question that's not explored often and I found it noteworthy in this context.

*** I would have said that ignoring house elves would be unrealistically foolish, but then again, Voldemort apparently ignored the possibility of taking Harry out with a sniper rifle as soon as he left his home, so...maybe?

**** Voldemort would never have been able to respect himself again if he killed Harry the Muggle way.

****** I mean, I honestly don't think Voldemort even thinks about Muggle things as something wizards even *do*. So I don't think he'd see it as powerful, I think he'd see it as something primitives do.

*** Yeah, I bet it wouldn't even occur to him that a house elf could have useful magic which wizards don't have. That sounds interesting, actually! Do you happen to remember what it was called?
