So this bunny hopped into my head the other day and wouldn't leave: Harry Potter, but transplanted into the Mojave Wasteland.

And that's all. And my once sharp and powerful brain, which now only go bing bing boing boing, is not being cooperative, because I've got a My Hero Academia fic that I've been working on for half a decade that won't get finished ever.

All I've got so far is that Voldemort has replaced Caesar, and Harry comes from a lost tribe of wizards in the Divide that Mr. House wants to subjugate.


** My only additon to that are mutated magical beasts roaming the lands. Though honestly I have no idea
