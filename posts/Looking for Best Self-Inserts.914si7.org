** Well, there are only two self insert fics I follow: linkffn(a fresh bouquet by tsume yuki) and linkffn(to the next by queenfirst), the first more enjoyable than the second, both decent anyway.

Be mindful that "best" when relating to self-inserts doesn't necessarily imply high quality.

  Reborn into the world of Harry Potter, Poppy Evans has only one goal; make sure she's not the only magical Evans alive by 1982. And maybe save that smug Potter while she's at it. Regulus Black didn't fit into the equation; he wasn't suppose to be so distracting.

  "To the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure" --- Albus Dumbledore. Pretty words, yeah, but she didn't expect them to be so damn literal. OC.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

** linkao3(14071644) - Do Not Tickle A Sleeping Dragon. Female SI into Harry Potter, with some original worldbuilding. Started this year, it's a WIP and there isn't enough of it to really say if it's good, but it seems intriguing and the writing (aside from typos) is good.

  Being a Chosen One is hard work. The Dark Lord of your universe is out to get you, people you love definitely die, and you have to suffer a lot. In fiction, it makes for a compelling story. In real life not so much. She isn't sure how she boarded this particular train but she wants off. Self-Insert. SI-OC.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheTrinity][The Trinity]]. This one's a crossover with the Nasuverse (Fate/Stay Night, Tsukihime, etc.) The SI is one of the three characters that wake up on a Hogwarts Express with no Harry Potter. The three characters all have aspects of Harry's canon background and adventures, such as Galen's godfather being Sirius or Takara becoming Gryffindor's seeker as a first year. The seventh book is in the works right now.

Overall, it's a fun story where the heroes are ridiculously powerful, and the bad guys are leveled up as well.
