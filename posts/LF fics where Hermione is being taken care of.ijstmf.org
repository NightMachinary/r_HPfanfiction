I'm looking for fics where Hermione's friends (eg. Harry, Neville, Fleur etc.) are trying to take care of her while she's being stubborn. It could be sickfic or something like that. Preferably no ships, but especially no romione, dramione or intergenerational ships (eg. Bellamione, snamione etc.)

To clarify: Hermione is being looked after and cared for by her friends.


** There was that one-shot (or perhaps it had two chapters, but not much more), where everybody (from Harry, Ron, and Ginny to Draco Malfoy) are disgusted with Hermione for her Confunding McLaggen, because “there is no cheating in Quidditch” (I am not sure about crying, but that's another issue). I cannot find it now. Anybody has the reference?

*** How does this fit what I'm looking for? To clarify, I'm looking for fics where Hermione's friends are looking out for her or taking care of her. The fic you're suggesting seems to he the opposite of that?

**** Teaching somebody how she was wrong is helping too, isn't it? And it was in very loving manner, certainly not Hermione bashing style.

Actually to single out Hermione in that context, when you have tons of fridge horror behaviour in the whole setting is extremely jarring and does indeed come across as very passive-aggressive, self-righteous bashing.

****** After reading it, it's actually pretty good. It's not bashing at all in context, nor does it exaggerate how anyone would have reacted.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was passionate about Quidditch. It was one of the few escapes he had; he found freedom in the air as he chased a small golden ball. Therefore, he wouldn't allow anything to tarnish the game. Not even one of his closest friends.
