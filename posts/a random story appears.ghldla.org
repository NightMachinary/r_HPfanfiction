Oooh I made a mistake. Reading HP fanfic at 11pm like I always do when suddenly I have an idea for my on story I have to write down! Except, there are some ocs so I need to write their names down too, or come up with them. So I research canon characters and come up with names for ocs, I look up mythological creatures and the history Merlin and wait I wanted to write down my idea not this other stuff. So I come up with a few important notes her or there and then, I just, write. Not quite a synopsis and not quite a prologue but everything that has happened that is a change up from the Marauders Hogwarts years to Harry's first year and suddenly I have almost 4000 words of this down and it's almost 5am and it's so weird because I have so much trouble writing but this just, happened? So I guess I'm plotting a new HP fanfic and this is my life now.


** Perks of being a writer!! What is it about by the way? Ideas keeping you up all night are worth a read. Would you like to share it?

** The rambles of a writer, I did the same thing, but I wrote it down in my mind (the main points) but I'm still trying to come up with cool dueling tricks other than the good old boom n' doom..
