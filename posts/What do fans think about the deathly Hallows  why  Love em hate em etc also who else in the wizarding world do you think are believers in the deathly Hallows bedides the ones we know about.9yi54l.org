Title


** I mean, it makes sense in the HPverse that there are ancient artifacts, enchanted beyond normal understanding. In the actual books there are items like the Mirror of Erised, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Deathly Hallows. Outside of the books, but still existing in the universe, there might be artifacts like Excalibur or the Tarnhelm or who knows what else - artifacts crafted in an earlier, more magical, and more savage age.

I just wish the Hallows had been rooted more firmly in that kind of legendarium. That they're considered to be just one of many such lost artifacts.

*** I think there's something really appealing when it comes to "ancient powerful artefacts" and what amounts to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect][Future Imperfect]] in regards to the Harry Potter world:

A lot about their society reminds me of civilizations in their death throes. Rampant corruption in the government, declining education, "bread and circuses" for the public (the Tournament)... etc. For example Hogwarts is supposed to be this amazing school for magic and it has only a handful of Professors, one of whom hates teaching and another is a ghost. Oh and a fraud/drunk. One of the subjects hasn't been taught properly for over a decade, because it is "jinxed". Magic is primarily used for Household chores or pursuing a meaningless career in bureaucracy.

Yet in the same school you find incredible things like the Room of Requirement, that no one even has an inkling how to make or replicate. The Headmaster doesn't even know this room exists in his own school. Meanwhile the Weasleys live in a House that barely fits together.

Also people with deep magical insight like the Flamels seem to prefer not to be a part of their society and live as legends/mystery. Mr. Ollivander has a wand store with presumably thousands of wands waiting for Wizards and Witches. A small group of motivated terrorists who can be bested by school children pose a significant threat to their government and law enforcement. What happened to this world? Was there some sort of calamity?

**** Just seemed to me that magical civilization was at the tail end of a long period of decline, or peace, perhaps. Or both. The statute of secrecy is clearly intended for self protection, and is a relatively new creation. No one even speaks of recreating the world's greater mysterious powers like the Stone. The Hogwarts Founders were clearly on an entirely different level. Even Voldemort only ripped off a pre-existing and rather distasteful form of immortality instead of creating his own, without the drawback of mutilating your own soul.

It could just be that the wizarding world has been at peace for so long (the Voldemort civil wars don't count, I'm talking broader scale stuff) that the greater magics have been forgotten, fallen into disuse, or outlawed.

** I think they would have made more of an impact if J.K incorporated them into the story earlier than DH. The last minute mention of it made it sound like a McGuffin or a Deux Ex Machina.

** I've always loved the idea that The Tale of Three Brothers is the written version of some old oral tradition and that the line about how the owner of three shall be the "master of death" is the sole surviving line of an ancient prophecy or something.

As for the Hallows themselves.... the wand is just a wand. The stone was a resurrection experiment. I'm not sure about the cloak, but it's something just a relatively mundane. It's the rumors and stories surrounding them that's really special.

** Personally, I quite like the concept of the Deathly Hallows. As someone with an interest in the Arthurian Legends, the Deathly Hallows (and by extension the Tale of the Three Brothers) remind me of how the legends of Arthur are sometimes treated. I also like them because of the way that the concept of Death is treated in the series, and the lessons that can be learned from it.

In terms of characters that might believe in the Deathly Hallows; I think Daedalus Diggle would definitely believe in them. There is something about his “blatant wizardishness” that makes me think he might.

Trelawney might believe in them as well as possibly Mrs Weasley and maybe Ron (though probably more through superstition than anything.)

** I like them, I think they're cool and a really interesting fairytale when introduced in the books. It makes sense for them to be these legendary powerful artifacts that may or may not exist, too. I think since they are so old, only some people would believe in them. Like, they're a legend so only some people think they're real and only some people think they aren't, but most people can't decide on it because they don't care enough. Everyone born into the wizarding world knows what they are but doesn't necessarily think they're real or fake. Kind of like aliens or ghosts- most people are kind of meh about it because "they've heard a story" or something, but also believe in science. Not the best example but still.

** I know thinking of the three artifacts as a set and the wielder as the Master of Death is a popular idea, but one I think is untrue.

Either they were the separate creations of three master enchanters, or two are cursed trinkets and a invisibility cloak with contains a spark/aspect/bit of essence of *DEATH ITSELF!!*

** For me it has recently been a fantastic excuse for Harry to be displaced in time and/or space. I've been reading a lot of crossovers recently, and being the master of Death is useful for ending up in the vast future or surviving a trip through the Veil into a different dimension.

** I read a few chapters of a scene script/drama in 4 acts of what has happened to the Peverell Brothers, but the author took it off [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], because he found it lacking and wanted to rewrite it.

Previously I hated the Master of Death idea, but after reading the fanfic, I found myself more open to the idea of owning and using the Hallows, - because they were not made by some sort of Death-entity but rather by imperfect humans.
