#+TITLE: In an alternative universe the Order of the Phoenix lost hope they summoned a hero . One of the precautions of the spell is to remember it’s an alternative universe and things are different. As it is they weren’t expecting a woman with 3 striped head tails, and 2 glowing white laser? swords.

“Where am I? Who are you? Why am I here?”. The odd looking woman asks. Her lightsabers in a defensive position.

It was Dumbledore who snapped out of his shock first “ahh you see miss, we needed a hero to defeat a Dark Lord so we summoned one from another universe”

The woman looks incredulous at first but than says “I see”. The force was confirming what the old human had said so as impossible as it was Ahsoka listened to it. She turned off her lightsabers but did not put them away. “And who exactly are you?.”

“Who are You?” A man with a wooden leg and a fake eye barked. Ahsoka raised a White marking and said “I'm Ahsoka Tano, now who are you”

Ahsoka is probably out of character lol
