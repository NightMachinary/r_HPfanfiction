Hi everyone, we made a free collaborative fanfiction writing game to play with friends. It's a round-robin style game that has each player pick some characters, write a beginning, *swap fanfics* middle *another fanfic swap* and an end. Then you all read your mashed up stories together - audio is great for this part as it makes for some fun dramatic readings! Perfect for a fun crackfic-filled time :> And yes... characters from HP have been written about hahah.

You need three or more players to start a game, and the time that you get to write can vary from 10 minutes per part to as little as one minute for the most intense drabble session you've ever done. Up to 16 players can play at once but we find the sweet spot is around the 7-10 player mark for a good varied amount of stories.

The website is [[https://franticfanfic.com/]] and we just launched last month! We made this game because we've been stuck inside during lockdown in Ontario for the last 6ish months now? And we just wanted to make something fun for our friends to play. But other people are having fun too so that's awesome!! Happy writing - let us know what you think if you do play it!


** Love it, great to see more creative endeavors besides prompts/challenges.

*** Yeah! We also have prompts in the game if you get stuck and we're working on situations being added too. But working with others and QUICK is like... a big motivator haha.
