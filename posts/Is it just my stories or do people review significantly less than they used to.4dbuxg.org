** Aside from what [[/u/M-Cheese]] said, remember that the longer a story's online, the more attention it accumulates. Of course older fics are going to have more reviews than new ones, they've had more time to gain attention.

**** I find that FFN review count grows exponentially with chapter count. For example, if chapter one gets 5 reviews, chapter two might get 8 reviews. I think this is because some people consistently review for every chapter, and with new chapters come new reviewers.

***** I would also add that more reviews leads to more views, because many people think more reviews = quality so they sort for it, and more views lead to more reviews... etc.

****** That reminds me, I savaged a story in review then went to find it. It was gone. So I went to check the story, it had only glowing reviews. The ability to remove reviews of your work is the worst.

** If true, perhaps it's reflective of a shrinking fandom? You could perhaps compare traffic stats across your writing career---it might give an indication, although there wouldn't be enough controls (or a sufficient sample size) to draw any conclusive results.

Relatedly, this thread inspired me to go leave my first reviews on ff.net in almost a year, so there's that.

** I don't think it changed much. I mean, people never really reviewed much in the past either. While much depends on what you write (and whether you have avid followers), but you would be lucky to get 5 reviewers for 20~30 followers. The exception I've seen is with slash, since slash fans tend to write more reviews than an average ffn user.

I think what might have changed is the way your write and your genre. The ffn audience tends to have shit tastes, and the shittier a fic is, the more reviews it tends to have (e.g. Harry/Draco Veela fics, Dumbledore!Bashing fics, etc).

The conclusion is, FFN reviews really aren't worth much/anything, and you shouldn't be too worried about it.

****** Ah, that makes sense. The thing is, many people tend to look for HP crossovers than pure HP these days, seeing that literally everything has already been done. That may have been why your HP/StarTrek is much more popular than your HP story.

What might have also influenced the amount of reviews are the time you posted your story, which time zone you are in, what day you posted your story, and so forth.

*** Yeah, I have been tempted to add things such as a slash paring to the description, just to see if I would get more reviews. I have been told that the one fic I have posted there is relatively well written, but has only 31 reviews ever since I posted it back in December.

** I've come to believe that a lot of readers tend to reflect their approval of a story more by adding it as a "favourite" than by reviewing, as reviews can be either positive or negative, but a "favourite" is a clear-cut method of simply conveying outright approval. A "follow" is also somewhat more dubious--a fave/follow combo means approval, while following alone could simply mean: I'll see where this goes before I fully decide where I stand in regards to the story.

*** I can see that. I basically do the same with twitter. If I like it, I star, If I think others should see it, I retweet. But if I think it's brilliant? I do both.

Though when I wake up in the morning to 20 or so new emails and they're just five people following me, favoriting me, favoriting a story, and following it, it becomes very, very annoying. FFn needs to fix that so that one email alerts you to simultaneous actions.
