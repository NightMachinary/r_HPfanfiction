******* I almost never double-post, but I want to make sure you actually read this.

Do you have a mailing list, or something? I'd love to be notified when you eventually upload this. Maybe link your FFN profile so I can mark you as an author to watch updates from?

** Sorted by their dates of completion:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/][Darth Marrs]] has several, the latest one being [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), crosses with the very rare Kantai Fleetgirls and features Harry/Hermione/Ron in a romantic relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), is my favorite HP/LOTR crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm#pt][The League of Extraordinary Women]] crosses with several universes such as Stargate, BtVS, DC, and 2 others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511), is a wonderful one shot that crosses with “The Deadliest Catch”?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]], linkffn(2857962), is a popular one with Firefly.

**** Yes.

“The Stars Alone” features massive space battles, planetary assaults, and generally ass-kicking Harry/Hermione/Luna. But as in every Darth Marrs fic, he will shoot himself in the foot from time to time.

“The League” is directly linked to one of my top favorites [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which universe Alex Mack came from. Chronologically, Alex Mack immediately tried to find her version of the Trio upon return to her home universe, and together they would fight some seriously nasty super villains in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]. The author is currently writing another massive crossover involving the HPverse Hermione as a side character. After that, she's going to begin “Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament”, the direct sequel to “Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived”.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

** I bolded the ones that /actually/ feel like a post-Hogwarts fic. Technically, all of these do take place afterwards (even if I only based that on Harry being an Animagus or the Master of Death) but it's mostly just a conceit of the story for the others. A couple of fics diverge at the Battle of Hogwarts. I didn't include sequels or prequels.
