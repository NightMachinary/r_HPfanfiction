I recently read these two stories: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=28047][A Winter Tale]] by Max and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3986682/1/Christmas][Christmas]] by Hermin22 which I really enjoyed. It is nice to see aspects of Dumbledore's character outside of just the leader in a war.

Can anyone recommend any other good Albus Dumbledore fics? I prefer a pairing with Minerva McGonagall or Hermione Granger, but I have enjoyed stories in the past with Severus as the pairing and am open to any pairing. Also fics where he has a family or is being comforted during the war for whatever reason (i.e. stress or illness) would be greatly appreciated.


** A long time ago, an author named Grandson of Dumbledore published three stories about his Hogwarts years.

They haven't held up all that well.

** [[http://www.letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]] is an AlbusxGellert fic where they exchange owls post Gellert's imprisonment and reflect on the old days. Warning, it's fairly sad at the end.

  "If I do this, you won't have done anything, Harry. You won't exist. You'll probably never exist." Hermione coughed roughly, the damp irritating her lungs. "None of this will have happened." Hermione has lost everyone and everything in the war. Left with only one terrible choice, she honors Harry's sacrifice and goes back to change history. Reposted from AO3

Warning: Mentions of past Draco/Harry and HG/SS. Normally not a fan of slash, but it doesn't bother me in this one.
