** Raises a lot of questions.

Can house elves and humans interbreed? Is the Voldemort homunculus fertile? Can house elves and homunculi interbreed? Are you a sick and twisted mind? Would Barry crouch Jr allow this to happen? Can Voldemort consent?

*** I have the answer to at least the last three questions:

Yes

Barty Crouch Jr would always consent to his Master's wishes. In fact, if Voldemort was feeling particularly kinky, he could have gotten both Crouch and Winky in his bed.

It's always the Dark Lord's will.

** Everyone, calm down. This isn't even the first suggestion that humans and house elves can reproduce together. In one of the Very Potter Musicals, maybe A Very Potter Sequel, we learn who Draco's real father is.
