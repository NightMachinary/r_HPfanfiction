When writing a fanfiction, do you use floo'd or flooed for the verb describing using the floo network? Or something else entirely?


** I don't think there's a definite answer from canon, but I wouldn't use either - they travel via the Floo network. We don't use car, boat, train, subway, plane as a verb - we drive, fly, sail, take the train or subway etc. Floo is the method, not the action.

**** Given that Floo is a pun on flue/flew, I'd be tempted to do a similar thing, a pun on idk, smoke, fire, burn, ember, ignite... Something like that!

** Going by JK's usual conventions, I'm inclined to say "Flooed" (stressing the capitalisation here, too).

On a related note, I get annoyed when people add unnecessary apostrophes like that. It's /Imperiused/, not /Imperio'd/. The other Unforgivables aren't given equivalents in the books, but /Crucio'd/ and /AK'd/ are just... no. To quote Michael Jordan, "Stop it. Get some help."

** If you have to use something of that ilk, use “flooed”.

“Floo'd” is an abomination of the same kind as “walk'd” or “eat'd” and absolutely should not be used, doing it at all implies very poor understanding of the English language.

Uh, "floo'd" *is* a contraction. Of "flooed". Like "ne'er" is a contraction of "never".

You see it all the time in hymns.

**** "Floo'd" can only be a contraction of "floo had/would", but it's a completely different case since "floo" is a noun in there.

****** But why would you want to do it? Unless it's to emphasize an accent, I don't see a point. To make it sound more archaic or something?

******* In the specific case of "floo'd" I think it's largely motivated by how weird "flooed" looks - three vowels in a row does not feel right. But of course better to avoid either.

**** No, when it comes to “floo'd”, it's just some people being mentally incapable when it comes to writing, likely out of their own choice. People do a lot of scary stuff to text due to not caring (you need only look at the basic homophones), but that does not make it acceptable.
