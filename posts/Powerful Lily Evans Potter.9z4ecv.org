I always thought Lily Potter is a really powerful witch. In canon she is able to control accidental magic, a great potioneer, good at charms, loved by her Professor, a Headgirl, defied Voldemort three times, and also outwitted Voldemort to destroy himself (I know its debatable).

Is there any fanfic that has Powerful!Lily as MC? I know some fics mention this in passing like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/3/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] or [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/35/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][HP & Accidental Horcrux]] but I haven't found one that has her as MC.


** Lily is extremely powerful in all of inwardtransience's stories, albeit not exactly the main character (they generally follow her daughter, a female Harry who is similar to canon in varying degrees). In linkffn(11762909) The Long Game, she is still alive along with the rest of the Potter family and tutors her daughter. In linkffn(12760426) Her Mother's Love, she is stuck in fem!Harry's head as a sort of quasi-horcrux created when she killed Voldemort.

I believe LeighaGreene's stories feature a similarly powerful Lily, but I haven't read them.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** bobsaqquara's linkffn(2477819) is told from her POV and she's strong enough to have killed Voldemort the first time.

She's a central character (though not the main character) in linkffn(1875189) by the late Arsinoe de Blassenville.

**** I second the motion on this fic. While I don't know what you mean exactly by "powerful," Lily is definitely fleshed out here. We see how intelligent she is and why she became the teacher's favorite.
