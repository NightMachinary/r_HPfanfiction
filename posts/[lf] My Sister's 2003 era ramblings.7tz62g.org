My sister posted some works to ff.net. The one she can remember most was a short one chapter Hermionie Draco fic with a Celtic looking name that likely meant something to do with wolf or darkness. If anyone can find this wondrous treasure for me I would be eternally grateful.


** Do you know approximately how long the fic was? I'm searching through, but if you can give me a narrower range than between 100~15k words I can eliminate hundreds of fics.

**** Sorry, I didn't see this when I checked before sleeping. It was less than 15k words for sure.

***** Anything more specific than that, like less than 10k, greater than 5k or something? Or another character, or a word most likely in the summary. Or a smaller range for the date it was published, instead of just in 2003, or whether it was marked as complete or not?

** Here's a possible result, though no Celtic name. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1659580/1/All-is-Fair-in-Love-and-Slytherin]])

I've hit the limit of the number of terms I can exclude for author, so I need better information. I'll continue trawling though the fics tomorrow.

*** Thanks, this search engine is so much better than the built in ff.net one. At the very worst I have a better way to find random fics now.

*** Not the OP, but rather the other guy who's trying to dig up the fic. Language is highly likely English, and the genre has a good chance of being Romance. That said, do you know of any search engine for fanfiction.net that will allow me to exclude a really high number of terms for authors? Scryer limits to less than 10.
