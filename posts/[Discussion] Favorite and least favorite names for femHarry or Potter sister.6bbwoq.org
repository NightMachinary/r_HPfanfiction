I know some people have very strong opinions on what names are acceptable for female Potters (be they genderswapped Harrys or siblings), but I personally don't have much a problem with any name except if it's something ridiculously Mary Sue-like. Which names do you guys like? And which names would make you drop a fic entirely?


** I don't mind most believable names, i.e. names that fit into canon without standing out like sore thumbs. Flower names work really well for this, because there are so many other female characters with flower names.

Personally, I don't like super-pureblood-y names, because James and Lily Potter naming their daughter "Lacerta Vulpecula" breaks my suspension of disbelief. They didn't care about "traditions" when naming Harry, so why would they care when naming a potential daughter?

On the other hand, for a genderbent Harry, I like names that can be shortened to Harry. I just like the idea of a female Harry still going by Harry, even if it's overused and somewhat lazy.

** I actually like Harriet for female Harry. If Harry has been literally just genderswapped (as in, its the same character and the only thing different is that they're not a girl) then it makes sense so we can make the connection (or take note of the disconnection) between cannon Harry and the new Harriet.

As for other names for female!Harry or a sister, I really like Willow, Holly, and Wisteria.

** I honestly really love when fem Harry has a name completely different from the clich√© "Harriett".

My favourite name so far is probably Charissa, which is featured in the fic, The Long Game.

The name Gurt would make me drop a fic.

** Based on the flower theme, here's a list of some names I came up with after like 30 seconds of Googling. Which ones do you like best? Flower names:

Common: Iris, Violet, Rose, Ivy(not really a flower name?), Jasmine

Less common: Acacia, Amaryllis, Azalea, Camellia, Linnaea (flowers look kinda lame, imo), Primrose, Senna, Zinnia

** I like the flower theme. My favorite is probably 'Iris'. 'Rose' is kinda boring but acceptable and i generally dislike names starting with H because it just seems forced. Most parents don't pick potential names by the first letter and there's no reason to assume that Lily and James would have named a girl Hazel or Harriet or whatever, simply because they liked 'Harry' for a boy.

But really, it doesn't matter all that much. if your story is good i won't care about the name and if it's shit a name won't change anything.

***** I do prefer phone as well. The point I was trying to make is that a single name is super easy to ignore. I mean if a story is Super Good, then I believe the name would matter little.

Then again our opinions might differ.

** Honestly for the most part it doesn't really matter to me. But if I had to choose I would rather it be something simpler (i rather doubt a family that names a son Harry would name their daughter Acacia).

Harry is pretty consistently a top 20 common baby name throughout the 90s in the UK so I would choose something like that. Hannah is probably the most likely name if you wanted to stick with H, but holly consistently comes in the top 35 and Harriet comes in the top 60 of girls names

One name I'm planning to use in a fic is Daffodil "I'm-not-a-fucking-flower" Potter, who prefers to use the nickname Daphne.

Otherwise I like the usual flower names; Jasmine, Iris, Rose, Hyacinth, and Holly.

** I like names that start with an "H" because I don't have to remember who the fuck the main character is supposed to be the next time that I pick up the story.

Harriett is a perfectly acceptable name for a British witch, but there are other alternatives, like Holly or Henrietta, that have a similar feel to "Harry Potter." Violet would be one of the exceptions I'd make since it's more memorable than others I've seen/read, and not completely unbelievable or out of character.

** I like Holly best myself. Especially since that's their wand wood. I like Jasmine too.

As mentioned, a made up pureblood pretentious name would make me drop it.

I personally believe James named his son after his grandfather tho JK has not confirmed it. We don't know his wife's name though, nor Lily's gran's. They would never name a daughter Euphemia. I could see Effie, and Emmie. Perhaps Ellie, but I think it's too similar to Lily for them to use it.

I nope away from emo names. Gryffindors wouldn't name their daughter Raven. Wizards wouldn't choose ebony, they'd use Nigellus. Oh wait, they do.
