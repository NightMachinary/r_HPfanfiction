As the title suggests, what's the evilest Dumbledore you've ever seen in a fic? I'm curious


** Damn I can't remember the name of the fic, but it was an extremely long oneshot where Harry gets sent to Azkaban after killing Voldemort. Dumbledore basically locks down Hogwarts and refuses to return the children until their parents swear oaths of fealty, and eventually completely takes over the wizarding world by using the power held by people like Lucius. Like it gets so bad that people are actually hoping that canon-like Voldemort will rise again.

** Can't remember the title, and wouldn't post it if I did, but pedophile Dumbledore really squicked me. Forget political ambitions, it doesn't get any more evil than that.

** You mean The Dark Lord Dumbledore in linkffn(There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel)? I really don't like any bashing, but this is honestly done AU where Dumbledore is just very different from the canon.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

** Damn, forgot the fics name, but it was a dramione where everything was flipped, Dumbledore was dark and Tom Riddle was light. They also called anyone against them 'husties' or was it 'fusties'?
