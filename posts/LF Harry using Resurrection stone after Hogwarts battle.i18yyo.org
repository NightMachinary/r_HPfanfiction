...to give everyone closure(i.e. summoning Fred for the Weaslys, Tonks, Ted and Lupin for Andromada(and later his godson, etc...).


** Given how the original story of the stone goes I can't see that ending well, even Harry's use of it just has everyone encouraging him.to die and join them.

** Honestly I always though the Stone was underused. He can call back people's souls, so technically shouldn't he be able to use it to resurrect them? Voldemort managed it with only wormtail helping him and Harry wouldn't need to be as secretive about it.

Or getting ghosts to disclose information for him like the location of treasures, knowledge of magic, blackmail material, historic secrets... I just think it should be used more.
