My biggest pet peeve is the whole if you gave Harry a lightsaber you have to give Voldemort a death star crap. Are there any good crossover fics where harry gets some sort of weird power (like that one dnd crossover with that milo person) and the universe doesn't magically adjust to be a blending of both universes.

To summarize, I want a super!harry in canon HP world. Preferably with lots of people having no clue what the hell is going on since his power is so weird and OP.


** The problem with an over-powered Harry is that it's incredibly boring if the conflict isn't scaled to match his power. This doesn't mean literally give Voldemort a Death star but make him powerful enough to give Harry a challenge.

*** I would say that the effective counter to that is that Voldemort doesn't need any sort of boost to challenge a super!Harry - one of the things I love to see in fanfiction is when they don't see the need to boost him but still have true challenge, because of course Voldemort is an enormous challenge to overcome, and its only that Harry was specially geared towards defeating him (or, if you prefer, that elements of the series were contrived to make it possible) that canon!Harry had a chance at all. Certainly I think any Harry that is powered-up needs an opponent that is powerful and not neutered, but you don't necessarily need to blend the two worlds (or generally change canon) to accomplish that.

**** You're right that without the Dumbledore created deus ex machina, Harry in canon wouldn't stand a chance in defeating Voldemort in a more conventional way. That said, I feel that Voldemort suffered from weaknesses that could be improved upon if Harry was potentially able to stand toe-to-toe with him in magical combat or strategy. For example, his arrogance and over-confidence (and what I feel is a reliance on the killing curse) could be played down and his cunning played up. No dramatic changes to make him more powerful, but ones that add additional conflict.

*** He's already got a huge advantage. He was a competent student for the full hogwarts educational experience and then spent who knows how many years learning about magic abroad and he has actual real combat experience. Harry is an average student who got a shitty defense education and is generally unmotivated about learning magic unless its immediately applicable. If he didn't have stupid amounts of plot armor he would have died like 20 times in the series. Just making him competent isn't enough of a buff imo to justify all of a sudden having a super!voldemort fighting him.

*** I've seen fics that overpower Harry but don't end up being boring. They do it by making the Voldemort conflict less important. You could say, if you give Harry a lightsaber, make him [[http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Negi_Springfield][teach English to a class of 14-year-old Japanese schoolgirls]].

***** The only one that springs to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]], which is focused on Hermione and has her and Harry overpowered. It's primarily a romance story, though, so the powers don't make much difference until the few chapters dealing with the Dark Lord.

** How about Perspicacity's one-shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]? I think this may qualify as the weirdest Animagus form in fanfiction. [[/s][Mouse-over for spoiler.]]

** This fic is recommended so often here that you probably already saw it, but Harry Potter and The Natural 20 comes somewhat close to your requirement - except it's an OC insert rather than Harry with the super power.

** Is it just me, or does making Harry Very Powerful without changing anyone or anything else seem --- I don't know --- dull, for lack of a better word? Unless you change his personality, goals, motivations, etc., he'd just spend more time playing Quiddich, dating, and hanging out with Ron. These are not bad things, but what's the point?

*** He survived by luck and plot armor in canon. Reading a story where he can crush the opposition on his own merits is fun. As for interesting plot stuff, just skip the year if nothing interesting happens. Or start later, there's no reason to start in year 1 if he's just going to take care of quirrelmort in a week and then nothing happens for the rest of the year.

Year 4 is my personal favorite for an OP harry. Plenty of events to show off at, and plus instead of just a few people going "That's impossible" you can have the whole country wondering wtf is going on.

**** I think that "on his own merits" is the problem, here:

- If he's just Harry with canon personality who got an arbitrary power-up, it doesn't feel "merited", it feels like an arbitrary power-up, and while the author can be very creative about all the ways in which this powered-up Harry crushes the competition, it's just as likely to make the one root for said competition and/or write off the whole thing as onanistic. (Consider, for example, Cedric Diggory, exemplifying all the virtues of Hufflepuff, working hard to hone his own skills and abilities, all the while helping others develop theirs. It pays off: he, a 6th-year, is selected to be the Champion from Hogwarts over all the 7th-years, purely on merit. Unfortunately for him, a so-called "protagonist" happened to be born with a gigantic magical core and/or descended from some obscure deity and/or whatever the power-up du jour might be, so Cedric doesn't stand a chance, and it's very obvious from the beginning.)

- If he's a Harry who got an arbitrary power-up /and/ worked hard to develop it, then he is almost certainly a HINO, because when it comes to preparing for future challenges, canon Harry basically does just enough work to get by, with a possible exception of Quiddich.

In the end, it's just a matter of taste, I guess.

** There's this one curbstomp fic with some muggle woman named Natasja who is the wife of a police officer adopting Harry and beating off death eaters with kitchen implements. Harry breaks Voldemort's arm with a rolling pin. I hated it for the mere premise, but it does have the people going "wtf 0.o he's scary muggle women are scary"

I think the summary is something like "cause really there's nothing that could possibly go wrong if you leave a baby on a doorstep in the middle of the night"

** I've been thinking of a Star Wars crossover that doesn't increase anyone's power on Voldemort's side. It wouldn't need to, really -- a lightsaber isn't much better than the Sword of Gryffindor, and Force reflexes and clairvoyance would mainly reduce the reliance on luck.

The clairvoyance would quickly track down Slytherin's monster, though it might not provide any hints as to the person releasing it -- Ginny Weasley could say, with full verisimilitude, she wasn't doing it because she didn't remember doing it. There are probably a couple other situations in which it wouldn't help as much as you'd expect.

But I wouldn't make Harry Potter a Jedi. He'd turn Sith, or else need to shift his personality significantly. Hermione would be a better candidate -- she deals with loneliness, sure, but she's less prone to anger.
