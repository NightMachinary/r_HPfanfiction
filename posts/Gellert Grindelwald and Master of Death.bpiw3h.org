I once read a story describing meeting between Gellert Grindelwald and female Master of Death (alternate version of Harry Potter) during World War II. If I recall correctly MoD traveled from different universe (because her version of Earth was mostly destroyed due to mundane's wars) and arrived in one of Gellert's properties because of connection to his Elder Wand. Female Harry (I do not recall her name) decided then to join Gellert's war effort. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of this story. Could anyone help me, please?

I would also appreciate other stories with similar theme (Gellert Grindelwald meeting MoD during his bid for power).

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel

*** I really like this story. It may start off a little slow but the main part of the story is from Harry's perspective and then it expands beyond Harry looking after Tom (in an unexpected way in my case). So I encourage anyone to give it a try past the first few chapters.

** Apparently I was looking for the story titled "Lemonade", which was written by Tsume_Yuki. Unfortunately author has removed that particular story from fanfiction/ao3 :(

  Graves isn't Grindelwald's first unwilling guest. Who else has better cause to summon a Master of Death than the man who wants to take his place?
