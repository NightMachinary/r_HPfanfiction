Hi! Looking for some inspiration. Do you have any Harry ships or Hermione ships that are not typical and known by everyone? Or some that are unpopular? I don't need any fics, but if you have some that you like you can of course leave a link here. Thanks!


** These two have been paired with almost anyone, but Harry/Hermione/Ron fics are surprisingly rare.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247?view_adult=true][The Sum of Their Parts]] are the only two that have a good plot, and yet Trio romance is not their focus.

*** Most of the triad fics are either fluff or smut. It's a bit of a shame.

I do have my own idea for a plot driven one to write whenever I get around to finishing my Harry/Ron WIP

** I've always been surprised by the lack of Harry/Parvati fics, given that they went to the Yule Ball together. This one is really sweet:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7613224][*we were in screaming colour*]] *by aceofdiamonds:* Lavender and Ron's relationship has a knock-on effect. “Lavender feels I haven't been spending enough time with her,” and then she tilts her head over to their best friends look as though they're struggling to breathe. Parvati's kissed a couple of people, she's not sure it's supposed to be quite like that, at least not at half eight in the morning. But she's not judging; she's being a good friend. Harry laughs. Parvati gets a sharp kick to the shin at that. Lavender's always been good at multi-tasking. “I hope you feel ashamed.”
