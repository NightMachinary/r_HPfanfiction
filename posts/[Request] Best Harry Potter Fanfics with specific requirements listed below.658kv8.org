I'm pretty picky with my fan fiction in general, and not just that but I've gone through a good deal of AO3's archives. I find FF.net really hard to search through but I'm happy to read recommended stories from there. Here's what I'm looking for:

1) Complete 2) No Bashing 3) No harems/not sex based 4) No super-Harry 5) Decent to epic novel length (25,000 words - 500,000 words) 6) Decent grammer/spelling/punctation (aka has obviously been at least a little edited) 7) Not romance based (I find them boring since they tend to follow the same-ish plot, if you have a very unique romance that's fine.)

I'm looking for stories about Harry being raised by the Dursleys (or someone else), being sorted into a different house, after Hogwarts how things change/grow. I'm not looking for Harry being dramatically betrayed by the light, but if he is 'dark' or whatever that's fine. I prefer quality of quantity.

This is my first time posting to HPFanfiction so if I've messed this up somehow people let me know!

edit: -I have yet to read a wrong boy who lived story where Harry as a twin/sibling who is thought to be the boy who lived that I actually liked, but if you have one you enjoyed - point it out (tell me what you liked about it too!)


** I hope [[/u/taure]] doesn't mind me posting this but a while back he assembled a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][list of good fics]]. Hopefully its a good starting point that hits a number of the classics.

*** That's brilliant, thank you. I just glanced at it and it clearly has some that I've read before but there also seem to be some I haven't seen. :) Thank You!

Do you have any personal recommendations/favourites?

**** If you like cross overs then check out Steelbadger on FF net but with regards to other recommendations its a bit hard. There aren't that many great fanfics, even less that are finished and without knowing your preferences a bit more I'd struggle. Your request is just a tad too open ended which is why the linked list is so good. Have you visited DLP's library and checked their 5* lot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/]] collects a lot of them.

***** I'll check it out, thank you!

Edit: I would like to be more selective but honestly besides the things I mentioned at the start - I'm willing to try just about anything. I read quickly enough that I finished a 56,000 word book in less than two hours. Anything you can recommend, especially when you can explain why you like - I'd love to read. Thank you.

*** I've already read Stages of Hope, Pétrification Proliferation, and Sum of their Parte. But! I haven't read a Dramatic Reading which looks really good - thank you!

Edit: I just read a Dramatic Reading, I loved it. It was very funny without being too silly. It brought up good points without dragging on, and allowed for a natural development in the stories plot without forcing it. Thank you for recommending it. :)

** [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s list includes almost all of my favorite stories. Here's some of my liking which are missed out:

Linkffn(Path of Decision by lulu42) - This is crossover between HP and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)][Sandman Comics]]. For this particular story, You don't need to know anything about the comics.

Linkffn(A Riddled Universe by hazeldragon) - One of finest story of how Tom Marvolo Riddle could turn into in alternative bringing up.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee) - One of the finest adventure story of the fandom.

Linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) - A (rare) post-Hogwarts romance story.

Linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban by Shezza) - The 2nd war more than 25 years.

Linkffn(Redemption by krtshadow) - Considering it was published in 2003 a classic Azkaban!Harry story, perhaps one of the first of this trope.

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by Zennith6) - Another unique take on TMR - if circumstances were different.
