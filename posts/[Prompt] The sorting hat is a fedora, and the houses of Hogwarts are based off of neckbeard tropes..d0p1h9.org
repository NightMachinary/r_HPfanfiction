Gryffindors study the blade, Hufflepuffs are [[/r/niceguys]] and super entitled and love tendies, Ravenclaws are pseudointellectuals/iamverysmart types, and Slytherins are incels/massive racists.


** "I like to study," Hermione said impishly, "Study /the blade/. Nothing personnel, Lav-Lav."

...

"Join me, Potter," said Malfoy. "You'll soon see that some kinds of wizard are more proper than others."

"You have drawn against my honor, Malfoy!" said Ron.

"It's not that I think that Mudbloods are naturally inferior," said Voldemort, "but the historical data shows that they /never/ get Ministry positions or climb the ranks of powerful wizarding organizations such as the Death Eaters. Why would that be, if they weren't our inferiors?"

"Yes, my Lord," said Bellatrix, batting her eyelashes.

Voldemort cringed away from her. "Sorry Bella, you're not hot enough for me."

Cedric tipped his hat to Cho. "M'lady."

Cho giggled. Marietta elbowed her.

They pretend they've /done extensive research on their mating patterns!/ This school is insane. I thought I would be around people who were actually smart, not cringeworthy pretenders."
