^ preferably drarry :) But specifically, are there fics where he doesn't befriend Harry and suddenly become a gryfindor but stay a slytherin and changes future for the better in slytherin ways


** I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20219482/chapters/47915569][the most powerful magic always]]

Edit: in this he does befriend Harry, so I'm not sure if it's what you are looking for.

** The flair you should be using is 'Request', not 'Recommendation'. 'Recommendation' is for when you want to /recommend/ a fic to others.

Draco does get sorted into Gryffindor, but he befriends Harry in this one.
