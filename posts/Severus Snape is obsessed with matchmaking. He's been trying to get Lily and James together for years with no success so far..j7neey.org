"Oh honestly, Sev, I still don't understand why you think it would work between me and Potter. He's an arrogant toerag about 78% of of the time!"


** "Potter, get a move on! I did not sweat and toil for seven years to get your parents together just so you could experience death by laziness! I want that potion on my desk and ready to test in fifteen minutes."

"Yessir-wait, what? You got my parents together? Why?"

"Because your mother had the capacity for understanding other people's actions, motivations and emotions normally only found in beanbag chairs and your father was about as smart as a beanbag chair. Now look at me, lecturing their beanbag chair of an offspring and wondering why you are like this."

"Umm, thank you?"

"You can thank me by talking to that Granger girl about things other than schoolwork more often."

"Uh-"

"Breeding for brains clearly didn't work, so now let's see if looks do the trick."

"..."

"I'm kidding Potter. Get back to work."

"Oh thank Merlin."

**** November 1st, 1981:

Snape stared at the desolate sight before him. His grand experiment, one that had taken him half his life to bring to completion, had been destroyed in but a single stroke.

Now, nobody would know that he, Severus Snape, was a social mastermind on par with the greats such as Horace Slughorn, the kingmaker of the Wizarding World. Never again would he be able to demonstrate to outsiders his impossible grasp of the very nature of the individual or show how the Wizarding World could be dragged into the twentieth century without the need to fire a single spell.

He stared at the ruins. His hopes were dashed. His plans for assisting Dumbledore in building a bastion of peace and equal rights for all magical beings were back to step one. His life's work, the healing of the fractures of the wizarding World through the power of loved and really, really heavy social engineering, would have to restart with the distinct disadvantage of the Wizarding World falling back into its pre-War habits of social stagnation, bigotry and mindless superstition.

How had this all come to pass? He'd lied to Voldemort and gotten away with it, labelling his fated adversary a she rather than a he. He'd instructed Dumbledore and his friends to hide by giving them the truth, sure, but even then he'd limited that information to only those directly affected by the prophecy.

All for naught, as it turned out. Voldemort had somehow discovered the true prophecy and had done what Dark Lords were wont to do, much to his disadvantage.

Leaving Snape pissed as all hell, because he couldn't even take his anger out on his now dead 'boss'.

He knew, however, that if someone had managed to snooker his plans, they wouldn't have been able to do so without leaving some trace of themselves behind. The Potter cottage had been warded by the very best enchanters Snape could get his hands on, after all, and he didn't pay people to muck around on the job.

So here he was, staring at the rubble, waiting for the detection enchantment to finish it's work.

Finally, a charred wooden beam shifted, the dust obscuring the item that was now floating off the ground.

Snape recognised it easily enough-a powerful variant of the common beacon charm, one enchanted to be undetectable until the subject of the beacon came into range.

The dust settled, and what hovered in the air was revealed to be... A beanbag chair. The one Peter had gotten for the offspring on its birthday. Snape remembered, because the little shit had puked on him and giggled about it.

Depression finally receded for the first time in 12 hours, giving way to rage.

"Peter Pettigrew" Snape growled in a way many of the rank and file Death Eaters would have recognised as a sign that they should start running and fast.

Severus pulled his wand out and twisted. It seemed that he had some pest control to do.

Rats rarely killed themselves after all.

****** He did it with baby Harry's squeaky mallet.

This being the wizarding world, it's literally just a mallet that's been enchanted to squeak.

He then set the half-dead ratman on fire and tossed the beanbag on top of course. Nobody messes with his scientific method and gets away with it.

Then Sirius is caught dancing around the sadistically brutalized corpse and sent to Azkaban after Severus takes his leave. Snape just plain forgot about him.

*** Snape and Lilly's falling out due to the tree branch hitting petunia goes a bit rougher, and when snape gets on the train he mopes in his cabin only for Sirius black to lean over and tell him to stop moping so much and that he is being a bit of a drag.

as snape apologises and goes to leave the cabin James potter calls out and goes 'Oi idiot, sit back down, black was only saying you needed to come join us and stop being all mopey'

the rest of the train ride goes well, With snape eventually learning what houses all his friends want to be and he tells them he wanted to be in slytherin but he hopes he can go to the same house as them.

then you could flash forward to harry going to hogwarts with fred and george telling harry that while professor snape is strict in class, he is pretty nice outside of it and once awarded them house points for how clever a prank he caught them planning.

Third Year, snape and Remus reconnect as friends and snape is even more furious about Sirius's escape and is overjoyed about sirius being innocent. As snape and sirius bonded quite a bit about how crap their own home life was.

also because I am a massive Ron fan, Snape mentors Ron because Ron reminds him of a mixture of Peter and sirius.

** It'd be funny if he set Lily up with James because he was worried there was something between her and Sirius and figured the only way Sirius would back off Lily is if she was with his bff James. He becomes civil, if not friendly, with James and when he discovers Sirius's innocence he keeps alluding to his "torch" for Lily until Sirius is like "wtf" and then he discovers that Sirius never had the hots for her.

** ..Now a days most of his fans are teenage girls, who like to savor story of his lifelong love for Lily Potter-Evans, love, that brought light and hope in the darkest times and circumstances. 99% of of our memory of this man has to do with pity. Sometimes somebody could remember his bravery and noble courage, sometimes -- his abilities in Occlumency (usually with negative connotations). But Professor Snape was greater than the combination of these character traits -- and we should keep this in mind when we`d try to figure out why Snape enjoyed the full confidence of Albus Dumbledore...
