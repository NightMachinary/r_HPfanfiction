Is there an accepted way to call upon the linkffn bot to provide me with an epub link to a fic I want to download? Or is there a better way of getting fics from [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] to epub? I've been having some trouble with FicSave.xyz.


** the normal linkffn/ao3 call provides an epub download at the bottom, does it not?

*** sure - but I don't want to use a post just to call up the bot. So is there a proper etiquette to effectively doing that?

** If you google around, there are quite a few other options for downloading from FFN besides ficsave

This is the one I prefer: [[https://fanfictiondownloader.net/#/home]]
