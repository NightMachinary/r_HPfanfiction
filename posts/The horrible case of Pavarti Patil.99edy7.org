Why are people perfectly capable of spelling Hermione correctly each and every time, but Pavart... sorry Parvati causes problems. She is the only character in HP fandom whose name is repeatedly misspelled by authors. Even veteran fanfictioners are sometimes guilty of that? Her name is not difficult to spell. Is actually a name of an Indian goddess and rolls pretty easy of the tongue. Minerva doesn't pose such problems, nor does the aforementioned Hermione. The only similar, though to a lesser extent, problem is Blaise Zambini.

** On one hand I've seen a ton of Minevra/Minvera/Minerva transpositions. Also Ginevera/Ginvera/Ginerva. And Hermione, Hermoine* So half of it is laziness. People just don't want to be bothered.

On the other, fandom is made up of a whole lotta people who can't be arsed to *check spelling* of names from outside their own culture - so any name that's outside the most commonly seen gets misspelled - but names outside the culture of the writer like Parvati gets hit harder because not only it is uncommon, it's a transposed spelling from another language with a different alphabet.

HP's not unique - We see the same thing in other fandoms - people will spell Warren Worthington fine every time, struggle with Erik Lehnsherr, and wow, completely destroy the spelling of Nezhno Abidemi.

And even in the same character - Erik "Killmonger" Stevens gets spelled right all the time, but "N'Jadaka" gets misspellings.

It's not hard to google and add names to spellcheck. I had to double-check all but three names in this comment - but I've got the correct spellings of names of characters I actively write in my browser's spellcheck.

- This particular misspelling always makes me think of Herobrine, so kudos for anyone writes a quick Hermione in minecraft fic where Hermione is Herobrine messing things up and breaking builds just because she's trying to get HOME. Pesky enchanted X-Box that her father-in-law brought home. ;)

** Lilly.

One of my worst pet peeves is people misspelling things. We live in the 21st century, they clearly have access to some sort of electronic device and the internet. WHY?

The worst is in online games when there is text for almost everything. Characters' names floating above their heads, location names on the map, tooltips for skills and equipment, and people still misspell things.

It's either stupidity or gross indifference. Or some kind of misplaced arrogance, like they know 'how it should have been spelled' better than THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY WROTE THE DAMN THING.

** Most people aren't familiar with Indian mythology, while comparatively more are familiar with Greek/Roman mythology. Latin was taught in my school, Hindi was not.

Furthermore, it's mostly just the position of the 'r' that causes problems - I've seen more than a few 'Hermoine's and 'Pansey's. People make a special note of Hermione because she's a main character and has an unusual name. People don't care as much about Parvati because she's not.

I agree that if they're making Parvati have more focus, then they should really be spelling it right, but both ways of spelling it sound natural (as does 'Zambini'), so you don't have the instinctual reaction of seeing, say, "Fluer" and realizing that it's wrong.

And for all that she's Harry's date to the Yule ball, she dances with him once, then leaves. It's practically intentional, keeping her in minor character status (probably to avoid shippers).

I'd argue that Pansy is a more prominent character, solely for her early-books antagonism with Hermione.

** I don't think I've noticed this misspelling more than other names; however, I can understand it being more commonly misspelled. Here's my theory: the ‚Äúrv‚Äù in the middle of Parvati is uncommon in English words. There's only about 3400 English words with that combination. Many of the words that do have it are multiple word forms of the same root word (like ‚Äòstarve' and ‚Äòstarvation') or compound words. There are also only 3 words in English with the ‚Äúarva‚Äù scheme: larval, starvation, and carvacrol (which is a scientific compound found in oregano... who knew?).

Basically this all means that the combination of letters is exceptionally uncommon in a language that has between 150,000 and 200,000 words, depending on who you ask. It just seems wrong to the English eye and ear because native speakers are unaccustomed to it. Your brain just wants to swap them and stick an ‚Äòa' in the middle. That, and the cheese thing. Probably it's the cheese thing.

** I must admit I had not noticed Parvati being spelled wrong more than other names. If asked for the most common misspelled names I would probably have said Luscious Malfoy, Hermoine or Lilly.

I think some of it is most fanfic (written in English) is written by native English speakers who are culturally and linguistically more familiar with Greek and Roman mythology than Indian mythology. Now that I think of it I am not sure I would notice is it was Parvati or Pavarti while reading a fic, Possibly because all the letters are there albeit in a different order the brain doesn't recognise a misspelling of an unusual (in the English speaking world) name. I think more people notice the misspelling of Hermione as she is a main character and often a major focus in fics.
