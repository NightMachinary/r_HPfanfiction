I have some things to specify;

- Harry is NOT the main character/creature. I think I've exhausted those resources, unless you've got something very obscure
- I'm not very fond of slash
- I don't care about length or if it's complete
- I did go through the other threads on this topic


** There's one on ff.net called The Mountain and The Sea by Alexis.Danaan. It has Draco as the creature (Veela) and he ends up with Hermione.

  The first thing it knew was the hunger. Life from a Dementor's point of view.

** A non-Harry non-Slash creature fic? There is a fic, written pre-DH, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1584458/1][Dementors]] by Miranya, where Hermione is imprisoned in Azkaban, makes friends with Dementors, and is eventually 'shipped with one, becoming part-Dementor herself. It's readable.

** If you aren't fond of slash your criteria are going to bring back very little

**** No seriously though, almost every single creature fic is either Harry or Draco getting mated to Harry or Draco
