The two fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/2/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon are easily two of the most divisive comedy fics in this fandom. Whenever we get a "Which fics do you think are overrated" thread in this subreddit, you'll almost certainly find a number of voices arguing that either fic is completely unfunny and they don't get why anyone would ever like it, and an equal number of people claiming that the fic is absolutely hilarious from start to finish.

Obviously both of these fics have very peculiar types of humor, that you either get or don't.

What I'm wondering is if there's a connection between how people feel about both of these fics. For example personally I'm a big fan of Seventh Horcrux, but don't get the humor in A Black Comedy at all. I'm really curious if this is this a pattern that holds true for everyone. Are the styles of humor in SH and ABC mutually exclusive, so everyone who loves one fic will automatically hate the other, or are there people who like both or neither of these fics. I'm also curious how many people didn't have such an extreme reaction and found one or both fics sort of funny but not super funny or completely unfunny.

This thread is intended as both a poll and a discussion on the subject. For the purpose of voting, please make an answer with:

Seventh Horcrux: [Yay/Nay/Meh] A Black Comedy: [Yay/Nay/Meh]

Feel free to add any explanation or discussion afterwards.

EDIT: Okay, one really interesting thing I noticed so far is that everyone who liked A Black Comedy also liked Seventh Horcrux, but the same is not true in reverse. This would suggest that the style of humor in SH appeals to a wider demographic than ABC that in fact encompasses the demographic of the latter.


** I love Seventh Horcrux and couldn't slog through A Black Comedy.

** I find both to be a little smarmy and not really what I would class as humour, so, neither in my view. But I'm aware that's just my own perspective.

Tbh I get from both of them the impression that they are either written by or aimed at teenagers, in the style of [[/r/im14andthisisdeep][r/im14andthisisdeep]].

I think the humour in neither of them is particularly British in the way that the source material is, so for me personally that's a dropping off point. I can see though how if the original series' humour is the one thats unfamiliar to you and this style is /more/ familiar you might feel the opposite way.

** I love both, but the humor in them is definitely different. Seventh Horcrux doesn't rely on crudeness and shock value, so I wouldn't be ashamed to recommend it to anyone. ABC is much more of a guilty pleasure (even though personally it was more enjoyable).

** I liked both, but read A Black Comedy when I was younger and I dont think I would enjoy it as much if I read it now. I enjoyed Seventh Horcrux a lot more. I should point out; neither of them are among the funniest hp fanfics imo.

** I enjoyed both of them immensely.

I actually feel like they have a lot of similarities in the source of their comedy. In a similar fashion to Dumb and Dumber or Bill and Ted, the world is mostly relatively normal, but then you have this bizarre fuckin weirdo of a main character (or characters, in A Black Comedy) going through like a bull in a china shop.

Some people just don't find that kind of comedy entertaining.

Addendum: Also, ABC has aged fuckin terribly in terms of what is considered appropriate, and I doubt it would be written the same today. Seventh Horcrux, to my memory, doesn't have this issue.

** I laughed at both [Yay/Yay] but admit ABC is closer to American Pie or Something About Mary in terms of its humour and there were jokes (like "Nappy" the House Elf) that fell completely flat.

*** Just read ABC because of this thread, and while I can understand how Nappy can fall flat, personally I found the whole situation hilarious. It's so inappropriate, and kind of ironic due to the fact that the Potters are the least likely family to treat their house elf like a slave, that I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it.

** Seventh Horcrux: [Yay] A Black Comedy: [Yay]

I honestly loved reading both. Seventh Horcrux was amusing in that Harrymort misinterpreted literally everything and reacted accordingly. His wildly incorrect predictions about human behavior granted the audience a suspension of disbelief about his antics, because...it's Harrymort, he doesn't know what's going on. Of course he did that random crazy thing. For me, Seventh Horcrux was the kind of fic I'd read and snort at, maybe put down once or twice to look at my ceiling and ponder the idiocy of the MC. The humor here stems from the MC being dumb, I think.

On the other hand, A Black Comedy is funny because the characters are completely batshit. I have a very crude sense of humor, which did lend itself to helping me enjoy ABC. This is a fic where I'd laugh out loud and shake my head because of what the characters did. ABC, I think, is a more typical crack fanfic in that Sirius and Harry are completely irreverent and just do funny stuff for the sake of it. I found it absolutely hilarious when Harry and Sirius go do self indulgent things and bemoan the weird stuff that happens to them---like Ginny, who was always a source of humor. Because Harry is an OP badass they can get away with a big ol “eff you” to the dimension they fell into and do whatever they want.

Fundamentally, I think both fics have one main similarity. They're both about caricatures of their original characters taken to a ridiculous extreme, which is a main thread that runs through crack fics. Voldemort utterly overreacts to everything. Harry and Sirius are hedonists who have adapted to Sirius' preferred state of being---debauchery. Seventh Horcrux can get a little dry while ABC gets really crude, really fast, but I still loved both.

A note on ABC not aging well: it hasn't, unfortunately. I still however find it funny, as I think people with ruder senses of humor would too.

** Interesting! I love both of these fics and appreciate them for their different types of humour. I think a great amount of dramatic irony in both comes from the reader knowing more than any character other than Harry, something that's used to great effect in both fics. I feel smug, along side Harry, while he's baffling and bamboozling those unfortunate characters in the story along with him.

Read most of both of them. Eh, don't really have any feelings towards either of them. They're just there in my mind under the "Okay fics but not for reread unless really really really bored."
