While AU fics that feature significant variations: ranging from Dumbledore being defeated by Grindelwald or Harry joining the Death Eaters, are a pleasant read, I'm looking for a more personal variations. Harry befriending Ernie for example, and I'm not exactly opposed to reading a fic that features large variations from canon or OCs, just as long as the protagonist's relationships changes.

Thanks!


** Are you looking for fics that feature travel to alternate dimensions where the characters witness these changes (Stages of Hope linkffn(6892925) is a poster child for this; Snape is wearing /burgundy/) or For Want Of A Nail fics that while they have such changes, by their nature don't acknowledge these changes as being different or changes at all. (Like linkao3(7331278) where the proverbial missing nail is that Harry never got his Hogwarts letter?

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
