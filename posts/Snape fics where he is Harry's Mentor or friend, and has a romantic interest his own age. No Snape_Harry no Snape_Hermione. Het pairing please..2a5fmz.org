*** The only problem is that the final story is 3 chapters from finishing and hasn't been updated since 2012.

It's really great though.

*** I second this with an addition of /anything/ by Arsinoe de Blassenville.

She's a brilliant writer. Her Dragon Age fanfictions are better than the tie-in novels that are done by the head writer of the franchise. Her HP stuff is great too.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7724057/1/Family-Bonds][Family Bonds]] has Father!Snape, but it's also a J+L Potter live, are neglectful in favor of his twin, Dumbledore isnt perfect etc..

But I would recommend it if those stories don't put you off too much.

** I'm fond of SuiteSambo's "Moment of Impact" series. No romantic interest for Severus, but the best mentor into parental SS/HP relationship I've ever read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2612609/Suite-Sambo]]

I also have a love/hate relationship with "Lily Potter's Biggest Secret". There are so many things wrong with it (character-wise), but it's a strangely compelling read. I won't give away the whole plot, but it's long, complete, and SS/OC, HG/DM, HP/GW. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7775877/1/Lily-Potter-s-Biggest-Secret]]

Yes it's very long (which I like) but not in a bad way. It isn't specifically a mentor fic but Snape is very much a part of Harrys life and is thoroughly involved and around. Things don't happen immediately and he still has to function as a professor and someone charged with his safety but they really do develop a relationship. The romantic part for Snape is there too with OC (well done imo) although it doesn't happen until Book 3 and later. I really do recommend.

---cheating below - not really what you asked for ---

This next one breaks all your parameters but perhaps the circumstances will let it pass. Snape treats Harry more like Lilys child than Potters spawn. Snape will eventually have a romantic interest (though they aren't his own age either). The catch is Harry is really Harriette and is the /eventual/ pairing but she really is her own character. It is done well and tastefully - at 480k words she has only just had a sort of realization that she fancys him and he is unaware (so it doesn't feel icky/unrealistic/underage). I am not into slash and would never want to read a Snape/Harry fic but like I said Harriette is her own self so it doesn't ever feel like Harry or slash. Work in progress starts year two and now past Christmas year 4.
