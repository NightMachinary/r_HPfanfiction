You are given the chance to be a wizard in Harry Potter, which year and school do you choose? Why?


** well if it was without choice (as in, in the HP world and given magic at birth) i'd go to ilvermorny cause it's the north american school. and as much as i'd want to do stuff at hogwarts, i don't want to have to deal with voldemort and if i'm inserted into a time before he becomes a problem, that's a long wait to meet harry and the gang

*** I'd love to troll Lockhart too

If I were a teacher in Hogwarts with my current knowledge of HP then I'd probably be a charms professor

Also master at mind arts of course

** I'd really like to be born in the late 50s so I can go to school with James, Sirius, Remus, Severus and Lily. If I still remember cannon I'll try to prevent the fist rise of Voldemort and stop the Potters from dying. Since I'm a Slytherin I doubt that I'll have a chance to be friends with the Marauders but I'll try to befriend Severus and Regulus instead. Also, I don't think I'd like to be a muggle-born because it could cause difficulties when/if I'll get sorted into Slytherin. Yeah, I've thought about this whole scenario a lot.

** Can we still keep our knowledge about the books? Because if so and if I can really choose whichever year in history then I'd say Hogwarts from 1892 to 1899 alongside dear Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. I would do my best to become his friend and hey, maybe I'd be lucky enough for a romance to blossom between us. Either way I would do my best to prevent Albus from meeting Grindelwald and Arianna from dying. Depending on how this effects Albus, we would probably go around the world and discover secrets about magic, getting full teachings from the Flamels, maybe saving Franz Ferdinand from being assassinating and preventing WW1 and WW2 and basically being Istari-like Grand Sorcerers or we would lead a quaint and calm life as professors at Hogwarts, Albus teaching Transfiguration and me either History of Magic or Charms. Voldemort would be but a passing memory with two wizards with nearly a century worth of experience and even more so if I get to remember the Horcruxes from the books.

Actually, no, I wouldn't know about most of the Horcruxes because I would have tracked the Founders' relics, particularly Ravenclaw's Diadem and Hufflepuff's Chalice. Probably would have tried to steal the Elder wand from Gregorovitch before Grindelwald does it and the Resurrection Stone from the Gaunts (not like it would be difficult to beat Marvolo). I'd let the Potters keep the Cloak, it's in safe hands with them and I only would steal the other two Hallows so Grindelwald and Riddle wouldn't be able to get their slimy little paws onto them.

What I'd do about Riddle since I would already have taken four out seven from his OG Horcruxes is that I would keep an even closer look on him post-graduation and possibly try to be a good influence on him as a teacher. That probably wouldn't do much, but, as they say, you miss every shot you don't take. Maybe I should write about this one day.

*** You can probably kill in secret Grindelwald and Tom while they are young and not prepared. I doubt a teen Gellert would prepare for a sniper bullet fired from behind and far away

**** True, but at the same time you try to find a good sniper rifle with matching ammunition when you are yourself a minor in the 19th century. Tom would be easier to kill, but I'd try to change him while he's in school if I don't outright adopt him, then I'd be sure he wouldn't become Lord Voldemort. That way it would also assure the continuity of my legacy. Can you just imagine a young Tom Riddle being raised by two highly intelligent and talented gay wizards? He would probably become something like the second person to create the Philosopher's Stone.

***** Yes Tom guided by you two would probably surpass everyone. If you know the imperius you can control a muggle soldier to assasinate him from far away, doable at 15 for a wizard, and in 1900 no camera, but Albus wouldn't like this so you couldn't tell him. You can't let Gellert be because I think even without meeting Albus he will cause trouble at some point

** I'd probably end up in Durmstrang though I think I would chose the Harry Potter years in Hogwarts because I's know exactly who and what to avoid annd before the last year I'd just skip to Europe and wait out the war. Also I'd make up huge betting pools to earn money and I'd invest in the Weasley's jokeshop as soon as possible. Maybe try ro prevent some deaths by leaving omnious messages

**** Oh yes. Though I think it would probably not fare too well to disturb the timeline. Who knows what would happen in return. But one could argue that knowing about stuff already disturbs the timeline. What wouldb be cool though is meeting Sirius when he is on the run. I mean he was in a few tropical countries and stuff
