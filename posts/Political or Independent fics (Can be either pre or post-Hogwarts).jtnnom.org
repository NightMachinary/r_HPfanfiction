Basically, I'm looking for fics where Harry involves himself in politics at least somewhat and/or is independent or taking his studies seriously. Doesn't have to be the major plot of the story but I'd like it to be at least more than a passing interest. I'm looking for something where like Harry taking care of his estate, becoming a Lord or whatever, taking a seat at the Wizengamot, whatever. I don't really care if it's gen or slash, either.

I'm also interested in fics where Voldemort somehow loses his insanity and becomes political again. I'd prefer it if Harry works with him, though, or if they're paired together. It's not a requirement, though! No evil Voldemort/Tom or Harry.

The only pairings I'm not looking for are any sort of harems/multiple ships and Harry/Hermione.

Recs that fit this category (and some that don't) that I've read:

#+begin_quote
  Around the time most young children's do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence.

  So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.

  And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor.

  Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets.

  Usually.

  When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Souls Touch, and the Future Changes, authored by now-deleted account sunmoonandstars, which used to be me.

  Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world. Of course, there is also the problem of being a "Light" icon in Slytherin, not to mention the fact that someone seems determined to hamstring Harry's independence.

#+begin_quote
  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  

  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. 

  “It seems I have finally caught you.”

** This is a WIP [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24460507/chapters/59031181][The Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter]]. It's well written and it starts prior to Hogwarts. The author had made it to year 2, and they both fairly regularly. Harry is being raised to be Lord Potter by Sirius, Remus,, and Arcturus Black. See summary from author below.

"In a world larger and more complicated than anyone could expect, how will Harry Potter navigate and survive when raised by House Black -- an Ancient and Noble family with a long and bloody history? Surrounded by powerful new players watch House Potter rise from the ashes of defeat and reclaim their place in the annals of history, by any means necessary."
