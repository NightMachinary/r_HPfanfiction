... or Harry Potter but Things Don't Exist Until They Are Introduced In The Books

Harry timetravels back, or a self-insert gets self-inserted, but something doesn't feel right...

They go to Leaky Cauldron, but it isn't there. Strange. So they wait until 11th birthday, and lo and behold - Hagrid takes them there with no problem.

On the train, Scabbers is just a rat, even has all fingers. When they ask about Sirius Black, the only response is "who?". And Weasley Twins don't have a map.

When at the end of year 1 they ask Dumbledore why he didn't take a Floo, he's confused and doesn't know what this Floo or Apparation you're talking about, brooms /are/ the fastest method of long distance travel. But in year 2, Floo becomes "real", it's retconned seamlessly, and anyone you ask tells you "we had it since forever, what do you mean?".

But it also gets absurd. Chamber of Secrets and Basilisk don't exist until the end of second year, and petrifications just happen out of nowhere. Scabbers is a rat until end of Third, and the Grim is also just the dog.


** Sirius Black did actually exist in the first book, Hagrid mentioned him by name as being the one who he borrowed the motorcycle from. He just wouldn't be in Azkaban, be the grim, or be known as a mass murderer until later.

**** I think it could still work, Harry is just operating on more of a time crunch since he has to wait for inciting events. Like death eaters and the dark mark don't even exist until the quidditch world cup! He could do notes to people, like reverse /Memento/. Like "don't read until x date" because it will sound crazy before then. That could help him make up for lost time compared to how a normal time travel situation would let him operate.

** Another option is that the Books are like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms][The Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], which is 60% truths and 40% lies.

Among the lies:

- Voldemort is nowhere near as bad as depicted in the Books, he neither mutilated his soul nor looked like a snake. The winner of the war simply bashed him into oblivion.
- The good guys are nowhere near as innocent and passive as in the Books. Dumbledore is one top political hack and his Order had committed their share of war crimes. Of course, Voldemort's gang was more brutal.
- There is no prophecy. Voldemort targeted Potters because they got some seriously important intel on him. BWL is just a propaganda ploy because the truth is that Lily Potter activated self-destruct. Voldemort survived not because of some soul anchors, but because some other dark rituals that gave him much better protections.
- Nevertheless, Voldemort being badly wounded gave his enemies the opportunity for a devastating counterattack. Only the growing rift between the Ministry and Dumbledore prevented his network from being completely destroyed.
- Harry Potter was never given to an abusive household, although both parties were not happy with the arrangement.

Under this pretext, SI's Book knowledge is mostly useless, and often counterproductive.

** This is a fun prompt! It would be really interesting to see how an authour would handle making changes to canon without the resources from all the books. It would also be cool to see how changes made before canon catches up would work (for instance if scabbers was killed before he â€˜became' Pettigrew).
