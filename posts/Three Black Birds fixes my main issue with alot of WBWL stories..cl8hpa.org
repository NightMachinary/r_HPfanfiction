So In Wrong Boy Who Lived Stories, Harry is sent off to live with the Dursley's because -insert bullshit reason here- and is then abused while his sibling is adored and loved by parents, friends and what have you, only to find out at 11 that he's a wizard his parents come get him like nothings wrong and later on in the story it is revealed that Harry is actually the boy who lived all along.

These stories will either go one of two ways, Harry is left to the Dursleys and abused like normal even though we know Lily and James would never fucking allow it, so Dumbledore has to step in and manipulate things as is his only character trait in fanfiction.

Or

Harry is actually abused by his parents or not loved by them, which is also bullshit.

Three Black Birds fixes this problem marvelously, because the Author takes Neglect and realistically uses it. In the story Harry still lives with his parents, but his Younger brother is the boy who lived and he isn't. This causes his parents to focus on Tom (Queue Palpatine Ironic) because they end up getting caught up in the fame of it all. James and Lily are magical parents in the magical world, and they want what is best for both of their sons, but they like everyone else get caught up in the boy who lived thing because they weren't at the house, all they know is James' mother died and that their sons survived, and that one son is apparently the cause of voldemorts death. So they get caught up in the moment and sometimes (alot of the time) end up forgetting about Harry when they do things, not out of Malicious intent but because they put all their focus on the younger brother because the younger brother is the hero.

At the same time though this isn't like other WBWL stories where everyone just ignores Harry, Harry is 13 by the time his brother goes to Howgwarts, he has his own group of friends, is popular in his own right and is still the greatest seeker in hogwarts history.

His parents slowly start to realize they know nothing about their oldest son as the story goes on and they take steps to try and fix the issue, unlike other stories where you get scenes of denial or just increased neglect or abuse, instead you get Lily and James realizing they fucked up and they try to fix the issue, but the damage is already done.

TLDR: Three Black Birds is great and it does something different with the Wrong Boy Who Lived trope and I love it linkffn(13247979)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.

  It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and just like the last two, it promises to be anything but restful. House tensions are high, Harry's twin Jules, the darling of Gryffindor, doesn't like Harry any better than before, and on top of all that there's an escaped murderer on the loose who's apparently hell-bent on taking his revenge on both Potter twins.

  It is Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With international politics, someone out to kill Jules Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and Slytherin House's internal drama, this year seems pretty standard. Admittedly, the last time there was a dragon anywhere near Hogwarts, it fit in Hagrid's hut and didn't pose much of a danger to anyone. Who thought the Triwizard Tournament was appropriate for teenagers?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

** Thank you for the recommendation. This has been on my bookmark for a while, I simply haven't read it yet because of the pairing. I simply don't understand why everyone prefer to use Daphne instead of an OC.

I'm only on the third chapter, it's a good story so far. I like that James and Lily weren't overly abusive or neglective. There's favoritism between the brothers of course, but I don't see something like James and Lily ignoring Harry when he's sick or only giving him second hand clothes. I also like that Sirius and Remus fell into the favoritism, they're simply a fun Uncle who didn't come around much.

I like that Harry didn't suddenly become dark, hateful, or overly jealous. We know from canon that Harry is a good person despite growing up with the Dursley, so I don't see why he can suddenly goes dark when he has Sirius and his friends to support him. This is my problem with The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][HP&BWL]], Harry can be spiteful and jealous about his brother, but he will take any friendship and love anyone else give him.

At least I understand when Daphne is used as some variation of Slytherin Ice Queen. The dynamics between the character can be interesting and she can be used as a Sympathetic Slytherin. I simply don't understand why the author used Daphne in this story; Daphne is Ravenclaw, two years older, and didn't have any Ice Queen persona.

** I like it too. I just think they go a bit too far with the neglect sometimes---constantly forgetting his birthday, never taking him to the train station, never writing him int he first year, etc. If they dialed that down just a tad (maybe have them forget a birthday or two, not nearly all of them), then the Potters realized they fucked up and try and repair their mistake wouldn't be quite as hard to buy.

I think that's just kind of my problem with most of the WBWL stories. They make the Potters out to be some monsters (of course, not so much in this story) and then often prop up Snape or the Slytherin house as the "saviors" . It's one of the reasons I liked the Santi's story so much, because the Potters did care deeply for Harry even if they were a teeny bit neglectful.
