This prompt was inspired by season one of HBO's Westworld. No spoilers for Westworld beyond defining the bicameral mind.

From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology][Wikipedia]]), 'Bicameralism (the condition of being divided into "two-chambers") is a hypothesis in psychology that argues that the human mind once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeys --- a bicameral mind.'

â€‹

Prompt: A person (or many people) who received the Dementor's Kiss has placed within him/her a Horcrux that commands the body to do various things but has no direct control over the body. Over time, the body heals from the Dementor's Kiss by 'growing' a new soul that has to fight the Horcrux to take dominion over the body.


** This is a really cool concept I may steal, fair warning. I fucking adore Westworld.
