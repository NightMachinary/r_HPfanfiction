:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a story, but I don't recall much about it. It was Slytherin Harry and he was friends with Theo Nott, I think. It focused a lot on Harry becoming a leader within his house, with Draco as a rival, and the only part I can remember is where the older Slytherins are becoming fed up with Draco's whining and tell Harry to sort him out. So he and (I think) Theo ambush Draco in the common room to teach him a lesson. Any suggestions as to which fic this is would be welcome.


** Do you remember if Harry had a twin in this one?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately I don't think it's Prince of Slytherin because I have only just read it (and it's brilliant!) so I'd remember. This story I'm asking about I read ages ago.

** Is it the "Sarcasm and Slytherin" series? I've been re-reading it and there's a scene like the one you described.
