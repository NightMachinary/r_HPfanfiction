Looking for stories similar to linkffn(10506441) Stories where Hermione (or someone else) restores the house of Black, either by time traveling into the past, or in the present like Arx Domus Nigrae.

  There are legends among the pureblood families about Keepers-special witches who have the power to restore a fallen House. If any House needed a Keeper, it's the Ancient and Noble House of Black. Hermione/Multi (Cygnus, Orion, Sirius AND Regulus). Polyandry.

*** Honestly I skipped the sex scenes, but what caught my attention in this story was the whole restoring the House thing, and thats something I've never read before. It's interesting to read

***** it's hard to explain, but Houses can ask for a Keeper if they want to redeem a House. They don't know when this Keeper will show, but often after the House has died out. It's an old legend and since the last Keeper was 400 years ago nobody really knows how to do it, the only thing they knows is that a Keeper is off limits, no touching, no bad mouthing etc.

Not so much politics yet. More House Black coming together. And that is what I'm looking for! House Black accepting Hermione into their House, cause she can change it
