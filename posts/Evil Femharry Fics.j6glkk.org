Looking for any fics featuring a dark, evil fem!harry. Could be anything from joining Voldemort to striking out on her own as a dark lady. Character death is always appreciated. For reference, a fic I've enjoyed in the past that fits this description would the The Dark Lady by StellaStarMagic. I realize this is pretty niche, but thank you so much!


** Not sure if it would qualify but Umei no Mai 's crossover fanfic Black Sky that's a Harry Potter x Katekyo Hitman Reborn comes to mind.

It's about a FemHarry that's actually like the adopted child of James because he was infertile so he did a ritual adoption of Lily while she was pregnant with FemHarry(?) and Sirius provided some of his dna.it's been awhile since I was able to re-read it due to time constraints of irl so I maybe misremembering that bit but this FemHarry was raised by Cassiopeia Black and other members of the Black family and was able to overthrow the ministry while she was in school with some help of her friends. . It's a long fanfic that's at over 300 chapters now.

#+begin_quote
  Eliza Potter was abandoned in an orphanage by the Dursely's and so 11 years later she refuses to be the Light Golden girl everyone wants. Eliza Potter is more a force of nature than a girl and she refuses to let anything stand in her way to greatness, and that includes meddling old headmasters[starts in first year]
