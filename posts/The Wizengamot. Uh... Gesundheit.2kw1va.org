The Wizengamot: As far as I can tell, it's like placing the Roman Senate and the Supreme Court into an atom smasher and using the result. (Though that may just be my 'not a Brit' showing, as I'm fuzzy on just how parliament works. So:

Whats your head-canon (how you assume it works until told/proven otherwise in a fic/story) for how the Wizengamot works and what they do?

Whats your favorite representation of it in a fic?

  The *Witenagemot* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English][Old English]] */witena gemōt/* IPA: [ˈwitena jeˈmoːt] "meeting of wise men"), also known as the *Witan* (more properly the title of its members) was a political institution in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England][Anglo-Saxon England]] which operated from before the 7th century until the 11th century. The witenagemots did not represent the political will of all England: before the unification of England in the 10th century, separate witenagemots were convened by the Kings of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Essex][Essex]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent][Kent]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercia][Mercia]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria][Northumbria]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sussex][Sussex]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wessex][Wessex]]. The Witenagemot was an assembly of the ruling class whose primary function was to advise the king and whose membership was composed of the most important [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility][noblemen]] in England, both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastic][ecclesiastic]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular][secular]]. The institution is thought to represent an aristocratic development of the ancient Germanic general assemblies, or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkmoot][folkmoots]]. In England, by the 7th century, these ancient folkmoots had developed into convocations of the land's most powerful and important people, including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealdorman][ealdormen]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thegn][thegns]], and senior clergy, to discuss matters of both national and local importance.

** I see the Wizengamot as a body which pre-dates the Ministry of Magic and which was incorporated into the Ministry during the Ministry's founding years.

Originally I see it as a kind of informal gathering of influential wizards, who would meet on an ad hoc basis to discuss and decide various issues that affected the realm at large. It also went by the name "The Warlock's Council". There was no idea of any separation of powers back then: they would judge criminals, or make laws, or whatever they needed to do.

Over the years I can see it becoming a more official body which would meet regularly.

It is important to note that the Ministry of Magic appears to have come into existence in the 17th century, the same time in which England underwent a civil war with the monarchy on one side and Parliament (powerful landholders) on the other.

I see the wizengamot as an essentially royalist institution. This was before the Statute of Secrecy, back when we know witches and wizards were part of the King's court. The Malfoy family, for example, came to Britain with William the Conqueror and would later try to woo Queen Elizabeth.

In my mind, the civil war (1642-1651) also involved magical people. When the royalist faction was defeated, so too was the Wizengamot. The victorious faction founded the institutions which eventually became the Ministry of Magic, subsuming the Wizengamot into their influence and turning it into a court.

In my fanfic, the anti-royalist faction was lead by a powerful wizard called Brandon Swann. Following the civil war Swann amassed to himself essentially dictatorial powers over magical Britain, following a deal made with Oliver Cromwell. These powers were made law by Parliament by the creation of various great offices of state which carried executive powers. Swann held all of them simultaneously.

Over the next decades Swann used his powers to create various institutions to enforce magical law. During the period of Swann's reign over magical Britain, the Statute of Secrecy was passed and Parliament obliviated of knowledge of the magical world. This led to the further founding of executive institutions under Swann's power, as keeping magic a secret was now a full-time job.

When Brandon Swann died, however, he tried to pass his powers to his son, which would have essentially created a wizarding monarchy. Magical Britain went into a kind of cold war, with people declaring for or against the Swanns, and it looked like it might come to war. But before that could happen, a group approached Parliament for a solution, revealing magic to them once more.

Parliament's solution was to create a Parliamentary constituency of Hogsmeade. As this was an all-wizarding village, it would mean there was always a magical Member of Parliament. This MP would hold the offices of state created for Brandon Swann.

Parliament was obliviated once more and the first MP for Hogsmeade was elected in the next General Election. His first act was to combine all the various institutions into a single organisation called the Ministry of Magic, with himself as the Minister for Magic.

Magical people outside of Hogsmeade can vote in general elections, but as they live in Muggle constituencies they are voting for Muggles.

The MP for Hogsmeade is an MP largely in name only, as he does not attend Parliament.

This system continues to the present day, more or less unchanged. The biggest upset to the system was created when an enterprising wizard stood for election in a Muggle constituency and won, leading to a constitutional crisis as there were now two magical MPs. The Wizengamot court ruled, however, that the MP for Hogsmeade was clearly established by convention to become Minister for Magic.

** They only seem to hear the most major of trials, one of the things that Dumbledore pointed out at Harry's Underage Magic trial, so I relate it more so to the supreme court in the U.S.

In my head at least, new proposed laws are also brought forward to the Wizengamot for discussion and vote and then goes to the Minister to be signed into law. But, I question if such things as the High Inquisitor and the Educational Decrees were actually passed through the Wizengamot beforehand since they seem rather short sighted and rushed. Much more like Fudge's work than a full Wizengamot, maybe just the board of governor's? My memory is kind of vague on that.

** I loved the representation in /The Firebird's Son/ where the Wizengamot is basically a front with no real power so that wizards can delude themselves into thinking they have power. Of course I love everything about that fic. I also like the idea in some fics that the seats in the Wizengamot are hereditary. It makes sense that old purebloods families have a better source for their power and influence. Money is nice and all, but the power comes from having government authority.

As for canon, it never really entered my mind to explain how it worked. Government power was poorly explored through Harry's eyes.

**** You really should give it a go. It's easily in my top 5 favorite fics, and perhaps even #1. If you're interested in politics of the magical world, you'll have a hard time finding a better fic exploring it. Don't get discouraged if at first you think it's too AU or maybe a harem fic. The AU flows naturally once you understand what's going on, and the gender relations are deep and complex. In fact gender relations is the heart of the story, and it's a very compelling concept.

** I generally take it to be something like the Witenagemot, and in my head cannon, where I try to work it into the fics I write (haven't published in a while), is that in the early days of Britannia, the various patriarchal heads of pureblood families would meet and come up with various laws of the land. It also served to dispense justice.

Through history it became something like the Star Council and then the House of Lords/Commons. Nowadays there are mostly pureblood seats sitting on it, deciding laws, and whatnot. There is a "ministry" seat, not the MoM who gives the ministries opinion on matters. And there are various seats that can be awarded for acts of valour or services rendered to the Ministry.

I see it mainly as a ruling/parliamentary body, and only serves a judicial function for very high profile cases. There is a judicial circuit for normal cases.
