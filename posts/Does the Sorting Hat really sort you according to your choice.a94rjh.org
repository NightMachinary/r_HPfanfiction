According to Harry, the Hat lets you choose, but is it really true?

Lets look at what Rowling said.

#+begin_quote
  Not all Slytherins think they're racially superior. But all those who do are Slytherins.
#+end_quote

You know what this means, right? That all those 11 years olds children that were indoctrinated by their parents to be racist would have to end up in Slytherin, even if some of them didn't want to. And of course being in Slytherin will probably make their prejudices even worse instead of help them improve, because they will have no positive influences in Slytherin. It's pretty messed up, isn't it?

Another example is Neville and the Sorting Hat:

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hatstall]]

#+begin_quote
  In Neville's case, the Hat was determined to place him in Gryffindor: Neville, intimidated by that house's reputation for bravery, requested a placing in Hufflepuff. Their silent wrangling resulted in triumph for the Hat.
#+end_quote

In other words, the Hat didn't let him choose his House.

Considering this information, does the Hat truly let you choose? Or did it want to place Harry in Gryffindor since the beginning, but was just teasing him when it offered Slytherin?

*** The Hat has to sort based on quota too, or else number discrepancies between houses can get rather large.

Plot necessity aside, I see the Hat as an algorithm that generally bases its decisions on:

- Min/Max number allowed for a house, so in other word, Quota
- Student's personality
- Student's value system
- Student's own choice
- Student's ancestry

** As concerns the broad question of "does the Hat let you choose?"... well, it's a case-by-case thing. If the Hat feels like the student would belong in any one of several (or all) Houses, it will offer a choice and take it into account; but if the student wants to go somewhere where they obviously don't fit, or which wouldn't help them grow as a person at all, then it will feel free to disregard what the student says.

As for all the blood-purists going to Slytherin specifically, the Hat is an amalgamation of the minds of the four Founders. The way I've always imagined it is that in its subconscious are echoes of the four Founders squabbling about who gets who. And the Slytherin side, being itself blood-purist, is very insistent on getting all the blood-purists, while the other three, being broader-minded, don't particularly /want/ those people in their Houses.

#+begin_quote
  Death of the Author is a concept from mid-20th Century literary criticism; it holds that an author's intentions and biographical facts (the author's politics, religion, etc) should hold no special weight in determining an interpretation of their writing. *This is usually understood as meaning that a writer's views about their own work are no more or less valid than the interpretations of any given reader.*

So her "all bigots are Slytherins" bullshit is unsupported by the canon text and is therefore just that: bullshit.

***** I headcanon that it was standard for the old wizarding families to believe in blood purity to some degree or another until fairly recently and it's just Voldemort's Slytherin buddies who were willing to go the extra mile. I mean, sure Molly and Arthur married for love and James and the Longbottoms fought Voldemort, but their families had to have gone out of their ways to stay pure over the previous generations.

Edit: Actually, it might have still been true to some degree when the series was set, considering how fast people were convinced to go along with genociding the Muggleborns. Maybe Harry and Hermione just lucked out when they befriended Ron, and Ernie Macmillan's parents spent the whole series silently disapproving of his friendship with Justin Finch-Fletchley.

** A book written for children requires black and white villains and heroes which is what JKR gave us. No one expected that the series would become so popular with a more mature audiences who would question the lack of subtlety. Many of us get really annoyed every time JKR drops another canon interpretation but we should remember that her target audience wanted a clear cut evil to be vanquished. Think of orcs, goblins, etc. in LOTR vs elves, men, etc. - a clear cut divide between good and evil so that we can cheer every orc death without feeling guilty or conflicted. How many people complain about the racism inherent in that? Or how Tolkien made the attractive races good and the ugly races evil?

*** Yes, but like I said, if she wanted to make Slytherin the bad house, that's fine, but she should have KEPT it that way. Instead she tries to convince us now that Slytherin is a normal House like all others with supporting nonsense like the Cursed Child or that Merlin was a Slytherin.

You see what the problem is? If she wanted Slytherin to be the House for evil people , she should have just disbanded it in the end of the series, not have Harry tell his son that it's okay to go there.

It just feels inconsistent and confusing. It feels like a retcon.

** The Hat looks at what you value, not what you have. Nevile valued bravery, he was just scared. The Hat knew this and to Gryffindor he went. If you read the first book and look at Hermione's little speech in the potions chamber before Harry confronts the Mirror + Quirrel then you see that she values a bunch of stuff over brains which is why she's Gryffindor over Ravenclaw.

** Well, it's not like we didn't know that JK never intended on representing Slytherin fairly anyway, so this isn't a surprise.

As to the rest of it, I tend to think that the Sorting Hat places you in the house that represents what you value most. Neville wanted desperately to live up to his parents and he knew that they were incredibly brave. The reason he didn't want to be in Gryffindor was because he was afraid that he wouldn't live up to the expectations, not that he valued hard work and loyalty more than bravery. The Sorting Hat would have been able to see what his real motivations were for asking for Hufflepuff over Gryffindor and placed him appropriately.

You know what. It's fair if she wanted to make Slytherin the House for bad people, but in that case, i just wish she just disbanded it at the end of the series.

Reading the books themselves (and not Pottermore stuff) it's actually hard to see why they kept Slytherin at all, after all the problems it caused.

What I dislike is that on the on hand she makes Slytherin the obviously bad House in the books and on the other hand she tries to convince us that it's a normal House like all others, when in the books it obviously isn't...

** Short version: The Hat takes your opinion into account, but the final decision is the Hat's.

Longer version: How the Sorting Hat works in the original books is fairly consistent, but certain comments JKR has made post-books tends to cause issues for canon. In the original canon, the Hat would take into account what your current traits are, what traits your are lacking and whether or not you can/should nurture those traits, how specific houses would help regarding those traits, and your own personal desire. Neville and Hermione are good for elaborating...

At the start of the series, Neville isn't super brave (on the surface), has confidence issues, is bullied by some other students and even one of the professors. Based on what he was like at the time of his sorting, Gryffindor may seem an odd choice. But a house based around courage and bravery and doing the right thing is just the kind of place that could help him develop those traits and make him a more rounded individual (which ended up happening).

Hermione seems like a shoe-in for Ravenclaw at a glance. She is intelligent, enjoys studying, and seeks knowledge. But Hermione says herself at the end of PS that there are more important things, like bravery and friendship (which is what Gryffindor is good for). The Hat could have put her in Ravenclaw and not had many issues, but Hermione wouldn't be as likely to develop other virtues that she didn't yet have, like bravery. Whereas putting her in Gryffindor allows her to pull a Neville and become a more complete person.

Regarding Harry, I don't think the Hat was joking about Slytherin. If that Hat was joking about a House, it would have been Ravenclaw; Harry had a keen mind, true, but he didn't show many of the other traits native to Ravenclaw. Slytherin, on the other hand, was an alright fit for Harry. Harry could be a little sneaky, was more cunning than your average Gryffindor (not that that's a high bar), really did have a desire to prove himself to others in the beginning. Those are all things Slytherin would have embraced and nurtured, but the fact that Harry actively wanted to get away from Slytherin mattered; by not wanting to go there, in spite of the Hat's points about how they could help him, showed that Harry isn't /really/ suited for Slytherin. But this would seem to create an inconsistency with Neville getting shafted by the Hat! Well...

I think it's a little different. Harry not wanting to be in Slytherin despite his potential there was anathema to some of their main traits, and while Neville being intimidated by Gryffindor is inconsistent with Gryffindor's values, it's something that Gryffindor could actually help him with in time.
