  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** For what it's worth, that happened to me with “the family evans” (linkao3(3073562)), as well as some of the other works by the same author (that can be found in the same series this one is in).

Then you have “Digging for the Bones” (linkffn(6782408)), which features quite a few rather emotional moments, but be warned that it can be fairly angsty in places and it also deals with Snape as Harry's father (actually done in a plausible-ish way, but the very concept may be repugnant to some people).

And then you have “Coexistence” (linkffn(1097925)) which is, as a whole, an emotional rollercoaster of a sort.

“End of the Line” (linkffn(3673824)) gets an honourable mention, for though it is a crossover of sorts (of the mild kind), it is a story that can make you shed tears for the most unlikely of characters.

“Happy Birthday, Mr. Dark Lord”, found of FIctionAlley ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/after_the_rain/HBMDL01a.html]]), can do the very same thing, though it is a one-shot rather than something longer.

I'll finish it with a mention of “Wraithspeaker” (linkffn(5702750)), which is unfinished but what is to be found there is a good dark piece of story, and when I say “dark” I do not mean “Harry is edgy and oh-so-powerful” but rather “potentially disturbing stuff happens inside”.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** Every time I read this one, I end up crying. Really quite a good story, but you may have already read it. If not, I recommend reading it all at once. In my opinion, it is much better read as a whole than in separate sittings.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.
