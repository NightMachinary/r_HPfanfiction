Has any story be updated today? I'm following close to two hundred stories and zero updated today


** Quick answer - yes. For the future, if you click on the Just In at the top of the page, you can see any recently updated stories, not just those you're following. The top one there is usually only a few minutes old, assuming there isn't an outage. At least recently, FF.net also usually does a pretty good job of posting outages on the front page under news

** I uploaded a new chapter of my story a couple hours ago. 300+ views on the chapter, so I guess it is definitely updated on the site.

** There might be some review issues when going to alerts on e-mails. A review showed up in my review list about fifteen minutes before it went to my email.
