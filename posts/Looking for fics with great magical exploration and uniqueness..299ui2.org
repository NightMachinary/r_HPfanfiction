I'm looking for fanfictions that are similar to "A Second Chance at Life" by Miranda Flairgold in the sense that are new stuff to develop, it is not pairing centered, and is unique.

Other fan fictions I'm interested would be where harry has a great talent, like the fic "RuneMaster" by Tigerman. Potions or herbology would be awesome.

Thanks for the help.

** I'm just going to link you to a couple of my old posts because I'm lazy.

Those should give you some good fics to read.
