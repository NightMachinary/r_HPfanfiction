Are there any stories where Harry leads a crime syndicate? Preferably with him still fighting Voldemort (eg because he didn't pay the protection money or is trying to take over Nocturn Alley).


** Ooh, there's some good ones out there! I love criminal or Mafia Boss Harry. Here are some of my favourites. One of these is Harry becoming a Don, but the other two are just involve him as a criminal.

Moratorium- fem! Harry enters the wizarding world and sees a world of opportunities. Complete. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/][Moratorium]]

The Vahan Saga - Harry gets picked up by a street gang as a child and then starts organising crime. Very slowly updating. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/623810][The Vahan Saga]]

The entirety of the genius Harveste Addams series. Harry murders the Dursleys aged five and is adopted by the Addams' who have coincidentally shown up. Delightfully deadly and decadent. Tragically abandoned in the middle of the fifth book but still definitely worth a read; this is a series I always gravitate back to, and I have read an embarrassing amount of HP fanfics.

**** IIRC, she hooks up with Diary Riddle. The asshole one that killed her parents is taken care of in other manners. But its been a while, so I mighr be mistaken.

**** There is a Harry Diary!Tom ship but the other Horcruxes get axed. I don't know if thats acceptable or not? Also I've just realised that I meant to add [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]] by esama instead of Moratorium - Moriarty, Moratorium, I get confused sometimes. Personally I liked Moratorium. I thought it did the approach to Diary!Tom very well. Both good - Business is better.

***** I mean, usually I'd point out that at that time, Riddle had already committed several counts of murder including a male rape victim, but I guess this is a thread for Harry as a Mafia boss, so morality isn't really an issue here.

** linka03([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169]]) -- Harry's not the boss, but it is about as mafia as you can get and it's funny to boot.

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

** Not mafia but crime boss lady, the only fem!harry that I've ever liked. I can't help but imagine fem!harry as Missy from Doctor Who.

  Ron never wanted to be a crime boss. Pity he was so good at it. Even if he did spend most of his time worrying about what would happen when his mother found out.
