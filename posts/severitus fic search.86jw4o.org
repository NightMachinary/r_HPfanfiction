Severus decides to adopt harry and to give him a de-aging potion in order to give him time to recuperate and have a true childhood before he has to go to hogwarts. they are friends with both the malfoys and dumbledore group. Severus and Harry, now named Alex Snape, buy an house in hosmegade and severus stop teaching to be a parent to harry.
