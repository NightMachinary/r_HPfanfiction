Where Harry has a sibling/ twin, but Harry is still the BWL. His parents are alive and because of the wizarding world, he is the center of attention. Public appearances, autographs, private tutors (starting at 8 with a year-by-year plot with assassins and other incompetent, disaster attracting tutors). He feels trapped by his fame because his friends are picked for him, he can't spend real time with his family, and his twin and younger sister resent him for taking their parent's attention away from them.


** hmm, don't know any but would definitely read. Better than all the 'my brother is the WBWL and everybody ignores me except for my little sister (insert plant name)'

*** "Is James Jr being mean again, big brother?"

"You know he is, you're the only one I can trust."

"I love you big brother."

"I love you too, Shrubbery."
