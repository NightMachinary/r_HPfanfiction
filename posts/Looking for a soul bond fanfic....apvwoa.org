between harry and ginny, where their minds are completely open and they cant block out that many thoughts. They at first get super annoyed because they cant hide a single thought but then learn to be completely open with each other. I know its specific, but if you could help me out that would be great (ive already read the amplitude frequency and resistance of a soul bond)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/][The Bonds of Blood]] might be a good fit.

Harry makes a mistake while trying to save Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. Afterwards the two of them are bonded so closely that they share thoughts without wanting to and can barely stand to go a few minutes without touching. They struggle to adapt to the loss of privacy and the way it changes their lives in the coming months. linkffn(5435295)

**** I see, but I read part of it and in this they can hide their thoughts if they choose to so I'm not really sure if it's what I'm looking for

*** Sort of but from what I've read so far they aren't really mad at each other and they can close the bond when they need to. They accept the bond wholly. I know I'm being picky lol

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** What I'm describing would probably be the most accurate description of how something like that would go, if someone else had access to your mind 24/7 then you'd be pissed off to hell but then eventually love them if you have a bond like Harry and ginny
