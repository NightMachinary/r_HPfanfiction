The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] is a well known series of AU novels where the central character is a midwestern American girl growing up in a situation that at first seems like a stereotypical !FemHarry fic, but quickly turns into something else entirely. Alexandra is probably one of the most flawed protagonists in a long form series that I have ever read, but the world building is top tier and feels so familiar to any season HP fan without falling into the usual "What is magic, really" trope.

Because it is set in America, the characters are ALL new, consistent, and fleshed out. The series takes place post-DH, so while there are some references to Death eaters or Voldemort, they aren't plot relevant, just window dressing to remind us what world this has been written into. But because of all of the native american lore, and the totally different political structure of Magical USA viz Magical Europe, it barely feels like FANfiction, just fiction.

I realize that there will be a lot of "why is she so stubborn and troublesome?" for first time readers, but I can assure you, the reasons are well fleshed out as the series progresses. On top of that, while the series is incomplete, the author has finished book 5 and has been releasing chapters twice a week. So far, it is his best work. If you had read the first two stories, I recommend coming back and catching up, because you will not regret it.


** I keep seeing this series recommended, and I keep wanting to read it (it's even open right now in one of my billion open tabs), but... I dunno. I have a lot of trouble getting into fics that don't feature Harry and co.

** I tried it, it wasn't very good. The only likeable character is the villain who gets killed off. The plot is pretty boring and then just gets bizarre with the whole underworld dimension garbage. I put it down when I lost all semblance of any suspension of disbelief. It really shouldn't even be considered fanfiction with how little it shares with canon.

** Can you give me more info about the series? Like, what genre would you describe it? How does it tackle mature themes? How does it handle romance, if at all? What's the magic system like? That kind of thing. I've heard that it's good, but I'm a bit cautious about getting into long, unfinished fics... especially series-long ones.

*** I would definitely categorize it as a general fic, but it does have some really strong mystery elements to it, as nobody seems to want to talk about something or another and those secrets inevitably lead to disastrous consequences when revealed or revealed too late.

The story starts as the HP series did, at 11-12 years old for the main cast, so romance is a non factor until the 3rd book and even then there isn't anything really serious until the 4th book. There are some conversations about sex but no actual sex. There's been a sex scene in the 5th book but it's not smut not explicit but it is clear that the two characters had sex and it has consequences.

The magic system is just like in canon, though there are many more naturalistic elements tacked on due to Native American themes. There's also a subgenre of magic called doggerel verse where someone can try to cast a one time spell based on intent using a novel rhyme and it may or may not work.

While it is unfinished as a series, the author is still active and is still writing, so there's some pretty good emotional payoff over the long term. This won't make you feel any worse than say, ASOIAF does since book 5 is currently done and is being released serially.

You may or may not like this, but the main character is not a Mary Sue (google this term and TV tropes if you're not familiar with the term). Bad things happen to her and the people she cares about and they're her fault due to her own flaws. In fact, in some respects, she is almost too flawed for a protagonist but she shows some pretty clear character development over time, but the author does pretty consistently point out that even when she's learning to be better, she still has hard instincts to do the wrong thing.

** I don't really know why, I cannot appreciate the story, I read the two first Books, but I dunno I can't bother to read the rest, It's really well written (especially the end of Book 1 where The vilain uses Modern fire arm because magic doesn't work in this situation instead of looking lost like all wizards when they lose their wand in a fight) , again I cannot really explain I just find it "Meh".
