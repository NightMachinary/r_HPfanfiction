How do you guys think people would feel to be teased with one ship but the real ship is with someone else?


** Are you... are you seriously considering /intentionally pissing off shippers/, and then asking */HOW WELL THAT WOULD GO?/*

...you fool. I weep for you in advance.

*** I read a story once that was tagged with a Charlie/Hermione romance. In the very last chapter, the author played us as it ended with Snape/Hermione. The reviews left on that story after it was finished was...unkind to say the very least.

** Don't advertise it as such, or you'll piss off just about everyone that came for it. The tags are there to advertise the ship(if selecting them together).

I remember reading one story a long long time ago where the author had tagged the story one way, but like half way through it was switched to someone else with no warning. They deleted the story from how much shit they were getting.

** if you actively advertise it as one ship and end it with another, you will earn yourself a permanent enemy in the form of me. though i wouldn't cause much problem cause i'm not motivated enough to do anything about it. but you can be damn sure i'll give your username the stinky eye whenever when i see it

but if you "tease" a ship wtihout specifying that's ok

in the end it's about trying to decieve people. actually lying to people isn't ok, but nothing wrong with pulling a little sneaky on us

** Depends how well you pull it off.

Ideally, the "real ship" would develop organically, with the chemistry between the characters being so evident that the readers would be calling for those characters to get together instead of the listed pairing.

In that case, I think it could go well.

But if you just do a bait and switch out of nowhere, I can't see it ending well.

Edit: also, if one of the ships is het and the other is slash, there is no universe in which the outcome is positive.

** Don't do false advertising. Misleading hints is fine as long as the true ship is well written and it fits the story, like for example the first partner dying to a death eater attack and the main character getting helped to overcome their depression by the later true ship partner.

** If you pull it completely within the story, it's fine. I mean I would hate your guts for it for wasting my time and likely drop it, but it's not necessarily bad writing (certainly gonna be hard to pull off tho, you really need to seed it through the whole fic).

If you actively publicize the fic as having a certain ship outside the narration (like author notes, summary etc) and you change it in any way shape or form after posting chapter 1 you deserve every little drop of the tsunami of shit that will come your way from all the shippers who read it.

** Its been done before, but generally, folks don't remember or realize it because the author vanishes (either intentionally or because folks no longer read/recommend their stuff) due to the overwhelming amount of hate and anger from readers who feel lied to.

Although often its less intentionally done and more that the author simply has a change of heart during the story and changes the ship. The problem is, many people read a story based upon the ship and the ship alone so that's bound to be a problem, and even if they don't read based upon ship alone if it goes from a ship they are ok with to a ship they despise... its really no better.

Regardless... bad idea. It's not ok in any sense to lie about a ship (intentionally or not) just to try and create a plot twist. If you are not sure about a ship or want to leave it up in the air, then you simply don't list or tag a ship until you are ready to declare one.

** This is workable in FFN since you can list 3 characters without flagging pairings either way -- this is depressingly common even when there is no good reason for it. Ao3 has a different policy on ship tags, making it much harder to do properly there without spoiling things.

Personally, I find that while ship "feints" is definitely a thing, I'm not sure if I'd be happy with reading it. /Especially/ if I happen to prefer the "failed" ship, and at that point I'd probably just stop reading.

While it wasn't a "fakeout" per se -- it was an open secret -- I preferred the HGRL outcome in linkffn(Debt of Time) even if it has a HGSB endgame. The reason is simple: the only reason HGRL failed was lack of free will and soulbond/mate shenanigans -- the chemistry was clearly there and the main ship felt very forced. This fic shows exactly what I dislike about common soulbond fics, even if it isn't the worst offense (that would go to a fic with a similar relationship setup except the non-bonded ends up with an unrequited love instead of just moving on with someone else).

Now I'm assuming this is about intentionally pretending to ship one way while actually having another as endgame. Temporary misleading flings -- a "romantic false lead" -- is different; I've seen these on occasion as distraction from the main ship but where it's obvious where things are truly heading, and unless it goes on for too long, I don't mind it much.
