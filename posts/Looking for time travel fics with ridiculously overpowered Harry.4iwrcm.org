  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

**** Urgggh. This looks so interesting but I really, really, /really/ +hate+ dislike harem fics.

Is the harem aspect of it central to the story? Is it well-developed at the very least? Or does Harry just become this oh-so-cool hero that all the girls can't possibly help but +lust after+ fall for?

Also, who is he paired with exactly? Aside from Fleur and Hermione, I mean.

***** There are actually no pairings yet. As of the current chapter, Granger and Delacour are only MCs. Really slow updates and the author gets information dump happy sometimes.

Also she and Plums should really learn to chop their paragraphs; Plums is co-authoring it.

One word: archmagus. Oh, and a great scene where Moody says they're like sons to him (bless their violent little hearts). If you decide to try it /despite/ the slash, be warned the prologue is explicit (just skip to the first scene break), but then there's almost nothing else till the very end.
