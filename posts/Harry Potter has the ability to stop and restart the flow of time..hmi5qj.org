Whether it's from a magic stopwatch, or awakening the power of [[https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/The_World][The World]], or however else he might've gained this ability.


** "You have been taught how to duel-" Voldemort was interrupted by a shout that would echo in the nightmares of the survivors for years:

"ROAD ROLLER DA!"

** I once read a crossover that had Harry as Jotaro Kujo post Part 3 and therefore after Star Platinum started stopping time. Aside from an introduction chapter however, there wasn't any content. Though there was a noted resistance on the part of Stands to most spells with SP blocking numerous curses ranging from Blasting to the Cruciatus and shrugging off stunners Hagrid style.

** The Dark Lord laughed, a sound that had little to do with how human beings usually expressed joy, then asked: "But you /do/ know how to duel don't you? First, we bow." and used his wand to force his young enemy to curl his spine and show his /respect/

Harry, however was quite beyond scared at this point. He was baffled. The prophecy was true and everything he had been told to prepare for, had been leading up to this moment. Voldemort alive, Harry surrounded by enemies on all sides. No one he cared about, except Cedric's corpse was anywhere close to this battleground. All the training, hiding and biding his time had been to hide the true nature of his Mother's protection. All the sacrifices made to give him the time he needed.

Harry's head snapped up, his eyes glowing with faint embers of green light and spoke the two words that revealed how badly he outclassed normal wizards.

His voice rung out across the graveyard, loud and true like a silver trumpet forged in the furnaces of Elysium: "ANIMA MUNDI!!"

The green embers exploded out of Harry's eyes, becoming a swirling firestorm of green flames and smoke. The smoke coalesced around and over Harry's body, taking a vaguely female humanoid shape. The smoldering apparition gave a hellish shriek, so loud it reverberated across the planes of spacetime and ordered it to stop.

Harry took a deep breath, first in, then out. He had never had to control this large an area before and felt a bit tired, but it appeared to have worked. Voldemort and all his death eaters were moving so slowly, they might as well be frozen.

Harry calmly inspected the bright green embers that crawled across his skin and the billowing dark green smoke that seemed to pour out of his sleeves, but decided he had more important work to do than worry about his appearences.

He took a camouflage-pattern duffle bag out of his mokeskin pouch and pulled out a long leather scroll full of tools, mostly big and heavy butcher's knives. He picked up a skinny carving knife and chucked it at Voldemort, as hard as he could. It was kind of funny to see the knife slow down until it too stood still in the timeless air, right in front of Voldemort's eyeball. "one." His boyish voice somewhat ruining the dark tension of the scene.

Harry saw the recently resurrected snakeface's other eye twitch and swivel to his position. Harry pulled out a second knife. Voldemort's eyes kept moving rapidly, probably in panic, but the rest of his body seemed not to obey him.

Harry looked upon his trapped enemy, completely at his mercy. He didn't want to do it this way, but Dumbledore had told him of the danger Voldemort posed and of the power his mother had managed to bind to his soul. A small part of him felt regret, felt that Voldemort was as trapped now, as Harry had been with the dursley's.

Harry sighed, steeled himself, chucked his carving knife at Voldemort and watched it slow to a crawl next to the first knife.

"Two." he spoke, and continued his bloody work

** Sadly if there was a Part 4 tie in it hasn't happened (again, into chapter with just Jotaro Potter and semi-senile Joseph with a Pol-Pol cameo on the JOJO side of things). Definitely a great idea though.
