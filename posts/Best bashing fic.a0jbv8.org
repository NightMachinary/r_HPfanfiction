I dont think I've ever seen a bashing fic I genuinely enjoyed( unless it was meant to be like a silly fic). So I was curious if there was a character bashing fic out there that I could like.

In bashing fics I don't like the negative traits of the character being bashed on get so exaggerated that i cant see it as the original character. I guess i want the callouts to feel more deserved so the characters in story should still be relatively in character.

Many bashing stories revolve around nothing but bashing. Like the plot isnt driven by anything else than making certain people look bad and that can get boring. So I do want a actual plot unrelated to bashing.

Any character can be bashed on as long as they aren't antagonists or seen as antagonistic in canon.

So can't be Voldemort, the Death Eaters, the Malfoys, Umbridge( i mean you can still call her out but the character being bashed cant be her), the Durseleys, Snape, or the Marauders (because I've seen it a lot).

Anyone else is fair game.


** There's a hilarious one-shot where Snape bashes all the Slytherin students during careers advice. Unfortunately I forgot its name.

** The reclamation of Black Magic by Shayalonnie has some lovely Dumbledore bashing, but it isn't the main premise of the story. Plus, who doesn't love Shayalonnie and literally everything they wrote?

** I don't think there is. Unless it's a comedic story, then bashing is by definition a poor addition as far as the quality of the story is concerned. If you enjoy bashing, the story might be enjoyable, but that's it. It's never going to add to the quality of a non-comedic/satire.

** Can there be good non-parody bashing? To me, bashing is when a character is portrayed /unfairly/ negative, which to me is /never/ a good thing.

Now, a fic that bashes someone isn't automatically bad, but the bashing itself is to me always a flaw.

*** Hmmm that's a fair point I guess its not so much trying to see if bashing can be good but trying to see if I can like a fic that has bashing.

*** To me, bashing is when a character is reduced to negative flaws to the extent that they don't act like a real human being. So, just for example, Umbridge in the original books is a "bashed" character because she's made up entirely of negative traits with not a single instance of her not being horrible and unlikeable to the people around her.

I agree with you that bashing is a flaw in the writing in fanfiction. But I can tolerate bashing if other parts of the fic are exemplary.

**** Yep, the "unfairness" is just a matter of opinion. You brought up a good example with Umbridge, who is definitely bashed and it's impossible to tell whether that's unfair or not (since everything we see from her is ridiculously negative).

When I read a Ron bashing fic I can recognize that it is bashing without considering the portrayal to be unfair.

*** It could be done, but 95% of the WBL stories have the Potters are some monstrous figures and a lot of fanfic has Albus as some evil figure out to ruin people's lives on purpose or there are even the occasional fics with Snape, who I strongly dislike, as a pedo which seems like bashing.

TLDR: I think most readers can tell the difference between criticism of characters that are written in non-canon ways, and bashing.

** Your mileage will probably vary on any recomendations. Readers are often willing to overlook bashing if they like the ship or plot in the fic, but those same fics might be example of bad bashing in your view if you don't share the same tastes.

For example, I enjoy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] even though it has some really blatant Dumbledore and Ron bashing. To me, the plot and the world building about wizarding culture and secrets of the first war are good enough to make up for the flaws. But the same fic probably is terrible for people who dislike AUs in which the Death Eaters aren't evil.

*** Honestly, I kinda disagree. This is one of my absolute favorite fics, mainly because of how it has a Dumbledore who royally fucks with Harry, but isn't really evil, just ruthlessly committed to winning the war. It's a realistic portrayal of the "Manipulative old goat" trope, that doesn't have mustache-twirling scenes of internal thought processes where he reveals how much he loves to abuse children, or something. Seriously, it's one of the only good "manipulative Dumbledore" fics I've seen which sticks to canon plot (up until 4th year at least).

** Bashing often only works if it's done in a humorous way, imo. I think it's pretty easy to bash the death eaters though as 99% of them are only negative, so any criticism may come off as bashing.
