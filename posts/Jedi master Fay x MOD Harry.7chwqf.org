Something along the lines of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12406605/1/Ageless-Stars]]

I'd take anything that has MOD Harry x Immortal character from any movie/anime/book etc, but I'm mainly looking for the Fay pairing. No slash or femHarry.

P.S.: No Hermione please. I don't want her magically immortal or her soul in some other verse. The less I see her the better. I stopped looking for new non crossover HP fics because she's god damn everywhere.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

*** That's a great story but it's a harem and I'm not even sure Fay is in the pairing.

**** She turns up in the latest few chapters. I'm moderately sure Harry will boink her in a couple of years.

***** Meh thanks but I'm up to date with that and I'm more looking for Harry pairing up with other immortals, harem is great as long as all of them are old and immortal themselves.
