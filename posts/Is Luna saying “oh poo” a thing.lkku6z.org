I've seen this in a few fics now and I absolutely hate it. It just weirds me out, plus it makes her sound like a three year old... Is this some kind of trope that I didn't know about? Because honestly just stop.

** I think it's a poor attempt to make Luna seem innocent, as in "'poo' is the worst swear word she can say".

At least, that's what it started out as. After a while I think it may have actually become an in-joke/meme.

*** Fanfic writers need to go the opposite way and make her like freaking FF7 Remake Aerith!!! She's sweet and kind but also has a spunky side! Let Luna say "SHIT" in the Department of Mysteries! :) She doesn't have to be an airhead all the time!

** IIRC It's one of those things that started in one of fics posted by one of the bigger writers (I don't want to put the blame in Rorschach's Blot, even though I'm pretty certain it originated with Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!) on the Caer Azkaban group and got tread everywhere by the hivemind.
