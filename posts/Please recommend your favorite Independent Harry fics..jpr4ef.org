  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

** Here's what I have:

- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442][Forced Maturity]] by pseudonym. A Peggy Sue where Harry retains associated feelings in regards to other people from the future, but not specific memories. Great concept imo, but it gets into some slightly weird things with Age Lines. Harry/Ginny, not for everyone.
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24360067][Lotus]] by Araceil). A Final Fantasy VII crossover where Harry is reincarnated as Aerith's twin brother. He's the precocious kid with a knack for magic and doesn't take $#!+ from anyone. A slash fic from a writer who is notorious for leaving WIPs in favour of something new.
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]] by shadowscribe). After getting AK'd in the Forbidden Forest, Harry instead decides to grab the mangled baby in the Kings Cross void, with the intent to care for it. The result is a Harry looking to be his own person, undefined from his parents, and not dictated by the title Boy-Who-Lived. Also, he's 11 again. Slash, Harry/Tom. /Personal Recommendation./
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19214098][Harry Potter and the Little Yellow Book]] by BrightSkywalker). Pre-Hogwarts. Inspired by reading a little yellow book titled 'Matilda,' Harry begins to experiment and discover his powers.
- [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] by Viridian. THE classic Harry goes to the past to save his friends story. Harry/Ginny. /Personal Recommendation./
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905][Messing With Time]] by slythernim). Harry wakes up five years old again, says 'eff this' to everything, and proceeds to break a mind-addled Sirius out of Azkaban.
- Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] by Sarah1281). Another classic Peggy Sue, only it's a lot like Messing With Time in that it has a far more comedic style.
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/416617][Parsel]] by PadfoorIsMyHomeDawg). Harry is raised as a snake, by snakes, and I don't mean slytherins. He's a snake animagus, and as such is independent in the wild, but when he reintegrates with society, not so much. Pre-Harry/Hermione
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/495672][The Perils of Innocence]] by avidbeader). After the Dursley's drop Harry of at an orphanage, said orphanage discovers Harry's accidental magic and attempts to study and foster it. Eventually, Hermione and Dean are also there except on holidays/weekends. McGonagall doesn't know what she's walking into during Muggleborn initiation. Not strictly an independent Harry, but an independent team. /Personal Recommendation./
- Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] by Paimpont). Harry tries to solve a mystery that only he notices is actually there because no one even remembers Sally-Anne. /Personal Recommendation./
- Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7353028][The Very Best]] by BrilliantLady). Pokemon fanatic Harry uses magic to create the critters he's seen on TV.
- Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/Three-s-The-Charm][Three's the Charm]] by MissCHSparkles). Another Peggy Sue, only it's Harry, Ron, and Hermione. An independent team, rather than independent Harry. But they wreak havoc on Hogwarts, and it's great. Ron/Hermione.
- Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13169380/1/Time-and-Again][Time and Again]] by Angler11235). Harry gets isekai'd into an alternate dimension where he becomes the DADA teacher of his younger, female self.
- Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]] by Oracle2Phoenix). Like 'Three's the Charm,' but the Golden Trio are on a time crunch, they have an infant Rose to care for after all, and need to get back to their established families. But first, they have to deal with Voldemort. Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

** I'm a bit fuzzy on what people mean by Independent Harry. Does it mean he runs away and raises himself, or just becomes self-sufficient with or without the Dursleys? Or does it refer to a Harry who joins neither Dumbledore or Voldemort?

Self-sufficient Harry stories include The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter, A Lonely Path by la baguette, and Harry Potter and the Hidden Kingdom (in progress) by QuibbleMeThis linkffn(11933512; 5411398; 12534241)

He's also forced into being on his own to escape Dumbledore (after being raised by Snape and Remus) in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants series]] by Endrina. First story is The Meaning of Mistletoe linkao3(9323225)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Linkao3(life skills outside the curriculum) is one of my faves. Harry runs away before he can get his letter and uses instinctive ritualistic magic.

In a similar vein is linkao3(Hermione Granger's Crammer School for Delinquents on the Run) wherein Harry doesn't get his letter so Voldemort gets his claws further in. Story picks up after Dumbledore's death, I think

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
