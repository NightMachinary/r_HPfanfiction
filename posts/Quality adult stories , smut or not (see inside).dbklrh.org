I'm looking for good stories which touch adult levels and topics, smut is fun and do not mind and can enjoy also.

My only requests are No slash, decent length/complete or good update. I enjoy smut, but not all stories have to be smut. But looking for ones which touch adult topics, graphic sex or not.


** Are you looking for ones that are set when they're older teens/adults, or are ones where they're still young but it's more mature fine? Also, are you looking for anything, or just serious ones? Like, would comedies be fine?

*** Any age is good, and comedies are good. i like comedy, and honestly some of the best comedies have good drama and stories. ( if you ever seen scrubs that show would rip my heart out and be so serious a few times a season)

**** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor; A Black Comedy) linkao3(A Marauder's Plan)

All complete, the first two are comedies. SoG is a smutty humor fic, ABC has some sexual content and crude humor. They don't touch too much on mature themes but are definitely adult. AMP is fairly serious and has the adults doing more of the legwork. It has more mature themes, dealing with abuse, loss/grief, and sacrifice. It also goes more in depth about politics and some magic than canon.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

** Blindness, linkffn(10937871), is a really good complete story. Its also on the darker side of fanfiction and touches more adult topics. There is no graphic sex, at least I don't believe so. They might have been a scene that I just skipped over, but I have no recollection at the moment.

What about Marry You, linkffn( 12357903), a Harry and Daphne fic that I thought was done amazingly well. It also touches upon adult topics, more of the relationship kind.

****** Lol, I am the same in a lot of ways. I certainly spend more than 2 hours reading for pleasure. Though I just tend to be a slow reader and enjoy immersing myself into the fic. Well, I hope you enjoy the story and feel free to message me if you what to be pointed in the direction of another story.

  Harry and Daphne find themseves trapped in a hasty marriage after a drunken night, and there is no way out. How will they cope with that? Warnings: underage drinking, probably a lemon or two, and Weasley bashing. Also, English is not my first language, so be prepared for strange language quirks or don't read. Chapter 3 partly rewritten.
