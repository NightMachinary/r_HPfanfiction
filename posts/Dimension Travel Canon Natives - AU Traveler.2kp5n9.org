I've been reading a bunch of peggy sue and dimension hopping fics where variations of the canon characters wind up elsewhere or elsewhen... but are there any recommended fics where the the canon universe/time is the one that ends up with a visitor?

Example: Harry Potter suddenly appears in the great hall, Hermione tries to ask him how he apparated in Hogwarts and he responds with something akin to "What are you on about now Granger? Ungh... Has anyone seen my mum, I think need a headache potion," before passing out in his non-Gryfindor robes.

As I type this out, I think I remember reading one where a DADA Professor Riddle shows up...

<edit> I should probably specify that I'm looking for more of a 'visitor is baffled by their predicament and confused by the differences as they explore the canon world' as opposed to a 'visitor immediately fixes everything'


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] is the fic you mentioned where Professor Riddle *journies to the canon universe.

I can't, off of the top of my head, think of any more where X joins Canon without it being a time travel, or a dimension hopping like chapter 17 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]]

Actually, I can: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/20/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power][HP and the Elemental's Power]] chapter 20, which I've linked to, onwards for a couple of chapters.

** I've just started reading it, so I'm not sure if it continues in this vein or not, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] definitely has that "visitor is baffled by their predicament and confused by the differences as they explore the canon world" vibe.

*** But in this case, the visitor is not a character of the HP-verse. I think he's from D&D universe, or something similar.

***** I started that but I kind of dropped it because it didn't quite seem up my alley.

Do you mind explaining why you think it's amazing?

****** 1. D&D wizard character operating by D&D rules attempting to survive in HP world that operates by HP rules. If you know D&D ruleset - that is already somewhat of a challenge because in D&D wizards get a limited number of specific spells which they can acquire by means mostly not available in HP world. More importantly they are much more limited in use of these spells compared to wizards of HP. In D&D they need to select these spells ahead of time, planning out possible needs for next day, and are than limited in both types of spells and the number of casts they have chosen to prepare. So much weaker overall compared to HP wizards that are only limited by their knowledge and skill. On top of that, MC must not only fit in and be competitive (story is pretty action heavy), but also hide his abnormality from school officials and authority as much as possible.

2. MC in this case did not just step over from a D&D setting - he is in fact an agglomeration of a D&D player character (in terms of his abilities/limitations) and a pretty common mindset of D&D players. So there is a pretty interesting and often funny interpretation of one world with a bent (but not broken) fourth wall. As the story develops the differences and limitations of that mindset are made fun off, explored and slowly evolved. So not only does the story feature/examine and makes fun of a lot of tropes of the game itself and those who play it - there is also a gradual but somewhat deep character development of an original character. That's quite rare in this fandom.

3. Above mentioned mindset is hellbent on exploitation of an absolute ruleset of D&D game in order to achieve whatever goals it needs to. Often in imaginative and amusing ways.

4. The story itself is pretty good in pacing and has a very nice mix of action/humor/relationships (not yet big on romantic side). That's again rare in this fandom where most stories choose to focus on only one of these aspects.

Harry and Hermione travel to a different universe on accident during the war. Very angsty, PTSD, but awesome. Good!Snape. Sirius as a DADA-teacher. LilyxRemus. James is kind of ignored.
