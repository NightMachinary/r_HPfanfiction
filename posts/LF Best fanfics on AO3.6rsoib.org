I have read many fanfics in ffn and there are almost no good fanfics to read there.

I would like to recommend some fanfics that you liked a lot in AO3, but please without slash and if it is possible no Ron as friend of Harry... i dislike that character. Everything else does not matter as long as it is good.

I recommend this linkao3(11278611), is a fanfic of naruto but still good, and in the next chapters will jump to the universe of HP to make a festival of blood and sex.


** I was with you until you gave /that/ as an example of a good fic.

Now it feels really weird to recommend linkao3(189189)

*** There certainly are good fics where Ron and Harry aren't friends (Prince of Slytherin, Again and Again), but I definitely agree that I far prefer to read fics that treat Ron well rather than devolving into bashing.

**** Uff, bashing the character actively becomes annoying, but simply treat like any other secondary character and fade into the story is the best... something like Seamus or Dean.

I do not see him as someone who would want to be friends, and enduring his character for the sake of history is annoying. I think I read a single Ron that I liked and it was very OCC.

  At the peak of the Fourth Shinobi World War Kaguya Otutsuki successfully kills everyone but Naruto. Without Sasuke, Naruto is unable to stop the ancient goddess and she completes her plan, forever casting the world into an illusion. However, before Kaguya Otutsuki rules supreme as a Goddess, she watched as the sheer hatred and grief possessed by Naruto converges inwardly and peaks. Yami Naruto is revived and he is clearly not happy.The Dark Persona of the Child of Prophecy has nothing to lose and everything to gain, and throw in dimensional jutsu to the mix and the multiverse will never be the same.Expect sex, raunchiness, outright insanity, and everything from wet stockings to biker shorts.Massive Crossover with numerous worlds. Yami!Naruto, Sharingan!Naruto, Rinnegan!Naruto, Godlike!Naruto, shenanigans and of course, did I mention sex?
