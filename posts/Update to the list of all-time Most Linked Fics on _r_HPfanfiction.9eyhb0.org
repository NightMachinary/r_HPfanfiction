My list of most linked fics from this sub has finally been updated!

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw]]

There's two new sheets: one that has the all-time linked fics from 2011-2018, and one that has just the fics linked in 2018. The all-time list didn't change much, but the 2018 list has some new fics if you're looking for something new to read. I colored the Publish column so newer fics are orange and older fics are blue.

** I think it's funny that Applied Cultural Anthology got 10 more recs than On the Way to Greatness. Both are the top Slytherin!main character fics and both are tragically abandoned/very slow to update depending on how optimistic you are.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** I like Starfox5 fics because:

- Always original plot and almost no canon rehashes
- Central themes: major reform or overthrow of that failed state known as the British Ministry of Magic.
- Intelligent, pragmatic, rational, and ruthless protagonists.
- Hardline militant approach against those sadistic genocidal maniacs known as the Death Eaters.
- Very positive portrayals of Ron, Ginny, and Dumbledore, even in his H/Hr fics. In fact, Ron, not Harry or Hermione, was the most sympathetic and heroic character in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]].
- Extremely dangerous Voldemort, who generally acts patiently, rationally, and with great subtlety, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]].
- Excellent combat scenes and tactical depictions, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] has one of the best final battles among all fanfics I've read. Voldemort's tactical genius against overwhelming enemy odds was done brilliantly.
- Great political intrigues and maneuverings by various characters, among them Dumbledore, Lucius Malfoy, Pius Thickeness, and Sirius Black.
- Extensive and consistent world building, especially Magical France, Germany, and Jamaica(!).
- Interesting and often positive portrayals of Aberforth, Fudge, Lavender, Lockhart, Pansy, Sirius, and Victor Krum. Petunia and Grindelwald are new additions to this group.
- Awesome Luna without going the seer or psychopath route.
- No Draco and Snape apologies, Lucius Malfoy is always killed off.
- Finally, the quality and tone of his fics is improving, as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Lady Thief]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][the Grindelwald 'Redemption' Story]] show.

Hermione is actually not the most sympathetic character in his stories, BAMF yes, brilliant and scary yes, but not the most likable for sure.

"Patron" is my least favorite of his stories. Beside a very depressing AU, there are just too many different POVs, and some story arcs, like that Auror pair, are really redundant. I haven't recommended this one much, and I'm honestly surprised it's still hanging onto #9 spot.

***** Interesting. It's probably still my favourite of his stories and for pretty much the reasons you don't like it. I've certainly helped push it up the charts!

For me it's the sheer breadth and scope of the story that makes it brilliant: the AU is original, realistic and compelling; the OCs are all distinct, well-rounded and interesting; the range of locations and settings is incredible... it's just god everything!

*** Yes, I just count up all the links in every post and comment in this subreddit. For example, rank 94 on the all time list is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822]].

Links to FFN are just much more common, so they dominate the rankings. Just for fun, here's the top 5 links from all time that go to sites other than FFN. You'll have to click on them to see each fic, though, because I don't have a script that parses the info from other sites.

| Rank | Count | URL                                                |
|------+-------+----------------------------------------------------|

| 235  | 73    | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072]]       |

| 305  | 61    | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561]]      |

Edit: Turns out I had a bug in my code. For FFN and AO3, I removed trailing text in the URLs to make sure I don't miscount things, e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1234567/the-title]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1234567]] would be considered links to the same fic. For [[https://tthfanfic.org][tthfanfic.org]] I hadn't bothered since they were so rare. But for the top fic, Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, adding this feature boosted its rank from 94 to 28!
