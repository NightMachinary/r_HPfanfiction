#+TITLE: I've just finished By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song by Enembee and An Unfound Door by Joe6991. I've already read the Denarian crossover series. Any similar recommendations?

** I've also read HP and the Witch Queen and I've bookmarked Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe for my next read, but I feel like I need to flesh out my alternate/ancient magic group of fics.

** The best recommendation I could give you would be enembee in general, but you're probably working your way through his other pieces as we speak. To stand in as Anarchy's foil of optimism, I'll endorse the following:

linkffn(Sitra Ahra)

linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin) and its unfortunately abandoned sequel

linkffn(Hallowed)

If you're looking for ancient, strange and exciting magic alongside the well-written interactions that are characteristic of enembee's stories, these are what first come to mind.

EDIT: Would have also listed Newcomb's linkffn(What You Leave Behind), but you might have come across that already.
