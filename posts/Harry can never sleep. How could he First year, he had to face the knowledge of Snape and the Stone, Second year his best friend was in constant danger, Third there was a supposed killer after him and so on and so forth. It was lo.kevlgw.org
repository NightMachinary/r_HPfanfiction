#+TITLE: Harry can never sleep. How could he? First year, he had to face the knowledge of Snape and the Stone, Second year his best friend was in constant danger, Third there was a supposed killer after him and so on and so forth. It was lonely though... So thank good for the insomniac Slytherin Lily Moon!
