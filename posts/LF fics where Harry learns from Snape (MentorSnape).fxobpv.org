Especially where Harry is competent but not stilted/overly formal or 'badass' and Snape is not hugely OOC. Prefer minimal romance in general. Don't care if he teaches him legillemency or potions or is just a mentor figure. This doesn't need to be 100% of the fic, just a noticeable component.

I liked Harry Potter and the Pureblood Pretense, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (though this is an example of stilted, 'badass' Harry), and Harry Potter and the Enemy from Within


** linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) is one I enjoyed a lot!

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

This is a more lighthearted Mentor!Snape fic that serves as a mild parody of the WBWL genre and actually does a good job of showing how a version of Harry who was neglected and cast aside would turn out.

Snape is is still Snape, but his reasoning for mentoring Harry and their relationship is quite a bit better than most MentorSnape! fics. Harry is shown to be quite the clever and resourceful Slytherin, but is still recognizable.
