** Dumbledore stared at the skeletal man, whose piercing green eyes stared daggers at him. “The dark lord...Hadrian?” asked the headmaster.

“Sod off,” said the dark lord Hadrian. “I was busy braiding the intestines of muggles when you called me, and by the time I get back they're going to be all rotting and tangled.”

Dumbledore stared a little more, then reached inside the pocket of his voluminous neon yellow robes (Muggle dyes were wonderful). He pulled out two tins. He seemed to weigh them in his hand before dropping one back into his robe pocket. The other, he opened, and took out a lemon drop. “I need an extra strength one,” he confided, eyes twinkling.

“I've always wondered what you put in those,” the dark lord Hadrian admitted.

“My own special blend!” he replied cheerfully, popping one in his mouth and swallowing. “Powdered calming draught and dilute elephant tranquilizer. Does wonders for my digestive system.”

It was the dark lord Hadrian's turn to stare. “Where do you get dilute elephant tranquilizer?” he asked. His hand, which had been gripping a wand similar enough to Albus' own that the man had to pop another drop, fell to his side.

“Severus Snape is surprisingly good at getting it off of black market dealers. It's almost as if he has a shady background,” Dumbledore mused.

“Never liked him.”

“May I tell you a secret, my boy?”

Hesitantly, the dark lord Hadrian nodded.

“I never did either,” replied Dumbledore, and tipped he entire tin of lemon drops into his mouth.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
