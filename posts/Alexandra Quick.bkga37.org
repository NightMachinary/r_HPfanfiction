Because it needs to be recommended a lot more.

Lots of people hate it and will tell you how the main character is flawed, or that the fic has bland characterization as a whole, and lots, like me, will tell you it's the greatest fan fic ever written, and it's actually tragic just how much better it is than pretty much everything else.

Either way, you should make up your own mind if you haven't read it yet! Book five is about to come out (soon ^{TM} ); it's a 7-part series.

A couple of notes: It's not a fem-Harry fic. It just has a female protagonist. It's not set in Hogwarts. Or in Great Britain for that matter. Canon is mentioned in precisely 2 sentences(not compliant or non-compliant, just neutral), and that's it. So it's completely AU, except for the magic, which is slightly AU as well but still the same as Rowling's, it just builds on it.


** ive not read it so i cant talk on most of this but " Because it needs to be recommended a lot more." we literally have its sub on the sidebar

*** I've seen it in a recent comment on this sub, and it was a very upvoted opinion.

I'm just as baffled.

It's like Game Of Thrones The Long Night episode. I personally think it was a work of genius, the rest of the Internet seems to disagree.

There are just those things that really divide fandoms.

** I only dislike it because I'm here for Harry Potter fanfiction, not an almost entirely new book series.

*** It depends on how you look at it. For me, it's Rowling's magic system that defines what's great about this universe. I wish there were far more fics that tried to be original rather than a repetition of canon plots.

**** Have you read Miranda Flairgold's fics? That's another set that starts off with the canonical magic system, but then builds on it and aside from brief diversions to handle canonical events that are no longer major difficulties, has an entirely different plot and a threat that far eclipses that of Voldemort. It's interesting if you want something significantly different from Hogwarts, though it gets a bit silly sometimes making itself different.

** [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]] - still a very small subreddit, but a community re-read initiative and has done wonders for discussion, flairs have (hopefully) increased engagement, and we have actual rules now.

Disclosure: I am one of the three moderators.

  It's about a witch going to a magical school. It's similar to the original Harry Potter in that regard. We get to see some new kinds of spells, and she has a very smart familiar that is more involved in the plot than a mere owl. There's really no reason for me to spoiler you, though, just read the books and see if you like them. You should be able to see the quality of writing for yourself

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
