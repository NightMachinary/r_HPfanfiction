There's been these memes floating around about Slytherin being fiercely protective of Hufflepuff, and it ranges from tooth achingly sweet to funny. Are there any stories written with cannon characters that are in that vein? I've been searching, and it's been a lot of overpowered, one dimensional original characters.

Any pairing is fine, slash is fine.


** like every Slytherin is given there own Hufflepuff that just hugs them and takes care of them? because i would read the shit out of that.

**** Now that's a fun ship. Helga drags Salazar back to Hogwarts by the ear "now apologize!" She taps her foot looking at Godric and Salazar " shake hands, you're best friends for Merlins sake! "

Godric, and Salazar both look down and mumble "sorry"

"What was that I couldn't hear you?" Helga says sharply " SORRY! " they practically shout at each other

Rowena starts giggling behind them, Helga runs to her "shut it you!, You're next."
