We know in canon Dumbledore is manipulative. But if he was truly evil or working for the greater good, he would have killed Harry the minute he found out he was a Horcrux.

Give me your best prompts or best fics where Dumbledore is mad at Mrs. Figg for failing at her watch job.

Keep the discussion civil please.


** I don't know any but I'll just squeeze out a little scene this made me think of. In this little thing I'm portraying Mrs. Figg like the rest of the people Harry knows around Privet Drive, all she cares about is what other people would think and happily ignores the nasty things happening. Reading back through OOtP I noted that on the way back after the dementor attack, all she does is go on about “What Dumbledore's going to think” and “How much trouble this is going to cause” so maybe it isn't what you wanted but it's what my brain came up with.

Arabella Figg was happily sipping her tea when the fireplace flared green and none other than Albus Dumbledore himself stepped out. Half-way to standing, she looked at his face and finally registered his expression... Rage. She had never seen Dumbledore like this; you couldn't tell by just looking at him, in fact, if you didn't know him, his expression would be rather pleasant. But Arabella had known Albus for years and knew that his true emotion showed in his eyes. They weren't twinkling, they were *burning* in anger. In fact, if she tilted her head and squinted, she could have sworn they were actually /glowing/.

"Arabella, we need to talk." No greeting, this wasn't going to be a pleasant conversation at all.

"Of course, Albus. Whatever do you need? Tea?"

"I think I'll skip to tea if you /don't/ mind. Now, let's talk about Harry Potter, shall we?" Albus sat down, braced his arms on his knees and clasped his hands together; horrifying was the dichotomy between his pale, wrinkled hand to the blackened, withered appendage. It was poetic in a way, Dumbledore had a hand in the rise and fall of the Dark Lord Grindelwald, in another world, Dumbledore may have even been Grindelwald's Black Hand. But Arabella was only trying to distract herself from where the conversation would inevitably lead.

“What would you like to know?” Nervously, Arabella continued to sip at her luke-warm tea.

“What I would like to know is; during the whole time you have been posted here to watch over Harry Potter, how is it that you never noticed that he was being abused?” Albus leant forward, peering deeply in her eyes, eyes which she couldn't look away from.

“Abuse Albus! Whatever are you talking about?” Arabella's posture straightened, her leg crossed over the other, and her little finger stuck out just a bit further from her cup.

“I'm talking about the fact that Harry showed up his first year thin and tiny, I had just brushed it off as a late bloomer, but then other things started to appear. Staying over at Christmas, his deepest, most heart-felt desire for a family, second-hand clothes, the list goes on, and that was only his first year! Funnily enough, I was speaking to Arthur about the shenanigans children get up to and do you know what he told me?” Lightly trembling, Figg just shook her head.

“He told me of how his sons stole his flying car to pick up Harry from his home, but the important part? The important part is that they had to pull *bars* off his windows, pick-lock the door that had a /cat-flap­ to feed him through/ and gather his possessions that were locked away in his old bedroom, which, in-case you didn't know, was THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS!” Albus thundered the last and Arabella shrunk away from him, leaning into the back of the sofa.

“I-I-I didn't know! How was I supposed to know? Well I knew they didn't treat him well and I told you that! But how was I supposed to know what happened behind closed doors? I've never actually been *inside* their house, what with Petunia not deeming me the ‘right' sort to invite round. I was just the batty neighbour who would keep Harry miserable while they went trotting off on trips and such. I did the best I could; I did what you told me to! Watch Harry, don't say anything about magic to Harry, fit in and don't draw attention to yourself. What else did you want me to do?” Arabella had puffed up indignantly, not unlike one of her cats, by the end of her tirade. Albus looked at her shocked.

“You've become like them. Bitter and ignorant, ignoring what doesn't suit you and making excuses. I think we're finished here. I'll Floo you if I need you. Goodbye.” And just like that, pleasant looking Albus was back, no hint of his earlier anger, but Arabella knew better. His eyes were flat, that was the only way she could describe them, no depth of emotion when looking at her, like after a storm when the waves have settled, the surface calm; no way to tell if the waters underneath were turbulent or if they were as steady as they looked. The only way to tell would be to plunge in and face the consequences, but Arabella didn't like the consequences she might face and so she bid Dumbledore goodbye. And, once his robes had vanished through the fireplace, she promised herself that Petunia's reputation wouldn't be recoverable by the time she was done with her. All the things she had ignored before, the injustice she had performed towards Harry, one he didn't deserve, gnawing at her until all she could see were Harry's wide eyes staring at her when he was 7, asking her brokenly why his family didn't love him.

**** If I find a place in a story to put it I will, but I am completely fine with others using it or even changing it, it's completely up to them if they credit me. It was just a scene that came to me from lack of sleep at 4am

I mean if you have an account, then you should publish it as a one-shot.

****** I do have a ffn.net account but I'm totally happy for you publish this, it was your idea. I havn't updated a chapter in ages and with a day in the HPreddit I've noticed a bunch of things I want to change. I'm glad I'm only a few chapters in.
