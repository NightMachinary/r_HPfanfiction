I'm looking for recommendations for a fanfic which features a Dark!Ron. My only stipulations are that Hermione and Harry are not dark and that the story is primarily from Ron's perspective.

Thanks for your help!

*** An entire month later and I am finally up to date. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best work I have ever read. It is absolutely captivating! And oddly realistic for a story which deals with magical creatures, morality, and fate. I want to thank you for recommending me this story - I am blown away, even with 100 more chapters still waiting to be published.

  Ron knows what he's fighting for, even if no one else does. Now complete!

*** Brilliant! It's something that has been swirling around in my head for quite a while now too so I'm glad you're writing something along those lines. So many authors choose to focus on Harry and Hermione's opinions but Ron is such a complex character that has so much potential for fictional works.

Where will you be posting it and what's your username on said site? Just so I can stay updated.

**** I post on both Ao3 and FFN. DorianSS on FFN and SurbhitSri on Ao3.

Since you've been thinking on it. PM me with any ideas you may have. I'm pretty tired from giving an exam just now but will reply soon.

  The supposed Golden Trio are ripped from their already terrible lives in hiding, thrown back to a time when they must deal with betrayals, hardships and secrets once more. This time around, however, they've decided to take things into their own hands. The Wizarding World would never see this coming. Dark Harry, Ron and Hermione! Tomarry, Dramione, Luna/Ron, Blaise/Ginny, Wolfstar. AU
