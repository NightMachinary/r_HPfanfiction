I would love to read more Sirius fanfiction but most of the fics I have found are either a/ slash (well ... not really my thing, but if it is good written I can give it a go) or b/ Sirius' characterization is as follows: listens to Sex pistols, has tatoos, drinks, smokes, sleeping around. ... and that's it.

Are there Sirius fics where he doesn't fall in either of the two categories? I am OK with Sirius drinking and sleeping around, but I want to read more characteristics, more story behind it all.

Pairing is not important. Any suggestions?

Thank you :)


** First of all, you should immediately read linkffn(Blackpool by the divine comedian), easily the best Sirius fanfiction I've ever read. There's very faint slash in there but it's wonderful, and I can overlook Wolfstar because of just how well written it manages to be. It's just under 100k words but I easily breezed through it. Next, renascentia is splendid, linkffn(renascentia: from the ashes). It's such a great characteristion of both Sirius and Regulus, it's the first part of a series.

This one-shot is one I couldn't find recommended anywhere on here, but I found it a bit heart wrenching, linkffn(Lacuna by cupid-painted-blind). There's also an incomplete fanfiction of Sirius's time in Azkaban, that I found defied most of the stereotypes and tropes. Linkffn(the righteous side of hell by voicesoffcamera).

Anything by Izzythehut on AO3 is wonderful and the Black Sheep Dog series is said to be pretty good, but I haven't continued it since I started it, which I'm planning to do (very soon hopefully). Linkao3(in the black by Izzythehut). But from what I remember it's really good.

I don't know if it's your cup of tea, but there's an AU written before Order of the Phoenix's release, I think and it's a bit tropey at times but the Unbroken Universe which starts with linkffn(promises unbroken by robin), was my introduction to fanfiction, and I was absorbed from the get go. From what I remember it is pretty good, but not great later on in the series. Sirius is, however, nowhere near the your common fanon one. For school age Sirius, linkao3(9106972) is one of the best.

I'm sure I have more, and I'll send them once I can remember them.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

** I'f you're interested in some younger Sirius fics, I've written a few one-shots and a couple of longer stories set during his childhood. My works mainly centre around Sirius's relationship with his family. This one, It Started With a Wand, is my longest completed fic, based around him getting his first wand from Ollivander. I hope you enjoy :)

​

I'm also currently working on Circinus, an AU in which Walburga has Sirius freed from Azkaban in 1984 and plots to secure him a trial and reinstate him within the family. I'm only two chapters in so far but there will be much more Sirius content to come in the near future :)

** Sirius features heavily in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) and sequels; the premise is that he escaped from Azkaban several years early (using accidental magic while asleep), and since he didn't have the same motivation as before, rather than hunting down Peter, he checked on Harry and found him unhappy. Cue Harry running away with him, the Wizarding world hunting for them both, contacting old friends and enemies much earlier than canon, and immense amounts of worldbuilding for the Marauders' generation.

There's a second divergence, as well, that starts off insignificant but gradually becomes prominent in the sequels: the Malfoys had a second son.

** It's not technically Sirius-centric, but he's prominent enough and the fic has probably my favourite 'personal story arc' for Sirius in any fic. Essentially, Sirius gets out early and grabs Harry and they go on a walkabout, living all around the world. Starts a bit slowly, but it gets steadily better throughout the first book.

I mean, there's A Marauder's Plan by CatsareCool that's basically peak Sirius-takes-some-responsibility-Pureblood-Politics-Style as well. He's definitely not the characterisation you list above.

**** Sure. Glad you enjoyed it. And not really, no. There are a few, but they're mostly terrible or played for laughs (eg. Bad Week at the Wizengamot) or idiotic pureblood apologism where he sees the errors of his ways and basically turns into Lucius Malfoy. I haven't kept any of the latter or former, I'm afraid. But I'm quite new to the fandom, so perhaps there are more that I just don't know about - maybe make a Request thread on it?
