Fics that address or explore how Hogwarts and/or magical Britain have changed over the years.

Hogwarts was founded about AD 990. This is possibly shortly after the country of England formally came to be, to put things in context. This is a long time ago, which means several things.

Firstly, it means that Salazar Slytherin would not have recognized modern blood politics. While the exact nature of his disagreement with the rest of the founders is unclear so many years later, we can say with absolute confidence that it wasn't caused by Voldemort/Malfoy style blood purity. JK has said that blood purity came about as a consequence of the Statute of Secrecy, that originally it was almost a sort of civic pride to try and keep the magical world safe by mingling as little as possible with muggles. The thing is, the Statute wasn't erected until almost 1700, as a response to witch trials which didn't really get started until the late [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summis_desiderantes_affectibus][1400's]]. If Slytherin was looking down on muggleborn students, it wasn't because of blood purity as Draco Malfoy understood it.

A second major thing to note is that language changes over time. In particular, Modern English is a very young language, being only about 5 centuries old or thereabouts. Before that we had Middle English, and before that we had Old English, and this is possibly what the founders would have been speaking, in addition to things like Gaelic, Pictish, or various Celtic dialects (considering it is located in Scotland) and Latin. The thing to remember is, Old English is *not* 'Most Potente Potions' and 'prithee, whither dost thou wander', Old English is ' Her sƿutelað seo gecƿydrædnes ðe '. If our plucky protagonist finds a book written by the Founders, he isn't going to be able to read the damn thing without heavy duty translation magic or a few years of practice. If books are added to the Hogwarts library at a relatively constant rate each year, then half the library is going to be written in something the average schoolchild cannot read.

There are lots of other minor details, such as how Hogwarts would not have been built with flush toilets since those weren't invented until something like 1592, or how the Sorting Hat probably doesn't have specific instructions about protecting children's secrets since the concept of universal rights like the right to privacy is a modern notion.

Now, to be fair, it isn't uncommon for fics to touch on some of these issues. Fairly often authors will point out that the Chamber of Secrets opening up in the girl's bathroom is anachronistic, and it isn't too uncommon for the language problem to be addressed to some degree, but the wear of time doesn't effect just a handful of issues, it changes a /lot/. Add on top of that, muggle and magical societies change at very different paces. Maybe the reason everyone is looking towards the Minister for Magic so heavily is because wizards only very recently switched over from magical kings and this whole 'democracy' thing is regarded as a newfangled and weird idea. There are ways to deal with all of these hiccups, but that requires recognizing there is a problem in the first place. Basically: if someone from closer to the Founder's era engaged in behaviour A, it could not be because of reason X, because reason X wasn't invented until N years later, so it must have been for undefined reason Y. What is reason Y?

Does anyone have recs that address things more completely? (like, it would be sort of hilarious to see a time travel fic where Harry is bounced to the Founder's era and is getting up in Slytherin's face about blood purity and Slytherin is just like 'what?')

Muggles in the 990s are completely different from the 1990's. Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

The problem is that Muggles improved drastically improved over the following centuries, and wizards refused to see that (or acknowledge it). The blood purists, I assume, don't like change that much, and with new muggleborns brings more change from a source they are unwilling to work with. They took an argument/belief that no longer exists today and ran with it. Imagine the other things that they still believe that are no longer true...?

Exactly! Or, sort of; essentially Voldemort represents a political party, right? One of the things his party supports is segregation form muggles. Slytherin would probably be down for that. But Voldemort also has vaguely defined ideas about the rights of magical creatures like werewolves and giants. Would Slytherin also hold those ideals? Probably not; he wouldn't even think to associate those two issues together.

On muggles, they've really only been barely tolerable for like... 2 centuries? Since the 1800's? I'm not sure when open sewers in the street stopped being a thing... Okay, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stink][Great Stink]] was an epidemic caused by sewage dumping in the Thames in 1858. So, I can seriously imagine Dumbledore's granddad telling him stories about how filthy and smelly muggles are, and being factually correct. 'improvement' is very general; muggles have only begun to do everything wizards can do (more or less) for the last century. Cold food, convenient stoves, adequate sanitation, more or less effective medicine based on experimentation... Muggles have been getting better, no mistake, and hardline purebloods are being unfair in their perspective, but its easy enough to see where they're coming from, particularly if the average wizarding lifespan is longer than a muggle's. Nobody really likes change once they reach a certain age. Things are always better when we were younger.

**** *Great Stink*

The Great Stink was an event in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather exacerbated the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present on the banks of the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera before the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.

The smell, and fears of its possible effects, prompted action from the local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem.

Nobles were just as illiterate. Literacy was confined mostly to monks and some of the ladies of the higher nobility who had the spare time and inclination for it.

And JKR apocrypha indicate that wizarding hygienic practices mirrored those of muggles - they just vanished their shit afterwards.

Also, spells may not have been advanced back then. I mean, it took them until around 1700 to create levitation. If magic was powerful and wizards were living better than Muggles, Salazar would not have feared the Muggles so much.

Also, the Hogwarts we see in 1991 - 1998 would be vastly different from the one in 970. You are overthinking it and stepping food into the trope we see when authors want to make Muggles look stupid and wizards smart.

Modern day education is vastly different from medieval education. Reading back then was not something that was important to the average person. Sure, people read and wrote, but as much as you would think. Wizards being literate and ahead of Muggles makes no sense seeing as they would be such a minority.

Also, back then, people assumed that being able to read was something God gave you. It was not something you could 'learn'.

Assuming you mean setting foot? Of course reading wasn't important to the average person, but then, the average person didn't attend school, either, did they? And a large portion of the British wizarding population /did/. Again, with a founder of the school who declared that "wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure" and had a house dedicated to learning.

I'm assuming that the people who believed being able to read could not be taught were, erm, not the ones who could read. Because since there was a portion of the population that could read, they would've had to have been taught, and taught others.

*********** Most likely.

However, you are completely missing my point and misunderstanding what I am trying to say. I am not saying that there were no wizards in that time period that could read, write, and were intelligent, I am saying the vast majority of them were most likely the same as Muggles. Also, a lot of the cool spells we see in the current era are recently invented spells. There is nothing to indicate there were healing spells or cleaning spells back them. It all could have been a simpler version that did smaller things. Think of herbalism and potions.

However, I am pretty certain the four founders were more than just simple ‘powerful' witches and wizards. I am sure they were learned and scholarly and set out to teach that to the youth. They could most likely read and write, were able to do things others could not.

However, as I said above, this time period is where people believed reading and writing was a gift from God and could not be taught. Most of the people who could read and write were monks and such. Christianity was massive at this point in time.

Perhaps the Muggles considered magicals to be druids of some sort, but Salazar knew the respect and tolerance would not last, hence his fear of them.

However, at the end of the day, there is literally zero canon information on this. For all we know, wizards could be superheroes back then.

They are a strong, handsome species who can assume either wholly human or wholly serpentine form and are potentially dangerous but often beneficial to humans

  The female nagas (*naginis* or nagis) are serpent princesses of striking beauty. The dynasties of Manipur in northeastern India, the Pallavas in southern India, and the ruling family of Funan (ancient Indochina) each claimed an origin in the union of a human being and a nagi.

A mythical nagini is literally a creature that can switch between the form of a snake and a woman.

With magic, books could be magically copied or written. With easy access books, and a way to instantly teleport across the country, it was probably much more likely for the common wizard to be literate.

#+end_quote

Centuries before the witch hunts. True, he doesn't specifically say witch hunts or trial, and people did fear magic long earlier, but you have to stretch it for it to make sense.

#+begin_quote
  "[Slytherin] disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy."

Seeing as this was long before the Statute of Secrecy, when simply letting the secret out would be untrustworthy, it seems likely that this is also related to active persecution.

#+begin_quote

/This/ would suggest a modern view on bloody purity, although "unworthy" is still pretty vague. If I'm rationalizing the legend, I would put the highest confidence on this being a later addition, but none of it makes a whole lot of sense given actual history and JKR's later (canon!) writings.

You can even earn a modest income if you're growing spell material or raising animals for said materials. Everyone who falls out in wizarding society is either not powerful enough (maybe a sub-race) or is extremely lazy / depressed in some sense. You can be completely ostracized from society and just do whatever the fuck you want if you're learned enough (as is displayed in many fanfics).

she wanted to write a children's book, which is fine but now she is trying to make it into this epic universe when frankly the world building does not scale with what she wants

I mean harry spent several years at wizarding school before learning about what an Auror was

as I got older I see more of the flaws, like wizarding culture will basically be destroyed due to all the immigration

and that's a massive issue facing our world today where countries are having so many immigrates that they form enclaves and do not adjust to the country they are moving too

There is a weird thing is that JK rowling also spent zero time establishing wizarding culture

they celebrate Christmas and Halloween and easter but from a wizards perspective Jesus, should be relatively unimpressive he turned water into wine, wow my 13 year old gets taught how to do that in class

******* For me, it made sense that this class doesnt exist because I an not convinced the Wizarding World even have a "culture ".

Dont get me wrong, they are definitively different to Muggles, but wizards seem to be very "individualistic". They all keep to themselves and even official structures such as the Ministry is more there to assure a basic control and ensure that the Statut of Secrecy is enforced than to really "govern " the people. In the end, every wizard seem to do anything he want as long as he respects some loose rules (like dont attack a Muggle without reason, or dont try to raise a dragon in your garden).

You could almost say that every wizard family has its own culture (the Weasleys, the Lovegoods and the Malfoys all have very different values and live different lives, and they are all purebloods ) And the closest thing to common values seem to be Hogwart Houses (an ex Gryffindor will raise his children with Gryffindor values and same for thé other ones ) which would explain why family members tend to be in the same house. But even this is not an assured result (with people like the Patil twins, or Sirius Black ). In this situation, except the law that can be covered in Defense and in History, what could be taught in a Culture class ?

I think Hogwarts and the other schools became prominent not because the wizard families were keen to have /others/ teach their children (in opposition to the old way of personal apprenticeships, most of them kept all in the family), but rather because as wizarding population grew, the high numbers of children running about without proper education became an outright /hazard/ for the public at large.

That's acknowledged on Pottermore. The entrance of the Chamber of Secrets was originally a run-of-the-mill trapdoor, but in the 19th century, the construction of the modern plumbing system threatened to expose it, so a Gaunt (who still knew where the Chamber was) arranged to be put in charge of the operations and took the opportunity to completely redo the entrance mechanism.

#+begin_quote
  or how the Sorting Hat probably doesn't have specific instructions about protecting children's secrets since the concept of universal rights like the right to privacy is a modern notion.
#+end_quote

The Wizarding World is more progressive than the Muggle world about many things, even though it is backwards in its own ways. I don't think this sort of concern can necessarily scale from the Muggle to Wizarding customs, even prior to the Statute.

Regardless, "not spilling the children's secrets" isn't necessarily a matter of "universal rights". It could just as easily be the discretion expected of a servant to the powerful --- e.g. the influential wizards wouldn't have agreed to let their children go to Hogwarts if there was no guarantee that their secrets would be safe. Or, to be less cynical about it, just plain kindness; just because it's not widely seen as basic universal human rights, doesn't mean that spilling someone's secrets without their consent wasn't seen as a crummy thing to do.

Good point. That's sort of what I was angling for; it feels like a lot of writers explain things by comparing it to the modern day, which is silly. I think it makes sense that the Sorting Hat /does/ keep children's secrets, at least to some extent, but the /reason/ for that behaviour is very unlikely to be because of a 'right to privacy' such as in the US constitution. 'To keep proprietary/family magics secret' makes a lot more sense. I'm angling for answers to 'why?' type questions here.

As an example, the books never directly address the whole 'a significant fraction of Hogwarts library can't be read by schoolchildren' thing: why? What if the entire library is under the effect of some large scale translation spell, like they have a modern English dictionary and all the books in the library are set to reference it to know what translation to show, and the library can just swap out what dictionary is referenced as language evolves as needed?

So, "ancient runes" was not a language, it was an alphabet. Specifically a group of alphabets used for Germanic languages and that includes Old English. The Hogwarts founding took place during the transitional period for Old English between Anglo-Saxon runes and the Latin alphabet, which was imported from Ireland to "Britannia" via monks. (I can't recall if it was England in 990 or still separate kingdoms and the Pictish vs Alba transition happened around that time too.)

I'd agree that many old books would be in Latin and Greek, but there would certainly be books written in the Germanic and Celtic language families as well. And those Germanic books would be a hodgepodge of the runic and early Latin alphabets - assuming that early wizards didn't shun the Latin alphabet because of it's introduction to the island via Catholic monks.

Edit - the early Irish and Pictish books /might/ be written in Ogham. (There are untranslated inscriptions in that alphabet for Pictish, even though it's usually associated with Early/Old Irish.) The Irish dropped ogham in favour of an 18 letter Latin alphabet much earlier than the Anglo-Saxons dropped runes, however. I'm not aware of an alphabet other than Latin for early forms of Welsh/Briton/etc.

Auraicept na n-Éces ([arakʲept na neːgʲes], "the scholars' [éices] primer [airaiccecht]") was historically thought to be a 7th-century work of Irish grammarians, written by a scholar named Longarad. The core of the text may date to the mid-7th century, but much material was added between that date and the production of the earliest surviving copy in the 12th century.

If it indeed dates to the 7th century, the text is the first instance of a defence of vernaculars, defending the spoken Irish language over Latin, predating Dante's De vulgari eloquentia by 600 years and Chernorizets Hrabar's O pismeneh by 200 years.

They absolutely were! As far as we can tell, there was a pretty dramatic shift in usage when you compare the stone inscriptions to the books.

That's what /we Muggles/ call Ancient Runes, but I get the strong impression that Ancient Runes as taught at Hogwarts means something somewhat different. Consider that /The Tales of Beedle the Bard/ is said to be translated "from Ancient Runes into English", creating an equivalence.

In my stories, I choose to consider that these Ancient Runes are a sort of magical cipher, a way to encode magical meaning that has never been spoken, but was instead developed by sorcerers as the most efficient (and hermetic) way to write down the complexities of magical theory; one Runic sentence can contain a spell, its incantation and wand-movement, its effects, /and/ the matrix its magical forces.

Here's a bit more debate, just to explain my reasoning (using muggle examples, of course! Can you tell that I kind of adore this subject?)

#+begin_quote
  Consider that The Tales of Beedle the Bard is said to be translated "from Ancient Runes into English", creating an equivalence.

Consider that The Tales of Beedle the Bard would have been written in middle English, which looked like this:

#+begin_quote
  And it was don aftirward, and Jhesu made iorney by citees and castelis, prechinge and euangelysinge þe rewme of God, and twelue wiþ him; and summe wymmen þat weren heelid of wickide spiritis and syknessis, Marie, þat is clepid Mawdeleyn, of whom seuene deuelis wenten out, and Jone, þe wyf of Chuse, procuratour of Eroude, and Susanne, and manye oþere, whiche mynystriden to him of her riches.
#+end_quote

It's mostly legible to be sure, but a bit of head tilting is still required to read it. Add in a different alphabet, and the translation factor goes up a bit. Then there's the subject matter of the book: it's the magical equivalent of the Brothers' Grimm or Aesop, which suggests multiple uses for the runes themselves. Reading/writing vs magic. To me, the fact that it's written in runes just demonstrates that there was more pushback against the Christian latin alphabet in the magical world.

#+begin_quote

Cipher runes exist in the muggle world as well, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6k_runestone][this runestone]] is a rather well known example of both ciphers and displacement cryptography alongside the standard use of runes at the time of carving.

*** Personally I would think wizards mirror muggles quite a bit. Think on what it would be like if the president controlled the major news sources. Especially if not believing what you're told by the prophet/ministry is frowned upon and you're looked at as only a conspiracy theorist. A lot of people blindly believe what their chosen news source tell them so if the vast majority of news sources were the ministry's servants essentially then the vast majority of the population would likely believe it. We see through Harry's eyes only in the books and other information is pretty limited in scope and a lot of people don't like considering other things canon /cough/ vanishing poop /cough/ cursed child /cough/ and Harry is a special case in that world. How many people do you think met the minister personally in more private settings who wasn't one of the people in his direct employ or other higher ups in the government. Combine and control over the news with blackmail or bribery and people who know the truth would probably keep quiet.

There's also that if it doesn't effect you personally you're less likely to care.

I've always hated that a gaunt (proud descendants of Slytherin) would be willing to make the chambers entrance into a girls bathroom. My headcanon has always been that there's a portal in the sinks that can only be accessed through parseltounge. It would explain why it couldn't be accessed without a parselmouths help as destroying the sinks would destroy the portal. Granted someone would have to find it and want to destroy it and thats the reason it would still be there. Plus other doors maybe in the dungeons because if Slytherin dorms are in the dungeons it seems likely that Slytherin spent a great deal of time in the dungeons.

I enjoy it cause I enjoy thinking about how language evolves, but the characterization gets kinda OOC and samey towards the last parts. If you like a LONG read it's great. Also!! It's updated regularly.

About half the series is set in the founders era, featuring founders who aren't depressing and/or boring, which is amazing cause most founders fics suuuuuck

(The fic also centers around the fact that the past was more socially inclusive/less socially shitty than the 1990s, which seems a little silly and tiresome, but it's a magical world so I just kinda rolled with it)

  Hogwarts was founded about AD 990. This is possibly slightly before the country of England formally came to be, to put things in context.
#+end_quote

The Heptarchy united under Æþelstan (son of Alfred the Great) in 937, immediately prior to the Battle of Brunanburh, when the newly-formed Kingdom of England fought off a particularly violent Viking invasion.

And Middle English is quite easy to read if you pronounce each word exactly as it's spelled. It's a language to be heard, not read.

*** Yeah, Middle English is comprehensible, more or less, if odd. I might be a little wary of trusting if for complicated and precise spell instructions, but for history or theory it would just be a bit slow going.

Cool! I wasn't sure exactly when England was formally recognize to have emerged during the 10th century. Thanks.

** My headcanon, if you play with the timeline a little bit, is that Slytherin was against the Christian church, specifically in Ireland, where [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Saint_Patrick_Catholic_Church_%28Junction_City%2C_Ohio%29_-_stained_glass%2C_Saint_Patrick_-_detail.jpg][Saint Patrick]] (who looks pretty fucking wizard) was trying to oust the "Snakes" from Ireland. St. Patrick excises Slytherin and his kind from Ireland, which leads to Slytherin meeting the rest of the founders. Cue Ireland becoming predominantly Catholic. Essentially, it's a metaphor for Catholicism vs. Paganism, and both sides were using magic, however, in very different senses. Over the centuries, this debate transitions from a religious one, to a cultural one (maintaining traditions versus embracing transition), to a matter of race/blood purity when Mendel's ideas gain traction. Mendel wasn't the first to discover these things (humans have been breeding wolves into dogs, plants into better plants, etc. for centuries before Mendel, but he was the first to use the scientific method and write shit down).

Perhaps Slytherin's family was originally Irish and after they were kicked out, settled in the Fens of England. Salazar chooses green and silver as a slight against the Irish Catholics his family tussled with, and his connection to magic and tradition.

Paganism involved a lot of rituals, and we see in Harry's time that ritual magic is considered very dangerous and mostly dark. We don't get a clear explanation of what is considered "Dark" except for the Unforgiveables, and old pagan concepts were embraced by magical and muggle alike. To the magical population, organized religion like Christianity represented a shift away from ritual magic, sacrifices, and an obedience toward something other than magic and minor gods: to acknowledge "the" God is a massive cultural shift if your entire life is based on loosely understood ritualistic magic and praying to gods of nature, while relying on the few magical people in your area to work miracles via magic.

In my head, Godric Gryffindor was Roman Catholic, or closely agreeing with those beliefs, and while originally great friends with Slytherin in their youth, their ideological differences just became too much for the population as a whole. The wizards could see big changes in the future and some in Slytherin's camp were very afraid of that change. Gryffindor's views sort of win out in the end, and the magical world follows suit.

Merlin and his escapades further this tension between traditional vs. new ways of thinking, while wars wage between Saxons, vikings, and Europe in general.

Old magic is like that as depicted in ancient texts: rituals, sacrifices, prayers. It heavily involves forces of nature. It involves a lot of people working in concert to do magic, except for the gods and those chosen by gods (ie. wizards / witches). This is very different from wand + spell based magic that modern magicals exercise. Old Hogwarts classes likely taught a mix, with individual magic becoming increasingly popular while the old, group magic becoming increasingly dangerous.

All the "old" families, like the Blacks, have family magic that dabbles in these old pagan traditions. Over time, and due to the increasingly dark association of ritual magic, they relate dark magic with old magic and become increasingly "dark" while trying to hold on to their family traditions. Dark, Old, and Ritual become obfuscated over time, which is why the Blacks are increasingly associated with madness and darkness, but /are/ increasingly mad and dark through that obfuscation.

The Statute comes to play as tensions between these various ideologies comes to a head: pagan muggles are dying out and becoming increasingly religious, pagan wizards are dying out and becoming increasingly religious, but nearly all known magic users by the English Renaissance era are borrowing from their pagan origins. This is a long and hard struggle, many centuries in the making. It's not a "Muggles started burning witches so we decided to cut off" -- it's more like "there are more and more people in the world, muggles and wizards both, so we need to decide our future." The Statute represents a concerted effort of organized wizard kind to leave tradition behind and embrace the newer ways of thinking, while ironically isolates themselves from the technological advances muggles discover. Magical society embraces a new world order, while essentially locking themselves in a late-Renaissance era of thinking. All the old conflicts eventually shift and change over time, especially as the written word becomes more prominent, and newly self-discovered "scholars" try to justify the old conflicts by re-writing the old conflicts in light of newly realized conflicts like blood purity.

There's no reason magical society could not have had "advanced" ways of thinking, like Democracy and an emphasis on individual rights, (Democracy was a Greek ideal, and while somewhat failed in that ancient society, nearly all Western societies are based on their ideals with modern social, technological, and political systems in place). There's even the possibility that muggle society followed wizards in social / political / economic standards but just pounced ahead due to technology.

Anyway, that was a ridiculous word vomit at 4am after work while drinking, so take those thoughts with a grain of salt, but I love lore / worldbuilding type discussions like this.

There were probably wildly different spellings of words (as even carried through to Shakespeare's time), and the language as we know it is more "in the spirit" of its time and grace.
