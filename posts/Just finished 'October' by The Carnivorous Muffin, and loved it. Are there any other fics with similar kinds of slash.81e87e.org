I don't read slash at all, but I tried this fic out and surprisingly enjoyed it. Are there any fics with a similar kind of slash?

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

** Hey! I don't have any recs but I recommend crossposting to [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] somebody there might have something. In my experience I get better responses over there when slash is involved

** Interesting, I also don't typically read slash, but recently read October as I like Carnivorous Muffin's other works. I highly recommend reading her other stuff if you haven't already by the way.

Anyway I have read one thing that has a sort of similar relationship half way through, so it might fit your request.
