I've been wanting to say something for quite a while now but really couldn't be bothered with the silly responses I thought I'd get.

I ship Harmione because to me it's the most logical pairing that's my opinion and it should be respected but for some reason the ship is treated worse than the more outlandish parings like drarry or dramione for some reason even though Harry and Hermione are actually friends with the possibility of being more.

So with that said it's really annoying when I see a post on ig that asks who you ship and everyone says who they ship but under the Harmione ones there's always replies like their are you even a fan or have you even read the books.

To me that's really offensive I live and breathe Harry Potter when I watch the films I know say the lines before they're spoken, I still get tingles pins and needles and feel a rollercoaster of emotions when I read the books Ive played the many games I have so much memorabilia that my bedroom is covered in it.

To me the books are everything they were my only lifeline going through secondary school every journey every break I would be reading. The books were the highlight of my days and got me through some dark times.

Just saying you should respect all fans even if they ship something you're not comfortable with or a ship that makes no sense like Romione or Hinny üòâ jk

but honestly I'm not sure what people's problem with the paring is are they jealous that there ship didn't share the close bond that Harry and Hermione have? Or do people just have to stick to canon that bad?

I've also seen the excuse that harmony fans always bash Ron but they don't there are plenty of fics that have a neutral or positive Ron. You shouldn't judge a collective on a few outliers

I could go on a while longer but I've gone on to long as is at the end of the day be more respectful and maybe even try a good harmony ship it might even change your mind üòÅ


** "A ship that makes no sense like Romione or Hinny "

How are you gonna play the victim and instantly shittalk other ships ?

*** Well let's see. Hermione is basically Ron's mother, helping with his homework and dealing with his constant whining attitude. Post hogwarts Ron is jealous of her position as head of ministry, he was drunk on their wedding day and he still acts obnoxious (imo).

Funny started off as a fan girl and afterwards it all seemed a bit weird considering I don't remember a single moment before halfblood prince where they were alone or they had any reason to like each other though that may just be my memory

** Harry/Hermione is my preferred pairing too, but if you think that it is even remotely close to the top 30 most bashed ships, you are delusional. I would even go as far as to say that it is one of the most accepted ships in the whole fandom and it has been for all of the 18 years I have been reading HP fanfiction.

Imagine if Draco/Hermione or Harry/Snape shippers would make a post like this everytime they are annoyed by a comment that critizizes them... This sub would be constantly flooded.

I think you just never had any problems with your ship being bashed, because it is so universally accepted, often even more than the actual canon ships, and just recently got some comments that intoduced you to ship bashing. Something every other ship has been dealing with on the daily.

*** In my experience I don't really see Harmione bashing but more like people wanting more variety?

Harmione is really popular especially in certain specific types of fic. So for those types of fic ( like for example Smart Lord Harry or something) people may feel a different ship may change things up make the story feel different and wish they saw less Harmonie and more of everything else.

Or they really dislike a specific type of fic and when they see it the ship is Harmonie and so they wish they saw less Harmione so they see less of x type of fic.

For example I really dislike guy who changes for the girl fics and I see that pretty often with Snilly and Dramione. Which makes me not want to read Snilly and Dramione and filter it out to avoid fics like that.

I see alot more of that with Harmione not bashing but people just not wanting to read it for x reason.

** lmao, Harmonie is in the top 5 most liked fics out there, I don't know where you get your sources but /every ships are getting bashed by someone out there/.

Fan of Romione? Ron is a delusional, insensitive, idiotic moron.

Fan of Dramione? They hate each others, this ship makes no sense, and Draco is a bad character anyway (not bad as "badly written", just bad as "not a good guy").

Fan of Drarry? Same as Dramione but you wanted your token gay ship, or something.

Hanny? Canon pairing, makes no sense, only thing in common is Quidditch.

Anyone/Voldemort? Voldemort can't love.

Haphne? Its fans are annoying as hell, and Daphne is an OC anyway.

‚Äã

My point is, stop whining. Every ships out there is hated by someone, with or without good reasons. Yours happen to be one of the less sensical and still most liked, so please stop trying to be a victim here. If you can't survive a few harsh words, then you have no businesses being here.

**** Settle down friendo, all I'm saying is Harmonie get less hate than literally every other ships out there, so you should stop being a drama queen. Just because you take things for granted doesn't lessen the fact.

Also, there is plenty of reasons to hate Harmonie. Here are sompe of them :

- Hermione is a manipulative character. That's what she is. She doesn't hesitate to use Harry's fame to create a big Defence study group, when Harry himself didn't want to teach to many people. She's willing to erase her parents' memories instead of telling them to flee or helping them do it themselves.

- Harry never saw Hermione as more than a bossy sister. He even thought multiple times that "it was not as fun as being with Ron".

- Hermione is a jealous wreck, so much so that she's willing to send a flock of birds to attack her crush because she couldn't deal with the fact that he was with someone else.

What was it you said... Oh, yes. "I could go on a while longer, but I've gone on too long as is." "I'm not [obvious to it], I'm stating facts"

"I have every right to be where I want to be. If you don't like it, you can leave; no one's stopping you, because where I'm from, we have freedom of speech."

** I agree that it's the most logical pairing in canon, but I would still never read a story with it. I can't even stand her as a main character most of the time. Part of it comes from the fact that fanon seems to turn her good traits into bad ones and enhances her bad ones even more, while another part is that I was utterly disappointed by her character after reading the first book and are always reminded of this when I just read her name.

That said, I find the hate that Harmony shippers get at times absolutely ridiculous. Honestly, just let anyone ship whatever they want. Insulting someone because their opinion is different from yours is childish and nothing else. (I draw the line at pedophilia, though. Those stories, with very few exception deserve all the hate they get)

*** Ok, so first, learn how to use reddit, you didn't reply to me actually.

Second, I can do nothing more for you. You are so close-minded, I can actually see for the first time why Haphne fans make so much jokes about Harmonie shippers. It is the first time ever I can relate to Haphne shippers, admitedly the most annoying, intrusive shippers of the HP fandom (even if most of it is nothing more than a joke gone stale)

"You don't know what hate this ship gets". Wow, get down from our high horse yourself! I have read probably more fics than you ever did, tried a bit of everything; from the most stale of self-inserts to the most amazing alternate universe, from the depressing HPMOR to DPaSW, from Drarry to Snamione, all in an attempt to understand what it was I liked.

So I know that when I say Harmonie is definitely one of the more liked fics out there, I'm not suttering, I'm no lying, and I'm definitely not wrong. For the same reason, I can tell you that Hermione is massively overestimated.

‚Äã

Hermione is manipulative, like it or not, facts are facts. She suggested the DA in a way that Harry thought he'd teach 5, at most 10 students, not the army he got. When faced with the accomplished results, he was understandably angry. Forgot that part, didn't you?

Want something else about perfect prefect Hermione? She's a lot like you : she believes she can't be wrong. An example of that: The House elves.

She may mock Ron for it, but she too lack social grace, like a lot. Like her treatment of her cat, that she let around an animal that she knew he attacked for apparently no reasons. When Scabbers died, what did she do? Mock Ron, because of course it's not Crookshank's fault, and he should have protected his damn rat better, even through his rat was /locked in his dorm/, and that's the natural order of things.

‚Äã

"Harry doesn't have a sister so he has no clues what that's like" yeah, maybe, but I have one and I can see those things. Hermione is much more a sister to Harry than a lover. In fact, in no way does Ron treats Hermione the same way he treated his sister.

As for the fun part, Ron was in love. That can't be questionned, that's literally the one thing Riddle's spirit used to hurt him.

And no, Hermione was not OOC. She was just less in control of herself. We could see another part of her : what happens when she's not the bestest at everything. In Year 5, she was beaten by Harry in potions, and went mad with jealousy. She was beaten by Lavander in love, and, guess what, /she went mad with jealousy/.

Also, I can't believe I have to explain this : I was quoting you to mock you, because /damn/ are you mockable right now.

The very first time we meet the cat it is jumping on Ron's head and then chasing the rat. How many times did the cat just sit and stare at Ron's pocket when Scabbers was in there? Crookshanks even attacked Ron's bag when he said the rat was in it. The cat had form. Then there's blood on the sheets and some hairs? What was Ron supposed to think?" This is a response in a quora question since I couldn't find the exact quote but you get what I mean lets not even talk about half blood prince as anybody with a brain knows that was a hermione bashing ooc hermione fic that you paid 10 dollars for book 7 is debatable so I won't go into that anyway bye

** I'm not saying Hermione is perfect never have I know she has flaws she's not manipulative ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you've named one scene where she does what your saying nothing like manipulators such as Dumbledore. She truly does care for Harry in case you forgot that year Harry does get angry a lot very easily although do agree he was right to be angry at that instance Do you believe she was wrong about house elves do they not need representation cause I'm pretty sure she was right about that even if she may have not approached the situation correctly Cats eat rats natural order of things it's weird that their both allowed as pets bit weird honestly

I have 2 sisters and we definitely are closer to a Ron Ginny sibling then a Harry Hermione supposed sibling relationship

Ron does treat Hermione like he treats Ginny it's the only way he knows how to talk to girls he just argues with them and tries to put them down (exactly the same way)

The point you made was that Harry finds Ron more fun to be around and I said yeh but Ron feels exactly the same about Harry that was my point

By the way the year your talking about is 6 not 5 and I said she was ooc that whole year so you can't really compare that to another moment in that year doesn't really work

Tbh I don't think this conversation is going anywhere you said I'm to stubborn to change which I probably am but so are you so Its probably best to stop there I'll carry on if you want to reply though if not hope you have a good day
