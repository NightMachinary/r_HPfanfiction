So I'm reading a fic - why yes, this is how I spend my Friday nights - in which Harry became a healer. Of course, the fic involves Harry having considerable knowledge in potions, which got me to thinking - is Harry actually bad at potions? Maybe it's the fics I've read, but it seems to me that Harry tends to be portrayed slightly below average in potions, unless he's a prodigy. The general perception is that while he can do it, Harry lacks the instinct, if you will, for the subject, and that his EE in the OWL took an extraordinary amount of effort on his part. But was Harry really that bad? Or was his skill and interest in the subject colored by Snape? Would love to hear your thoughts on this one.


** I think the big thing to remember is that Harry (and Ron) was good enough to get an E in the only nonbiased examination we see him in. Which puts him probably as a good, but not great student. There are, after all, 10 students who get Os in Harry's year.

The other key moment I'd consider is coming up with the antidote in Slughorn's class. While Harry is certainly good enough to ace Potions with help from the HBP, he doesn't have the theoretical base to brew his own antidote, or even have an idea of where to start. Compare to chemistry: often you'll see students who do good lab work, understand reactions, and yet have a very difficult time designing their own experiment (why I was always in favor of 'lab tests' to show knowledge).

So is Harry bad at Potions? Absolutely not-- he'll be perfectly competent with straightforward brews, and would probably get much better in Auror training. But is he going to revolutionize the field with his unrecognized Potions genius? Nope.

** I don't think there's any way of gauging what his abilities /would/ have been, but I think it's definitely true that having Snape for the teacher influenced his interest and emotions toward the subject, which certainly (whether consciously or unconsciously) affected the amount of effort he put in and his overall performance. It's very difficult to work hard for someone you don't like, and, speaking from both personal experience and general observation, teenagers are not very good at separating the fact that while this teacher they don't like is the one requiring the work, /they/ are the ones who will ultimately benefit, not the teacher, so they should do the work and do it well anyway.

Since we have no idea what Harry would have done with the class had he never met Snape, I'm usually willing to accept any level of ability in the subject that an author wishes to give him, short of the utmost extremes.

I agree. Harry's a pretty emotional character and I think his strong feelings about Snape's petty jealousies could easily bleed over into the subject that he teaches.

**** Is it any wounder - I myself have this flaw, too I hate doing work "for" somebody I dislike (even if the work does ultimately benefit me!). It's also harder to do the work if you know it's not going to be appreciated (humans need encouragement and not constant scorn - people in leadership positions/teachers/professort etc. are taught this, not that Snape cares!)

**** What do you expect, we are talking about Snape - the guy who loves the dark arts (not like Voldemort who likes dark magic because it gives him power, but more like Dumbledore and alchemy...just in a more disturbing way as most of that magic is used to kill and torture!) and is as anti-social as they come (more at home hiding in his dungeon brewing something obscure or even experimenting with something new than at any social event (the only real social event I can see Snape at is a meeting of potioneers - at all others he'd stick out like a sore thumb...bat of the dungeons and all that!))

*** Harry would have talent if he actually applied himself to his studies. Many times throughout the books we see him and Ron leaving homework till the last minute. Would Potions have been different for him if he had known just one of the answers to Snape's questions? Perhaps, it would have shown that Harry was prepared, maybe even showing an interest in the subject, as it seemed from when Harry had read through some of the books. Yet, Harry let himself just be lead by Ron and as a result, we get canon Harry.

** As we see in HBP, Harry can be top of his class in practicals when he stops fucking around with Snape and Draco and /follows the fucking instructions/.

Better instructions and no distractions? Better results.

But there is no indication he cares for the written or theoretical portions at all. E's when he's actually tested on such.

A shame that he's so uninterested in classwork in a story set in a school. Usually, students worry about their grade. Harry hardly has them in canon. Oh well.

**** Shouldn't matter. It is a /schoolkid's/ revisions he's working from. It isn't shown that the instructions /themselves/ are what makes Harry's potions work so well, either, I'd like to point out. He never compares the two results /himself/. It's just shown that he's a lot more into using them, for some reason, and a lot of them are faster or better than either Slughorn's general class instructions or the school book's.

Do you really think Snape gives /worse/ instructions as an adult, from a technical standpoint? My take was always just that Harry was finally paying attention to whatever complicated instructions Snape was /always/ saying--from a Snape that was at the same stage of learning as Harry was this time, albeit also a student obviously much more advanced in theory than Harry /or/ Hermione.

I mean, I'm not suggesting Snape in canon isn't a /terrible/ teacher. That goes without saying. I'm just suggesting that Harry is kinda dense until HBP, when it comes to potions, and the book is written in /by the same guy who taught him the last five years./ So yeah. Maybe, just maybe, it's a Harry not giving a fuck problem up to that point.

And it could still be that Hermione would /destroy/ him with the same instructions, in Slughorn's class, if only she wasn't getting absolutely /pummelled/ by the fell demon Pubertus the entire damn time and thus unable to think rationally.

Hmm. Maybe Hermione is pissed partially because Slughorn /isn't/ giving out special instructions on the board like Snape always did, and is just teaching from the book--which she's already read, likely multiple times. Makes sense.

***** Whoa, man, all I'm asking is if we actually saw Harry using non-revised instructions. It was more of asking you to confirm my memory than an outright accusation of something.

But your points got me to thinking. We don't actually see proof in the form of rigorous testing that Snape's revisions themselves cause the improved potions. I'm sure JKR was relying heavily on Occam's Razor, but that could be a interesting fic - someone putting the revisions to the test.

I could actually see Snape choosing to stick to the book while teaching. Doing this for your own potions? That's one thing, but when you're expected to teach students, who have books, and may complain about odd recipes to parents, and are expected to graduate and get jobs that may require them to be potions? That could lead to attention-gathering problems down the line. Not a good look if you're trying to be a reformed death eater.

I think that's a totally plausible reason for Hermione to be upset. I think fanon distorts this, but I don't like the theory that Hermione only objected to the book because cheating is bad. That is just too convenient of a flaw, made unrealistic given her character development. HBP was more nuanced about Hermione being way of the consequences of doing magic that was, as at as she knew, the random scribblings of some person that had not been observed at all. I would think that this could fit in as well - like OK, with a teacher you can reasonably expect them to go beyond the book, but for some reason Slughorn is not and Harry is following some random scribbled and how is that not going to go to hell in a handbasket.

****** No worries. I was simply expanding on the point I interpreted you as making. Harry is only shown to use the book instuctions, as far as I recall.

I'd love to see a *"Hermione Does Science" story where she snaps and A-B tests everything in the HBP potions book, with Harry and Ron as test +victims+ subjects.

I still think Snape is the sort to be too proud not to put at least some of his stuff into the lessons. He doesn't actually /do/ anything else, in canon, other than teach and work as a double-agent (which only comes later). I'd also love a "Snape: Tough Love Teacher" story where all the shitty "fewer aurors and healers" fanon trope is reversed, and the whole post-war country only holds together because of his rigorous standards for teaching N.E.W.T. students.

Remember, N. Tonks had to have managed an "O" O.W.L. in his class, and she isn't presented as some sort of studious genius. But Harry /is/ presented as sort of a dumb jock much of the time.

******* Yeah. I feel like Snape was building stronger Aurors by tightening the requirements.

He clearly knows how to teach. The HBP book he 'revised' shows an innate understanding of how to break down potions and even improve them.

He just apparently doesn't like kids. So it's interesting to theorize here.

** No, I figure he does fine in potions. He had no interest in creating or dissecting potions in a way that would make him exceptional, but he follows along with the material just fine.

Plus, it's important to note that Harry manages an EE even though Snape has harassed him for 5 years and allowed Malfoy to do the same in his class. Harry even notes in OoTP that, when Snape is ignoring him, he finds it easy to make his potion. It's the same observation he makes while taking the exam: he's more relaxed and productive without Snape.

** Harry didn't seem to care much about school work in general, he seemed to wait until last moment to do his homework, much like Ron. Though I think Harry's problem stems from his childhood with the Dursleys, schoolwork was something he couldn't excel at because of that idiot Dudley and even at a different school, the patterns of the past are still ingrained into him and Ron makes this even worse. Perhaps if Harry had met someone who had a better study ethic first (doesn't have to be Hermione, her's is a bit overachiever mode) then maybe Potions might have been something Harry might have given a shit about. As it was, Harry was actually looking forward to the class, but didn't come prepared for it. If I had an interest in the a subject, but had heard from others that the teacher was a hardass, I would have studied the book as much as I could, or gone to the library to ask if there were supplement materials I could read too.

In Snape's case, he was looking for a sign that the child was more than just James Potter's mini me, which after that class, Harry kinda proved. Lily had enjoyed potions, I think he was looking to see the same glee in the subject that she had in her son's eyes. Could he have been less of an asshole about, sure, but then again the man was in a position he loathed with every fiber of his being as penitence, a form of protection, and cover for when Voldy rose again. This is a class he couldn't be lackadaisical in, it's one wrong move and we're all fucked class, who wouldn't be touchy. Not defending, just understanding.

So blame lies mostly at Harry's feet, with the influence from Dursley's, Ron, and Snape.

Think about this for a second, to become an Auror you had to get an Outstanding on your Potions exam, meaning, Snape was ONLY sending them students who applied themselves to their studies, who happen to be some of the best, while at the same time making sure only those who actually paid attention and had a clue at what they were doing made it N.E.W.T level Potions. Meaning, Nymphadora Tonks got an O in her O.W.L.s in Potions, even with her clumsiness. Maybe it helps it helps not being a Gryffindor.

** Snape is a poor teacher. He clearly understands the material, but he's shit at transmitting it to his students.

Harry is, equally, a middling student - an outright /poor/ student when faced with a teacher he can't stand and the distraction of sharing a classroom with Draco.

If he really put his nose to the grindstone after the events of HP7 he could probably be adequate at potions, if he at least had a decent teacher.

He's not better or worse than other muggleborn students who don't have Snape constantly finding fault with him or her (It really irks me that that loathsome and bitter SOB didn't really get his comeuppance (nope: He died, yes but he didn't receive his just punishment...you could say: He got off easy!))
