EDIT: The time travel fics*, the title auto corrected.

As the title says; I personally like the fics where things are drawn out, but not overly so. Like, I like the technicalities, the why's and how's, as well as a bit of romance - but mainly, I read a time travel fic for the the fact that there's actually change happening and the reasoning for the change(s).


** If Harry does have all his memories as an adult, he should have to grapple with the fact that he can't relate to any of his peers anymore. How odd is it when we're reading about a budding romance between a grown man (in mind and spirit, if not body) and a 15 year old? I would hope as an adult he would recognize how morally iffy that is.

It would give a story more stakes. Yeah, he basically has this superpower, he can go back and defeat Voldemort preemptively and save a lot of lives but he loses out on his friendships and romantic relationships.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** I'm very happy to see any of the cast go back during the canon years and fix things. There isn't enough of this story for me. Yes, it's been done, but I'm happy to see another take on it. Most especially, I like the butterfly effect. Everyone writes it differently, some really well.

I've only seen a couple where the same things happen as in canon - the worst was literally canon except the time-travelling OC got to have conversations about the same things playing out as before. Like, a worse-written copy of the books with an OC levered in. I think those miss the entire point of a redo/fixit.

I dislike a long lead-in. I'm mostly interested in them being back in time, rather than the alternate future that they dropped back from. Though, I can just skip that chapter.

I don't mind even slightly if there's a bit of wish-fulfillment going on. I /love/ unexpected consequences from a fix.

- Flashbacks to the hell of war. I don't read time travel often, but I find that the Travel is often very shortly after a triggering event. I'd like to see longer gaps.

- An emotional reveal. Not an angsty-teenage one, but something more tender.

How do you think Harry would react when he woke up naked, next to his mother after a night of drunken sex? Like, he ended up in the past, decided to get pissed, ran into his mother, who had a row with Petunia and wanted to get drunk as well (sixth year Easter holidays, James is not in the picture)

Assuming full disclosure, Lily would probably freak out that she has four years and then latch to the one party who can change that, but how would Harry react? I'm playing with a plot bunny, but how do you write a reaction to banging the mother you never knew?

Maybe they exist alongside their younger selves. Maybe they end up in the body of their younger selves but the magic makes them age rapidly.

More time travel into the the FB timeline that doesn't jump right into shipping.

More fics where Harry can't walk into Hogwarts as an unknown. Maybe he spends a while as just a homeless teenager. Maybe the ministry holds him and he ends up escaping and on the run from them. Maybe Tom Riddle opens the Chamber of Secrets and finds some random kid living there with a basilisk (dead or alive basilisk).

More villains time traveling with the heroes. The heroes don't have a big advantage because there's Voldemort or Bellatrix also running around with future knowledge. Maybe a hero is chasing a villain trying to preserve the timeline (because things are good in the future), but the villain just keeps screwing with things until there's no future for them to go back to. Hell, maybe the heroes don't go back at all. Maybe that typical 'lost everything in the war' story happens with Bellatrix and not Harry, and the trio/the order are scrambling to win when the bad guys are inexplicably one step ahead.

A time travelling Harry who has been missing love and affection his entire life should be his normal impulsive and act first think later self when confronted with for instance his parents being alive. But in a ton of those fics he's the epitome of self control and maintains perfect distance and lets nothing slip.

For that matter I would like more time travel/AU dimensions where building a relationship with his parents is a main plotline (which is rarely the case). Especially Lilly focused fics. Every time I read a fic where he meets his mother (whether that's a Marauder time travel or dimension time travel) I expect him to have tears in his eyes and say “Mum?” And hugging her, sadly this rarely happens.

I actually dislike the trope of returning to your own child body and pretending to live as a child for many years with your mind being 20 or even over 40, can't imagine what that would be like, probably horrible.

Sadly all time traveling fics in this fandom are either discontinued or horrible so... I would like to see less spelling and grammar mistakes, more punctuation, less illogical plots, less bashing of canon characters because they did something the author doesn't like because there was not a single perfect character in the books who had no flaws.

*********** I'll look into it, most fanfics I found promising were abandoned... For such a large and oldish fandom I must confess that I expected a wealth of very well written and lengthy fanfiction, but somehow most writers write like young children and half of the works are discontinued anyway...

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

****** The technical writing is very good but the repetitive self-loathing and constant doubt becomes eventually boring. From what I understand Mat, the author, was in some kind of an accident and is currently bedridden. I hope the guy pulls through.

** Someone other than "golden trio" and usual suspects reincarnated ~1970 Starts hogwarts in tonks year, preferably not gryffindor. Prepares friends to coming conflict. Reincarnated could be from far future and knows about second wizarding war from schools history lessons. Horcruxes were not public knowledge.

Interesting twist would be that time traveller is not mc and no-one will about reincarnation/future knowledge and absolutely no seer crap, muggle wank nor bashing. Perhaps cedric/daphne and daphne is protagonist. Time traveller is daphnes older brother. Tonks/oc brother?

** I think most time travelers aren't subtle enough or good at acting to actually act like their younger self. I want to read fics in which non time travelers are super suspicious of the time traveler's behavior and try to investigate

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
