** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel][Percy Take the Wheel]] on FFN. Due to an accident, Molly dies and Arthur is left in a coma, leaving Percy to take care of his younger siblings while his older brothers maintain them financially. The Ghoul gets sick/depressed and Percy takes care of him, leading to a bond forming between them resulting in the Ghoul becoming Percy's familiar.

** There was a fic I read a while back where the ghoul was Regulus Black, who operated as a spy under Gideon and Fabian Prewett. They distributed emergency portkeys to all their spies as an escape method. Regulus went after the horcrux after they died. When Regulus was murdered by the inferi, it activated the death clause on the portkeys, dragging his reanimating body to the Burrow. Molly and Arthur hold onto the now-unrecognizable ghoul carrying an Order spy's emergency portkey in the hopes that someday it will recover enough of its memories and tell them its unfinished business.
