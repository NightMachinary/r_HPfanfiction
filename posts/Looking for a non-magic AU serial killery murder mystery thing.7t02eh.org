** Well, non-magical AUs can work. See: [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. It depends, I think, whether or not you can capture the "spirit" or "essence" of the characters.

Although I can't see where the story is going. Is Ron working with his best friend Harry and Forensic Scientist Granger? Or has he a "Consulting Detective" Granger (with her platonic friend Potter) meddling with his case? Or will he stumble into a shadow war between criminals, or secret agents?

*** Well I had Seamus Finnigan as Ron's partner. Hermione and Ron were an item but split pre-story, she is now his boss. So far I have Dr. Cho Chang the coroner, Padma Patil a forensics technician. Albus Dumbledore (deceased) is a fantasy novelist who's sort of written the 'Harry Potter' books, if you know what I mean? He is the one that went to the police when he found a link between some unsolved murders and his books and worked with them in an attempt to track down the killer.

They need to find an expert on Dumbledore's works and come across a novelist/uni lecturer a Mr. Michael Corner.

After James and Lily's death Harry was adopted by Mr and Mrs Corner and named Michael, instead of, you know, keeping the same name so the murderer that might still be out for him could track him down. They never told him about his birth parents.

Luna Lovegood is the eccentric owner of a bookstore and Michael's friend and her invaluable help brings them some good leads.

Oh what else, right Cedric Diggory is the first victim so it ties in with the story.

Big fat spoilery stuff ahead - although I doubt I'm actually going to write any more or publish this. [[/spoiler][Michael (Harry) actually knows about his birth parents and also knows that the police are no longer looking for Voldemort. He also knows about the links to Dumbledore's works and spent years becoming an expert that the police might approach. He is the one that killed Cedric in hopes of opening the investigation so that he could join it and find details of the past murders so that he could track down Voldemort himself. So yeah, going into a slightly Hannibal-esqe territory.]]

Is there really nothing like this out there? The whole book inspired murder thing seems so cliched. I really don't have time to write this! But I'd really love to read something like this...

**** Well, the story I linked has the war against Voldemort turned into a James Bond like story. Lots of spy stuff and investigations.

With regards to your plot outline, I think the story would work better if you kept closer to the canon relationships. If there's no magic, and the setting is very different, and you split up the trio, too, then you're already have a large distance compared to canon. Splitting up Ron and Hermione and focusing on characters that didn't really get much screentime in the canon books like Seamus and Patil (and, to some extent, Cho - although she works well in her canon role as the murder victims girlfriend) only increases that gap. And while the point at which a reader says "this is no longer a HP story" varies greatly, the more you change things, the more readers will reach that point.

What about making Ron and Hermione partners? They can struggle with sexual tension and regulations and the case, and their tempers, which would add some familiarity to the plot. They would also complement each other much, much better than Seamus and Ron. Luna would make a good coroner, but Harry needs some familiar characters, so that part would work out without changes. Ginny might connect through Luna to Harry, to add another bit of familiarity.

***** Well, I'll have a look at your rec, but to be honest I think I was looking for something slightly different. I spent the last weekend bingeing on episodes of Criminal Minds, so was in the mood for sort of disturbing crimes/serial killery type of stuff. I also have no idea what the Secret World of Alex Mack is.

And yeah, I get that there is a point where there's such a huge gap from the canon stories that you might as well rename the characters and just post it somewhere as an original story, but I still sometimes want to read something really different while it still has that slight connection to the world of Harry Potter.

And I do like it when some of the characters that barely get a mention in the original stories has a larger part in fanfic. That's what I'm doing in the main fic I've been working on for a year. I realise that people come to read HP fanfic so they can get more of the bigger main characters of the stories, but sometimes I think it can be interesting to have that interaction with a new set of personalities. But yes, you are right, most of the characters I've mentioned I'd only considered having a small role in the story, it was mostly going to be Ron, Hermione and Harry (Michael), there was probably going to be a point where Seamus was going to get killed off.

Anyway, thank you so much for your thoughtful replies, but as I said, I doubt I'm going to go anywhere with this. This was suppose to be a LF a fic thread rather than a help me with my fic one. =)

****** Well, let's just say that the stuff Voldemort did in that story are pretty much "serial killer", and - while not going into the gory details in story - the methods were on par with say Hannibal Lector's. It's just that focus of the story is fighting a secret organisation led by that serial killer, so his killings are more background information dug up during the investigations.
