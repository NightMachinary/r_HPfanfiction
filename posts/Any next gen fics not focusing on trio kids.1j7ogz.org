Ocs would be nice. Next gen kids can be in it but not focus. Thanks


** Inverarity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] centers on Teddy Lupin and a bunch of OCs. It's around 200k words, is well written, and is complete.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** Gave this one a go. It'd be good if it weren't for the mass of character we have with no defining characteristics of their own... they all just blur together.

**** Try to keep going with it. I had trouble getting into that story too, but it gets better, and then it gets amazing.

** I think the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick]] series would count, if you're not already familiar with it. Takes place after the books, but in wizarding America with OCs.

** - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] - ensemble comedy about Fred & gang hosting a radio show.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]] - comedy, revolves around the next gen Muggle Studies teacher and his class. Punny, sensible and hilarious mix of pop culture references.
