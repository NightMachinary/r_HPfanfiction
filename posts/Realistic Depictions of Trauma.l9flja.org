Last week, I plowed through Shattered by Anobii1992 on ao3. It's actually a Doctor Who fic focusing on the Thirteenth Doctor as she recovers from being kidnapped and raped. She has brain damage, seizures, and trouble walking, as well as mental breakdowns. It is quite long, and is much more a recovery fic than anything typically Who.

However, before you think, wait, what does this have to do with Harry Potter, I will enlighten you.

The Doctor and her companion Yaz end up meeting a 10-year-old girl named Maisie who has been abused and neglected by her father. We aren't given all the details, but as Maisie becomes more prominent in the story, it becomes fairly clear that her traumatic upbringing will affect her for years. Despite being 10 years old, she barely knows how to read at first, and it's noted a few times but even after schooling all of her academics are years behind where they should be. She has violent outbursts with caregivers and the Doctor and Yaz, but does start to make progress eventually. I haven't done the research, but this felt like a fairly realistic portrayal of a traumatized child.

And of course, this got me thinking about Harry. Specifically, the Harry-is-horrifically-abused-by-Dursleys fic concept. In the stories I've seen, this Harry is constantly terrifed of being sent back to the Dursleys and rarely gets angry. Schoolwork might be affected by not enough prior pratice, but not much, and making friends is surprisingly pretty easy.

So, like I said, I haven't done the research. Children are different from one another, but they should also be allowed to run the full gamut of emotions. This is a shower thought discussion as well as a recommendation. With Shattered, heed the tags. I will say that it really opened my mind as to what it can be to realistically live with brain damage and mobility issues.


** I watch/read fiction to decompress

Personally I...just don't really want to see that kinda stuff in my fantasy wizard school stories

*** That is totally valid. With this, I got invested, and then my thoughts started whirring. Wanted to get them out somewhere.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
