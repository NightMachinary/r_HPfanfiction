So, I'm planning a big old crossover story, and Harry will eventually play a major part of it, probably second year. And yes, a major part of this will be getting him out of the Dursley's house, and the main characters will be quite furious with Dumbledore and the Dursley's. At the same time however, I don't want to Dumbledore bash. Part of the problem being that JK Rowling really doesn't seem to realize that what the Dursley's did was abuse, not just that they weren't very kind. So how do I address this in a realistic way without bashing Dumbledore?


** You can play the angle that Dumbledore did not actually realize what was going on. Figg did babysit for Harry, but the Dursleys are not about to show their sweet, elderly neighbor anything that might be cause for concern. The fact that Dumbledore did have Figg spy for him shows that he is not omniscient and he probably never showed up to the house.

Doesn't mean he didn't make a mistake though. Perhaps he should have checked up on Harry once a year or so. Drink some polyjuice, impersonate the mailman, etc. Make himself invisible as he says he can in the first book. That's where the anger can come in, without Dumbledore being all "hey, abuse is fine in my book."

** I feel like Harry suffered from neglect more than abuse. At least that's my reading of canon. All his physical needs are met, albeit barely. Harry is fed regularly, he eats at the table, he attends school.

#+begin_quote
  /"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured/ - Vernon Dursley - Book 1
#+end_quote

Here we see that Vernon has refrained from hitting Harry, however poorly he has treated Harry otherwise. He doesn't even swing at Harry in book 5 when he believes Harry is responsible for Dudleys Demenor exposure. However, Vernon and Petunia don't do anything to protect Harry from Dudley, his gang, Aunt Marge or her dogs.

They obviously feel threatened by his presence in the house and attribute all abnormal behaviour to Harry. They don't trust him to be left alone, as is demonstrated before the visit to the zoo.

#+begin_quote
  /'I suppose we could take him to the zoo,' said Aunt Petunia slowly, '... and leave him in the car...' // 'That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...'/ - Book 1
#+end_quote

The key to Harry's protection is his mothers sacrifice. Which is only maintained by Petunia's tenuous acceptance of Harry.

#+begin_quote
  /"She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you."/ - Dumbledore Book 5
#+end_quote

In fact that only people that hurt Harry while under the protection of the house are Petunia and Dudley. Petunia swings a frying pan at Harry in book 2, and only after believing that Harry might have used magic to hurt/scare her child.

Dudley also bullies Harry, which is something that I think all brothers do so some extent. Dudley's behaviour is consistently rewarded by his parents, who treat Harry as a lesser being.

*What is important is that both these people are direct blood relatives.*

Now lets look at Dumbledore's history.

#+begin_quote
  /my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it./ - Aberforth book 7
#+end_quote

His life is marred by Muggle/Wizard conflict. It lead him to Grindlewald, it cost him his father, his mother, his sister and the love of his brother. Some how I can't see Albus feeling comfortable threatening Muggles or Obliviating them. It would remind him too much of his tragic past.

Finally lets look to the Longbottoms who were tortured by Death Eaters in the weeks following Voldemort's fall. They were both Auror's and likely protected by powerful home enchantments, similar to No.12 Grimmauld Place. Not even they could protect themselves!

Neville (the other choice for the prophecy) is effectively left an orphan, seeing this, and knowing that the Dursley's only grudgingly took Harry, how could Albus not think that he had done the right thing?

Especially after Harry shows up at Hogwarts ten years later as a fairly well adjusted young man.

I realise I've not really answered your question directly but I feel these points need to be taken into consideration for anyone planning to remove Harry from No. 4 Private Drive

*** He was locked in his room and fed through a cat flap. In one of the latter books it says 'Harry knew not to get within arm's reach of Vernon' (paraphrasing). That says there was at least a threat of violence. He was locked in the cupboard for the snake incident, made to sleep on the floor in the shack (did I make that up?). Petunia cut his hair in a way that would've made him be ridiculed. They told the neighbours lies so that he was ostracised. They sanctioned Dudley 'Harry hunting', and Harry was scared enough to apperate onto a roof. They did not provide adequate clothing. These are examples from the top of my head.

Scapegoats and favouritism are a recognised form of emotional and psychological abuse. Withholding food is physical abuse. Neglect is a form of abuse, not providing adequate housing for example, and a cupboard is not adequate. Withholding love, support and guidance are all forms of emotional abuse.

Child abuse is covered by four main blanket terms:

physical abuse

sexual abuse

neglect and abandonment

emotional or psychological abuse

Canon Harry suffered from all those forms except sexual. The Dursley's treatment of him would have been enough for social services to intervene.

***** I agree that there is little evidence of physical violence/classic physical abuse against Harry in the books. And the main form of abuse Harry suffered was neglect and emotional abuse, he was not emaciated, he did have a bed of sorts, he was clothed after a fashion. But under any commonly accepted definitions of abuse, he was abused. I don't actually disagree with your general sentiment. What I was clarifying is that neglect #is a form of abuse, so it cannot be said that the Dursley's did not abuse Harry.

I don't mean to get too serious over an imaginary boy and terminology, I just think that it's important that all forms of abuse are understood, recognised and validated. /Climbs off soapbox for the day

My problem with most of fanfiction's depiction of the Dursleys lies there. The authors don't seem to think that what the Dursleys did (mostly neglect and emotional abuse, some physical) was bad enough. I get the feeling they don't think neglect and emotional abuse is abuse and they weigh it less than physical abuse. So they have the Dursleys beat Harry every day, sexually abuse him, and so on. But that sort of treatment is neither backed by canon nor necessary as they already treated him terribly and abusively. The quote by Vernon even points out that they /didn't/ beat him:

******* Completely. I've read some really good stories that explore the results of his canon treatment by the Dursley's, sometimes the subtle things are the most fascinating. His home life really was utterly crappy, as it was portrayed, and no one could go through that completely unscathed.

I like reading an exploration of the effects of his childhood, the different ways that could have made things play out. Because he did grow up unloved, deprived of the simple things every child deserves, they are not little things (when he gets that hug from Mrs Weasley and he thinks that must be how a mother feels, well that is just heartbreaking in itself).

That's not to say I don't ever read fics where the violence is ramped up, or that people shouldn't write it. But his experiences in the books would have left scars, and sometimes psychological and emotional scars can be the hardest to heal of all.

******** I'd just like to thank you all, particularly [[/u/fenellakettlewich]] for the clarity and interest you've shown in your posts. Honestly, I am probably excessively biased on this front, as I'm personally recovering from emotionally abusive parents, so I'm more sensitive to such things. It was never my intention to ramp up what happened to him, but I do fully intend to explore what happened canonically. And /that/ was abuse. I have a somewhat darkly humorous scene planned out where the main cast, most of whom are very protective of children or else the victims of abuse themselves (albeit usually more damaging then the form the Dursley's used) have to figure who can go get him that /won't/ likely to burn the house down.

The Art of Self-Fashioning

By: Lomonaaeren

Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1019740/1/]]

AU: "By Merlin, Albus! That boy must be moved!" What if Dumbledore took Harry away from no.4 Privet Drive, with its perfectly pruned shrubs and colour co-ordinated flower beds, to somewhere he could call home...

saving harry

by the seeker

What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse.

Stealing Harry by samvimes

Stealing Harry grabs canon by the throat and disembowls it. If Lucius Malfoy got to Peter Pettigrew before Sirius could, Sirius would be a bookshop owner, Remus would have a steady job, and one day, when Harry Potter was eight-and-a-half years old, they might kidnap him from the Dursleys

I have a few others but they are either shippy or have added violence.

********** Currently reading the story by The Seeker. It's very good, and exactly how I've always imagined it. I don't understand how people can say what the Dursleys did to Harry wasn't abusive; I can only conclude they have never been bullied. Bullying is terrible and constant, and Harry not only has a bully at school, he lives with three, two of whom are adults and legitimize the actions of the other one. Harry should be /messed up/ - although, shades of that do come through even in canon.

Anyway, what I find most realistic about The Seeker's story is that yes, I can well believe Petunia and Vernon being very careful not to leave any marks or to let themselves get caught being abusive. Abusers do that; anything to prolong their fun and nasty behavior. Some people are awfully quick to give the Dursleys the benefit of the doubt as if they weren't two adults who were horrible to one child in their care while lavishing over-the-top affection and praise on the other. They've always made me sick.

Having said that, The Seeker's story is doing a great job of making me feel some sympathy for Petunia and to see it from her angle. Again, that has its roots in canon, which I think some people fail to take into account - she is a thin, slender homemaker with no living family and no friends to speak of, who lives with a man much, much larger than her, who is the sole breadwinner, believes in traditional values, and has a bad temper and an equally horrible family. What's she to do, behind closed doors, with no support network of her own?

ps: I love seeing the Dursleys punished (so in general I like reading stories where they are worse, still it would be great actually seeing what the canon abuse did to Harry because in the books he doesn't show many signs (I'd think he'd be far less trusting and more withdrawn for example and he would not accept betrayal at all, so Ron doesn't get second and even third chances at all and Hermione doesn't get to boss him around, if he's even friends with either or both of them!))

***** *(NSFW/NSFL links are in this post, just a warning.)*

I'm going to disagree with you on one point. Vehemently. Neglect /is/ a form of abuse, not just bad behavior. It's more than just ignoring a child and it can cause [[https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/impact/development/][long term issues]]. The Dursleys might not tick all the boxes, but they are [[http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/child-neglect.html][textbook]] abusers.

Part of the reason people disagree with the "Harry is abused" narrative is because JKR glosses over the reality. In the earlier books, she played Harry's situation more for laughs than anything else, (the tone of which changed as the books "grew up" along with the readers). It's hard to blame her, considering the target audience of her books. She's the spiritual successor to Dickens and Dahl.

But anyone examining his situation through a more critical lens will find his upbringing to be undeniably disturbing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1122772][Here's]] a pretty good meta analysis on how the Dursleys treated Harry -- *NSFW/NSFL* warning as it discusses the different forms of abuse in fairly stark, clinical terms.

****** You know, considering the person you are replying to has already agreed that neglect can be abuse, right now you are basically playing semantics to look more right than them. Or at least that's how it looks to the general populace.

We do know that neglect can be abuse, and in this particular case is. The point is that in the books proper it is shown as “neglect” more than “abuse” because the books gloss over both the behaviour and the possible implications it may have to a child's development; because really, it is played for the “Cinderella” factor. And while I do disagree with the books' act of glossing over the implications---and that other people do too is why this post even is a thing, most likely---and also with Faeriniel's approach to it (because the lion's share of abuse in this case is emotional, with neglect being closely linked to it, rather than it being mostly neglect), you seem a bit too pushy there and this isn't going to make people want to actually listen to what you say.

As far as the Cinderella factor goes, I agree. That's in the second paragraph of my post above. JKR married a Dickens and Dahl approach, and that's a big part of why the series is such a draw. It's as close to a modern fairytale as I've seen.

Regarding pushiness: You might be reading too much into my post. Tone is a tricky thing on the internet, so I suppose my point didn't come across very well -- which is, basically, that if the /HP/ series is looked at from a different angle, Harry's situation with the Dursleys was pretty shitty.

And as for pushiness, well ... when I got to your comment, it already had a downvote and it did appear pushy superficially, so I wrote it more or less to let you know that this is happening and that people are taking it this way (though, considering this reply of yours, I might have failed to make it as clear as I wanted it to be; yay for the tone again).

But yeah, Harry's situation is really cruddy and regardless of how one looks at it the Dursleys are abusive pieces of ... thing, regardless of how one puts it, be it abuse, neglect, being arseholes, or whatever other way. And certainly I can subscribe to getting a clearer definition because I once spent a week ping-ponging messages with someone who made a moron out of themselves by not understanding that two homophones are not necessarily the same thing meaning-wise and that redefining one to be equal to the other does not an argument make, but I think in the case of the message you originally replied to it was a case of someone talking about the subcategories (which means that “neglect more than abuse” would mean “it's neglect as a form of abuse more than physical, emotional, or any other abuse”) rather than saying that it's not abuse altogether (at least, that's what I got from their other comments here).

Anyway, I'm ending it right now, since I seem to be starting a journey towards mental Siberia and that's going to result in a wall of text only tangentially related to anything if I let it happen.

**** So several things the Dursley's did do are 100% considered abuse by modern definitions. Fanon tends to exaggerate it however. But yes Harry doesn't actually act like an abused child. It basically stems from the fact that the first few books were more fairy taleish and having evil step parts is a pretty common trope. So the Dursley's were made basically cartoonisly evil, and as essentially caricatures/cartoons they aren't meant to be taken seriously so it doesn't actually effect harry much. It wasn't meant to be a real look on abuse, it was just there for background effect, but this gets a bit harder to reconcile as the books got more serious as they progressed.

I agree manipulative Dumbledore is stupid though. He clearly was intended to be a good character, not a manipulative one. Its just that it would mess up the plot too much if he saved the day or was overly involved in whatever that year's situation was so he didn't. In general things often happen for plot convenience rather than them being necessarily logically consistent, so it looks like things are happening too neatly which implies a manipulator behind the scenes. But there isn't one, that's just Rowling's style of writing. Which is totally fine as Harry Potter wasn't trying to be A Song of Ice and Fire, its just not that type of series. Even in Lord of the Rings stuff like this happens, e.g. the eagles not just carrying Frodo to mount doom and the book being over in only 100 pages. Well if Dumbledore figures out Quirell is Voldemort right away and stops him immediately then there isn't a book. Or if the obstacles on the way aren't perfectly situated for Harry's friends skill sets, then he can't make it to the end and have his confrontation with Quirelmort. And thematically he needs that confrontation since it makes a good story.

*** I would also add,

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.--Book 1
#+end_quote

Harry was never or rarely physically abused except by Dudley. He was only starved when he was locked in his room in Book 2. He was definitely emotionally abused and neglected, but he was mostly psychologically healthy and felt safe enough to mock the Dursleys fairly regularly, e.g. "I didn't know it had to be so wet." So he might not have presented as abused. (Disclaimer: I am neither a psychologist nor a child care worker.)

Dumbledore couldn't have involved CPS, as [[/u/onekrazykat]] mentioned, but he could have visited the Dursleys directly. That alone might have scared them into treating Harry better. I think his main mistakes were trusting Mrs. Figg to spot any problems and not visiting in person once a year or so. Because of those, he might not have know anything was wrong beyond the bad blood between Petunia and Lily. (And remember there is no canon evidence that he was monitoring Harry from his office.)

*** FRYING PAN!

(As far as I remember Petunia hit a young Harry with one!)

Also the cat flap, allowing (and actively encouraging) Duddley to harass and beat Harry (the Smelltings-Stick comes to mind, Vernon tells Dudley to hit Harry with it!), locking him in his cupboard (not to mention: Making him sleep in there in the first place!), the hand down clothes (they can afford better, but don't want to!) and the school uniform Petunia makes for him by dying another set of Duddley's old clothes (with some extremely smelly dying solution that's probably not healthy when worn daily), his bad (probably wrong prescription!) broken glasses etc. etc.

So I say that's abuse (it might not be as bad as some cases, like that Austrian man who locked his daugther up to rape her regularly and father several children with her, but that doesn't make it right or OK)

ps: They also allowed Vernon's sister to set her dog RIPPER on Harry and they let her denigrate his parents (not to mention that they themselves were doing this as well!)

ps: It's not "bashing" if you say something NEGATIVE about a character, everybody has got flaws!...hell, I like Sirius Black for example, but I think his feud with Snape (despite the fact that I don't even like Snape!) is ridiculous and saying that doesn't make it bashing!

You can have it happen "off page," for example, having [character who rescues Harry or whatever] have a private conversation in Dumbledore's office and then coming out and telling Harry that he wasn't going to be living with the Dursleys anymore. It would be understood that the adult in question (or whoever is involved in your story) had bawled him out, but it wouldn't look as bad if we didn't actually see it.

So, we have to infer what his life was /really/ like based on his perception. He was definitely abused, it is just a question of how much, and how it was done. Fics that claim he didn't know his name/ have extreme physical abuse are either non-cannon in that respect or have completely gone off the deep end.

** We have stronger requirements of parents today than Dumbledore had growing up. We consider some things abuse that we wouldn't have been concerned with in 1890.

On the other hand, Dumbledore's in a position that, nominally, should deal with children. He should be in a position to recognize the ways in which children become damaged.

On the third hand, Dumbledore doesn't exactly interact with the students much. His office is hidden and password-protected. And with Tom Riddle, he also mistook Tom being abused and reacting to the abuse with Tom being indelibly evil. He was crud when he was working with children every day; now he's terribly out of touch.

In other words, you have your work cut out for you. If you want Dumbledore to seem both competent and benign, your best bet is to violate canon. The Dursleys were moderately distant parents to Harry, and he'd probably find help in [[/r/raisedbynarcissists]], but they were okay for the most part as long as nothing funny was going on.

That leads nicely into: the kid's got his Hogwarts letter and has gone to school. He's obviously and indelibly magical, so now the abuse starts in earnest. (After the shock and fear wears off, which means it starts after first year.) Dumbledore didn't know because it wasn't happening before Hogwarts.

Though, of course, children have accidental magic so getting physically hurt is a tad harder, and as far as emotional development goes wizards are weird anyway, so it may be a bit excusable. But we do have canon evidence that he wasn't good at getting to kids fifty years back when he failed with Tom, so ... yeah, one could also just assume that he's good as a teacher or a leader or a powerful wizard but not the best when it comes to actually raising children and fulfilling their emotional needs.

*** Canon Dumbledore is competent and benign though. Its just that canon is more concerned with being thematically consistent than being logically consistent. Harry is the protagonist, so Harry saves the day. Dumbledore is just the wise background wizard who gives advice but isn't directly involved in the plot. Logically Dumbledore should be doing more, but that isn't his role in the story so he doesn't. No evil or incompetence needed to explain it. Fanfiction is welcome to take a more realistic style where lots of attention is paid to all the possible characters motivations and actions in every situation and how effect follows cause, but that simply wasn't how it was done in canon. Which is fine, as not everything needs to be super realistic, while it adds another layer of immersion, and is masterful when pulled off, its also limiting, and Harry Potter was still an enjoyable read without it.

#+end_quote

Benign, sure. Making him malevolent, or at least terribly callous, is one easy way to resolve the conflict, though. That's why I brought it up.

Competent -- someone is not omnicompetent or universally incompetent. Canon shows that Dumbledore has superb magical abilities and, if I recall, that he can teach well. He's able to quiet a room full of students quickly.

His competence in other areas is mostly unexplored.

In context, I was talking about his ability to act like a social worker in Child Services, effectively. Can he find a good home to place a child, ensure that that home remains safe for the child, and recognize signs of abuse? In canon, he demonstrably cannot.

#+begin_quote
  not everything needs to be super realistic
#+end_quote

But characters should be portrayed in a realistic way. The story should be internally consistent. It is unsatisfying to readers otherwise.

For instance, Rowling took the "child left on a doorstep" trope, removed of its original context, and added a twist and a new context without considering what it said about her characters.

Is the trope bad? No. Do only bad people leave children on doorsteps? No.

But in the standard version, you leave a child on a doorstep of the church, because it's the next best thing to an orphanage for the period when the trope was born. In the standard version, there is a good reason to avoid talking to people when dropping off the child (it's a newborn and born out of wedlock, in a society where that is more than frowned upon).

By all evidence, Rowling /did not think/ about the implications this would have on her characters. /That/ is why it's bad.

Alternatively, she /did/ think about it, in which case the rest of the narrative is inconsistent. Which is also bad.

** To address your question on Dumbledore, OP, I have to dive into interpretation of what exists and speculation of what can be inferred. But it's mostly my mish-mashed headcanon delivered in a style that's less an essay and more a mix of faintly interrelated comments.

First, the man is old. Really old. Which means that his background would be utterly alien to most Muggles' of the 1990s, not to mention most readers of the series. In the western world, the idea that children are innocents who ought to be protected from the ills of society didn't gain full traction until around the Victorian era (when Dumbledore was born). But even then, that time period was notable for childhood labor and short, grim lives for anyone who wasn't lucky enough to be born into the right class.

It also wasn't unusual at all for people of his time to view a strict childhood as a fact of life. There was a dim view of excessive kindness, which was seen as "coddling." Physical punishment would have been a given, one that few would've batted an eye at.

So, on the one hand, you have a wizard who was born in an era where the idea of children as innocents was coming into vogue; on the other hand, society hypocritically employed children in dangerous work and deemed caring too much for them as a bad thing. He also employs Snape and makes little to no effort to curb the man's behavior in the classroom.

Add to this the views of wizarding child-rearing, which can be gleaned from, oddly enough, Neville Longbottom's background. No one thinks twice of him being dropped out a window. Not even Neville. It's likely that any wizard takes the resilience of magical children for granted, and a "tough love" attitude like Augusta Longbottom's doesn't seem to raise any eyebrows. Also of note: Hogwarts Castle and its surroundings can be pretty damn dangerous at times, but there's no real safety measures, just warnings. (Hello, Forbidden Forest full of centaurs and werewolves and hungry, giant spiders.)

Danger is seen as part of wizarding childhood. Strictness isn't abnormal, it's "character-building." Muggles aren't often seen as a danger to wizards in canon; wizards are frequently a danger to Muggles. Dumbledore probably didn't think that Lily's sister would outright hate her own nephew.

And Harry doesn't exactly go around talking about his home life. I also doubt that the Dursleys would let the neighbors know how they really treat him; they work very hard to maintain a facade of respectability. They know what they are doing is wrong, which is highlighted when they immediately move Harry from the cupboard to a bedroom once the wizards contact him. They didn't want to get in trouble for mistreating him.

All in all, I think most of it is generational and cultural differences paired with a touch of ignorance.

** Dursleys are cartoonish step parents in the style of Roald Dahl, used largely for comic relief and to set up a contrast with the wonderful wizarding world to which Harry is invited, and except for the act of taking him in, their actions have no consequences whatsoever for Harry's personality or the plot.

So, I'd suggest treating what abuse you can infer as the prosaic analogue of cartoon violence, no more "serious business" than Bugs Bunny dropping an anvil on Daffy Duck's head.

** Yes, Harry was abused. It was horrible and dreadful. But it never came close to being life threatening. Had he not had the blood protection, his life would have been threatened. He would have been dead. Dumbledore couldn't step in and stop the abuse, because it likely would have ended with Harry being tossed out. Or Harry being removed from the house by the equivalent of CPS. Both would have been death sentences. You could play it as the lesser of two evils in Dumbledore's mind. He didn't want to subject Harry to the abuse/neglect but the alternative was much worse.

** Although technically less interesting than exploring themes of child abuse, you can explore supernatural reasons for their behavior. Perhaps Dumbledore /couldn't/ check on Harry personally or allow other magicals to do so because the presence of magicals would interfere with the blood protection in some way (thus a squib monitor). Perhaps the Dursleys behavior is explained by exposure to the scarcrux or perhaps Harry's early accidental magic was a real daily threat to the Dursleys (and their infant son) until they found something that worked (darkness and confinement).

** might try something with Dumbledore's age and Figgy status as a squib. Albus was a kid about 1880. Oliver Twist was published in the 1830s to 1840's. Orphans didn't have an easy row to hoe 130 years ago. Harry's treatment wouldn't have been extreme in that time period. Figgy was a squib, squibs were often disowned and abandoned if not outright killed.

They were both good people (in your story) and might hope Harry would find a true home but when he didn't, they wouldn't have been shocked given their life experiences. remember Ariana.

As far as Figgy's reports, Harry's protection at #4 is vague enough that you can make non-interference with the Dursleys a condition of placement either due to how Albus set the protection charm or conditions the Dursleys imposed on the acceptance.

That said.. I don't believe it. It would take me a long time to dig up the exact quote so allow the paraphrasing of Albus talking to Harry in the latter books.. 'I never dreamed such a person would come into my *hands*..' I'm sure he said hands.
