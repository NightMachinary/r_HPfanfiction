*** I believe it was written during the DH was published (so it can react to it in some parts), but yes, it is AU to DH. What's more important, it is really good. I have written [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][elsewhere]] that *ALL* fanfiction stories could be cut in half for the general improvement. That is not true about this story. Author of this mentions help of some professional editor as a beta-reader and it shows. Story flows rather well, and there are few pages I felt need to skip. Really good story, highly recommended.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Ginny fit in very well under Grindelwald's leadership. [[/spoiler][They didn't really search for Horcruxes, but captured Voldemort and tortured their locations out of him. When the Goblins refused to give up the Cup, they stormed Gringotts and killed most of the Goblins.]]

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]]: It's a crossover with BtVS. Ginny gained the Slayer power and took the lead in Horcrux hunt. She did most of the heavy lifting, but the others made major contributions too.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
