I know this isn't really the right place, but I don't know where to ask. I repeatedly searched for a star wars fanfiction community or websites like hp fanfiction for starwars. I know there is some on ff.net but you know how it is to find something good there.


** I don't know, but perhaps you could also ask in [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]

There are people there interested in many different fandoms.

*** This is your best bet. We don't have a specific Star Wars sub listed on our references there, but I know there are several Star Wars writers there that may have some direction for you.

** I don't know about other places, but I don't think there is one on Reddit. There are a few inactive/dead subs though so maybe someone can attempt to revive one or create a new one?

[[/r/starwarsfanfiction]] - very inactive, but also seems to have restrictive rules like no nsfw or adult content

[[/r/swfanfictionarchive]] - even more inactive

** Have you checked the Space Battle's forums? They often have Star wars fanfictions on their site, some of which is cross posted to FF.net. I would warn that the star wars stuff I've seen there tends to stay away from the movies' events and more towards game or EU/Legend areas.

**** Unless someone has made a list for you then I think the best you can do is sort the threads by views and hope that is an indicator of quality.

** Well, I know of a very active erotic Star Wars fanfiction community, if you're into that. It's got a nice archive and people are glad to give recs of their favorites. PM me if you want a link to it.
