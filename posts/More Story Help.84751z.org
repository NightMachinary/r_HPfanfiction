So, my newest OC (yes, another new one. I just get inspired easily) is the second cousin of the Weasley's on Molly's side. Her name is Melody Prewett, she's an American witch younger than both Bill and Charlie.

She starts off the story three months pregnant with her current boyfriend's child in August 1997. They attend Bill's wedding in the UK and the boyfriend somehow ends up cheating on her with one of Fleur's veela cousins.

What's a believable way Melody can find out that he cheated on her since nobody really saw them and her boyfriend is too much of a coward to tell her?

Is Melody a proper name for a Prewett cousin?


** I just ask, what is the purpose of the OC

** Melody is a plausible name as such. I like it. Some might feel it strays a bit too near to an Over-The-Top Mary-Sue Name, but I like it.

*** Yeah. Though, it might not fit that she was born in the 1970s America. It was the first name that came to mind. I'm open to a change though.

**** You don't think Melody is a name someone would give their child in the twilight of the primary hippy era in America?

***** Although, Melody is part of a former 'Scared 28' family. I'm picturing her as a half-blood though.
