  Sirius Black in a moment of strange clarity, in midst of all the confusion & madness, asked, "Is that a Time-Turner?" A single line & suddenly deep down in her subconscious, Hermione felt as if some huge grand play had been interrupted, as if a monkey-wrench had been thrown in the cosmic cogwheel of fate & storytelling.
