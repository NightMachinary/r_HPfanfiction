I'm looking for a fic where Dumbledore is doing his thing, but Harry knows about it and knows it's the best way. Whether or not it /is/, I'm OK with. Also ok with him being convinced it isn't good.


** The Dumbledore in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is totally Manipulative!GreaterGood, and the kids have also figured that out, and yet they went along with his plan.
