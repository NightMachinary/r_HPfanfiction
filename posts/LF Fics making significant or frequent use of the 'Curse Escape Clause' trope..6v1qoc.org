You know, deadly venoms that have a very specific antidote...wait.

Uh, monstrous creatures or dark lords that can only be slain by certain prophesied people...wait again...

Uh, a curse being broken by true love's kiss? Sans the kiss, swap 'broken' for 'deflected'...

Alright, so from a certain point of view Harry Potter is already full of this trope already.

Nevertheless, does anyone know any fics where a great big curse, with a correspondingly big way to break it, is significant to the plot?

I know that the Dangerverse series has a bit about breaking a Britain-wide spell that allows someone's blood status to be identified, and I bet there's a bunch of harem fics out there that involve 'True Love's Kiss' (or True Love's decidedly less chaste activities)...


** In Seventh Horcrux, the curse on the Defense position had one such clause: the curse would only be lifted if someone was hired that was as suited for the job as Voldemort himself was when he applied.

*** If i remember it right, [[/spoiler][Harrymort also locked the Room of Requirement, and Draco Malfoy had to do multiple quests to unlock it]], although this was not the focus of the story.

** The Last Mage of Krypton Series has a clause in the Defense curse that anyone wearing the Dark Mark is immune to it, and Voldemort creates an amulet that specifically renders the wearer immune. (Narcissa gets it first, and she gives it to Sirius in the third installment.)
