I've recently read "Too far from home" by 'story2tell' and "In Another Place" by 'whats up with jeremiah' and both stories in their own way see Canon Harry sent to another universe, a parallel world where his parents are alive, he has siblings, Harry is in a different house ecc... Eventually the people of this other world find out the truth about him. Both stories were really good but unfortunately unfinished and they left me wanting to read more.

Do you know other fics like this?

(Possibly complete fics, but just long ones are okay too)


** Linkao3(C'est La Vie) It's not finished but it's pretty good, the Harry meets Lily and James is only a subplot, and they don't know he is their son.

Linkffn(Across the Universe) It's a one shot from James perspective

Linkao3(The Second String) Harry ends up in a different dimension thinking that he time travels, so he pretends to be a squib.

Linkao3(Dimension Hoppers) A good work based in C'est La Vie, alone is a simple work, but if you're a fan of C'est la vie is pretty good

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** There is a fanfic called Paralells - it is an OP harry fanfiction where Lily is alive (have no idea how to link). Think Stepping back and Delenda Est also feature alive Potters, but that might not count since it is time travel (In Stepping back he is friends with them, and in Delenda Est they are also featured quite a bit, not the major focus of either story tho)

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
