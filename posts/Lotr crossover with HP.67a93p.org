So, I really don;t know much about lotr. I saw the movies when I was little. But an idea came onto me. I thought it would be kinda interesting to read about something that combined these two worlds together. I would prefer if a character from either books somehow teleported into another. But not necessarily.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][Steelbadger]] writes the best HP/LOTR crossovers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), is finished and pairs Harry with Eowyn.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]], linkffn(11115934), is WIP and has a original plot.

--------------

However, Steelbadger only likes to have Harry going to other universes alone. For those who want to see more HP characters in the LOTR universe, the choice is quite limited. The only I like so far is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/Failsafe][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891). Unfortunately, that story looks abandoned.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** These are the only two fics I've found that do the crossover right:

linkffn(11027086; 11115934)

Most other fics are just unreadable to me. Either they're crack, or they're based on the Peter Jackson fanfic movies instead of the books, or they have Harry as an Elf and paired with Legolas and Aragorn and Bard and Boromir etc.

  After the Second Wizarding War, Harry goes to Middle Earth for a little R&R away from it all. He was told it was peaceful. He was wrong. He then spends four years fighting in the North. When the Ring is discovered, a war for the sake of two worlds begins with Harry at it's centre. I own neither LOTR or Harry Potter and would be a good deal richer if I did. THE SEQUEL IS NOW UP.

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.
