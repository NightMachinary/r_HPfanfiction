:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic and all I can remember is Lucius Malfoy teaches politics or traditions or something like that. Hermione gets offended in the class and refuses to follow traditions. Thanks


** Don't remember one with Lucius but there's a great one where Umbridge teaches tradition in fifth year and Hermione gets really mad at her.

Lucius Malfoy starts it all by influencing the ministry to create the tradition class but he doesn't see much action apart from being blown away by the combined anger of Hermione and a bunch of other muggleborns.

** I believe that is Formans Familia by Michally, in that fic, Lucius teaches politics, and Hermione thinks it is stupid.

Fic is hard to find, since author has taken it down, and it is a slash fic as well (Harry x Lucius).
