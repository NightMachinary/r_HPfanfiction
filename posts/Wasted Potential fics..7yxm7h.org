** wind sheer. Pretty much everything about that fic is just squandered potential, to the point where I can't even classify it as a good fic.

** I've gotta agree on the Albus Potter series. Some great concepts, good worldbuilding and interesting OCs and then the author had some personal problems and just rushed the last book. Felt like it could have been twice as long, so many missed plot points and ignored characters/details.

** The 3rd book in the Firebird Trilogy. The world building and the matriarchial society is awesome, but the ending feels a bit off. Some of the darkness is a bit over the top and Harry has too many powers. Overall incredible AU but it has its issues.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of the Starship]], linkffn(7135971), still remains the only non crossover 'Wizards in space' story. The author had some really good ideas, but totally rushed the last third, and turned it into a ridiculous Star Wars crossover.

Also "Time Heals all Wounds", but that's a personal preference. It just feels like a pointless story to me... I don't deal well with that kind of Nihilism: [[/s][Spoiler]]

** Yes I vote Harry Potter Methods of Rationality. :( If the science stuff was not so crazy complicated and impossible to understand for me I might have even liked the plots and characters and also even jerk Harry version. :( Because yes I did ENJOY how Harry and McGonagall interacted, and I did ENJOY the forest battle scenes, and I did ENJOY the Azkaban escape scene, and I did ENJOY that Quirrell was so in depth...

But all the confusing complex science talk made me frustrated and upset to the point that I didn't want to read it anymore. :( I couldn't understand what was going on with all of that. :(

Yes please can someone make a version of the story that just cuts out all the science stuff?
