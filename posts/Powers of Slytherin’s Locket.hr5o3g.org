Slytherin's Locket is described as having “all sorts of powers” by Hepzibah Smith in HBP, but we never actually get to see what those were, other than the ones presumably bestowed upon it by being a horcrux. What abilities would you grant it?


** I'd have it act as a key to bypass the protections on the original Hogwarts preventing apparition. I'd have this be a defunct ability, however, as the protections would have been changed over the years.

I'd also have the locket allow for easier and more compulsion of snakes. Magical snakes would go from being able to refuse a parselmouth's request to being forced to at least consider it.

I'd also have the locket grant a slighter compulsion over other people to respect and follow the bearer of the locket. If the diadem granted wisdom, and the sword only appeared to those with courage, I think it'd be thematically fitting for the locket to aid in matters of ambition and cunning, namely convincing other people to do what you want.

I do think the abilities would be largely useless with the presence of the Horcrux and the additional protections placed upon the horcrux by Voldemort. Even if the Horcrux could be removed without damaging the artifact, the remaining enchantments would still interfere.

** Diadem - Enhanced wisdom and ability to learn.

Sword - gained abilities from slain enemies and appears when someone is brave enough to do what needs to be done.

Given that Salazar was a ‘for descendants only' man. He gave any heir the chamber with a basilisk and one can use it but a parcelmouth.

Definitely manipulation, maybe power amplification.

It was most likely a ‘here is a cheat.'

The truest mystery is that cup.

Not really the only reason it absorbed the basilisk venom was because that was goblin silver... A goblin silver SPOON could do that theoretically... So that's not really a power

**** It's the symbolism. A sword that gains power from the enemies you've slain and appears in moments of true bravery.

It's not intricate. They are just important artifacts from historical figures. Historical figures with an extreme love of dramatics.

***** Yea but we can assume that the diadem was enchanted to help the person that wears it think maybe it acts like a amplifier of sorts or maybe it helps you recall things like a memory boost... But the sword only appears on a moment of bravery (and as far as we know only if the fucking sorting hat is also there)

****** They aren't really acknowledged beyond being artifacts.

The sword is goblin-made and the Sorting Hat was originally just his hat.

Rowena was extremely smart and the diadem was an impressive creation that no one could recreate. She made a symbolic magical artifact. With her intellect, she made something incredible and symbolic to help increase wisdom.

It's all just symbolic. You pull Gryffindor's Sword out of his old hat when in a moment of true bravery. It's just his really good sword. Symbolism.

Salazar shoved a useful ‘heirs only' chamber with a giant super weapon only his heirs could use. You got manipulation and dark arts locket and a basilisk. Be useful and continue my legacy. Just his selfishness and ‘I will not let this go even though I'm dead,” attitude.

Helga Hufflepuff though....mystery.

** It's a locket, so it would be interesting if it had a small portrait in it of Slytherin. We know the locket can only be opened by a parselmouth, so then Slytherin could pass his secrets on to his "heir" directly. Like where the chamber is and how to open it as well as other Hogwarts secrets that he might have known like the RoR.

Alternatively it could be a portrait of someone important to him, like a wife or something, and they could impart what they know. Or a group shot of the founders who then squabble like school children.

I would assume making a portrait a horcrux would destroy the faux consciousness that portraits have leaving the locket pretty useless.
