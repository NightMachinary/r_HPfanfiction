She quickly looked around to get her bearings ."Wait a minute,this is the Ravenclaw Common Room"

A short robed figure walked up "Yes,Ms.Lovegood" it was the squeaky voice of Professor Flitwick"Welcome to your initation;forgive the bag and rope;traditional procedure."

Another figure spoke up in the voice of Padma Patil"We should give her a quick crash course,Professor. She's rather shockingly misinformed about what we do here in Rotfang"


** Eh, not my best work, but I had fun with it.

"You're trying to take over the Ministry!" Luna shouted, straining against the ropes that bound her to a very sturdy chair. She wiggled her fingers uselessly. Her captors were clever--the knots were tied where she couldn't reach in spite of all her squirming.

"We are not!" Padma protested. "I take severe offense to your slander!"

Her arms were tied, but Luna tried kicking her legs--her feet weren't restrained! She kicked Padma in the leg and Luna noticed her feet were bare, The Rotfang Conspiracy had joined forces with the Nargles to steal her shoes!

Oh wait, she'd been barefoot earlier. She remembered now; her shoes hadn't been lost, just her shoelaces, so she had decided to forgo footwear entirely. Usually Luna found sans shoes a rather pleasurable experience, but when one was bound to a chair bare feet weren't effective means of defense, against multiple opponents.

Two other hooded figures each grabbed one of her kicking feet and despite her best attempts to wiggle free, they were able to grab her every time. Though it almost certainly wasn't their intention, the hooded figures' repeated grabbing of her feet resulted in a rather ticklish ordeal. Again, what was usually an experience Luna enjoyed was less than ideal.

Luna's unwanted giggling betrayed her and she found her legs pulled out straight in front of her, her ankles tied together, her toes the only thing she could move.

Luna glared at her captors.

"It isn't slander!" Luna cried. "You won't get away with this! Mmmph!"

Padma shoved a scarf into Luna's mouth and tied in behind her head, muffing her screams. Luna felt her wand being yanked from behind her ear.

"Padma!" Flitwick squeaked. "That is hardly necessary!"

"On the contrary, Professor--If she is unable to heed our warnings without interrupting, then it is only logical that we restrict her speech."

"Mmph!"

"No, I am not undoing the gag!"

"Mmmph! Mmmph! Gggmm!"

"No! You can have your wand back after we tell you what we really do! And I am not under the Imperius Curse!"

"Mmmph! Mmmph! Amwwm!"

"No, I am not untying your legs. You kicked me in the shin!"

"Mmmph! Mmmph!"

"I have never had a cavity in my life! Hermione was the one who needed braces!"

"Mmmph! Mmmph!"

"Don't bring Parvati into this!"

"Mmmph! Mmmph!"

"I don't care if your nose itches!"

"Mmmph!"

"I am /this/ close to putting a Permanent Sticking Charm on the gag, Luna."

"That is enough!" Flitwick squealed. "Now, Luna, please, you are my favorite student."

"Hey!" One of the hooded figures snaked down his hood. Michael Corner. "How can she be your favorite?"

"She has a delightfully creative mind."

"Creatively ridiculous, more like."

"Mmmph ummm mmmppp."

The color drained from Michael's face.

"No, Luna. Please, please, please do not tell Ginny about this. She'll use the Bat Bogey Hex...and other meaner hexes...please don't tell her we kidnapped you and tied you up and gagged you and took your wand...oh Merlin, we're doomed."

"Mister Corner, if you cannot be still, you can go stand guard."

Flitwick smiled at Luna and waddled over to a small bag. What instruments of torture were in there?

Flitwick pulled out a small stuffed rabbit.

"I find that new recruits are calmer and more reflective of our goals when they get to hold Flopsy."

Flitwick set Flopsy in Luna's lap, in such a way that Luna could have had a staring contest with the stuffed animal had she been so inclined.

"Now dear, I think you might be responsive to our goals. We of the Rotfang Conspiracy do not seek to take over the Ministry. We seek to remove it entirely. In the name of freedom."

** Funnily enough, I had the idea for a prompt where Luna and Hermione are kidnapped by nefarious members of the Rotfang.

Luna for exposing them, Hermione for being the daughter of dentists.

But this idea makes me giggle.

** "You should be ashamed," Luna said, shaking her head. "Calling yourself a community that cares?"

"Oh, but we do care, Luna," Professor Flitwick said.

"It's all about the greater good," Cho added.

"THE GREATER GOOD," Ravenclaw chanted.
