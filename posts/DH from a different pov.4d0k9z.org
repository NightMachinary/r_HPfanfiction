I recently read Not From Others by FloreatCastellum and absolutely loved it. I was wondering if there are any other well-written stories out there of the seventh book from someone else's pov. I'm not really looking for another Ginny pov simply because I just don't think it could get any better than Not from Others (which is basically canon for me now). Instead, I'd be really really interested in an Order member's perspective. Maybe one of the Weasleys or Kingsley or some other older person who was heavily involved in the war.

If there's anything like this, please let me know. Thank you!

  What are you going to do?" she asked softly. "I'm going to fight back." Percy replied calmly. What Percy was really up to during Deathly Hallows. Teaming up with some unlikely allies, he tries to bring the persecuted to freedom... and stay alive.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

** Another fanfiction I enjoyed about DH from different pov is "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness". It's from Neville's POV, so we see the entire year from inside Hogwarts. But it is rather in depth and explores the story of many minor characters, so even though I really loved it, it's more of a story on its own. But it is really well written, and I couldn't say if I liked Not from Others or this one better. (and I should probably add that it has some gory scenes ;-) )

*** Obligatory "but DAYD is the absolute worst fanficion ever written!"

I personally enjoyed it, though. And the sequel, even if the sequel gets rather un-canon-y.
