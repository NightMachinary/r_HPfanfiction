I'm currently sketching out ideas for a fic, and in the midst of deciding if I want to do a full rewrite or start at a common point of divergence. As I'm going through Harry's year two, it's occurring to me that there doesn't seem to be a real reason (that I can remember) why the basilisk only attacks people one at a time. You'd think it would be capable of slithering into the Great Hall during a meal and go wild. Even if it didn't want to attack the whole student body at once, you'd think it would at least go after groups.

Also, do the teachers know what the monster is at all? If they know it's as dangerous at a basilisk, why leave the school open? If they don't, what other creatures are capable of petrifying people?


** In canon, Diarymort says he wasn't interested in killing Muggle-borns anymore. And appearing in the Great Hall would put all he purebloods at risk too, it's not like Riddle know who's "pure" or not from looking at them.

***** Dairymort actually seems to hate his father more for, according to him, abandoning his mother when he learned she was a witch. Not saying he wasn't a supremacist (obviously was) but I suspect part of it was motivated by what he thought would work politically to bolster his esteem.

If it was just behaving like a predator, I could see it, but remember it is being controlled by Diary!Riddle. For Diary!Riddle, the goal stopped being "kill all muggleborns" not long after Ginny started writing in the diary but became "Harry Potter must die." It's all about creating a situation that gets Harry alone, ready to be killed and done in such a way that makes it seem like it wasn't Voldemort's fault. Larger attacks do nothing to benefit this situation.

No. Hermione is the only one to figure it out because she had the clue that the teachers didn't have (Harry hearing a voice no one else could hear).

** Could it have to do with where the pipes are? Since the basilisk travels through the pipes in the walls, it can only get out at certain places. If the goal is to attack and get away, the attacks would need to be near the entrance/exit points so that it could hit and run.

**** I believe that if 12 year old Harry could kill it with a sword (with help from a Phoenix that scratched out its eyes), then bursting into the Great Hall would be the last thing it did. Sure the death toll would be horrific, but it would most certainly be slain by the teachers, particularly if the more competent ones were there (Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, or Flitwick could probably kill it singlehandedly).

It's advantage seems to be the element of surprise and that the people it attacked are mostly students with limited combat experience. Without these two advantages, it becomes a formidable but mortal foe.

** Well...the attack itself would probably go perfectly, if you wanted to just kill lots of students and teachers, destabilise magical Britain, get your name in the history books, and assassinate Dumbledore & Harry Potter under the cover of killing everybody.\\
It's difficult for it to go wrong on approach; any students, teachers, ghosts or house-elves who witnessed the basilisk approaching the Great Hall would likely be killed or petrified. Though paintings could be trouble, depending on how fast their occupants can move between frames and whether they can reach the Great Hall, or warn others in the path of the basilisk in time.

...But then what? 99% of the school's population has been killed off, including all of the teachers. With two of the biggest thorns in his side presumably dead, Tom Riddle can presumably take Ginny back to the Chamber of Secrets and suck out her life at leisure.\\
But, if this wasn't the first strike (and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11029663/6/Promotion][here's a nice first strike for you, in this chapter]] ), there's that message on the wall (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED) that's basically advertising Voldemort (the heir of Slytherin) is behind it.\\
Hogwarts would become a quarantine zone, Tom Riddle would have great difficulty escaping without being detected by Aurors.\\
If he did escape, there'd be the problem that the children of most of his inner circle just became collateral damage; he would have very few pureblood followers left, if any, and his ability to recruit other magical creatures would be curtailed without their support. AND there would be Aurors actively hunting for him.

So, I guess Tom Riddle's options were, resurrect himself, completely destroy Hogwarts and his greatest enemies at the cost of revealing himself and being constantly hunted and losing all of his followers, or resurrect himself, somewhat-destroy Hogwarts (remember that the school was due to be shut down anyway with Ginny's disappearance) and stay under the radar for as long as he wanted, at the cost of letting Dumbledore (but not Harry) survive for the time being.

The fact of the matter is that the two most knowledgeable sources for information regarding the chamber both concur that Salazar was a bit of a racist and that the purpose of "Slytherin's Monster" was to purge the school. Now, you could argue that "Legends change with retelling," all you want - and perhaps you're not wrong - but at least it has /some basis/ in history. Whereas the counter possibility pointed at above is a completely /fanon/ possibility /never once/ mentioned by any character or narrative in the books. Which one is /more likely/ to be true?

You'd probably argue that such a thing is fanon, but it has /just as much evidence/ to support it in canon as "The purpose of the basilisk was to protect Hogwarts in case of an attack." Namely, none.

JKR says that the original purpose of the chamber was perhaps to simply secretly teach spells from upon by the others, and later used to house the Basilisk before he left. Ignoring the obvious reason is a bit silly, honestly.

** There's a fic that's a dimension travel in which Mirror Harry, under both Voldemort and Dumbledore's order, sets the basilisk loose on Hogwarts, killing a bunch of people (there's more to it than it sounds, it isn't a dark edgy Harry just for the sake of being a dark edgy Harry) and forcing the school to close.

Its hands down, one of my favourite dimension travel fics, because of the world development, the plot itself, both Harry's (there's Mirror Harry and Canon Harry, and its quite confusing at times) personalities, combined with CanonHarry's character development, Dumbledore's actually being a ruthless manipulator, without that whole fanon idiocy of MoG, a Voldemort so entrenched in Dark Arts that it makes canon Voldy seems like a unicorn, and a pretty unique and different, though reasonably, closer to canon Lily.

I went completely out on a tangent, but if you're interested, check it out, its called Imprisioned Realm.
