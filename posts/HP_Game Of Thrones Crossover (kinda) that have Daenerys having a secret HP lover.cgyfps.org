Whether the HP characters are stranded in the GoT Universe or vice-versa or the GoT are "visiting" Britain like in a Triwizard Tournament Business.

Although i thought that a HP character meets her in GoT, shows his potential an becomes her secret Lover. I mean by that his total presence would only be known by her and she can have "official" lovers, but the HP one stays hidden...and no, not because they really love each other. The Reasons why he keeps hidden can vary, but real love isnt what im looking for, atleast not on both sides.

Thinking about it, i would accept a Female Lover aswell...possibly even a Threesome. As long as they stay hidden....and i think its easier to do that by a single person.

​

It doesnt matter, if the GoT follows its Book/Series Canon or follows its own route. So a Deanerys who is a Queen would also be accepted.

​

Ok, now i think about going a bit stray by this....but her Lover also having an affair with an other female Character of GoT would also be ok (If Dany finds out, what i am certain, she wouldnt mind, as long as she is his First Priority). I think this would be easier, if she "employs" him as some sort of Advisor.

But this is totally optional and the focus should stay on Dany. I hope something as this exist.
