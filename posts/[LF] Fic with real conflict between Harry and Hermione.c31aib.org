I would rather it be an ideological conflict. There shouldn't be a right answer. Whether they make up or not doesn't matter, so long as they aren't bashed.

#+begin_quote
  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.

**** I was completely sarcastic, but read that linked essay ... in all Harmony stories, the relationship between Harry & Hermione is somewhere between poorly written and horrificly unbelievable. Even in Harmony stories I like (e.g., linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof)) the relationship between these two is worst part: so absolutely perfect as unbelievable. And both authors obviously can write a way better: Percy & Audrey in the first story (and in linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities); because of these I firmly hold this Audrey as my headcanon, yes, she must be a Muggle) is one of the best relationships in HP fanfiction I know about.

In the latter story mentioned above Cho Chan tries seduce Harry in absolutely disgusting way, and Harry cannot stop himself to kiss her, once and briefly, before he runs away. He is broken and distraught for weeks and he decided, he is so dirty, he is not worthy of Hermione evermore. It could be just fun anecdote of silly inexperienced teenager, but it was the biggest and only conflict in whole book.

Harmony is just a Hollywood-originated wet dream about two perfect persons being together making the most perfect relationship. Give me Snape × Petunia anytime! Or Ron × Hermione ... a way more interesting and readworthy.

***** Funny thing is that Hermione in the books is just as flawed as Ron is, moreso if you consider the lack of character development.

I'd argue that Ron deserves not to be put down and attacked with birds.

Snape and Petunia are two characters cut from the same cloth. Spiteful, jealous, and unable to let go of the past. That's an unholy union.

****** Yes, of course, both Snape and Petunia are completely disgusting characters. However, if there is a possibility of such thing as repentance and conversion, it would be a nice story to walk with them through it. And yes, it would be long and painful story.

Concerning birds, do you think that he cared after his experience with being poisoned?

And yes, of course, she is flawed; Harmony is mostly based on films, not on books.

******* I'm just sick of the Ron bashing in fics.

Hermione was a better friend to Harry in the books. I'll admit that. She stuck with him, albeit being a bit boring and generally had his best interests in mind.

However, in the Ron/Hermione dynamic, Ron gets the raw end of the stick in the later books.

******** I'm not even sure of that. Harry and Ron got exactly 2 "big" conflicts in the book (when he got chosen for the Tournament and when he leaves them ). One of them was when he almost died and under the influence of a Horcruxe (not to mention he just wanted to cool his head, if not for his lack of luck and Harry décision to leave instantly, he would have been back the same day, he just wanted to cool his head )

Harry also had 2 conflicts with Harry (3rd year when she snitches about the firebolt, and 6th year with the HBP book ). Except in both case, she maintains she was right and doesnt ask for forgiveness like Ron.

For the rest they are both excellent friends ready to sacrifice thelselves for Harry. But I think Harry prefer to spend time with Ron because Quidditch > Library.

If anything, the worst friend of the 3 is probably Harry with his brooding mood and his (justified ) mood swings.

I disagree about Harry being the worst friend, but he's probably the most volatile when pushed. But he is definitely dependable in a tight situation. Harry was crapped on in canon because of his passive attitude.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Hermione is expelled after Malfoy and a few other Slytherins frame her for theft.

She decides to take revenge by becoming a cat burglar and actually robbing them until they're ruined.

Harry decides to take revenge by becoming an auror and arresting them the next time they try anything unlawful.

Neither inform the other of their plans until it's too late, and they end up fighting each other (although Harry doesn't know that it's Hermione under the mask).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
