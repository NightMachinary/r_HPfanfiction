I am looking for a fic like Weapons of Dark and Light by Noyoki. So one where Harry or anyone else becomes stripped of all emotion and becomes a weapon or a bodyguard without inhibitions. I don't mind if slash, het or gen. I don't mind if it is a crossover. The idea is just so good that I need more material along the same lines.

Damn Updates!

  What if Sirius Black had raised Harry to be a warrior. What if he defeated Voldemort, and then had to face a bigger challenge. Going to Hogwarts for the first time.

  Stripped of his humanity, Logan became Weapon X. When the doctors were through; he was little more than a remote controlled beast guided by base instinct. In contrast, Harry became Weapon IX and was stripped of his human trappings. Care, love, and compassion were torn from him, creating a superb machine who kills without remorse. Is that all they will ever be? /Slash/
