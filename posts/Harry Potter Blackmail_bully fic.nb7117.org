*/Are there any stories where one (or more) of the Slytherins (Draco, Blaise, Theo) get something on Harry and blackmail him into doing what they say?/*

Dark themes, slash (preferred, but Gen is okay), forced proximity, and humiliation are all okay.

Like I want them ordering him to sit with them in the Great Hall. Maybe hangout with their group in the Lib or in their common room. I defiantly want angst and drama. Like maybe Draco ordering Harry to spend more time with him and less with Ron and Hermione and they keep reaching out to him and he runs off or avoids them.

I'd like whatever they caught him doing (maybe dark magic?) to be something bad enough that he can't reach out to Dumbledore or one the professors. I'd really like it to have a Dom/sub feel like maybe he starts to like some of the orders and they notice and do it intentionally.

I've read a few Tom/Harry stories where Harry ends up in the past and Tom is controlling and possessive and he uses his influence over the other students to control Harry. One if which ( I wish I could remember which) has him ordering Harry to sit at his feet in the Slytherin common room (I think Harry was sorting there) while Tom and his friends hang out. It had him first forcing Harry to sit and then him running his fingers through Harry's hair and Harry eventually falling asleep against his leg. And I loved it and would love something like that in a blackmail fic.

I'm looking for a Draco, Blaise, Theo one because I really want to see Harry pulling away from his friends, in the time travel ones he is alone, I'd also really like them getting him into dark magic and maybe even joining them. IDK
