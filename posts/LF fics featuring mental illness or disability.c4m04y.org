something more fleshed out than "the hereditary Black madness" or a few vague sentences where symptoms are equated with Evil™. no harem fics (ugh,) no creepy student-teacher relationships, no incest, no noncon. preferably no modern AUs unless they're really well written.

(examples: works by LadyAltair on FF, certain bits of The Anti-Heroine, Rebuilding by Colubrina, the epilogues to The Changeling, Session Transcripts, etc.)


** Here's one where I believe Harry has DID. I haven't actually gotten a chance to read this yet because there's so much already on my to read list, but I've heard some good things about it. It's complete and I think there's a sequel to it. Broken Mind, Fractured Soul by SensiblyTainted Linkffn(2529586)

** This is a short one but good, Snarry with a blind Harry. Linkao3(3673248) (Note that the non-con that's warned is a past experience, not part of the fic or perpetrated by the main characters. And this is post war and Harry is an adult. )

I know I have a couple more in my library somewhere (Drarry where Harry is blind but uses seeing magic to “see”, plus I swear I have one where Harry is physically disabled in some manner, maybe a Snarry) but don't have the time to look right now. I can later if you're interested.

  Harry is blind. He meets a stranger (Severus) in a bar, they begin a relationship while Severus uses a different name. Does Harry know that his stranger is really Severus or is Severus' identity revealed by someone else or Severus himself later on?

** “The Unfixables” linkffn(11262352), features Barty Crouch being mentally ill and him struggling with that in addition to other problems if I remember right. The story's paring is Barty/Luna if that matters at all, however.

  When let off from Azkaban on a second chance, Barty Crouch Jr becomes Xenophilius Lovegood's worst nightmare, back to haunt him and his daughter. In order to fulfill forgotten vows, an ex-murderer and a war heroine are brought together in unconventional circumstances, leading to an unexpected romance. NOT an arranged marriage fic. Warnings enclosed within. COMPLETE!

** Linkffn(the Bureaucratic Error by iniga). A Remus time travel AU. Divergence begins with PoA/the Shrieking Shack, so it's a post-Azkaban Sirius who deals with PTSD. (Background unless it's a chapter from his POV).

It's one of very few fan fics I've read where a character has a specifically diagnosed muggle mental illness that doesn't feel forced or awkward.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
