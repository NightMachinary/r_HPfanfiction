** Well, now you've given me an idea. A world where the Dursleys succeeded in stamping the magic out of Harry. ALL the magic.

A Harry who has no more sense of wonder, or compassion, or give-a-damn ability, just goes through the routine of childhood; moving, eating, pooping, and not giving a fuck about anything else whatsoever. Even the most amazing, extraordinary things never get anything more than a raised eyebrow, an eye roll or a 'whatever' from him. He is literally the most detached, dismissive person on Earth.

And, this attitude, this strange change in the fabric of Harry's being, goes far beyond making Harry not-magic; it makes him Anti-Magic. Spells don't work under his gaze, illusions and notice-me-nots aren't even acknowledged by him, and even the terrible Killing Curse simply fails to work in the face of his don't-give-a-shit-ness.

How will Professor McGonagall react when the thing she tries to transfigure to prove magic to Harry Potter instead puffs and gives a 'meh'? How will the students act when the Sorting Hat gives up and has a nap in the middle of the Sorting after being placed on Harry's head? When the entire crop of first years find their wands failing with the sounds of dismissive raspberries? When potions fail to react during brewing? When the centaurs drop their mystical comments and don't even give a damn about Firenze being saddled up?

In short, what happens when a don't-give-a-fuck Harry, whose don't-give-a-fuck is so powerful it exudes a don't-give-a-fuck miasma that causes the very magic around his being to shut down, is exposed to the poor Wizarding World?

*** I'm afraid to think what would happen when this version of Harry met Luna... She'd probably try to hand him a copy of /The Quibbler/ and it would burst into flame and her dirigible plum earrings would shrivel into prunes and then she'd run off in tears because she'd never seen anyone with so little compassion or wonder in their life.

*** I think don't-give-a-fuck of this magnitude would even be able to pierce a Somebody Else's Problem field. I haven't heard of such a story but the premise is intriguing. Just don't let Harry near anything under an expansion charm.

**** But you'd think that a SEP field would work super well. Why would this Harry give two shits about somebody else's problem?

*** Harry's "I don't give a fuck" attitude in this story is absolutely legendary.

On a different note, I highly recommend every story Athey has written, even if he/she has a chronic habit of never finishing stories.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
