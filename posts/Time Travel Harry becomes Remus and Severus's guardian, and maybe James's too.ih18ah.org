:END:
Harry's family is murdered - Ginny and the kids. He gets sent back in time and runs into the Potters, who he lives with for awhile. If I'm not mistaken he becomes an auror - this is all pre-Hogwarts for James, when he's maybe 8 or so? I don't quite remember how it happens, but he takes both Remus and Severus in - I think Eileen Prince somewhat blackmails/bribes him into taking Severus, and he takes Remus in because his parents kind of hate him for being a werewolf. He also agrees to take James if anything happens to his parents, but I never finished the story so I'm not sure if he ever did.

I read this story a number of years ago on ff.net, and I'm not sure if it was posted anywhere else. I also don't know if it was ever finished. I've been dying to read it again though and I really hope someone knows what it's called.

Thanks for any help!

** Tried to read it and although the premise is good the writing is just north of abysmal. Grammar is fine, but it's just horrible.

*** Ooh, that's disappointing. I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, and I know back in the day my standards for fanfiction could be pretty low. Thanks for the heads up.
