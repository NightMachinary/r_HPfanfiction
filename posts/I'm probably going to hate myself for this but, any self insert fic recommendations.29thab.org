I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]] and am in the mood for another +guilty pleasure+ good fic.

EDIT: I'll eat my words, there's definitely good stories in every category.


** I don't know about guilty pleasure, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] is actually /good/.

*** I agree, it's my favorite self-insert fic even though there's not much competition.

Does anyone know if the sequel is going to happen at Hogwarts or somewhere else? There are supposedly hints, but the ones I've noticed are too general.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]] is alright too, but unfinished and not updating frequently.

** Well, there's the incomplete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][The Visitor]], which is about a muggle woman transported from our world to that of her favorite fictional one... where she meets her favorite romantic hero, Severus Snape. It is amazingly well written, and the author kept it third person and didn't explicitly say that it was her in there, but it's rather obvious (a female Harry Potter fanfic reader who happens to adore Snape finds herself at Hogwarts and interacting with her favorite characters, eventual romance, etc).

It sticks to canon mostly, but with some alterations (as some things can't be avoided, for good and bad)... and the conclusion of the occlumency lessons is perhaps one of the greatest moments in fan fiction history. Unfortunately, the author succumbed to a long series of health issues. One of the /best/ fan fics ever.

edit: this fic is completely unedited, and has a some (though not too many) mistakes in the language. Do not read if this disturbs you too much. It's not professional, but in the end, it has a raw and fun feel to it because of this.

**** I do not have first hand confirmation, but after over 350k words over 108 chapters that were religiously added in 6 months, there was a 1 month break, and then a note that she was found with cancer, had a surgery, and got a flesh eating bacteria, then there was a 2 month break before that final update to the story, where she says that the bacteria caused a relapse in the cancer.

... then nothing.

A few other authors have (on their pages) said that she had died, and that she will be missed. There are (at least for me and a couple of other users) no updates or answers to reviews nor PMs. After 2 years, I think that unfortunately, we can assume the worst.
