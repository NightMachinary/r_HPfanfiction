** Isn't that more or less Regulus?

**** Well, he would need some people to help him, but all things considered, it was the right move for such an alliance to first 'bomb' the Horcruxes.

But someone that first followed but then thought he went to far/it wasn't winnable in the long run and takes actions from the inside to stop him (and failing), sounds like Regulus. So it would be easy to cast him in such a story

** Perhaps a cadre of high-ranking pureblood death eaters that disagree with Voldemort's more extremist policies, kinda like the old Prussian elite in Germany ?

*** More likely they're sick of answering to a boss that uses torture curses as a reprimand. Alternatively, they've only ever been in the whole Death Eater thing for the power, and they decide it's time /they/ were in charge. Bonus: They succeed in offing him (and making it stick, maybe using obscure magic to seal him away in the Phantom Zone or whatever) only to now become each other's rivals for the top seat and tear themselves apart via infighting, backstabbing, and paranoia.
