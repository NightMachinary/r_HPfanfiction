Doesn't have to be Snape/Harry, but I want to read one where he squirms because of the likeness.

** This is much more than what you're asking for, but it's a fantastic story so I feel compelled to link it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by the imitable Taure.

Read all of his other work once you've finished. And if you really feel like geeking out, he wrote out Harry Potter magical theory as well. He is essentially the world's expert on it.

*** It seemed to me like the typical humor romance with a weak Harry potter theme, at least after the first chapter. Wouldn't recommend it.
