Because I have a l o t. Do you want the list? Well, here you go:

Drarry, Tomarry, Romione, Bellamione, Pansmione, Harry/Fred/George, Nuna, Neville/Luna/Ginny, Neville/Luna/Draco, Grindeldore, Minerva McGonagall/Poppy Pomfrey, Cho/Cedric, Fred/George, Deamus, Ron/Harry (kinda), Ron/Blaise, Ron/Theo Nott, Neville/Draco, Ninny, Linny, Hannah Abbott/Susan Bones, Wolfstar, Jily, Jeverus, Marlene/Dorcas, Alice/Frank, Marlene/Regulus, Rabastan/Rodolphus, Severus/Lucius, Harry/Dementors,

Yeah, I guess I actually have quite a few... what about you?


** Well, I have a Constellation Andromeda, a Gladius and a Hornet, I would really like to have a Super Hornet though...

Oh, wait, wrong sub... I guess Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne are my favorites, I was never much for Harry and Ginny and most of the Harry/Hermione I have read simply isn`t good.

Perhaps I like those two because they force the author to get out of the bounds of canon whereas Ginny is canon and Harmony would be canon if JKR wasn`t feeling out of it when writing.

*** I agree, I don't like Hinny either, and Harry/Hermione don't have all that great fanfiction, it's weird but I've never read any Harry/Fleur fics, but it sounds interesting.

I also like it when the author has to think outside of canon when writing, it makes it more of a thing that the writer's produced rather than a regurgitation of canon.

**** There are some good Harry/Fleur, but some of them rely on stuff like soul bonds, veela life debts(lol), or other contract-y stuff to kickstart the romance.

Yeah, I get it, starting it may be kinda hard, but it can be done without cheapening the story with plot devices.

** The Durmstrang ship is pretty neat.

I do enjoy Harry/Luna and Harry/Daphne stories though.

** I like pretty much any ship involving Harry /as long as the other person/people is in his own age group/. Fleur is the oldest person I'd ship with him tbh, while Astoria and/or an aged up Gabrielle is the youngest. Although, that being said, I'm not really a fan of Harry with any Slytherin boys outside of Theodore Nott -- especially Drarry. It just isn't my cup of tea.

** Eh, any ship, honestly, if it's main pairing then only Tomarry is ok for slash, side pairing I won't give a fk about slash and all het is ok.

Haven't found many good Harrymort fics besides linkffn(again and again) so please link some

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** I know what you mean about hetero, I don't read all that much of it and don't really care about it, though I couldn't tell you for the life of me why.

Hermione/Bella is good, though I can't find that many good fics for it. Do you have any you could recommend? Ginny/Tonks sounds interesting, though I don't think I'd read it myself. I never did understand Hermione/Ginny, but there you have it.

** Sirius/Lucius, occasionally Ron/Draco, read some Lucius/Harry, Severus/James, Sirius/Remus/Severus, Tomarry, Fred/Harry/George, WolfStar, Drarry, Bill/Fleur, Fabian/Arthur/Gideon,

If I wanted to stretch it to crossovers I would say Tony/(Male/Female)Harry and Fem!Harry/Kakashi

*** I love all of these apart from Sirius/Lucius and Harry/Lucius but I think that's because I ship Wolfstar and my other Harry ships so much.

I don't read crossovers all that much but I like a Harry/Tony every once in a while
