Any FF's where he is rather dismissive of others and doesn't try to get friends or he is in Slytherin and actually joins the political power play to get what he wants. Or he sees what kind of clusterfuck the wizarding world is and tries to play it to his advantage. Like Riddle actually. So, all in all, I'm asking for dark!Harry, manipulative!Harry fics.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
