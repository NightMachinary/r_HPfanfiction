I think this is certainly one of the more strongly reviled tropes in Harry Potter fanfiction: the first years acting like trained politicians the moment they step foot in the school. All formal and 'Heir Potter, Heir Malfoy', talking about alliances and marriages for position; it's frankly ridiculous.

Now, I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that there aren't any /actual/ Lords in wizarding Britain. Someone might call Lucius 'Lord Malfoy' but that's really more of a gesture of respect than acknowledging an official title issued via the Monarchy. When we say 'the ancient and most noble house of Black' we don't mean noble in a literal sense. On the other hand, there is a bit of ambiguity about the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizengamot][wizengamot]] last I heard, since we aren't sure exactly what qualifies one to sit on that panel, and it predates the formation of the Ministry of Magic by a few centuries so it likely isn't democratic. Still, the closest we are likely to come to actually nobility amongst the magical community is the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sacred_Twenty-Eight][Sacred Twenty Eight]], and even that isn't anything like an 'official' thing.

So, on the one hand; these are fucking children. They are 11 years old when they start in at Hogwarts, they aren't thinking about marriage alliances; girls still have cooties!

However, on the other hand; these children are getting married right out of school and are in fact legal adults upon graduation at age 17. While it seems unlikely that the lower years are doing any sort of real maneuvering, it seems almost certain that the older years /are/. It doesn't even have to be Slytherin exclusive, though it might be a bit more blatant there; Ravenclaws who want to get into good apprenticeship programs or a spot in the Unspeakables are likely trying to curry a bit of favor with the classmates who have relatives in the Ministry, Hufflepuffs are talking to their housemates about going into business together after graduation, and likely even Gryfindors are doing a bit of extra credit to try and impress the teachers who might write them letters of recommendation.

We tend to view overly political Hogwarts students with a bit of snideness, but these aren't really just children, these are young adults who are going to be dropped promptly into their adult lives the moment they get their NEWT results in. It seems likely that there is a certain amount of maneuvering going on, and that while the kids might not all be phrasing it in terms of 'alliances' and power blocks, that is what is actually happening on a fundamental level.

How much politics makes sense in a fic? Are these just kids, or are they pre-adults? Is there an age where it should start getting more overt, or is it a gradual slide upward?

Some fics for consideration:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807][Faith and the Devil]] is kind of nice because the adult SI gives us a more realistic perspective on some of the schoolyard shenanigans which are, in point of fact, /schoolyard shenanigans/.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2618230][Cunning and Ambition]] has more of the Slytherin power plays you might expect, but they don't start becoming more explicit until the kids are in their 4th and 5th years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] has Slytherins doing driven Slytherin things, but not considering 'politics' very much when power is more readily accessible through magical prowess.

I don't actually have any of the bad ones handy, I guess [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] but honestly that fic is so terrible for so many reasons beyond the politics...


** I agree that having 11-year olds act like seasoned politicians is a bit odd, but I feel that the trope can be done well with appropriate world building. For example, if the author establishes that British pureblood wizarding society is like British aristocracy in the pre-colonial era, it's completely fine in my eyes to have the first years from prominent families address each other by their formal titles. It's definitely fine for the parents to be scheming and maybe have marriage contracts on the table that the kids are aware of, but regard as something that'll happen way off in the future. I also think it's pretty reasonable for them to have a vague idea of which families they are allied with and shouldn't overly anger. In terms of outward political maneuvering, on the other hand...I thoroughly agree that have first years be political masterminds is ridiculous in the majority of cases. Once they get older, however, I feel that it is completely reasonable for them to slowly get more and more involved.

*** That would seem to require a bit of AU but...

Yeah that's about what I think too. The kids should be /aware/ that politics is thing that matters, and that means they need to be a bit careful sometimes, but much more than that is just silly.

**** Yeah, for sure! It's an AU I'm working on now, and by golly, there's so many different factors to consider. There's just so many things that can easily become cliched or just go wrong. I think that's something a lot of writers don't consider, which is that writing a good and realistic political fic requires a lot of planning as well as a logical buildup

** To some extent, that's very true. It's absurd to have (relatively) normal children to discuss political matters in depth, plan future marriages and future alliances. Especially those of the third year or below. They wouldn't be able to form much in the way of a coherent, persuasive speech unless aided by an outside source.

On the other hand, it is entirely possible that the younger children would address each other formally. It should not surprise me if many Purebloods were raised to do so. Additionally, children do form alliances, even at a young age. We call those allies 'friends,' and some children will go to great lengths to ensure that others like them.

** I don't really understand all the "There are no Lords!" stuff. It may not have shown up in canon, but it's not a really far leap to take.

First, Britain is one of the most "class-conscious" societies in Europe. Being a noble still matters some. And it mattered a whole damn lot more in the past. Back before the SoS, a title was very important - and no one gave a damn about the muggle-ness of it or not; the world wasn't split. All you need to keep noble titles is to assume that the wizards didn't have some egalitarian drive to abolish a system they have been following for centuries.

That doesn't mean that their kids would be politicians at age 11. Given wizard lifespans, it seems more likely that politics is an old people's game. I do see the kids practising schoolyard politics, though - even if that's just adding some flowery speeches and airs to the usual cliquish power struggles. But no one in actual politics would really care that Daphne managed to put one up over Pansy when the Slytherin Quidditch Team attended her birthday party - unless things escalate to the point that people get seriously hurt.

So, I could see 11 year olds talking about alliances and such - but it's just another word for "he's my best friend, not yours! I've known him since we were little! Go away!"

I think a number of stories just portray that kind of "kindergarten politics" too seriously, and also make it out to be something special for Slytherin while odds are that all houses have such "power struggles". Or maybe the authors are using third person limited POV, and the readers don't realise that they are seeing things through a child's POV while adults grin at the whole display.

*** I don't understand that argument either Muggle Britain still has a House of Lords. Nobility still exists and while they may have lost some power they are still there. Even Germany still has a nobility with (albeit very small) privileges and we abolished the monarchy in 1919. While politically powerless it is still a position of respect.

** I think that mixing politics with the school stuff in fanfiction should just be avoided, or at the very least not even touched upon until the students are 14/15. Not only does it, as you've rightly said, force the interactions between /children/ into rigid, uncharacteristic, articulate formality, but also I've yet to find an author that can really present a /child's/ 'political manoeuvring' in a believable way, that is to say, they'd get fucking rinsed.

Politics and idiotic children (and to be honest, hormonal teenagers) do /not/ mix. Putting kids up in a political arena against experienced adults? Hell, even canon Cornelius Fudge could outwit any of these eleven-year-old 'Heirs'.

I think my real issues with the trope, though, are just how fucking unimaginative so many authors are with it, like it were copy-pasted between all of their stories. All these ridiculous, poorly-defined Lordships, the lack of any explanation to the Wizengamot's role in governing Britain, and in general the avoidance of any actual substance in the inclusion of politics in fanfiction just damages a story. Authors should try and be clearer - if the politics are important, /make it actually important, and explain/, rather than just use it as a means for Harry to subject his rivals to honour duels or whatever basic fairytale stuff people think aristocratic politics consists of.

Like, anyone interested could just look into the numerous European empires in the 17th/18th Centuries - think France, Spain or the HRE, or Italy during the Renaissance. Any of these could provide someone with some real inspiration to make a story that includes politics unique, distinctive, and refreshing. Hell, even examining 20th Century politics, with the entrenchment of democracy and constitutional governments across the world could provide something new - particularly in the deep ideological conflicts of the Chinese Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the rise of Nazism in Germany and Fascism in Italy, or the Second World War itself.

When politics are included in an interesting way, they can make for a solid read. But when it's just the same-old-shite that you've described, it'll just turn me away from a story nowadays.

*** I've been trying to write for my own fanfiction with politics (as said, it wouldn't make it's way until around an appropriate age) where the Wizmenagot consists of both democratically elected seats and inherited "Lord" Seats and would deal with the push on both sides to eliminate the other. It would also avoid Lord Potter-Black cliche because the Potters don't have a seat on the Wizemenagot, and because I've already made a rule that no one person can have more than a single seat on the Wizmenagot.

** We know from Pottermore that the Malfoys were gifted land by William the Conqueror when he conquered England. In those times a gift of land from the king was synonymous with being granted a title, and William was famous for installing his own barons to replace the Anglo-Saxon nobility. So it's likely that the Malfoy family has a noble title. And given that one of Malfoy's ancestors was a suitor to Queen Elizabeth I, it seems likely to be a title of relatively high rank.

But this is a Muggle title not a wizarding one and perhaps one that the anti-Muggle modern Malfoys try to keep quiet.

*** Neat! I didn't remember that, cool.

I think the general question when it comes to wizarding lords is how prevalent muggle lords are (and I think the UK has around 300?) and then how likely it is that a muggle king might have granted a wizard a title for some magic. England has existed for like, a millennia, right? And the Statute of Secrecy is only a few centuries old, so there's a decent chance for some of the wizards to hold noble titles.

** Maybe I was strange but I was far more politically aware/vocal when I was around 13 than now. From about then until sixth from was when I was more aware and I can safely say I was an idiot when I was 13. My ideas had such vague notions that I never thought about the implications. I think it was Churchill who once said 'if you weren't a socialist when you were young you've got no heart. If you're not a conservative when you're older you've got no brain.' I can easily see kids who will inherit power/responsibilities having grand ideas but I doubt they'd be well thought out or anything but nice thoughts. We know so little about the political landscape of the wizarding world its just a potential minefield wandering into it. Malfoy is friends with Fudge, Malfoy is a Death Eater who for years thought that Voldemort was gone. Therefore Fudge could be bringing in Malfoy's anti-muggle sentiment or he could be pro-muggleborn and therefore be making Malfoy look better. Alternatively he could have no real opinions and just exist to make the ministry look incompetent for the sake of the story. Does Malfoy care about politics or business?

I can safely say that politics in fics, as in actual politics not power plays, are something I very much dislike reading. Politics is ugly, its petty and its something that has so many potential points where you can offend people. So often we see when politics come in the characters go off on pseudo-intellectual rants where the author tries to make their own point and its a huge turn off. Noodlehammer's latest fic does this, HPMOR is infamous for this and while not really politics as such its the same trap. Northubriam is one I can say does it right, on their profile I can see something about Brexit but thankfully I can't remember ever having come across real world politics in their fics.

*** Hmm, I get what you mean. Kids tend to be pretty opinionated. I think that might be hamstrung in the wizarding world though, because the primary political issue is massive, violent, and hugely divisive. There don't appear to be many 'moderate' pureblood supremacists saying things like 'well, muggleborns don't really respect wizarding culture so why should we give them handouts?'.

The actual politics of HP are almost impossible to break down into something which could be dealt with in bite-sized reasonable chunks; you're either a super-nazi or a parragon of goodness, and people tend to get grumpy if you try to present the pureblood agenda as having any sort of reasonable basis. :\

But even when we were all stupid idealist children who knew /exactly/ what needed to be done to fix everything, I don't think many of us were forming coalitions and starting Special Interest Groups to fund our favoured politicians.

**** The only thing that isn't dammning about HP political fics for kids is that its a tiny world were everyone knows everyone. With so few people and some from families that matter a good first impression is key. Remember you're school friends parents could be your future boss. Amelia Bones might not hire someone Susan says is an arse. Malfoy Sr, might well have the influence to effect hiring. While not politics in the traditional sense, you would want your children who represent you to behave in a certain way and not to annoy certain people. The kids might develop their own opinions but at 11 they would be what they were told to be. Then its the OOC Harry who's some strange political genius with all the answers and tears apart the system who is the issue.

** How do kids of British aristocrats talk at age 11?

Anyone knows?

How about the same crowd from 100-150 years ago?

My take is that if Magical Britain was some kind of feudal society like in certain AUs, kids at 11 should be able to use formal titles in addressing VIPs. However, most of them would NOT be able to make long winded speeches with highly logical or political arguments.
