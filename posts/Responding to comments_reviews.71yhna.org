I'm interested in people's opinions on this. When people review or comment, do you reply? Do you only reply when they ask a direct question? Do you never reply? Do you only reply on certain platforms and not others?

And reviewers, do you expect a response? Is it just nice if you get one, or is it strange?


** I sometimes reply with a PM. If they ask nicely about the continuation of "The Salem Settlement", for example, I tend to write back a short PM. If they wrote a long and interesting review with good feedback and criticism, I'll write back a PM.

I hate replying in the chapter, however. I don't like that in other stories and so I won't do it in mine.

** I almost always reply if there's something worth replying to.

If the review is simply "Update soon please" I'm not gonna bother. I still appreciate the review, but I'm not going to respond.

The longer your review is, or the more complimentary it is, the more likely it is I'll respond. Even "This is great." will likely get a reply from me, because compliments like that get me motivated to start writing.

If it's a long review and has constructive criticism, I'll thank them and respond to certain points.

If it's a long review and has a ton of complimentary comments, I'll probably be too busy exploding with happiness to respond. But no, really, I respond to almost all those too.

I have 92 reviews right now, and I've probably replied to 60 or so of them.

** I reply by PM to most reviews when I have the time. Though, not usually to people who leave "great job"s or ":D"s unless it's their first time reviewing.

Since I try and leave reviews that have some substance, it's always nice getting a PM reply where people thank me.

** I won't reply to reviews merely asking to update or expressing interest but if they directly ask a question or give a more in-depth review then I'll probably reply.

I don't reply to guest reviews in author notes but might decide to talk about something they bring up if it seemed relevant.

When I review stories essentially the longer my review the more expectant I am for a response but it's not too surprising if they don't reply. I always appreciate any responses and any feedback in general.

** Yes, as an author I always reply to signed-in reviews. Obviously I can't reply to guest reviews although I'd like to. If the review is very critical I might wait until I've stopped stinging before sending a 'thank you'. I never try to justify or explain or engage in arguments.

As a reader, yes I like to get a reply. Seems to me it's just good manners to thank someone for taking the time to comment. After all the vast majority of readers don't bother. If I don't get a reply I'll assume the writer doesn't care or isn't active any more and I probably won't review again.

** I really try to but if they come in during my working day I tend to forget to do it when I'm home. I have some regulars who always leave detailed reviews and I make sure I always reply to them.

** As an author, I reply to reviews that need replying (be it that they are insightful, or so weird and confusing I need to scold the Peeves wannabee who did it), but not to the "--- stop --- Good chapters --- stop---" types.

As a reviewer, I do expect a response if I ask a question (even if that response is merely "can't tell you yet"), and it's a nice bonus if I merely left a critique but I don't expect one.

** I reply to reviews that express something specific such as liking a character or a scene. Sometimes reviewers have a question or specific feedback. If someone just leaves a "I like it!" or "Great start!", I'll leave those alone.
