Death Eaters contemplating if they're the bad guys. Their symbol is a skull.

Inspired by the Nazi sketch by Mitchell and Web: [[https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU]]


** Rabastan stared at his big brother for what seemed like an age . He had just asked Rodolphus a pointed question about the morality of their work. Both Lestrange men were mulling it over in their heads,thinking way back to when they had pushed Matthew McMillan into the Black Lake during the boat trip. All the bullying they committed over the years and lately all the crimes that came with servitude to the Dark Lord came rushing back . Then in perfect unison the Lestrange men shrugged their shoulders and returned their attention to the screaming form of Nathan Boot.

*** The higher ups, yeah, I see it. But consider those who are just foot soldiers, especially the young ones who grew into this environment, like Regulus and Draco. They just accepted their parent's beliefs and practices because it was all they'd ever known, and it took them both some time to see it all for what it really was. Kinda like the Hitler Youth.

**** Actually, we don't see Draco grow out of those beliefs. It is his loyalty to the Dark Lord that changes because of what Voldemort put him through. In the end, Malfoy family didn't run away from the Battle of Hogwarts because they realised subjugation of Muggleborns was bad, but because they realised Voldemort was going to lose.

Kinda? Not the "Muggleborns are inferior" beliefs, but he does seem to grow out of the "murder is fun and honorable at the same time" bit of the Death Eater creed, and certainly of the "Lord Voldemort deserves to be our immortal ruler" bit.

******* I didn't say it was redemption, I said he'd grown out of some of the Death Eaters' beliefs.

I don't think Draco is any level of actual sociopath, though; he seems more of the run-of-the-mill results of someone of not particularly strong moral resolve growing up in a bigoted environment. He's no more a sociopath than any non-abolitionists in the Antebellum South were, I think.

******** I don't know. He was pretty excited about possible deaths of Muggleborns in CoS, eager to get an animal executed for the fun of it. And let's not forget the two counts of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder to his list of crimes. And no, I don't think 'it was only so he could protect his family' is in any way a reasonable excuse to the last one.

********* No, I think in all cases it was because he'd been brought up by a Death Eater and Death Eater sympathizers, both of whom had taught him about how much fun it was (and how noble and honorable it was) to get your enemies killed. The whole point of his not being able to kill Dumbledore he's that he's "all talk and no bark", convinced that murder is the right solution to everything and eager to try it, yet when push comes to shove coming to realize he doesn't actually like doing it one bit.

Think... think young soldiers, pumped full of propaganda, who go to war fresh and joyful, telling anyone who'll hear about how good they feel about stabbing those rotten enemy foreigners... then instantly get traumatized by the horrors of war and get nightmares about every single soldier they're forced to wound.

********** Yes, if only he had the same reluctance with the cursed necklace and poisoned wine. Look, I get your point but let's not beat around the bush, almost 18-year-old Draco Malfoy was not a person that shoukd be allowed to walk free. You are right that he was making a move towards redemption but it was by no means enough. He took the first step towards becoming a normal person but it's a mile long road.

As sad as the situation with child soldiers are, those kids shouldn't be allowed free either, not without a proper re-education. And unlike them, Draco Malfoy has the means to cause damage after his side loses, what with his money and all.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed the Malfoys walked away without a punishment.

*********** Have I said anything about how Draco should be allowed to walk free, or considered redeemed? All I am saying is firstly that he was /not/ a born sociopath, and not as evil as he wished he was; and secondly that he /did/ canonically grow out of /some/ of the Death Eater propaganda he'd been raised on.
