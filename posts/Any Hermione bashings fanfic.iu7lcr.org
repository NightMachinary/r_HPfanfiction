I read many fanfictions where Ron is always the bad guy because of him always being jealous of Harry. So I want some fanfictions where it's Hermione's turn to be the bad guy. It's fine if it's slash.


** I have one but it's got Ron/Dumbledore/and Hermione bashing

Is that okay?

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
