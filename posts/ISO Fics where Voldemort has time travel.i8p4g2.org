I'm reading The Ghost of Privet Drive currently and there is a throwaway line about the horrid things that could happen if Voldemort got do-overs. It got me wondering if there are fics where he does. I was originally thinking of a Tom-centered fic where we might even be privy to his thoughts and focused on his journey of using time travel to get his way, and where he wins. That would be really dark though and I'm not sure I'd even be up to reading it. But I'm curious about any fics where he has time travel in general. Like maybe subvert the time travel fic genre by having him somehow go back after he realizes that Harry is alive at the castle and all his Horcruxes are gone.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

*** Thank you! I think AndrewWolfe actually recommended The Evil Overlord List and said that The Ghost of Privet Drive was inspired by it.

** Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday linkffn(2477819)

Very minor, but it kicks off the plot. Voldemort uses a time tuner to work with himself and have multiples attack Harry. Then the time tuner breaks.
