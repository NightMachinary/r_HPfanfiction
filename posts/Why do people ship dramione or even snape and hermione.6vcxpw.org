I don't get it. I'm not hating, Hell. Even i have weird ships but i just want to know


** Unlike what seems like most of the commenters, I'm a Dramione fan. Other than canon compliant works, it's my only "out there" pairing. I always really liked Draco's character in the sense that he is really fleshed out in many ways from being the schoolyard bully to pushed into a path he's not so sure he wants but terrified to refuse (death being the other option). So I find his character intriguing and very much in total contrast to Harry throughout the books and not-so-terribly-as-bad-as-he-seems as we grow with him.

I find him the only interesting combatant for Hermione. While in canon works I love Ron/Hermione, and don't like Weasley bashing, Draco is canonically Hermione's equal in intelligence. She is beating Draco at every subject (I took this to mean he was second). And while you could say favouritism in Potions I always took that to be that he was an excellent student in all areas because that was what his father demanded. And it's not like Crabbe and Goyle were doing his homework. I believe he's a very scared child and runs from the danger he finds himself in. He refuses to name its Harry at Malfoy Manor, but he also calls out to a DE that he's a Malfoy and on their side right after HP and RW save his ass. So we see his human side-- he does not have the bravery required of a Gryffindor, but he does not wish to die and has an inkling of turning to good for he sees the horror that is Voldemort.

Basically, I like Draco's character and I find him more redeemable than Snape. I believe he is smart and a good opposing matchfor Hermione. Ron tests her patience, I believe Draco tests her.

Also when I read Dramione ff, I tend not to read the hogwash that is cliched fiction. Anne M. Oliver is/was an incredible writer who doesn't tend to bash the Weasleys and writes very interesting post-DH EWE fics. They tended to be very AU, but very interesting with in my mind a good characterisation of both of them. (Though a good Pureblood!Hermione is my weakness).

That's my two cents!

*** Draco is no way near as smart as Hermione, he may be as smart as Harry or Ron but without the grace under pressure and the ability to think on his feet that harry has but Hermione is a genius, she is the smartest of her generation, while she can be stubborn and misguided cannon Draco is comparitivly quire dumb .If you read the books again and you will be surprised.

** probably for the exact same reason there are millions of harry/draco stories. he's one of the few people that gets any development, and it's allways about how he interacts with the trio. it seems more interesting to subvert cannon, and more people read your stories if he's a favourite character..?

** Okay, it seems like these questions get asked every week and people offer the same condescending replies (the actor blah blah) and simply want to jump on the bandwagon of hating Snape or Draco without actually providing an answer.

I like Snape. I like seeing him in different contexts and how he reacts in each one of them. I don't particularly ship him with Hermione but I've read some Snape/Hermione stories. I find him fascinating. I like that he's grey. I like to see how that moral ambiguity interacts with the traditional goodness of other characters. He's not good looking and even someone you'd call ugly, but I appreciate that. I want to see how that ugliness, inside and out, affects him and his relationships. Snape is someone I associate a certain amount of tension and electricity with, if that makes sense, and it's interesting to see how that tension gets amped up in the right situations. He fucks up so many things in life, and I find it entertaining to see how he fucks up relationships too. This makes the relationship dysfunctional, but I never wanted to read about a functional relationship in the first place. That's why I'll ship Snape with every HP character under the sun anyway.

*** Not a Snape/Hermione shipper, either, but co-signed. These are pretty much all the reasons I love Snape as a character, and what I look for in a pairing fic.

I don't scorn romance, but not every ship fic has to be romantic or even healthy. Sometimes it's about exploring the complexities of a particular character and seeing how they behave when their emotions and sexual desires take over. For me, that character is Snape. For a long time he was one of the little black dresses of fandom; he went with everything, and some of the results make for great fics.

Also, because fanfic is speculative it lends itself to exploring and redeeming these "grey" characters.

I think its also reasonable to forgive people who join a gang in their youth and then realize they're trapped.

I'm surprised it isn't discussed more, but frankly I think JKR didn't write a proper redemption arc. Fanfic authors have done a better job of redeeming both Snape and Draco than she did. The two men could be redeemable, she just didn't do enough to redeem them.

******** Again, without knowing what Voldemort's original "policy" proposals or early extra legal activities were, we really can't say. We also don't know how close Snape got to Voldemort before he was inducted; older students were probably his conduit to the Death Eaters, which is quite similar to a gang. Besides, I think you're vastly underestimating how violent some gangs are.

It seems likely to me that Voldemort originally started off with a soft "sell" to appeal to moderates: Muggleborns are diluting are culture; we need to go back to the good old days by purifying our culture and rejecting muggle influences.

After all, how genocidal could the Death Eaters have been if they allowed Snape to join? Sure he hated his muggle father and his muggle side, but if the proposal for Half-Bloods was death, he wouldn't have joined. Presumably, half-bloods like Snape were considered fine if they assimilated by rejecting Muggle culture.

Look, everyone has a right not to forgive Klansmen and Nazi. The Death Eaters are basically an allegory for the Klan, its valid for you to keep hating all of them forever.

However, J.K.R. has the line "The world is not divided into good people and death eaters"; she quotes the bible and writes a story of self-sacrifice and redemption. She intended to show us that Snape and Draco could repent and be redeemed. She just didn't show us convincing evidence that they deserve our forgiveness.

Personally, I prefer my Snapes redeemable; he regrets joining immediately afterward, but its the issue of the Potters that compels him to risk his life by turning to Dumbledore. He then spends the rest of his life trying to make-up for what he did. Then the remaining issue gross his treatment of Neville, which in some stories he later tries to make-up or can be explained by other factors.

TL, DR: You don't have to forgive Nazis or Klansmen analogs, but considering the authorial intent regarding redemption, you should be tolerant of others liking those characters.

It could also be interpreted that there are far more bad people than just the Death Eaters, something clearly visible by the small number of people making a stand against Voldemort. But just because other people are bad it does not lessen the crimes of the Death Eaters.

And let's not forget that while the bible preaches forgiveness it also coined the phrase "an eye for an eye".

** It seems to me most of the answers you have received from people thus far are from people who don't ship these pairings but want to offer their two cents anyway.

I can't speak to Dramione its not my bag but I am happy to discuss why I like SS/HG.

First my tastes run to fiction that is exclusively post DH, and usually some years after when all the characters are well into adulthood. It is easier to see how the striations of character between the two align then.

On average surveys show SS/HG shippers tend to skew older and I think older readers find more appeal in the truly morally grey nature of Snape. It has a more truthful ring to it.

My own life experiences with age differences in relationships and people with challenging (putting it kindly) personalities have allowed me to not instantly dismiss the idea, so if the writing style and plot appeal away I go.

** I like Snape/Hermione. I read Hermione parings exclusively and I don't care for her and Ron's relationship, I prefer AUs, EWE, a bit of OOC to make the pairings happen, etc. I really don't care for canon when I read fanfiction, I have the books if I want canon stories, to me fan fiction is about everything else. I like Hermione with someone that matches he intelligence and Snamione fics can be really good when both act stubborn and banter a lot. I like a good reception story so there's that too. I read a lot of student-teacher fics since there are a lot out there, but it's really not what I prefer. For Snamione, I prefer fics where Hermione is in her 20s, out of school (teacher's assistant, teacher at Hogwarts, or something else entirely - but not a student under him anymore). One of my favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6578435/1/Post-Tenebras-Lux][Post Tenebras, Lux]] by Loten, it's 10 years after the war. Them being older is a good setting for a more mature an interesting relationship. I read other weird pairings and I also prefer when Hermione is a bit older and mature, especially since the men she's paired with are older than her and I tend to find it difficult to see them fall in love with a school girl most of the time.

** I don't ship Snape and Hermione, but I get the appeal. They're both very strong characters and Snape probably sees similarities between Hermione and Lily. I think with Snape having such a tragic story, people want to see him finally get the (Lily-esque) girl. Then there's that whole "hot for teacher" thing...

With Draco...ok. so, I used to strictly ship Harmony. But now, I am so into Dramione. I know JKR doesn't want us to romaticize Draco, but it's really hard not to. I think it'd be a shame to simplify such a potentially complex character. Draco was bad because of the circumstances in his life and it's nice to read fiction that really fleshes him out. Hermione is great to pair with him because they hate each other. People are suckers for the whole enemies-to-lovers thing. I just really enjoy their rivalry and it's nice to read about them challenging each other. AND they're a good Snape and Lily parallel.

** Dramione is one of my favorites. I at first was 100% turned off at the idea of Draco and Hermione. Draco was a whimp in my opinion. not worthy of someone as brilliant as Hermione. That was before my first dramione fic. where i was put into draco's perspective and what life must have been like at home for him.... the first fic I read was Isolation and I feel like that was the realest way of creating a " probably " for these two. Once that was planted I couldnt stop..... Draco's incessant teasing of Hermione was as if he was internally trying to convince himself she was inferior as his family had instilled in him. Even when it was evident that she was far from inferior, therefore fueling his fire.... So him secretly liking her makes complete and utter SENSE. Shes everything that he would like in a witch and everything his family said a muggleborn wouldnt be. Hermione however, ever the logical thinker has a huge emotional capacity, and passion... and unrelenting empathy would definitely cause a change in perspective in that big beautiful brain of hers.. causing a change in heart and or give her reason behind draco's behavior... a difficult romance where both are opening up doors within themselves neither thought they had..... a rouge romance (and not an easy one, which makes for a slow, a hot, angsty, passionate romantic build btwn the two) having an extremely open mind to both of the characters faults and at the same time inviting those faults into open wide arms helps. Ive secretly convinced myself that they were soul mates..... esp seeing as both of their off springs seem to like each other. Scorpius being a bit more open about it than Rose....

I like Snape and I ship him with Hermione. I even like Alan Rickman, but he is not my Snape. I think his portrayal did more harm than good in the minds of a generation of viewers. Alan was at least two decades too old to play the part and succeeded in creating the impression (for many) that Snape was "old" not just "older".

When we meet Snape in Harry's 1st year he's about 31. He's still a young man, especially by wizarding aging.

Robert Pattinson is currently 31. Bruno Mars, Shia LeBeouf, Lady Gaga, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. All 31. Rickman was an amazing actor, but entirely the wrong age to play Snape.

***** Agreed.

I mean if you are looking for someone Snape-esque (Still a bit pretty though) but closer to the right age, Adam Driver springs to mind.

All that said I reject the over-simplification of saying that the whole segment of a fandom that like this ship or that ship do so because of the actor playing the part. I mean... I don't form attachments or even attraction based solely on the outward appearance of someone. My brain is always engaged before my groin when I feel a pull toward someone (fictional or not) and IRL my own worth does not start or end with my outward appearance; so why would the appeal we find in characters we encounter in books or film be any different? Everyone is a complex stew of life experience which informs our perceptions and interactions with the world around us and how we interact with it, I just think trying to reduce it like that is a cheap shot by one faction trying to belittle a group who thinks differently.

However, as this is a teeny tiny little fan fiction-y sandbox in a big wide world I can play in whatever way I like and the opinions of others matter not a jot! Ship as you will I say. Lol

****** I do agree with you. The Snape in my head is different than the movies and always has been. It just annoys me how off he is in the movies. Especially now that I'm not far away from that age myself.

I think Snape is popular because he is a truly complex character. He does bad things, he does good things, and we had nearly a decade of fanfic to speculate on his actions before it was all finished. He could be whatever you needed him to be in your story. He was mysterious, he had a prior friendship with Lily so not without some decent qualities, and he was intelligent. So he's a great person to focus on, Schrodinger's character. Good and Evil all at the same time. He's real, he's petty, but very much human.

Malfoy had more of the bad boy image, but he was never very good at it, and he turned out not so bad in the end, so it's no wonder he gets so much attention in fic. It's very easy to see his story as him needing help to save himself, stuck in family expectations. The bad boy image has always attracted certain people. Even if he turned out to be rotten to the core he's portrayed as Harry's opposite throughout the story. He's going to be a lot of people's focus in fic for that.

******* For myself, I was already an adult and parent when the books were coming out so while I was sympathetic to the young protagonists I was always more interested in the adult characters.

I do think as an adult you are more aware that life is rarely black and white nor the players in it. As a child, it is much easier to believe in good guys and bad guys and much harder to accept that everyone is flawed and that even bad guys love their dogs (or snakes).

Snape appeals because from the outset there is always more going on with him than seen at first blush - not just the obvious counter cursing Quirrel etc but in the next layer down. Over many rereads you notice things like why did he chose to have Filch tend his injuries from Fluffy instead of Poppy? Because he wouldn't fuss as much? Because he had an undisclosed friendship with him? Because as the only squib in the castle he could trust that Filch was the ONLY person who had no use for or interest in the Philosopher's Stone or hope of reaching it? In POA in the first pass of the evening even though he appears to be big noting himself and being a dick he actually persuades Fudge the children are not accountable for their actions by insisting they must have been confunded. Things like that just piqued my interest in what was really below the surface with him.

Nasty, moody, bitter, petty, yep all true but also damaged and having some empathy for the journey he took to where we meet him is how I wrapped my brain around the character - and the characters of the real life people he reminds me of. I always like works that inspire "sympathy for the devil".

Draco is harder for me to relate to but I can broadly understand the appeal.

** Most people won't like what I have to say but I think you can see why people write these stories by looking at how they differ from cannon.

Firstly, Hermione in cannon is not an average teenage girl, she is the smartest witch of her generation, she is ballsy enough to light a teacher's clothes on fire, she is also a really powerful character(not just booksmart). Moreover she does not tolerate bulling(Both Snape and Draco are bullies and Hermione is not a generic female character that throws a tantrum when faced with a bully, she actually fights back i mean look at what she did to umbrige)

Hermione in majority of the draco or Snape romances is a lot less competent tolerates a lot more bulling is usually only book smart and rather submissive(or is made submissive through the fic) I think this allows the average reader to relate more towards her. The basically replace a fun and interesting character with a cliched female character

Secondly, In canon both Draco and Snape are very interesting character both are bad people(and bullies) and extremely selfish, while draco is a coward and snape is not(Some one described snape as one of the good guys but not a good person).

Similarly to Hermione the male character is also replaced by a cliched male character ( does not matter if its snape or draco) they take away what makes snape and draco unique and replace them with a generic male protagonist in a female led romance.

Thirdly, these stories are filled with prejudice against muggles and muggle borns and live pureblood traditionists.They act as if Hermione should be overjoyed that she landed Draco/Snape

I could go on and on but the jist is that they replace everything unique and interesting with cliched and cookie cutter shit.

That does not mean that i have not read good romances with Draco/Snape(Reverse a Hermione/Draco story is one of my favorites) its just that most are completely unoriginal
