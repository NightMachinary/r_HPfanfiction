** Okay, I get that you're excited, but you've posted essentially the same thing here three times in two days. At some point, this just becomes spam.

**** It is a big accomplishment! They're still correct though that it's three updates relating to similar accomplishments. I recommend for updates like this that you either create a discord for the fic or post on the discord for the main ship? You could also reserve the updates for the “what are you writing” thread, which has the benefit of reaching the specific audience that's looking for self-promotion.

I think posts like this are technically within the guidelines for the subreddit, but if you pay attention, you'll notice no one else is really making posts like this because the “what are you writing this week?” thread offers such a good space for talking about this stuff without showing up in the feeds of everyone in the subreddit. It's great to be excited, but there are other places to share your excitement where people are more interested in this kind of content.
