Hello denizens of [[/r/HPfanfiction]],

We have a relatively new podcast called PotterWatch in which we (Molly and Alex) read through the books chapter-by-chapter, discussing our favorite and least favorite segments, themes, characters, etc. interspersed with clips from the one and only Jim Dale versions of the audiobooks.

This weekend we're switching things up a bit and doing an episode about fanfiction. It should be a fun episode, but to make things more exciting we're taking questions/suggestions for what we should discuss/debate/argue about! Alternatively, post on our [[https://twitter.com/realpotterwatch][Twitter]], [[https://www.facebook.com/PotterWatchPodcast/][Facebook]] or email us at [[mailto:podcastpotterwatch@gmail.com][podcastpotterwatch@gmail.com]]

The podcast is available on [[https://soundcloud.com/potterwatch-podcast][Soundcloud]] and [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/potterwatch/id1182517630?mt=2][iTunes]]

** - Make sure you mention Sturgeon's Law.

- The fics with the most reviews are not a true representation of the highest quality stories.

- Check out Taure's general recommendations: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA]] . It's a great list which is still updated.

** I've noticed a clear divide in those who like AU and those who like canon compliant stuff. That could be interesting to discuss :)

** If you want a short but effective way to prove the worth of fanfiction, do a pod-read of linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair).

*** Cauterize is the fic I use to introduce people to fanfic world... I think any Harry Potter fan would be moved by it.

** Try and include a few different genres.

Not all fanfic is great to read out loud, but yet again linkffn(10677106) is appropriate here. Internal monologue plus dialogue.

** You could talk about ship wars and how a lot of HP fanfic used to be hosted on ship specific sites but over time a lot of those sites have been closing and the fics on them are being lost or are moving to Ao3 and FFN.
