Is Heart and Soul worth it? I've read a few chapters of linkffn(5681042) but I've never actually sat down and got through the whole thing. It's 700k words for f's sake. I love long fics and I adore Hermione/Harry/Fleur, but there's just so much unnecessary wording. It's rated M, what makes it M? Is it sex, if so how early in the story? Is it violence? Does it move at a slow pace?

I've wanted to read this story for a while, the idea of this story intrigues me. But I don't want to get half way through it and give up, because it's not worth it.

I'm also looking for femslash. Not interest in reading young teen femslash. I don't mind one of them being a student at Hogwarts, but they have to be over 16. It's hard to explain what I'm looking for, but more decent, realistic adult fics. Not necessarily smut, but without all the teenage drama/angst. Is it so hard finding decent HP femslash? I mean, the fandom has over 700k stories, there has to be something.

I've read all Bellamione, Hermione/McGonagall stories, read Dignity in Fear, tried a few Ginny/Hermione stories which I didn't like, tried the Luna/Hermione story â€˜crazy little thing' but couldn't get into it, even read a story about Hermione traveling to the Marauders era and falling in love with Lily (it was sweet), and the Hermione/Molly one (it was weird). And yes I'm a sucker for age difference pairings.

As you guessed, Hermione is my favorite when it comes to femslash. So please rec me new stories, where Hermione is the youngest in the pair! :)

Thank you!!


** I was many chapters in and finally stopped reading it. The relationship between the three felt uncomfortable. More polygamous in a Big Love way than polyamorous with all partners getting more equal love/attention/focus. It also seemed ridiculous that Hermione would be seriously contemplating marriage at that young of an age. I also thought that the way they handled Harry's abuse by the Dursleys was unrealistic.

*** Is it one of those fics where they talk of marriage a few months into the relationship? Too many fanfic authors look at marriage as a part of some kind of checklist for romance.

**** Yup. Possibly even earlier if I remember correctly, but it's been awhile since I've read it. They even get Hermione's parents in on the discussion and I don't remember an appropriate level of horror from them.

**** It can work under some circumstances, like a strong threat to your life and freedom or our beloved +rape+marriage contracts/laws but in most cases the writers mix up agreeing on a future together ("I can see us together in five years") and "We need to get married ASAP because the author ran out of ideas for the plot and wants to generate some conflict".

*** Updoot for visibility. Written by a self identified lesbian who loves older women, the relationship feels a lot more realistic than I've encountered in most fanfic.

*** It says slow burn in the description. Are we talking about "I am confused about the fact that I like girls and still scarred due to the war" or are we talking about 150k words of the two awkwardly dancing around each other while everyone else has figured it out?

*** This! This is what I wanted and needed! The perfect build up of trust,love and UST. And oh my god the sex scene was perfect! Loved that Harry and Ron are behaving like actual adults in these situations, Hermione's not panicking about liking a woman.. The writing is solid and mature. Even though she's only 19 in the story, there's no childish arguments that other writers love to put in.

I had my doubts, thought the summary wasn't very good and I hate first person POV. But I can't describe how much I actually loved this one! I kept reading it at work and on the bus home.

This is my new favorite story and I'm so looking forward to more! So if you have more of this type of stories, I'll love more

** This was possibly the second or third fic I ever read, and I enjoyed it. Now that I have seen the better fics out there I went back and tried to read it again and couldn't get through it. If it's bugging you after a few chapters it's time to let it go. The writing style doesn't improve as you keep going.
