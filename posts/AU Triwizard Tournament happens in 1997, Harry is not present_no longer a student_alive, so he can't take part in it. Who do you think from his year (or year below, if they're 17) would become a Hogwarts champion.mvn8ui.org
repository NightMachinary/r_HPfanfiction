/(Assuming that the first Tournament either didn't happen or for the sake of the question doesn't affect the candidates, so, for example, character X wouldn't refuse to participate just because Voldemort came back during the Third Task in 94'.)/

My first thought obviously was Hermione, but then -- she's a brilliant witch, but also I think she may lack skills needed for that kind of Tournament. She's not really openminded, prefers plans rather than improvisation (which is kinda unfortunate during the Tasks where you need to think fast) and she panics in high-risk situations (again, not very good for the Tournament). Plus, I doubt she'd even /want/ to participate in the first place. After all, that whole thing was quite dangerous.

So I'm not really sure who'd be chosen. What are your thoughts?


** Assuming that the Tournament didn't happen earlier because Harry wasn't at the school and therefore Dumbledore didn't need to bring the foreign schools over to make alliances... then Harry must have dealt with Voldemort before then, permanently.

Hermione wouldn't have her association with Harry to boost her prominence in society and open doors into the Ministry, nor would Slughorn be around to open those doors for her. Given that, she'd be the best candidate to champion the school and willing to do it in order to serve her greater ambitions.

** *Hermione will probably become Champion if she enters.* We don't have many data points, but the Goblet seems to like well-rounded candidates like Cedric, who was a 6th-year selected over 7th-years, and it picked Fleur even though she wasn't, in all evidence, much of a fighter. (For these reasons, I would also predict that a hypothetical 7th-year Hermione who hadn't had to deal with Harry-related adventures would probably get picked over a hypothetical 7th-year Harry who had been raised by the Dursleys but had not otherwise had to deal with Voldemort or his agents.)

If Hermione doesn't enter, I think Ron might be a good candidate. He is competent for his year, and he has something to prove---more so if his ambition isn't assuaged by his friendship with Harry.

*How Hermione would perform is a separate question, but I'd give her good odds.* In canon, all of the Champions learned about all of the tasks to varying extents, so nobody really had to improvise in the first place. But, even if they had to go in blind, the tasks themselves weren't ones to force the Champions to "think fast": for example, they could have been placed within the dragon's reach or dropped straight in the middle of the lake or in the middle of the maze, but they were instead given space and time to think at the start of each task. And so, in canon-style tasks, the enormous arsenal of magic Hermione would have by Year 7 and her general knowledge both would give her the advantage.

With respect to things like combat skills---and this is getting into headcanon territory---NEWT years is when those students who continue to study DADA begin to transition from the adolescent style of magical combat, which features a lot of movement and infrequent and relatively weak spells cast verbally, to a more adult one, in which one stands one's ground while engaging in a rapid exchange of a wide variety of nonverbally cast spells---each of which likely ends the fight if it connects---and counterspelling and shielding. (Compare, the adolescent duels we see to Molly vs. Bellatrix in DH.) But, the adult style plays to Hermione's strengths (versatility, arsenal, nonverbal casting, Transfiguration?)---and as a legitimate Hogwarts Champion she would have no shortage of sparring partners if she needed to develop practical skills.

** We don't really know what the Goblet's criteria for choosing champions was. It could honestly be completely random, for all we know.

But if it does pick based on capability somehow, I do think Hermione is the best option we have. Her objections were more based on the fact that the tournament was too dangerous for underage students to participate in. As a seventh year, I can imagine her thinking that she would be capable enough to handle whatever they throw at her. If she was still going to choose not to participate, it would be because it would get in the way of studying for her NEWTS. And realistically, that probably would be enough to convince her not to enter.

The next best option from canon is probably Neville, assuming that he still got all the character growth he did by the end of canon, and then Ron. And then we're basically out of characters who we know enough about from canon to really judge. Maybe Susan Bones or Padma Patil or Ernie Macmillan would have been a fantastic champion, but we have no way to know.

*** I'm not convinced Hermione would be the best possible Champion. Even if she is brillant, the girl clearly has a researcher mindset and is not made for the field. In Canon, we have several situation where she just "freeze" in the middle of a stressfull situation (Devil Snare, DoM battle, Confrontation against Nagini . . .) and I'm afraid it would also happen during a Task.

But the problem is that, as you said, we don't know how the Goblet select the Champions. If he is only looking as pure knowledge, if he is also taking other qualities into account such as one's composure, there are probably several other student better suited than Hermione to be a Champion. I would consider Ron, and maybe even Neville (though in his case I'm not convinced he has enough theorical knowledge despite his bravery) as safer bet. And that's without mentioning all the other "of age" student we don't know anything of (such as the ones you mentioned).

While that is true, she has also been seen to think on her feet at times (leading Umbridge to the centaurs, disfiguring Harry's face when the Snatchers showed up), and she did still hold her own in some fights.

Plus, the Tournament does encourage and reward research and preparation. The second task did so explicitly, the first task wasn't meant to, but still did, and the third task kind of half did.

I still think she's the best option based on what we know from canon, but as we've both said, that doesn't really mean much.

** If Hermione fought in the war, then her freezing in tough situations would have been mostly fixed. As for not being able to think on her feet or being terrible at improvisation, that is incorrect. From Umbridge and the centaurs, to the Lovegood house, to Malfoy Manor, Hermione has been shown over and over again to be great at improvisation.

It is more likely that she refused to participate at all than she tried to join and the Goblet did not pick her if we are assuming that it chooses contestants on sheer ability alone.

** It depends. If the war against Voldemort happened and hermione fought in it, then her.

If not I could see it being a toss up between hermione, Neville or draco(even if I hate draco he is good with a wand, just less than harry)

All three of them could qualify for diferent reasons.

I would still put my money on hermione. She is always been powerfull, knowledgable and quick to result to violence/fighting I can definetly see her winning too. Just not as solidly if she didn't fight in the war

She might be more able to get someone to cross the age line for her than the twins were, though.

** I think that unlike most responses here, I don't think that Hermione would make the best champion. It's not her over-reliance on written knowledge that would hinder her. In fact Dumbledore states that the criteria on which champions are judged are: magical prowess, daring, powers of deduction and ability to cope with danger. While Hermione fulfills most of the criteria, if we disregard her movie superpowers, she is not that good at dealing with stressful situations and usually gets flustered then. We know very little about the rest of the people in Harry's year and other than Ginny, Luna and Colin we don't even know anything about those in the year below. I'd say Ginny would be the most suitable candidate since she seems to be reasonably good at magic, pretty resourceful and a courageous girl, but she is also too young so assuming the age restrictions are still in place, she would not qualify. I am not very sure about Ron either considering that despite being a reasonable fit for most of the criteria, he has stage fright and would just end up losing his head in front of a crowd.

Maybe someone outside of Harry's gang? If you're looking to incorporate this in your own fic... Neville would be quite a twist. Or you can always go with someone that we don't know much about. Ernie is reasonably good with magic and judging by how outspoken he is, he could probably fulfill the other criteria as well.

*** Ron was the guy who screamed Dobby's name in Malfoy Manor almost giving them away. He was the one who forgot he had magic and wanted Crookshanks to tap the base of the Whomping Willow in the Battle of Hogwarts (ie. "Are you a wizard or not?").

Ron does not unilaterally think better under pressure. He has good moments and bad moments - just like Hermione.
