** [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]] - strangely, this is the second time it's been mentioned in a day.

Author's note [from first chapter]: I'm writing this for my own amusement, so it won't be very good. This story will feature plenty of OC's, OOC behaviour, well trodden Clich√©-filled paths and a hideously Super Harry. There will be pointless overdone smut. There will be plotholes large enough for Jupiter. There will be bizarre theories and strange forgotten stuff. I will drop threads. This story will not contain literature. I'm not just playing in JKR's sandbox. I'm mixing in concrete and ground glass. If you like it, let me know. I have a vague sort of storyline, as is made clear below. Suggestions are welcome.

**** Of course - he bangs just about every female mentioned except Susan Bones (because she's with Neville and they're bros). The 'squirrel-girl' is a Huldr (also spelled Huldra or Hulder) and the tail is fox-like in the story.

** I recall the post by Vanir, he was working on an archeological dig and a tree fell and hit him on the head. Pretty good writing as I recall.
