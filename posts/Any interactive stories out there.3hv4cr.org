So I was wondering, are there any big interactive stories out there? You know where you can choose from several different options how the story should progress. And if not, why don't we make one? Everyone could contribute even if only with a few hundred words


** Not exactly what you're looking for, but most HP quests would fit. A quest is a work usually written in second person, where a snip is uploaded bu the author, and viewers vote as to what the main character does. Good ones are on Spacebattles, Sufficent Velocity, and Questionable Questing. I'm not sure what Harry Potter ones are running right now but I know there's a few on SB and SV.

*** I wouldn't call QQ good, but there's currently a quest going on at SV where James survived Voldemort's attack, which results in lots of butterflies.

**** I don't actually use QQ, but I do know that it has quests so I figured it would be worth checking out. I'm pretty sure there's a The Gamer and Harry Potter on SB, though I haven't checked it out that much.

**** I'm only aware of /Worm/ fanfiction/interactive stories on those three sites, but QQ has some stories (most notably /Amelia/) which don't show up elsewhere, but are still good. I think SB is the best one, for /Worm/ at least, but that might be because Wildbow ran a PRT Quest game on there (he's the author of /Worm/).

***** Amelia is on SV as well. But QQ has a... Questionable reputation. Mostly as the place smut goes. I wouldn't know, but I don't think that there's all that many serious quests on QQ.

** There was an initiative like that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ed9vn/a_timetravel_fanfic_written_by_the_whole/?ref=search_posts][last month]].
