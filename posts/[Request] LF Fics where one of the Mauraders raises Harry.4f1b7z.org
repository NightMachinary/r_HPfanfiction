Looking for decent fics >60k, where the Marauders raise Harry. I'd also prefer if it's just one Marauder raising Harry. So not Remus and Sirius, just Remus. Also leaning more toward Adventure than Hurt/Comfort...

Hit me up with all your suggestions, even if they're not all that close to my request. Interested in different takes on raising Harry.

Cheers!


** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels has Harry raised by Sirius, though Remus is around too. It has its problem, but it's okayish. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) leads to Sirius (and his family), but it ends relatively soon after that. There was sequel mentioned, but it was a long time ago so it probably will never come to be.
