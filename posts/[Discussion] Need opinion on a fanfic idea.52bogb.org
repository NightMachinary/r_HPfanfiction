** I don't think it's a stupid idea. It has the potential to be good with some careful thought.

I'll give a few of my opinions below, but ultimately, you should write whatever you'd like.

First, I think that it may not be the best choice to do the story in diary format. It's certainly easier to write it that way, but it's very difficult to make it engaging to the reader. That's not to say that it's impossible to pull off well, but it limits you a lot. The reader won't be seeing events as they happen, complete with dialogue, descriptions, etc. but will be getting all of their information from the words written down by the protagonist.

Second, there are a lot of traps that can be fallen into when writing an OC (original character), particularly one that you'd like to join the Golden Trio, so you'll have to be careful about having things happen in a realistic, natural way.

I frequently see OC's that magically know how to say exactly the right thing to everyone in order to solve all of canon's problems and/or eliminate other characters' personality flaws.

It's a lot more interesting (and realistic) when an OC with foreknowledge tries very hard to fix things, but isn't always very good at it, or fails to take all variables into account, or is just plain unlucky.

For example, take the issue of how to make your OC become friends with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

What if your OC tries to make friends with Harry and Ron on the train, but as a 20-year old has no idea how to make friends with 11-year olds and does a terrible job? What if he's sorted into a different House and hardly sees them? What if he inadvertently prevents Ron from insulting Hermione after Charms class, and then she doesn't need to be rescued from the troll in the girls' bathroom and never warms up to them? What if your OC does successfully make friends with the trio but then finds them all incredibly immature and annoying and constantly has to come up with increasingly terrible excuses for how he knows things?

For every situation in your story, think of everything that could happen differently or go wrong because of an OC's involvement, and then decide which course you'd like to take. Don't always make things go smoother than canon, because that's no fun. :) Every story needs to have conflict.

Make him a year younger and in Hufflepuff or Slytherin. Drop him into his new body a few months into his second year at Hogwarts-time to play catch up with an incompatible wand. He doesn't have any memories from the body's previous life-holidays are coming up and he doesn't know his family, home, or how to act.

**** That's delightfully evil. I love it. He'd either have to get his act together very quickly or end up committed to Mungo's.

***** Eek, he'd be going through a ton! Died and lost his family, friends, and life. Wiped someone else out of existence by his arrival in this world. Has to make a convincing lie for his change in attitude and personality, seeming loss of knowledge and ability, etc. And he can't forget his mission of helping Harry! Good luck finding him and not sounding like a nutter

** I think I would be more interested if it was a 20 or so year old /muggle/ from their world in 2016 dies and becomes the dying, wizard 10 year old. That way he has no book knowledge, but lots of future knowledge still to draw from.

*** That's a really interesting thought. I'm now visualizing a muggle coming from a future in which Voldemort won and enslaved all muggleborns/muggles or waged war on the muggle world or just generally did something egregious and noticeable, so they somehow know that something went terribly wrong but not the details. That's just what my brain immediately jumped to, though. It might be better with no knowledge relevant to the magical world at all.

**** Your idea would be equally interesting, it all depends on the direction the OP would like to go! Another thought is that the OC could be originally a /squib/ from 2016, so they have a very basic knowledge of magical history and spells like you mention. Hell, it would be hilarious if the only spells he knows "well" are the household ones his wizard parent/s used regularly around him! It would also give the character the added dimension of never having magic and jealous/angry about it to suddenly being magical himself.

**** Thats great idea. Unless you use magic causes insanity Voldemort would easily enslave muggles in a day. Easiest way is to make parliment pass law that makes him supreme emperor of UK, with bit of imperius curse. Or just apparatate there with nuke and tell muggles that they have hour to sign terms of surrender or London would be destroyed.

I imagine a 1984 style future. A muggle would be caught by thoughpolice wizard that uses legilemency, imprisoned and used to experiment with transplanting souls where accident causes him to go back in itme. That limits characters future knowledge as while he read "The rise of our god-emperor" its hard to distinguish truth from propaganda.

** u/Lamenardo:
#+begin_quote
  I'd say 50% of my goal would be to explore stuff not mentioned in the books - mostly how life works in the wizarding world and the culture shock of someone who never lived in it.
#+end_quote

This is what I like about fanfiction, rather than rewrites of actual book stuff.

** How would you work in the impending demise of your protagonist? I think this premise could be interesting, especially if you examine ways in which their history would have adverse effects for them in the HP universe.

** I do enjoy stories like this, so yup, I like it. I dislike reading first person stories for the most part, so unless you're really really good at writing diary type stories, I'd recommend avoiding it. Or maybe you could do the old 'half and half', where for the most part we see it in third person subjective, but part of it is the character writing in his diary.

I have to say, at first read, I thought it was /Harry's/ dying body he'd occupy. And I rather like that idea. Basically magic doing weird things because the horcrux has to have another soul in there, or somesuch. Or, what if, it was Hermione, and that's why she's so smart. Especially if it were a witch from the future stuck in a muggle child's body.

Now, the idea of him joining the Golden Trio...Unsure about that. I'd prefer it if they were the Twin's age, and befriended them. Or maybe, a girl, who doesn't quite make the Golden Trio, but is close friends with Hermione, because she tried befriending her from start.

** Thats combination of several ideas, some are good, some are bad. With stories you could try to experiment to change some bits to make it better.

Diary-format: As said before its hard to make that interesting.

A 20 year old self insert fic: You should avoid that as this idea has bad reputation. Half of readers will drop it after reading first chapter as 90% of these stories are trashy mary-sue romances with OC/Harry+Snape+Draco ship. For that reason better writters avoid this cliche which causes average quality drop more.

Time-travel idiots: No, just no. When one reads that story contain this, mainly based on: "We need to preserve the timeline and change only small things" speech followed by checking 20 chapters forward that while character traveled in first year Sirius escaped at start of third year then its one of my main reasons to drop a fic.

This basically tells your readers that you are lazy author and story would be boring because you don't bother to come with original plot. So why should we read this story? I read dozens of stories and even if some other aspect catches my eye I will skip paragraphs and paragraphs that rehash events that I already read dozens times about. That story would likely contain lot of railroading to keep it close to canon instead just letting to flow it naturally and do canon divergence. Last reason is that it makes time traveler an idiot that discards most advantages that he has for keeping future knowledge which is useless as he doesn't act on it and it could be erased by butterfly effect of changes that he made in any moment. With any decent plan an future knowledge he could neutralize Voldemort. For example in three days he could tell Harry to open chamber, place and basilisk and mirror next to Quirell's office. Then put Voldemort's statue in the chamber of secrets and Voldemort is gone until Ron reveals his true colors and frees him because he is his son (how else does on explain that Ron is parselmouth?). Defeating Voldemort isn't that difficult, main problem is not to accidentally kill him as while horcruxes save him from death they don't prevent keeping him alive but permanently asleep once captured.

Now for your aim as I previously written that your setup contains stigmas that cause lot of readers to drop story before they evaluate it on quality of story itself a simplest improvement would be following:

Dean Thomas just found that magic was real. He visited a cool magical place called Diagon Alley and bought some extra books at Transdimensional books INC. He didn't know how what looked like child's books will change his life.

That is basically same as your premise but framed differently. Dean is muggleborn and new to magic, knows about HP events from HP books that he bought at alternate dimension bookstore, then he meets real Harry Potter at train platform before Ron does and finds out that books were sorta real except that lot of events change to keep story interetsing.

** While it sounds like it is a great idea and could potentially be super interesting, there are a lot of red flags that pop up for me. The biggest thing that I really, really can't persevere through anymore is canon rehashing. I've literally read thousands of fics rewriting first year canon and it's a real struggle for me to slog through the events of Harry's first broomstick lesson, potions lessons, troll incident etc without some sort of divergence or different resolution. It's seriously difficult even if it's from another perspective or something. Any OC fic that I read nowadays, has to somehow differentiate itself from all the others, generally by making huge waves and significantly changing events from how they are in canon. First year is definitely the hardest for me since those are the most overdone, so maybe it could be better if the dying student was in his second or third year maybe?

Anyway, best of luck with the fic and I will endeavour to read it, but it will be hard if the OC sort of sidelines the first few years or so and doesn't really start influencing the story much until the later years. Sadly, I'm too impatient to wait through those kind of fics anymore
