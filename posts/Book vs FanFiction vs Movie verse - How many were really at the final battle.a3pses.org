Watching the final battle again, I can't help but think there were WAY too many on Voldemort's side. There had to have been @ 5 thousand or more, and what maybe 100 or so at Hogwarts? How many do you actually think were at the final battle? How many really died?


** The thing about the Battle of Hogwarts is that basically everyone's in it.

Everyone in Hogwarts who was of age is involved, plus a bunch of not-quite-old-enough kids who sneaked back in. There's the House-Elves, of course. All the statues, suits of armor, ghosts, gargoyles and so on are also fighting for their castle (feel free to imagine Peeves killing off Death Eaters through the power of slapstick). I don't know what that amounts to, but certainly more than a hundred.

On Lord Voldemort's side are all his remaining marked Death Eaters (thirty, forty?), plus Greyback's werewolves, the Dementors, a couple of Giants. And also basically all the Knockturn Alley scum that gold and promises of power can buy --- Snatchers and so on --- to whom it is reckoned that he gave Death Eater robes (but not the Mark) to make his numbers appear greater. All in all he probably has about two hundred wizards and witches, and, I would say, about as many magical creatures.

Also involved are an indeterminate number of Acromantulas (I would say 300, allowing for the fact that most of those would be on the younger side and so cat-sized at worst) whose primary grudge is against the Death Eaters, but who, having only a very shaky idea that there are multiple sides among the humans, and a very big appetite, basically want to kill everyone.

*** Haha, I don't remember the Acromantulas. Why were they out for death eater blood?

**** Mostly because the Death Eaters had kicked them out of their home earlier. The clearing where Voldemort "kills" Harry is in fact the very same clearing Aragog inhabited back in /Chamber of Secrets/, and Voldemort unceremoniously ousted the Acromantulas while looking for a temporary lair. They didn't take it well.

Also, secondarily, their patriarch Aragog was blinded by Voldemort all the way back in 1943.

Also, thirdly, on two separate occasions, Voldemort released the Basilisk whom the Acromantulas considered their worst enemy.

All in all one understands why they were a bit ticked off.

** At the time of the one-hour ceasefire, the defenders had suffered fifty dead. Considering that there was also a large number of injured people, yet their defense had not collapsed yet, that suggests several hundred defenders.

The attackers are shown to have the numerical advantage. I think a low four-digit number (including the creatures fighting for Voldemort) is the most probable figure, I think. Fewer, and Voldemort would need to take a more active role in the battle than he did, but more than 2,000 are improbable either considering that the size of the magical community did not exceed a low to mid five digit number.

TL;DR: 250-500 defenders, 600-2000 attackers would be my guess.
