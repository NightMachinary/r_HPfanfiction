Or any other interesting pairings that aren't Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny or Harry/Ron.

I could also read a threesome like: Blaise/Harry/Susan, Draco/Harry/Neville, Theo/Daphne/Harry or Green Apple/Harry/Draco (Random examples) If it's interesting.

PS: I love a Insert Slytherin/Harry relationship. and more when said Slytherin help Harry to become a good future Lord Potter. You know, teaching him the Slytherin political game.

NOTHING with Snarry, please.


** The lion series is one of the best harry/daphne works I've read. Or The Legacy Preservation Act also.an amazing harry/daphne neville/tracy fic

****** Ah but what your hoping is that the person that is making the recommendation likes the same thing as you do and evaluates the stories the way you would. Otherwise, you get the "I really liked this Harry/Daphne story and you read it and think it's garbage".

Speaking of that you can try this story. Harry Potter and the Betrothal Contract by James Spookie.

linkffn(5598642)

The Bonding by LRThunder

linkao3(4646073)

For a post war harem/coven story that starts with Harry willingly marrying Luna and being tricked (by old magic laws) into marrying Daphne (who he does like) you can try Witches of Westfield by E J Daniel. It even has Harry being friendly with Draco.

linkffa(1399)

If you want a little variation here is a Harry/Astoria story. Family - It's in the Blood by mjimeyg

linkffn(13292346)

ffnbot!refresh

You can also try Harry and his New Life by JackPotr which is a marriage contract fic with Harry/Tracy and Neville/Daphne

******** Well I don't know if you already do something like this but if I read a story I like I then look at the other stories the author wrote that contains the same pairing i.e., Harry/Daphne that i'm currently reading or the same genre (say marriage law fics or time travel etc). If the author says that the fic was inspired by some other fic I check that out.

I then look at the Authors that writer likes or the stories he likes (whichever is smaller, though i'll go back to look at the larger). I check those out to see if they have stories that match the pairing or genre I'm currently on or the summary of a story sounds interesting. If I like that story then I check out the other stories and pairings from that "recommended" author/story. And then quite frankly I just rinse and repeat.

My thought is if I like a particular author's story then there is a good chance I will also like the authors and stories that that writer likes. Now it doesn't always hold true but for the most part it has. Which has allowed me to expand the numbers of stories and authors I've read. Basically it's a noninvasive method of getting story recommendations.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
