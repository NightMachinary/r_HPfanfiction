That used to be a pretty common trope in fanfiction, but it lead me to wonder, how could you write in a way that made it probable? Dumbledore would believe Harry, the people who knew Harry would believe in him. Though, it could provide some uncertainty/drama to have people who didn't know Harry that much, be unsure in the Order.

Lucius Malfoy blackmailing the Minister could be a way that they do it, or they could plant enough evidence where it seems pretty damning.

Who would listen to Severus Snape? He might be a Spy, but the Ministry has no reason to believe an Ex Death Eater.

Harry wouldn't know a crazy amount of magic that would help him be stable, etc. But how to do it so he doesn't go crazy? Or as crazy? You could always have people from the Order visit him. Let him know that there are people out there who believe in him.

What are ways you'd write the potential Harry in Azkaban story, that would be passable/probable?


** Lucius tells the Minister NOT to sack Dumbledore from the ICW, because it'll get Dumbledore out of the country with their plan to get rid of Potter. Dumbledore away at ICW meeting, Fletcher guarding house then goes off on his illegal drug buy or whatever criminal crap Fletcher does. Harry arrested for "Murder of Cedric" or some other crap. They take the Sirius Black approach and just dump him in Azkaban without trial.

Could lead to a Jaded "Gray"/Dark but Good Harry after Dumbledore gets him released or someone manages something. Maybe Harry slips out when Voldemort attacks Azkaban, and manages to hide in the Muggle World for a few months til he's proven innocent. He runs across a Death Eater muggle baiting, stabs them in the back of the neck, killing them and taking their untraceable wand or something.

His friends all believe him. The Teachers (Scumbridge doesn't count) all believe him Maybe some of the Hufflepuff are antagonists, and Fred and George torment the crap out of the Hufflepuffs that are involved. Maybe Susan Bones is one of those "He's in prison he's obviously guilty" idiots, or something,

Maybe Sirius just flat out Avadas Fudge. who knows, there are a lot of routes that first paragraph could go.

** Easiest way to send Harry to Azkaban is for the crime he /did/ commit - he used the Cruciatus on Bellatrix Lestrange in OotP. The law on Unforgiveables is pretty clear: use one on a human and you're sent to Azkaban for life.

*** Best idea in this thread.

It's still a reach, but additionally to the biased members of the Wizengamot, you get the righteous/absolutist Crouch-Sr-types into your corner from the start. That's better odds than anything I came up with.

**** Harry's defence: Bellatrix Lestrange should not be considered a human and therefore using the Cruciatus on her is not a crime.

If he succeeds in this defence, not only does he get away with it, he also has the pleasure of having a Wizengamot ruling that Bellatrix Lestrange is a half-breed.

** Most probable would be either during 5th year or after Voldemort took the ministry. I don't think Fudge would participate in framing Harry , he seems more stupid and incompetent than actively evil and malicious, but if Umbridge did it without his knowledge he wouldn't look to hard to check for a reason against his luck. And after Voldemort, it's incredibly easy and likely he would've been arrested if Voldemort moved any earlier on the ministry, or if the OoP wasn't informed as they were in canon.

*** The no-trial idea is a good point, but it's hard even (and perhaps, especially) then. I don't think Dumbledore would stand for that. And by "stand for that", I'm talking about a person who can duel Voldemort to a standstill and half a dozen Aurors at once, and who has no problems deciding not to leave with the Ministry when it comes calling (OotP/the DA thing).

So you have to construct a setup where it's more improbable than not that Dumbledore simply grabs Harry and moves him somewhere the Ministry can't get him before they even try. In normal circumstances, you'd think it'd simply be Sirius #2, and Harry ends up chilling on some tropical island until a more reasonable Ministry has come.

** +1 solely for asking the question "how to make it probable". If only all authors did that.

As for the answer, I personally think a lot revolves around how the Ministry is set up. Don't forget, sometimes Harry is its darling, and the very idea of sending him underage magic notes is preposterous (PoA). And other times, they are looking for ways to gank him and literally make up evidence (OotP). And of course Voldemort!Ministry would have thrown him into Azkaban without question. So for me, the point is less "what'd Harry do" and more "how'd the Ministry react". There's no case if the Ministry doesn't want there to be one.

In a second step, you'd then have to tackle Harry's support network (Sirius, Dumbledore, his friends ...). The first point is that Sirius needs to not exist. In a world with Sirius, most definitely Harry will not be going to Azkaban, regardless what happens, even if he were convicted and possibly even /if he were guilty/. They'd simply leave Britain together.

Dumbledore, too, will do a lot to prevent him from going to Azkaban prior to the accusation, including sweeping things under the rug that legitimately /should/ have consequences. He will also defend him during the accusation, and will know Harry didn't commit the crime, if Harry factually didn't. I don't think you can write a story that is both probable /and/ stays true to Dumbledore's character, where he is fooled. It will always be improbable to a certain degree -- see the debate about Sirius and the Fidelius.

What Dumbledore /might/ not do is subvert the decision. He let Hagrid go to Azkaban, after all. Consequently, you at least either have to remove Dumbledore, Dumbledore's influence, or make the case so watertight that even Dumbledore can't convince the Wizengamot. The first is easy, but not trivial in terms of story consequences (a story with no Dumbledore is a huge decision), the second is hard (even in OotP, Dumbledore's words had enough influence to convince the Wizengamot Harry's actions were legitimate), and the last is interesting, so here's some thoughts.

 

For example, Cedric. You might try to construct something out of the fact that he is dead and Harry is with him. To make it plausible, you have to remove all evidence of Voldemort's return, perhaps Voldemort hides the entire graveyard, so it'd look like Harry was rambling nonsense and made-up excuses, if he started talking about a place that didn't exist. Further, there must be a way to fool experts investigating the Cup-that-was-a-Portkey, there'd certainly exist magic to tell it used to be one in normal circumstances. You'd also have to tackle a defence of "it happened in the maze". The point in front of a jury isn't necessarily what is true, but what gets you off. Harry might conceivably say one of the beasts killed Credric, or that it was an accident in a fair fight for the Cup. Ideally, it would appear as if Harry cast a Killing Curse, since that's an insta-ticket to Azkaban. So perhaps Voldemort used Harry's wand to do just that, and when they used Priori Incantatem, that's what comes out. Additionally, there need to have been a place in the Maze the audience couldn't see, where it could have happened, so perhaps Barty set that up.

I think that'd get you a pretty solid case, and now you're down to arguing about character. Would Harry do that? If you pushed the trial into OotP, after a bit of smear campaigning, and added a couple of biased witnesses (say, Cho is mad with grief, blames Harry for Cedric's death, and accuses Harry of killing him because he wanted her), in the end, you might get enough votes for a conviction from a biased Wizengamot.

 

But you see what kind of struggle it is -- it requires a conspiracy (someone, in this case Voldemort, has to actively /want/ him Azkaban, Harry is not going there accidentally) and a kind of passivity (no counter to the smear campaign to get public opinion on his side, no true attempt to contradict witnesses etc.). All in all, IMO, in a world without Voldemort and with Dumbledore (and certainly with Sirius), it will always be the exception that a judicial error on this scale can happen.

** Set up a crime scene (dead Dursleys or blown up muggles) with Harry at center. Use his own wand to perform the crime and then /Obliviate/ him. Using priori incatatem would show that Harry destroyed his own memory of the crime, so his testimony/veritaserum is useless. Harry himself wouldn't be sure of his innocence especially if the victims are Dursleys.

** One of RobSt's fics did it reasonably well: At first, Harry was arrested out of the Hospital Wing for Cedric's murder immediately after the Third Task, but kept in a holding cell at the Ministry as Fudge and Umbridge leaned on him to get in line with the Ministry's story. Dumbledore was trying to work within the system to get Harry out, especially since it was just a holding cell at the Ministry. It was only later, and without making it generally known, that Fudge and/or Umbridge had him moved to Azkaban to increase the pressure on him. By the time Dumbledore or anyone else in the Order knew about it, he'd already been moved.

It can work in part because Dumbledore knows that the war is about to come out of its' 13-year ceasefire, and doesn't want the Order fighting on two fronts (against Death Eaters and the Ministry), so until and unless the Ministry jumps fully into Voldemort's camp he's going to try and play nice, even if that means innocent people suffer in the meantime. Having Harry initially just kept in the DMLE also helps, since it takes away a lot of the urgency (i.e. "Yes, Harry is doubtlessly not happy at present, but he is at least safe. Had he been taken to Azkaban, I can assure you my response would have been far less genial.")
