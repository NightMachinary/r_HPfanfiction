Outside of wanting a fanfic where Harry is still the main character, and not having any slash, I'm pretty much down for anything here.

Maybe her parents where witches and wizards themselves, or maybe she comes from a long line of squibs to the point where they forgot they descended from witches or wizards.

I know alot of these types of stories usually have her being a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, which I'm fine with, but as I said I'm pretty much down for her being descended from anyone. In Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin she is descended from House Wilkes, and in the Perfectly Normal series she's descended from House Parkinson, which makes Harry and Pansy related, and leads to some pretty interesting interactions between the two.

Oh, and extra points if she's descended from a "dark" family, like the Malfoys, Notts, Parkinson, Rosier, Selwyn, etc.


** The story Forging Destiny by White Angel of Auralon has Lily being adopted into the Evans Family an actually the Heir of the Boldon family (rich European purebloods) as well as being a secondary heir of Ravenclaw.

  Everyone knows that the seventh son of the seventh son has great magical abilities, that they are destined to become great.But a sixth son of a seventh son? That's nothing special. There's no guarantee of magic or heroics or special gifts. Just a little boy with lanky limbs and earnest eyes and a face splattered in generations of freckles, who grows up knowing that he's nothing but a footnote to the glory of his older siblings.Ron Weasley grows up as a shadow. Every single one of his older siblings is extraordinary, in their own way- Bill, the exceptional linguist and cursebreaker; Charlie, the dragon tamer; Percy, head boy and prefect; the twins, inventors extraordinaire. His entire life, Ron is compared to them by everyone he knows and always falls just a little short, no matter how hard he tries.Is it any surprise that Ron wants more out of life, that when he arrives at Hogwarts, bastion of magical opportunity and the chance to change his fate, that he takes it?

  What if Lily Potter was more than she seemed? What if she was a goddess of magic born from the arcane forces of the universe? Harry learns his mothers true identity and his status as her Demigod heir when he is eleven years old. How will this knowledge and some early intervention affect his role in the Wizarding world?

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.
