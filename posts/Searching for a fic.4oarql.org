Hey, I'm searching for a fic I read about 4 years ago now (and also any good stories you know). Harry wants to explore the chamber of secrets, but doesn't want to do it alone. Ron and Hermione won't appreciate it, so he goes to the one person who will, Malfoy. The two develope a begrudging friendship (no slash). I can't remember much more, except that Harry ends up staying in a barn in Ireland for a while and gets a muggle girlfriend there.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin)

I'm crossing my fingers and hoping I don't have to double check the name. I loved this fic the first time, haven't been able to reread it yet.

Edit: went and double checked. I was wrong. Right one is now linked.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.
