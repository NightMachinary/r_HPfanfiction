  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.

  Another take on WHAT-IF Harry got rid of Voldemort in fifth year? Oh yeah and WHAT-IF he just so happened to fall in love with certain twins? In disguise. Under a wrong name, that is. Shenanigans ahead.Also a take on self-discovery and gender fluidity.(Or the one in which Harry gives the headmaster the finger and decides to go exploring the Wizarding World on his own.)
