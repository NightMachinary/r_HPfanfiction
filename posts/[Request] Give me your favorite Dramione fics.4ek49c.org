  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

***** I haven't read her one shots but her other fic It's All Uncharted linkffn(7395687) is okay a little sappy but okay. If you want some adult Dramione in a cute happily ever after type thing it might be your thing. It has a twelve part sequel that's pure fluff.

  "Are you ready?" she asked. Draco brushed the back of his hand against her forehead before tracing it down her cheek. "I was ready the moment you came back into my life, Granger. Are you ready?" "With you," she whispered, "I'm ready for anything."

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 39 posted.

** Posted this comment in a different thread:

"The God of the Lost, by Gravidy. This is one of the older D/Hr fics, originally posted on ffnet, and Gravidy has since... disappeared. Once you get past minor grammatical errors, she is an extremely talented writer with truly spellbinding worldbuilding and horrific imagery... Her fics have no match. Unlike some of my other fanfic reading material, I still enjoy her work as much as my mid-teenage self did.

Rizzle on ffnet has a good zombie DHr story, that comes to mind as well.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** I loved [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]]

#+begin_quote
  Becoming attached had never been part of the plan. Neither was falling in love. One night out on the town, Hermione comes face to face with Draco Malfoy--Memory Charmed and living as a Muggle--and an opportunity too good to pass up. What starts as revenge quickly grows into something more, and as Hermione delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the man who can't remember who he is - the man everyone thought was dead - she might discover more than she can handle.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.
