Unfortunately I have a hard time not bashing characters like Ron or the Weasleys or Snape. But it's starting to get in the way of my fanfics and people get annoyed. So I would appreciate tips on how to keep myself from bashing all and any Harry Potter characters in my Stories especially the Weasleys.

Thanks!


** 1. Think of them as their own independent people with their own stories rather than as adjuncts to Harry's story.

2. Have them learn from their mistakes and adapt to new circumstances.

3. Allow them victories.

4. Don't reveal all their thoughts to the reader but rather leave the reader guessing as to their true motives and plans.

Follow these points and even if you cannot resist making those characters villains, they will at least be interesting villains rather than cardboard cut-outs that only exist for Harry to easily defeat.

*** To add a little more value: Taure's comment is good advice for writing any supporting character, not just avoiding bashing. If a character isn't relevant to the story (doesn't meet points 1 or 3 of the comment), there's no reason for them to be there. Points 2 and 4 will make the supporting character more interesting.

Character bashing is just the antagonist version of creating a Mary Sue and neither of them are particularly interesting.

** Think about the very best qualities of the characters and work to emphasize those. To balance out your dislike. Make Ron witty . Make Snape speak with a double meaning every time he talks. If that isn't workable, it's ok to exclude these characters from your story.

*** Make Ron witty?

His cannon character is to be a heartfelt, laid back person who 'Says what he feels' without a thought. He may embarrass you, drive cute girls away who don't like his team, let you fight a dragon without warning cause of an argument, and eat so badly that it is a running gag... but he will stand up for you against death itself.

O.o Why not just make Hermione a class skipping girl about fashion, or Severus a forgive and forget christian who loves correcting potion mistakes?

Don't get me wrong, I've seen stories where characters are literally cursed with god like vengeance for such crimes as 'She read my mail without asking!' and 'He would rather die than do homework!', but calling Ron witty is not somehow 'un-bashing', it is almost lavish praise.

I had to get away from insulting the kid by basically having him do what he WOULD do if he wasn't so important to the story: Play chess, eat food, and sit places.

**** Ron was witty in book canon, his eating habits are fine, he does not only play chess, eat, and sit places. Only fanon and the movies make him look like a disgusting pig, a bunch of Ron lines were given to Hermione in the movies.

It was not Hermione that stood up to Sirius in PoA, it was Ron who stood up on a broken leg in the books while in the movie he was just in a corner whimpering.

In PS it was he who reminded Hermione to use her wand against the Devil's Snare while in the movie he just screamed.

When Draco called Hermione a mudblood Ron explained what it was and said the idea behind it was ridiculous, but in the movies Hermione explained what it was. Even though Ron is the one who should know about it because he grew up in the Wizarding World

When Snape called Hermione a know it all in the books he stood up for her, while in the movie he agreed with Snape.

You see what I mean, in the books Ron was amazing but the movies made a Hermione a goddess and Ron a buffoon.

***** Hmm... It HAS been a long time since the books, and the movies DID make him seem like an ass I suppose...

I think I have a bad impression for a few reasons.

I sympathized with Hermione a lot (Also a know-it-all person here, obviously) and the boy's constant fighting with her annoyed me.

The chess set thing annoyed me, because the supposed chess prodigy made NO ONE the king, the safest piece. I tried not to judge him not replacing the queen, as I am not brilliant at chess, mind you.

Ron went to a school of magic, to learn magic, to practice magic... and did NOT get a replacement wand for a whole year. Like having a machine gun randomly fire all the time. I can understand having pride, mind you, but not having a wand at a wand-required facility... Oh that made me angry, even if it was plot-required later. I think there was a fanfiction story where Goyle flat out refused to carry his, tossing it out or leaving it places, cause he only cared about potions, history, and so forth... at least that made SOME sense to me. If it WAS because they were poor... well, that speaks pretty badly in my opinion on the facilities, his family, hell, neither Hermione nor Harry volunteered to help out. (This still bothers me).

Ron's really bizarre refusal to believe his best friend about the Trophy thing. I mean, the boy sort of just decided "Hey, Harry is a lying asshole for some reason." His refusal to directly inform the boy sleeping in the same room that he may have to fight a DRAGON... well, that seemed like a murder attempt to me, and again, NO REASON as far as I could tell. I think he was still angry AS HE WALKED TO THE FIRST CHALLENGE.

After not caring about his rat for several years (To the point of forgetting it, almost sitting on it, cursing its existence), it became THE most important thing of his life 3rd year, more important than his friends. Yeah.

I'll forgive the broom thing, all wizards seem way too into Quidditch.

Hmm... now I'm second guessing myself about some of the other bits that annoy me. The whole 'abbandon them while trying to save the world in a tent' thing followed up with 'Showing up in time to save harry' thing bothered me, but I have read so many 'I abbandoned them cause I'm hungry' or 'I wanted more potions to blah blah' stories that the whole thing is foggy in my head, not to mention his mind being influenced by a soul portion.

And don't get me started on Snape, I never liked the Ass and he abused 11 year olds every year, 3/4ths of all the witches and wizards of England no less. And he wanted to tap a woman so hard that he went evil, tried to kill her husband and children, then wined about it forever.

Yeah... Snape was designed to be a bad guy, to the point where it was plot required. Just because the actor on screen did such a GOOD job portaying that, doesn't mean that he gets a good mark in my book when he uses the last moments of his life informing the boy he abused to 'GO KILL YASELF! Only way to save the day, sorry!'

So, here's the thing: Ron is convinced that because he is the sixth son he will never amount to anything compared to his brothers. His biggest desire is to be recognised for his accomplishments and his biggest flaw is his jealously, a flaw that he does try to keep under control but Harry being famous is just one more nail for the thing because obviously compared to him Ron won't be of any importance.

The horcrux in the locket fed on this, amplified his jealousy, and make him go out the tent. The thing is, he immediately wanted to go back but couldn't because the snatchers got him. And, I will note, he did protest when Harry decided that they are going to be taking turns wearing the locket, so we can't say he did not try.

#+end_quote

Ron did not want the rat, nor did he want to care for it. It'd been given to him as an afterthought basically, yet another hand-me-down, but the rat always managed fine. The third story was the first one where the rat was in any actual danger, and so the first time when Ron, not very willingly but still, actually tried to do something about it. And let's be honest, Hermione's lack of capacity to understand that maybe cats are predators so she shouldn't dismiss Ron's claims that the cat is trying to get the rat just because it's easier for her that way. I don't dislike Hermione but the whole situation with Scabbers would have been way different has she not behaved like a stubborn ... loon, frankly (she does the same thing---decides she knows better than anyone else so her version it is---when she throws clothes for the elves to find, and also when she obliviates her parents).

It's not really bizarre. Again, we go back to the jealousy and to the feeling insignificant compared to Harry thing. Yes, that should not have happened, it was Ron at his lowest. Nonetheless, I will point out that in the books Harry did not really try to talk with Ron, and what played on Ron's jealousy the most was that Harry did not want to tell him how he got past the age line when he knew Ron would have wanted to know. And from that moment neither of them talked with the other, so as far as Ron saw they may not have been friends anymore, so while not telling him about the dragons was not good it definitely was not a murder attempt, it was someone losing a friend and being convinced that the friend was somewhat at fault and thus not approaching them because they were no longer friends, not a deliberate choice to put Harry in danger via dragons. Jealousy? Sure. Childish stupidity? Sure. Malice? No.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, you do not understand. Because you ascribe pride to him as the reason for this when the real reason was that he thought his family did not have money to spend on him, even when it comes to something as important as a wand. Read the first book, his wand is in a shape where everyone would have told him to replace it even when he meets Harry for the first time, yes, before the first year even, but at that point where you read it you do not yet know how important it is to have a wand in good condition so people don't remember. It's easy to see Ron as arrogant, prideful, spiteful sometimes, it's a bit harder to see that there are moments when he's just resigned to not being important enough for anyone, even his own parents. It's easy to see him as utterly lazy because he just is, it's a bit harder to see him look at his homework and think “what does it matter, even if I do it nobody will notice me anyway”. It's easy to forget about his flaws, the ones that he really has and why he has them, and give them exaggerated versions that are there “because he's Ron”.

But if you want to not bash him, you will have to learn to not go for what is easy and instead write his character in his whole.

Ron's family was poor, they couldn't afford a new wand, and because of Ron and Harry flying the car to school, they had to pay a fine as well. Because of that, Ron didn't tell them.

I would recommend reading [[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=97181][this essay]] about Ron not believing Harry. It brings up some good points about the fight that is rarely brought up. Including Harry and Ron talking about entering, and Harry telling Ron how he would have entered his name during the night so no one could see him... And Ron never knew about the dragon, that was a movie invention.

He did not abandon them because he was hungry, but because he had just heard that the the "Weasley don't need any more of their kids injured" and that Ginny had been sent into the forbidden forest, and it seemed that Harry didn't care. Harry also had to basically ask him to leave THREE TIMES before Ron left

#+begin_quote
  “*So why are you still here?*” Harry asked Ron.
#+end_quote

“Search me,” said Ron.

#+begin_quote
  “*Go home then*,” said Harry.
#+end_quote

‘"Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn't you hear what they said about my sister? But you don't give a rat's fart, do you, it's only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I've- Faced-Worse Potter doesn't care what happens to her in there --- well, I do, all right, giant spider and mental stuff --- ”

“I was only saying --- she was with the others, they were with Hagrid --- ”

“Yeah, I get it, you don't care! And what about the rest of my family, the Weasleys don't need another kid injured, did you hear that?”

“Yeah, I---”

“Not bothered what it meant, though?”

“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don't think it means anything new has happened, anything we don't know about: think, Ron, Bill's already scarred; plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you're supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I'm sure that's all he meant --- ”

“Oh, you're sure, are you? Right then, well, I won't bother myself about them. It's all right for you two, isn't it, with your parents safely out of the way --- ”

“My parents are deadl” Harry bellowed.

“And mine could be going the same way!” yellow Ron.

#+begin_quote
  “*Then GO!*” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you've got over your spattergroit and Mummy'll be able to feed you up and --- ”

Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner's pocket, Hermione had raised her own.

** If it's been a long while since you read the books, it might also be helpful to reread parts or even just certain scenes to get a feel for what the character was like in canon, the way he talked, interacted with others etc.

Also, give the character the benefit of the doubt. Don't know why a character acted a certain way? Don't assume the worst motivation. They make mistakes, they (opposed to you) don't know their future. Consider what you know about them, and then think logically why they would act in a certain way.

E.g. the Weasleys... I don't even know how one would really bash the Weasleys. They have little money, but took Harry in almost every year, they invited him to the Quidditch World Cup, they sent him presents for Christmas, they worried about him. Yes, Molly is a concerned mother, yes she tries to keep Harry and the others away from the war. But if you really think about it, if you consider that she lost her brothers in the last war, almost lost her daughter, that she is surrounded by families that were destroyed by the war (Potters, Longbottoms, Blacks e.g.) then it seems only natural that she would try to shield the children from the war as much as possible.

*** I agree about Molly, but I know how the bashing got started I think.

While most of us in Harry's place would feel smothered by the attention she gives him (Do this, Go here, Clean this), I think Harry (In context) would have thrived under it.

A female parental figure who is giving the kids a common activity, helping him integrate with a bunch of strangers while standing out less... it was pretty clever if it was on purpose.

** I guess think how you would react if you where in their shoes. Characters have motivates. They are like people. They have flaws that may be more emphasized or strengths that are emphasize. Bashing a character is simply painting just their flaws without any redeeming qualities. That they themselves don't have anything that makes them complex.

For example, Percy. People can keep on saying he is a pompous Prefect or a git. However, if you are in his shoes. He is an elder brother who would worry about is younger siblings. He conflicts more with the Twins because some of their experiments are possibly dangerous. He was might've been inspired to get a high position in the Ministry to provide for his family. He could equate high position as better recognition for his family. So it would have hurt to be accused about something he worked so hard to achieve just to say he would spy on his own family.

Giving them a background story also helps lessen bashing moments.

** It sounds weird, but it's about having empathy for them, even if you disagree. All of their thoughts, behaviours and responses make sense to them, and, like everyone, they will see themselves as the hero of their own story. Something I found interesting when I wrote an argument between Harry and Ginny in a fic was a clear divide between people who thought Ginny was being a bitch and people who thought Harry was being selfish. Any conflict in your story should have layers of mistakes/unreasonableness as well as genuine motivation on both sides - unless you are writing for children people shouldn't be evil for the sake of being evil, and good characters should not always be right. You should be able to empathise (even if not necessarily sympathising) with the character.

** Well, if you don't want to bash Ron, for example, you need to take a look at Ron, and imagine yourself in Harry's shoes. Ron laid down his life for Harry in first year - sacrificing himself in the chess game. In second year, he, deathly afraid of spiders, followed him into the Forbidden Forest facing Acromantulas. He went down into the CoS with him, despite having a broken wand. In third year, he stood on a broken leg and told a supposed mass-murderer that he had to go through him before he could get to Harry. He engineered Harry's breakout with the flying car, too. He followed you into an obvious trap in year 5.

Now, in Harry's place, what kind of person would you be if you consider him a traitor for being jealous once in year 4? Imagine that. I'd think you'd have a hard time not bashing Harry, seen from this point of view.

Now, realise that most of the "Ron eats like a pig" stuff is comedy and hyperbole - or fanon. Molly certainly wouldn't tolerate a total lack of manners in her children. And that Ron was more or less as skilled in magic as Harry.

It really doesn't take that much to not bash Ron. Simply don't brush away what he actually did. He is Harry's best friend. He is one of the bravest kids in the books. (Snape is a bloody coward in comparison, and Neville is a wet blanket.) Yes, he doubted Harry in fourth year - and? Everyone but Hermione did far worse.

As far as the other Weasleys are concerned, Molly can be portrayed as forceful and overbearing. But once again, put yourself in her place. She has raised the twins - who were as stupid and reckless to try and make Ron swear an unbreakable vow as kids. And generally break any and all rules they know, and seem to waste their talents - they're smart - by doing the minimum of O.W.L.s. Now imagine hearing about Ron and Harry's adventures. Your kids and their friends are facing dark lords, giant snakes, giant spiders, steal your car to drive across the country, almost break the SoS, and want to fight in a brewing civil war. And 9 months out of 12 they're at Hogwarts, where you can't protect them and keep them from killing themselves. I think you might be a little overbearing too - especially if you're staying, say, in a house full of curses and traps, and know the kids will want to explore. Oh, and if you read the infamous "love potion" scene, it's "Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a Love Potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly". Nothing about using it to catch Arthur, or his interest. It sounds more like an amusing "Look how stupid I was when I was a kid" story.

With regards to Snape, I would advise you not to go overboard. He is a miserable excuse for a human being who bullies kids for no fault of their own, but he is not a cartoon villain. He loathes Voldemort more than anyone else, he seems to practically live for his revenge, and he is very smart.

As for Ron's point of view, imagine you have this trusted great friend you went through all that dangerous madness. There is this tournament, far safer than an acromantula or basilik's nest, where you're barred from entrance. You joke about it with your trusted friend, they both agree there is no way you can enter, neither is trying to find a way to enter and, BAM! he gets chosen through an obvious cheat.

Wouldn't you believe he could have told you how to enter either because he trusts you or because both can try to enter? And that by refusing to share with you how to enter, he's actively blocking your way into the tournament?

** There's a lot of great advice in this thread, so I'll go with something a bit closer to home.

Think about yourself for a moment. Remember the life you've lived, from what you remember of childhood to the present day. Remember your parents and/or siblings, and all the good or bad times spent with them. Remember your hopes and dreams, your wants and desires. Remember your first crush, your puberty, the best and worst moments of your life. Remember all the times you were right, and all the times where you just /thought/ you were right. Remember that moment of Oh-Shit-I-Fucked-Up, and Oh-Shit-I-Can't-Believe-That-Worked-Out. Remember all of that. You've lived all of this. You are a person.

Now remember that /everyone else/ is a person too. They have their own family, their own wants and desires, their own triumphs and failures. They have lived their own lives. They've lived their lives like you've lived yours.

** Making them relatable, while not required, is probably the easiest way to gain sympathy from your readers. Identify their motivations and have their actions reflect those. If they're proactive, they're probably going to be interesting whether or not they're aligned with your main character.

Ron is oftentimes unmotivated, but he wants to be acknowledged. The struggle to accomplish this without resorting to some sort of mental fortitude potion or self-induced Imperious to buckle down will be something people can relate to.

Snape is broken by self-incrimination and self-loathing. The fact that he's semi-functional at all is a minor miracle. It doesn't mean he's not a disgusting human being, but you don't need to make him likable, just make the reasons behind his actions not entirely irrational.

*** The issue with this is that if you stay true to some characters they end up bashed. Take Molly Weasley for example. She knew Harry was getting abused and she sent food instead of calling the authorities. That's at least accessory to child abuse. How anyone can see her as the loving mother figure is beyond me. Just read the scene when Harry arrives at the Burrow in CoS.

There are a couple more characters where Rowling writes characters in a certain way but ignores it in the end because she intended the character to be received in a positive light (Draco Malfoy, Snape). Draco's attack on Katie alone would earn him multiple lifetimes in prison if not outright execution. Apparently, the unforgivables are forgivable since he is free in the epilogue. You cannot write those following Rowling without either having gaping plotholes or disregarding the canon interpretation of the character.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday.
#+end_quote

Molly suspected that Harry was badly treated to the point where she and her husband considered getting him out of there (CoS). You don't take children away from their guardians without their consent without good reason else it is called kidnapping and even then you need to inform the authorities. So either the Weasleys suspected that Harry was abused but were content with letting him be with his abusive relatives or they did not, in which case there would be no reason to remove him from Privet Drive. By GoF Molly knew that he was starved. She sent food. 1/4 of a grapefruit has around 30 calories if we are generous. That was Harry's breakfast. In his age, the recommended intake is 2200-3200. Divided by three you get 730-1065. So in the best case scenario, Harry got less than 5% of his supposed ration. Wikipedia lists starvation as a form of torture and sign of child abuse. The Dursleys abused/tortured him and Molly knew.

  Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.

Signs of malnutrition in SS.

#+begin_quote
  The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust. “It's no good turning your beak up at it --- that's all we've got,” said Harry grimly.
#+end_quote

Literal starvation in CoS. A can of soup has 200 calories at most. That is 600 calories daily at most while he should get over 2000.

Harry does not give the signs of an abused person, therefore there is no way for her to know that he is abused.

First, she did not know Harry was getting abused. She was told that the Dursleys put bars on Harry's window, and logically assumed her sons were exaggerating.

Second, she had no reason to believe it because she had not witnessed it. To say nothing of the twins breaking the bars off Harry's window, thereby eliminating any evidence.

Third, what of Hermione? She lives in the Muggle world; she knows the proper channels. She only sent food too. Are you going to bash Hermione?

Molly had reasons for her concern and yet nothing ever came out of it. Harry even went as far as telling her that he was being starved and yet she did not call the authorities. In Germany, we call that "Unterlassene Hilfeleistung", which translates as failure to rend aid and is a criminal offence. And according to Wikipedia, there is a Duty to rescue in Britain if you are watching over a child, such as Molly did when Harry was at the Burrow.

** Figure out each character's greatest strength, and their fatal flaw. Make another list of positive/negative qualities for each character, and make sure that you show them in relatively equal amounts. This can also help prevent making your characters too overpowered -- if you notice your character has no fatal flaw, then they're probably not only overpowered but also one dimensional.

Take, for example, Ron. One of his greatest strengths is his loyalty to his friends and his willingness to sacrifice himself/overcome his fears to support them (think chess game, and going into the Forbidden Forest despite the Acromantulas). One of his major flaws is his short temper (goblet of fire fiasco, storming off during the horcrux hunt). Some other positives are his sense of humor, and his knowledge of the Wizarding World (he tells Harry what Quidditch is, reminds Hermione to use her wand in the first book). Another negative is his impulsivness/acting before he thinks.

If you do this for all your characters, and make sure to show some of their positive qualities while not making their flaws the only characterization, you'll be able to avoid bashing :)

** Ok first thing is that personally I do not believe that it is possible to bash Snape. Snape is a member of a magic Nazi death cult and likely had to commit horrible acts as part of the initiation. And also prior to that used the magical equivalent of the N word to attack his best friend. There is no redemption for Snape and without major changes to canon where he actively changes his behavior there is no reason to pretend he is a decent human being. And before anyone says what about his enduring love for Lily I will simply point out that I don't find Snape capable of loving someone.

Ron in specific, Ron has an inferiority complex as the youngest of 6 boys. His brothers already set the bar so high that Ron feels he cannot match it. There are two ways to deal with this. First, you could give him places to excel maybe have a Hogwarts chess team or have Oliver notice how obsessed Ron is with Quidditch and take Ron under his wing to become Captain latter (probably should have Harry be prefect instead if you do this). Second, ditch him fast. There are many ways this could happen: Harry and Ron don't meet on the train, Harry picks Hermione over Ron 3rd year, Ron ruins their friendship after the Goblet of Fire incident.

The Weasleys which usually means Molly and Ginny. Starting with Ginny have her get over her crush and move on. If she is not going to be Harry's love interest have her date Neville or anyone else really. Then she was just a young girl with a crush on a celebrity and not an obsessed stalker. Molly bashing is a function of many people not finding Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny parings realistic over Hermione/Harry and looking for a reason to explain how the canon parings happen. The obvious answer to some people is the use of love potions. To solve this have Ron and Ginny date other people and have Molly avoid interfering in their relationships.

I mean, you're pretty far gone into fanon if you can't see that those two things right there are bashing in and of themselves. There's no canon version of an initiation, or any indication at all that there is one. And what you "don't find Snape capable of" directly contradicts canon.

Okay, but the Patronus kinda says differently. People can read Snape so differently- I see him as not being "in love" or infatuated, so much as simply loving the only person who showed him friendship and care pretty much his entire life. Like someone would love their grandmother or their sister. The only reason he had a problem with Lily going out with James Potter is because he was a bullying Marauder.

And I believe Sirius was trying to murder Snape, not Snape murder Remus.

As for the Death Eaters, I believe all they had to do was be trusted by Voldemort. Which Draco kind of proves.

No Sirius was not trying to murder Snape he didn't tell Snape to go confront Remus only how to do it. Snape wanted to prove his suspicion about Remus correct and expel him and Sirius at worst and potentially kill Remus at best in an attempt to hurt James.

Draco is a special case among Death Eaters for three reasons. First, it punishes his parents for their failings. Second, he has access to Hogwarts and as a student is unlikely to attract much attention. Third, Voldemort expects him to fail this ties into the first point but Draco failing will test Snape's loyalty.

Eh, you never called a loved one any names? My siblings and I used to have some spectacular fights when we were all teens. Some I thought I'd never forgive them from. Yes, he crossed a line, but that's kinda what the entire Snape plotline rests on, how much he regretted it.

Sorry but there's a lot more evidence for Sirius trying to murder Snape than the other way around. Snape knew Sectumsempra all the time, if he wanted to murder any of the marauders there'd be no reason to go to a time and place Sirius had told him. He could just wait around a dark corner and do it any old time.

I'm not sure why you think Molly should have seen a problem? It seems that she lives in a society with very different standards.

The second problem with your theory is that nobody in the HP universe seems overly concerned with child abuse. 1. All the muggle teachers who Harry had while sleeping in a closet seemed not to notice any abuse? 2. The neighbours of the Dursleys didnt seem to notice any abuse? 3.
