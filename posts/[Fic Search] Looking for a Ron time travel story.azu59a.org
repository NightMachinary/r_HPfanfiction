All I can remember is that it's post-series, Ron comes out of Auror retirement to help with a case, and it involves some wackiness involving Harry's (as of yet unknown) sister Rose and some strangeness involving potential incest (I don't want to give too much away to people who might be interested, but I hope this provides enough to spark someone's memory).
