A friend of mine just wrote this what do y'all think. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12384075/1/A-troubled-past-the-biography-of-Albus-Dumbeldore]]


** I can't read that until you fix the lack of paragraph breaks. I'm not trying to be rude, I literally can't read it.

Let me know when you do and I'll happily give you my thoughts.

** "Friend"? Choose a different username if you want to fool anyone. And if you don't have the guts to own up to your writing, then don't fucking promote it.

** It needs a fair bit of work grammatically and structurally. The story, for example, shouldn't start in the same paragraph as the Author's Note.

The sentence structure is very choppy and there's some really basic errors that make me believe it wasn't edited at all before posting, such as names not being capitalized.

As for dialogue, well, read the following.

Content wise; I have a very hard time believe that the parents didn't have a name picked out for the child before it was born.

Stylistically, are you trying to write a 'biography' or a story? There's a big difference. If you call it a biography, then write it as a biography. There's plenty of interesting ways to write a historical fiction biography of a person and keep with that tone. And really, it could be quite interesting to write as an in-universe historian putting their opinion into the text.

But if you go that route then things like 'no one saw the baby levitate the wand when it was less than a day old' are very unbelievable. Apocryphal stories of power in his youth that are believed to be more legend than fact come off as a better solution and then also juxtapose the Dumbledore of myth and the Dumbledore of fact, leaving the reader to determine the truth of it all.

You could look to something like, say, Anthony Everitt's "Augustus" as an example of how this could work. Or, more fictionally, George R. R. Martin's coffee table book, "A World of Ice and Fire."

But if you just want to write a story about Dumbledore's life, go for it. My suggestion, though, would be to not call it a biography in that case.

** Perhaps add a summary instead of just a link?

** You should make up your mind with regards to whether his mother's name is Kendra, Kendall, or Kendrall.

Hint: it's Kendra.
