I mean seriously , you guys are awesome.

I've seen everything from a request for tentacle smut to mundane stuff like hhr and hg .People don't even judge the cringy stuff either , this might be the most accepting forum for fanfics i've every seen.

That's not a good choice. That's not even the choice between a half-decent and a bad story. That's a choice between brown and green shit. Whatever you choose, you'll be eating shit either way.

*** I totally agree. There are a lot of ships I don't agree with but I never actually say anything to people who request them cause I don't want people to attack me for what I like. I probably shouldn't, but if someone is already attacking me or someone else for a certain ship I'll get into argument. *Example:* Some (AND I SAID SOME) H/Hr shippers who attack H/G as a pairing and go on and on about how she must have love potioned Harry in canon or thrust their "evidence" in people's faces that JK Rowling admitted she made a mistake from an article that was taken totally out of context. I read Harry/Hermione stories myself, just like I read Harry/Ginny, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harry Susan, etc... I just don't like people who go nuts on how other people's opinions are wrong but luckily like OP is saying, this sub is really good in that regard. Once and a while I'll see someone make a single comment about how they don't like something or don't understand the attraction to something but nothing overly rude. Comparing this to another forum I've been on its pretty much perfect. This other group had two people last weekend get into a 100+ comment argument over James/Lily vs Snape/Lily. Anyway... rant over. *TLDR:* Yes I agree, this sub is amazing... it's not perfect but a lot better than many other forums.

**** Wasn't that Sugar Quill? Their policy was basically only the main canon ships and Remus/Sirius. So that's understandable, given that there would be lots of potential for H/Hr shippers trolling the forum with things like "RON AND GINNY ARE EVUL!!!!1".

Talking of H/Hr, where has Portkey gone? They've been gone since 2010, and now their shippers are roaming around, with nowhere to go, lol. Since you seem to be quite deep into fandom history, could you explain?

There's also a difference between fanfiction and general fandom circles. Harry/Hermione is more popular in fanfiction, while H/G is much more popular generally. Dramione is an exception though, because it's very popular in both segments (because of the bad boy/good girl trope that so many people like). So part of the reason why there is so much acceptance for different ships here is because people realize that it's kept to the fanon arena.

I don't mean that Dramione is EVIL or shouldn't exist (if some people enjoy reading and writing it, good for them), I just mean that Sirius is a textbook example of a Bad boy (He even has a motorcycle for Godric's sake!), which is why I LOVE Hermione/Sirius as a ship, with or without the age difference.

*** On the other hand I have personally been part of several slash recommendation threads. And level-headed discussions about why some slash and most mpreg fics are just plain bad - but some people (for example the gays /gasp/) still like to read the better ones from time to time.

Also there was the "like robst but better" thread were nobody was chased away by an angry mob.

Sure, noone here will treat you like a special snowflake, but I have never felt disrespected here. And I HAVE been banned from some places for my homosexual ways so yeah - if you are upfront about what you want and why and not a complete ninny this sub is rather accepting :D

Gen and het fiction ist just so much more abundant that it is far easier to find ones where any relationships are not the whole plot and tastefully/well done. To the point that I often like them more but, you know, sometimes you like reading about /people like you/ even if it is cringy in places...

EDIT: more in-depth link [[http://failfandomanonwiki.pbworks.com/w/page/65995575/Thanfiction]]

The story itself is super dark and has appalling depictions of women and ethnic minorities, which, fine, loads of people like ridiculous over the top angst, but it grinds my gears that something so wildly out of sync with the series is hailed as canon. When you read the story within the context of his bonkers real life you kind of get the impression that he's psychotic, and suddenly the gratuitous violence and pathetic women become a little disturbing, not in an entertaining way.

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't they say in the first chapter to rebel against the death eaters with their homemade/cultural magic? So you had a bunch of non-canon stereotypical magic spells being thrown around? I don't even know. Point of the ramble? I agree that it wasn't strictly canon.

It's the same with popular/infamous stories. >90% of the HPMoR and Robst fans are probably really great users who make fantastic contributions. It's the small percentage who argue that their fandoms are better than canon that cause [[/r/hpfanfiction]] to collectively lose their marbles.
