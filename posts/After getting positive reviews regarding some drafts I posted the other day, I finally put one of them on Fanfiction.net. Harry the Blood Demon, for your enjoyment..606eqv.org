#+begin_quote
  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)
#+end_quote

A creature!Harry story without the stupid "soulmate" thing or any form of unneccesary slash, /Harry the Blood Demon/ is my attempt at writing a smart, monstrous Harry that doesn't conform to the usual Light-Dark dichotomy. He's amoral without being /evil;/ instead, nothing will stop Harry in his pursuit of practical knowledge... except, maybe, his stomach.

Heavily inspired by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6172754/1/Freak-of-Nature][/Freak of Nature./]]

** This is brilliant so far, though as a reader I feel like I need something explaining why Harry appears hyper-intelligent as a 10 year old to suspend my disbelief from. I find myself really enjoying the bits where his childishness shines through, or where his shades act parental. It creates an adorable dichotomy between childhood innocence and, of course, being a literal demon.

** Is there an update schedule you will try to keep with, or are you just going to write when you feel like it? Either way, I'm looking forwards to reading more of your story.

*** I'm pretty sure that the word you're looking for isn't "etymology". Based on your comment below, you probably wanted "inspiration".
