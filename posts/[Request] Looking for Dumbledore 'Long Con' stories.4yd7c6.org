I know there is a lot of fanfiction out there where Dumbledore is depicted as a bad guy. A 'what if?' recently came to mind and I wonder if any of you know of a fanfic that matches this scenario:

Dumbledore is running a long con, having actually killed Voldemort at the Potter's and is using him as a boogeyman to keep his positions. He manipulates things to keep a constant level of perceived threat going so that the wizarding world 'needs' his 'protection'.

Of course, any stories showing him being exposed as a fraud in the end would be welcome.


** Um that sounds AMAZING and also surprisingly like the plot of Carry On by Rainbow Rowell. It's... Kind of HP Fanfiction?

**** Well, it's technically a published book that the author intended as a satirical/subversive take on the HP series that pokes some fun at tropes while addressing the lack of racial/lgbt diversity in the original... I got my copy on Kindle but it's also available in non digital format if that suits your fancy...

** I'd be more interested in such a story if (assuming it's from his PoV) he got away with it.

** I'd love a story like that. At the same time, I'd want to virtually strangle that Dumbledore.

** To what end, though? Is there some agenda he wants to push, and if so, what is it?

*** Most of the Dark Dumbledore stories I've seen simply have him wanted to be the most revered wizard of his time. This is just a different path to the same end - and even better, by manufacturing the threat he knows he won't have to actually face a lethal confrontation.

*** P.S. Maybe he's a sociopath and /loves/ watching everyone run around in the circles he's created for them.
