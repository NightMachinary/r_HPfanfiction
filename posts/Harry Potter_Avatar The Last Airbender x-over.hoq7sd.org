Doesn't necessarily have to be a full crossover. Maybe Harry is just playing by a pond, doing some stuff he saw in a cartoon (like literally every kid I've ever met has done!), until all of a sudden, he gets slapped in the face by a water whip, or knocked down by a freak gust of wind, etc. Bonus points if Harry is the Avatar, come to bring balance to the Magical World.


** Cool sounding idea.

** I know it's a little late but I just saw this post and to recommend my personal favourite crossover fic (one of my favourite fics in general). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6832255?page=3&show_comments=true#comments][Harry thinks he's the avatar and wow does he commit to the role]]

** I don't know how to work the ffn bot linker, but there's a this amazing story by The Sorting Cat called Harry Potter: the Last Avatar. It's amazingly good but incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2014

** Born for the slaughter by attackfish. It's a WIP but I believe she intends to go back. Dunno how to link but it follows Zuko and Azula in the HPverse and their years at Hogwarts. It's real good. You can find it on AO3
