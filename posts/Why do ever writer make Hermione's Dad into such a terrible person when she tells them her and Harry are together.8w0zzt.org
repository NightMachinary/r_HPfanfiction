This mostly has to do with all the Lord Potter or Time-Travel fanfics. Every time Hermione says she and harry are together. (im just gonna call him Dan, Most common name in FF) Dan always runs his mouth makes an ass out of himself and even his wife is on the kids side. It's totally understandable on where hes coming from his underage daughter just comes to them and says "I love this Boy you've never met in person, but ive written about him to you and we are getting married." Any sane parent would do the exact same thing. Why isnt her mother agreeing with Dan? Why do Fanfic writers see the need to bash on Him so much?


** Well, underage Hermione and Harry marrying is a usually warning sign in a story. Such an act doesn't fit either Wizarding Britain nor muggle Britain, and certainly not Hermione's character and social class.

But mostly, I think that's the shitty "shotgun polishing dad" cliche in action.

***** Cant link a specific Fanfic from the top of my head but I remember one in which the cliche was written in a humorous way:\\
- Hermiones dad shows Harry his cool gun collection\\
- Hermione and her mother roll their eyes\\
- Harry points out his wand and that it is the equivalent of a small a-bomb.\\
- Hermiones dad kinda faints

Something like that

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** It's dumb on multiple levels:

a) As many have pointed out it's extremely out of character for Hermione to suddenly get married. While I'm not against Soul Bonds the whole "You're now legally married and treated like adults" is completely ridiculous and makes no sense.

b) He's totally right to be concerned when his underage daughter is suddenly married to someone he doesn't know... It's idiotic to make him the antagonist just because he doesn't immediately embrace something so weird. It's just ridiculous when he expresses this in such a Neanderthal way (see next point).

c) It's a way to write the overprotective father cliche, which for some reason people enjoy, even though it's the most ridiculous thing a father could do if he actually wanted to protect his daughter. Yeah, alienating her and acting like a raving maniac is sure gonna help get her away from that awful dude.

** Because some writers have no creativity and are unimaginative. It is far easier to write a flat character than give them /actual motivations/ for the way they act.

** Unless we are talking about a "marry now or get executed/arrested" type of situation, I am out as soon as underage marriage is mentioned. I mean, you can legally marry at age 16 in Scotland, but it would be very OOC for Hermione to do so (unless they have been romantically involved for some time before the hunt, they feel hopeless and even then Hermione is 18 and Harry 17).

That being said, I think it is normal for any parent to be concerned about whom their child is dating. But the whole "evil father threatening his daughter's BF" thing comes from American media and their weird fixation on purity/virginity. There is a difference between being concerned when your daughter shows up with a broke stoner who stinks of Weed and has cum strains on his torn sweatpants and tearing apart every BF your daughter brings home even if he is from the Royal Family. Most parents, at least here in Europe, would be interested in getting to know the BF, maybe ask a few questions, but other than that they tend to be pretty accepting unless there is a valid reason to complain.

** The ones I read Mr. Granger doesn't hate on Harry enough, he sees him as already a son, and normally the name is Dan, it's annoying, and Mrs. Granger is always talking about how hot Harry is, and normally the name of her is Emma. I rather see the bashing, lol.

** Because sadly overprotective fathers who think their "little princess" is made out of glass aren't all that uncommon! Neither is fathers threatening boyfriends (in the US some fathers might still show their daughter's BF their guns, with the non to subtle prompting that they might be staring into the muzzle of said weapons if they hurt their darling daughter!)...luckily I never met one, but I would probably talk to my girlfriend about that (make it known that I think her father is a massive jerk and can go to hell for all I care!)

As for Hermione getting married young? I agree that it's not great and unlikely! Hell, her marrying when she did in canon is still not to my liking! I don't get why most authors don't get that Hermione would most likely starting to think about marriage when she's 25 and older (hell, maybe not even till she's in her thirties!)

ps: I wouldn't even be astonished if she thought marriage was bullshit (but maybe that's just my own anti-marriage-bias (I hate the institution of marriage with a passion! It has ruined my father's life IMHO and I will do all I can to never see the inside of a divorce court in my life! Best way to do this? Not getting married!) influencing things!)
