#+begin_quote
  Sent back in time due to a careless mistake, Harry is granted a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get to know those people he should have known since birth. With his "sister" Tonks by his side, what will Harry make of this unique opportunity? Will he finally have the family he's always longed for? Join Harry as he joins the Marauders in 1976. A companion to Taking Control.
