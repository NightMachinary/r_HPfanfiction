Do any AUs exist where more Hogwarts Houses than in canon have existed for a long time, not ones that the Sorting Hat creates as soon as Harry arrives at Hogwarts? You'd have to add a lot of OCs and maybe more classes but it would be, in my opinion, a fine idea if it doesn't exist already.


** Teddylonglong has a few where house of Merlin was forgotten and i think in "Ghost of Hogwarts" Harry discovers two additional houses that were disbanded by previous Headmasters because the founders had not pure blood. (I'm not sure of the fic's name)
