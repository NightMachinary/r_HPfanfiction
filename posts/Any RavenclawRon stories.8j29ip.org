I just got an update from AO3 saying that the Switchverse had updated, it still says that the latest story was published in 2007 so don't get your hopes up maybe my computer is just screwed up. But the unique sorting of Ron really interests me so I was wondering if any of you guys have anymore.


** Don't have any recs, but it has updated. Chapter 4 on The Prisoner is new. They're possibly backdating their stories? Don't know why. But I double checked on their LJ and the new chapter is there, posted yesterday.

** I've never really seen any, but isn't that because Ron is the most anti-Ravenclaw character there is? You'd have to make him so OOC to be a ravenclaw it'd just be an OC.

Ravenclaw isn't even about being smart or intelligent, which Ron may be, but about thirsting for knowledge, about being studious, which is about as far from Ron Weasley as you can get.

***** My point was that Ravenclaw seems to have space for a /lot/ of different kinds of intelligence, and it wouldn't take THAT much of a tweak from canon to put Ron - who has an excellent mind for strategy and problem solving...we know he's great at chess, in the later books he makes observations which *Hermione* of all people considers "brilliant", and it's him who does a lot of problem solving on the fly; he found Harry in the room of requirement, he found the brooms that saved them from the fiendfyre, and it was his idea to use basilisk fangs to destroy the Horcrux - in it.

Honestly, I think you could put any of the trio in any of the houses.

I'd say Crabbe and Goyle, but Ron is fairly witty and wise in his own sort of way. His problem though is that he isn't knowledge-seeking. Quite the opposite, in fact.

He most certainly is.

*** Being studious is Hufflepuff's thing actually, hard work and all that.

And while a love for learning is part of Ravenclaw's desired qualities, it's not the only one (Ron probably counts as having wit and a decent amount of widsom). Furthermore, learning is not just about academics, Luna is into weird things and isn't especially noted for being a straight-O student : Ron's love for quidditch could lead to learning a bunch of trivia, statistics and so on and you just don't become good at chess without loving learning new ways to play it.

And he would actually fit pretty well with a number a known Ravenclaws : the Ravenclaws of Harry's time are aither quidditch players (Cho Chang, Roger Davis), judgemental cliqey people (what happened to Luna) which Ron can be or really into their hobbies (Luna), wich Ron is with Quidditch and Chess.
