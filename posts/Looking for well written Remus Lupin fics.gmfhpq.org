** Here's a beautiful one explaining that boggart lesson:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125]])

I wrote (and am slowly writing) a few, all pretty much canon compliant, therefore depressing.

A little Marauders-era one-shot: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14923193]])

A WIP about his work in the first war, ultimately explaining why his friends didn't trust him enough to tell him the real plan:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796]])

After Halloween, 1981:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

And canon doesn't tell us that he didn't know Tonks during Prisoner of Azkaban.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

** TheDivine Comedian has a lot of good stuff like that, but here are some of the best Remus ones: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] by TheDivineComedian; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] by TheDivineComedian; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12299451][Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow]] by TheDivineComedian)

It's post books, but linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) is a really good Remus fic.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][/Living With Danger/]], which centers around Remus Lupin and an OC, Hermione's older sister.

I actually enjoyed it, starting out, but eventually lost interest. It started getting stupid, IMO...
