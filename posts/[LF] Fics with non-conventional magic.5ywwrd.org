I kind of want to see fics with different, more symbolic magic. I read a nice fic a while back that involved the Weasleys(Percy?) Using hedge magic.

So yeah, hedge magic, voodoo magic, cantrips, rituals scraped together from random ingredients, the sort of thing where symbolism matters more than pronunciation, or wand movements.


** linkffn(By the Divining Light) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song). These are in the running for the best fics in the entire fandom.

** not sure if it's quite what you're looking for, but:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]

first story in a trilogy by Miranda flairgold. involves blood magic, necromancy, and soul magic, among other things.

very entertaining read, though it's more or less abandoned at this point.

** Are you talking about Percy take the wheel? Just read it & its lovely.

I think linkffn(the crown of metis) was light magic with a symbolic twist.

Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle) has some symbolic magic, especially in the sequels. Nicknames come from old folktales and develop their associated magic (the ozarker myths), death is represented with a coin, the magic of child sacrifices is a huge plot point. It's more epic symbolism than hedge magic, though.

*** Linkao3(house proud by astolat) also has symbolic/hedge magic. The plot is Harry reclaiming the 'soul' of Grimmauld Place after his neglect and resentment turns the house against him.

** linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) is the first one that came to mind. As a brief warning, this fic is dark, but it's also fairly well-written and has an interesting take on voodoo magic. It also has a couple of sequels.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
