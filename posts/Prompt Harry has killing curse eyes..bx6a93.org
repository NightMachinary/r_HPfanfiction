Like Marvel's Cyclops, Harry has killing curse avada kedavra's for eyes. Meaning, they have the bright, poisonous green light, the loud rushing wind noise, and the rotting stank described in the books.

Unlike Cyclops, he's shooting unforgivables from his eye sockets, ones that are hazardous to physical objects.

How will Harry function in a world where he can't quite make out what people are saying and he smells like rotting meat and if he opens his eyes people just die?


** I do not recall a rotting smell in the book and I've read them many times.

*** Killing curse vs glasses, what would win?

Unless you mean the glasses would focus the killing curse or something, in which case that sounds like it would be more dangerous

**** I'm talking about since it's like the cyclops thing then wouldn't an indirect gaze aka through glasses wouldn't kill right?

***** From everything in the books, killing curses cause unpredictable destruction when they make contact with something that isn't alive. Unsure how that would translate to inferi, but I expect it to explode part or all of the body, or try to kill it again and appear to do nothing at all.

Glasses would probably explode, shatter, melt, something. Never heard of a spell reflecting off of something.

*** I like it, but if we're consistent, spoons wouldn't hold up against the killing curse, and his eyes shouldn't stop emitting the horror even if they're removed. Sooner or later, they'd get set down and just blast their way to the center of the Earth, I guess.
