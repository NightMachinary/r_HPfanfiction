Nitwit - A stupid incompetent person

Blubber - Excess bodily waste / Excessive crying

Oddment - Left over after the rest has been used or sold

Tweak - Adjust finely

Is it just me or did Dumbledore just outright insulted everyone in the Great Hall. I mean from my perspective it sounds like Dumbledore meant "You, children are all stupid, naive and fat. Some of you are probably orphans from the previous war, and all of you need to be guided by us teachers to the correct path. As well as succeeding in your studies so Hogwarts will always be a great school"

I propably made some Dumbledore-haters didn't I...

How about a less mocking one "Many students has came to this Halls are like you, without knowledge and irresponsible, or maybe their brothers outshine them (referring Aberforth to Dumbledore) but do not worry for within these Halls even your brothers started just like you. With some help from the teachers you will be great witches and wizards and help the wizarding world, who knows maybe you'll be like me one day..."

I hope there is a fanfic where Luna's the only one who noticed this and told Neville or Harry


** Personally i prefer the idea that those are the names of the house elfs in charge of the house tables

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** When you say houselves and I look back at the words and found another insult though its pretty much the same.

Nitwit/Ravenclaw - smartest house but not the people

Blubber/Griffindor - bravest house but also not the people

Tweak/Slytherin - House that needs to be guided to the right path

Oddment/Hufflepuff - Well I don't know how to describe it but they are the rest

Wow JK Rowling, just wow...

** You know something. My head cannon is that those 4 words that Dumbledore says, are just him calling for the House Elves to start the feast. 1 elf per House.

I never took the words in a literal sense. It's Dumbledore after all.

** I like Dumbledore, and for all his faults, I don't think he'd say something like that. He was either naming the house-elves in charge of putting food on the tables or literally just saying a few random words.

Not everything is a Dumbledore-conspiracy.

This one makes sense in the mouth of a man old enough to remember Music Hall. It's a standard comp√®re's joke from that era: I dare say it absolutely /slew/ back in 1910. It was a standard for tedious old think-they're-funny bores when I was a kid in the 70s, and I seem to recall Vic Reeves recycling it on /Big Night Out/ as part of his schtick as a music-hall/variety revivalist.

** The story Three Little Words by Rouven_Auge_des_Sturms_Singer has Fred and George placing a bet and then telling the fourth years (Harry and Hermione that Dumbledore was just telling the Head Elves to start the feast.

George smirked at his brother before turning and agreeing. "All right. My brother, will you bestow wisdom on these mere fourth years?" He asked waving dramatically over the three of them. Fred bowed slightly, making a smirk too. "Oh yes, my dear brother I will. You see, my lovely Mrs Granger, you are asking the wrong question. The question is not what, but who." He said grinning at them. Hermione rolled her eyes.

"What is that supposed to mean?" She said in an annoyed tone, before eating another sweet potato. Fred smirked leaning closer. "You see these words, that are no words its names. More so the names of the four head house-elves designated to each house. Nitwit for Ravenclaw. Blubber for Gryffindor. Tweak for our friends in the dungeons and Oddment for our badgers. It is the signal for the four of them that the feast is starting." He said with a wink, while Harry stopped eating, looking surprised.

  This is a AU where Harry and Hermione use the timeturner to change one more thing and it makes all the difference. It changes the course of the world to a better turn. A lot of politics and also Fluff.Of course, this is a fan-fiction. I don't own Harry Potter in any kind or way and I don't make money with this story.

** I always thought there are four words and four houses, so each word means something to the houses.

I think they are what people in each house don't want to be seen as. Let me explain:

Nitwit - basically the opposite of Ravenclaws values. So Ravenclaw students work to try not to seem like a Nitwit in their house

Blubber - it's what people in other houses think of Hufflepuff, so Hufflepuff students work hard to not be viewed as such within their house.

Oddment - in Slytherin where pure blood beliefs and old traditions are followed, no student would want to seem the odd one out in that house

Tweak - When you tweak, you fine tune something cautiously. Gryffindor is full of brash and brave people. Students in that house would not want to stand out by being more calculated in their risks.

Overall I think Dumbledore wanted them to know that it was okay and understandable to feel like that during the school year, and that being different is okay. Just my two cents.
