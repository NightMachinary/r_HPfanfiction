"Have you seen my Toad?" a pudgy boy asks. "Kuchiyose no Jutsu!" a small toad appears. "Yo, Niichan, got any candy?" The Toad asks, laughing as the Pudgy boy faints, so shocked by the idea of a talking Toad.

Technically Gamakcihi would be allowed at Hogwarts, and Hagrid would probably fangirl over Gamabunta. Dumbledore would probably get scolded by Shima quite heavily as well.

Plus the idea of Trevor suddenly talking to scare the life out of Neville would be hilarious.


** Umbridge obviously signed it and tried to become a sage. No success, during the training with the oil, she was going to transform and was interrupted but not "repaired" by the cleansing beat stick. That's why she's sour at life, she's lost her natural look. Maybe if she was hit by hit she would be less ugly... and nicer.

** I had this idea for a toad animagus Harry who would defeat Voldemort by zapping him with a faster-than-a-spell tongue attack, but it turns out that frogs and toads don't actually have tongues several times the length of their body. Drat.
