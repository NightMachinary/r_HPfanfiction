One where Dumbledore takes an active role in making him the best wizard he can be. I would prefer the story to not be a Harry/Ginny pairing. Thank you!


** I found [[http://lira-snape.livejournal.com/4575.html][this]] list of fics with Dumbledore acting like a mentor towards Harry, Dumbledore acting grandfatherly towards Harry, or the two of them just having a positive relationship.

Also, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light%5D][By the Divining Light]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][Magics of the Arcane]].

** Prisoner's Cipher captured a relationship between the two of them very well.

** Possibly linkffn(The Merging) might be going that way.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
