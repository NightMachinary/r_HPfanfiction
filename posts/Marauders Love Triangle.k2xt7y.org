Any fics where there's a fifth marauder, a girl, and there's a love triangle preferrably between the marauders? If teh fic is good, other characters can be in the triangle instead.

Love square is fine too!

Specifically OC. No time travel tropes please! Thanks!

**** The fanfic is called the debt of time by shayalonnie on ao3. There's a version that's chronological (called the chronological debt of time) that starts the story in the Marauders time when hermione goes back in time, and there's the first version the author posted where the story starts in 2000 ish ( I forgot what the actual year was) and then hermione goes back in time. It's a pretty good, well thought-out story, the author called it their magnum opus. The only thing that bothered me, my one criticism is that James shortens hermione's name to how mio in hermione is pronounced and the author types Mia when it should be written maya. That's my only criticism. Aside from that, it's a really good story and there's no bad grammar (from what I recall) and its pretty long (150 chapters). Enjoy! Sorry I don't know how to put the robot link

** Why do you need the fifth marauder? I can easily imagine James/Lily/Remus triangle.
