Just finished reading this one, it's not completed yet and it's still on going. I really enjoyed.

Since I dont know how to do that special link thing, I'll put the information here:

Pairing: Tom/Harry

AU: Voldemort never existed.

Summary: Harry needed a break. He wasn't sure whether it was a break from the expectations of being the son of the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, a break from his friends and family, a break from his work, or a break from the trauma of failing to save a missing child. The old house he'd discovered far away from the concerned gazes of those around him seemed like the perfect getaway, the perfect side project to keep him distracted and give him some peace and quiet. The idea of solitude was appealing...or at least, it was until he began to see hints that he was not the property's only occupant.

Additional tags: Ghost stories, Psychological thriller, Murder mystery, Trans harry (mentioned later on due to J.Ks tweets).

Hope you consider giving it a read and supporting the writer.
