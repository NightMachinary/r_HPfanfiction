I am finally working on my story more but I have lost touch with anyone who was previously helping me. I need help from a female writer so my female characters seem real, as well as assist in polishing a character I already have. Speak cowriting might be welcome as well. If you're interested in helping, please post on here or message me. Communication will be over Kik.


** That is a really odd question.

I know this is Reddit and it shares some similarities with DLP but er . . . have you never met a /sucks in sharp breath/ female person? Mother, sister, aunt? Females are not another species. Just give them, you know . . . personalities.

**** You're probably right. I should keep my irritation to myself.

** There isn't really anything special that makes women 'be' women. Just give your female characters traits, qualities, a disposition, personalities. If you do that you'll be fine.

** You just need to find a beta reader. Not sure where to post a request, but I'm sure loads of folks would love to read your story and provide editing and suggestions. Good luck! *Just keep writing.*

** George RR Martin on [[http://imgur.com/gallery/nu2Mipb][writing women.]]

Edit: = understanding /humans/ and our motivations, nuances, and specifics of character, those are what you need to dig into and pull onto the page to make your charcters great.

*** I don't disagree with the quote, but I always found George RR Martin to be pretty bad at writing (most) female characters. That's what turned me off his books, in fact.
