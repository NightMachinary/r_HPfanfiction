I just read

- linkffn(Weremione by Sakubato)
- linkao3(The best laid plans by Lowten)

and what in the world authors have about the Hermione having tail? Is it unhealthy influence of Catwoman, or what? (edit later: actually Catwoman doesn't have a tail) Any ideas?

  After Hermione's second year she is now stuck with cat ears and a tail. When she goes home for the summer, Hermione's parents learn all about her boyfriend - Harry Potter. How will this is affect things going forward?Divergent from canon. Buy one dark lord, get two free! Will our hero prevail? And if he can, will he make it through unscathed? All chapters now retrospectively beta'd/edited.

  Harry and Hermione don't quite escape from Professor Lupin unscathed at the end of third year,which results in unexpected complications and struggles as the pair face adversity and bigotry while trying to stay alive. This is a Work in progress and will be updated as i can.

** Comes from the polyjuice mishap. There are so many cat Hermione stories and, at one time, a lot of them were PWP with 12-14 yr olds.

** I actually wouldn't mind weremione in itself, it is rather neat idea (although, I don't care about werewolf packs, the canon never mentioned Lupin doing anything like it). linkffn(That Which Truly Matters by RhysThornbery) looks like a nice setup, except it has been abandoned, but werecat? tail? WTF?

  Transferred from my FenrisWinter Profile. Events surrounding Harry's third year at Hogwarts force Harry to re-evaluate what is truly important in his life and just who he wants to be. He's not the only one experiencing a change in outlook either. Like Dumbledore said, there is a difference between doing what is right and what is easy. Starts off rated T, On Hiatus.
