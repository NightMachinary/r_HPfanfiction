Hi, since dystopian novels are one of my favorite literary genres could you recommend me some dystopian fan fiction?

Bonus 1: A dystopian society may not be guided by dark and a pureblood society, but also by light. (In practice the moral drift of the principles of light)

Bonus 2: The fall of the magical world can begin in one of the following ways:

-Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter die the famous Halloween night, and Lucius Malfoy takes power

- Halloween night happens as in the canon, but a Dumbledore with less moral qualms (and less fear of power) carries out a coup. Dumbledore never really abandoned his plans with Grindelwald

- Sirius Black is not imprisoned for the death of the Muggles and Minus and much more aware of the prophecy Harry grows as the future leader of the magical world.


** I have written a story that might fit your request. Lucius Malfoy takes over Britain after Halloween 1981. Sirius does not end in Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** I remember reading one in which after voldie was defeated in gordocs hallow everyone went really tight on laws. All people who were the children of death esters were terribly oppressed. They Removed slytherin. Any person who the hat proclaimed to be slytherin had their magic taken away i something similar to an electric chair. The entire thing was messed up.

I also remember seeing a dystopia where after Harry took off the invisibility cloak and started fighting v in the last book, v won, and Harry escaped with a few freinds but ginny died.

V was rapidly aging even though he had control of the entire world in just 3 years. He was terrible desperate, and the scene described horrified me I ll try to describe it as best as I can . I won't be able to capture the feeling of horror I got though

In the depths of the department of mysteries, Lord voldemort sat in a room with runes and ritual circles written around in blood and pus.

A queau of h in hundreds and hundreds people stood out the room, and each minute he ordered a new one in. No none knew what was going on there, but they knew no one ever came back out.

Voldemort sacrificed each person to tie himself to life more. He tore his soul again and again and again and again, tying it to ordinary object.s.

He looked even worse than he did in the graveyard.
