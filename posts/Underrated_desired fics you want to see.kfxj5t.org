So I've written a draco fic and am almost finished writing a Fred and George fic. I'm currently part way through an LGBT charlie weasley story that I'll focus fully on after The F&G one.

I wanted to do charlie because hes SO underrated in every sense.

I wanna know if there's any harry potter characters/ AU's people might be interested in reading? I'm thinking of a wlw Ginny story in the future, but I like writing stories about characters that don't really get a lot of appreciation.

(I say as I wrote a DRACO fic and a FRED AND GEORGE fic ðŸ¤£)

Low key thinking of oliver wood, maybe bill (might as well just do their whole damn family at this point), maybe a wlw fleur story.

I love writing smut more than fluff, though I write a good mix of both, and I also like realistic, gut wrenching story lines that tie in someway to a somewhat happy ending.

** I would also like to write a Charlie story. But I want to focus more on the field of magizoology and what that entails. I've only seen a few good Charlie fics that didn't have him paired with some boring OC woman. Actually, the only good Charlie ones I've read are with him and other men. There are some characters I would definitely like to see more of. Cho comes to mind as well as Lavender, Theo Nott, Dean and Seamus (Particularly these two in a relationship). I also like Voldemort-killed-early fics wherein Voldemort either doesn't resurrect in 4th year or dies in a battle in fifth year. So, there's room to do something new in sixth and seventh year. That's what I'm working on right now, a canon divergence with some rarer characters.

*** I am trying to incorporate some magizoology stuff in my charlie fic, but it's not it's whole focus. Think Love, Simon with a magical journal (like tom riddle's diary), mixed with young marauders. Charlie falls in love with an OC man. It's like a sweet, coming of age story in a way.

Interesting choices! I do love cho. I think she was wrongly fucked over. It makes me mad everyone hates her and I'm like??? She was force fed a truth serum and you're mad she betrayed DA? And home girl cried all the time because her bf DIED lmao.

Dean and Seamus have always interested me. I wrote them in somewhat in my draco fic (not together) and I just really love those two.

** I found these 3 when browsing last night that I thought were good. They're oneshots but slightly different takes on common events? All Marauder, no fluff sorry a lot of angst but good all the same. All the same author.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13772212/1/The-Matron-and-the-Ward][The Matron and the Ward]] ^{^} Poppy Pomfrey looking after Remus. Her introspection into it and how she deals with things. Also Sirius was there if I remember. I hadn't seen a story from her point of view before.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13772236/1/The-Stag-in-the-Shack][The Stag in the Shack]] ^{^} James scopes out the hut for the first time by himself. It was different reading James dealing with that alone. Usually it's skipped over or done while Remus is there. This was a bit more powerful in a way?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13772250/1/Dorm-Rule-Number-79][Dorm Rule; Number 79]] ^{^{^}} James turns into a stag in the dorm and wrecks the place. Just a good laugh tbh

*** I LOVE one shots. Thanks for the recs. Ill definitely check them out. I am such a sucker for a remus/sirius romance. I'm writing them in my charlie story so im excited about that.

And I love angst! Any drama really so long as it's not too heavily Toxic or abusive.

** I want more fics with a focus on improving characters via magic. Magically enhanced eyes that have literally unlimited range because of enchantments, subdermal armor that can block the killing curse, straight up immortality via a hivemind connected to a single mind in a fideliused location on another planet. Imagine a Voldemort that had 300 copies of himself, all capable of communicating instantly with any other instance no matter the distance. I feel that it would make an amazing story.
