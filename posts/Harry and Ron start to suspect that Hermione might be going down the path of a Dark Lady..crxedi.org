Maybe it begins with her making a comment about forcing people to emancipate all the House Elves "Whether they want to or not", or they find her reading a tome on dark magic and they find her excuse for why a bit on the flimsy side. Bonus points if nobody else believes them until it's too late.


** There's a DarkGryffindor!Hermione plot bunny that I've had for a long, long time. Here's some prose show the divergence.

​

The news came the morning of the leaving feast. They weren't supposed to. After all, the year's mystery had been solved, the battle fought and won, victims rescued or healed; and, for bonus points, exams cancelled, a slave freed, a fraud unmasked, and an innocent exonerated after five decades.

But not soon enough.

The details had been sketchy, the accounts contradictory. A rogue Dementor---that's what they called the monsters that guarded Azkaban, apparently---had eaten his soul, some said. An old man suffering a heart failure in prison, said others. Ultimately, the exact mechanism did not matter.

Harry spent the rest of the day in a daze. Hermione just said "If I hadn't been petrified..." and fell silent. Ron was just there.

The funeral was two days later, Hogwarts Express to London postponed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived at the wake together, but quickly found themselves separated.

Harry could see Hermione speaking with Dumbledore, looking increasingly frustrated. Ron was with his family.

And Harry, Harry found himself face to face with perhaps the only man he now hated more than Voldemort.

"Terrible business, all this... I heard you were close. Dreadfully sorry for your loss, Mister Potter."

Harry sputtered, surprised by the apology. "But you killed him!"

"Mister Potter, that's a very serious accusation!" A short, squat woman dressed in pink with a perfunctory black funeral veil interrupted with a cough. "Mister Hagrid was over sixty, and a half-giant. Giants have short life expectancy, you know, so it stands to reason that it may have simply been his time."

"You put him in Azkaban!"

"A perfectly reasonable precaution, given the evidence available to us. We did everything right."

"Now, now, Dolores, let's not be hard-hearted. We did everything right, but every death is a tragedy. I really am terribly sorry for your loss." Cornelius Fudge turned to move away.

"Mister Potter, please accept my deepest condolences!" The newcomer was blond witch who had fluttered over. "Perhaps we can speak later about your memories of the deceased."

"Minister Fudge," she continued without missing a beat, "Some have called for your resignation in light of this incident. What is your answer to them?"

Fudge puffed himself up. "Well, Rita, if someone wants to accuse me of excessive zealotry in protecting their children from harm, then I plead guilty as charged and throw myself to the mercy of the court of public opinion at the next election."

"Surely it doesn't make sense to dissolve the government over an understandable accident? The only one who was hurt was a Hogwarts dropout known for handling dangerous creatures around children," the witch in pink added.

Harry's wand was half way raised to point at the officious duo, when he felt Hermione's hand on his shoulder. That gave him enough pause to notice a man in a crimson robe looking him in the eye, hand in his robe as well. Of course the Minister for Magic would have a bodyguard.

Hermione herself looked livid, but did somehow manage to speak in a level voice, "Dumbledore says there's little he can do. Fudge has to resign or be voted out, unless he decides to prosecute himself."

***

The topic was the talk of the Opinion page of the /Daily Prophet/ for the next month. Hermione had her say (edited for length). There were rebuttals. Even Dumbledore weighed in, with a call for institutional reforms to provide more judicial review for detentions and better conditions for prisoners, but stopped short of calling for Fudge's resignation or endorsing an opponent.

And then, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, and Hagrid was old news.

***

"The Ministry murdered him, and nobody cares, because he was a penniless dropout half-giant," Hermione summed up the outcome on Hogwarts Express. "My parents and I came home from France to find three dozen wizard letters. And the first one we opened turned out to be a Howler. And the Ministry refused to believe me when I told them so, and gave me an infraction for underage magic."

"Welcome to the club," grumbled Harry.

"Professor Flitwick had to come in to place a Charm on our house to redirect letters to Hogwarts! And then, we had to sprint through Diagon Alley the way some wizards were looking at us."

She grasped his and Ron's shoulders. "But I've understood something... It's not about Fudge, or Umbridge. Not even the whole ministry. Dumbledore was right: it's the institutions that need to be changed. But the public doesn't care. /They/ don't think what happened to Hagrid could ever happen to a /proper/ wizard. Until someone disabuses them of this notion, nothing will change."

*Edit:* Rearranged the dialogue with Fudge and Umbridge.

**** A bit late of a reply, but I don't think I have the time or the talent to write this fic well. The way I /would/ write it would probably hit the following plot points during the Hogwarts years:

- Hermione would have a growing sense (that is only somewhat accurate) that the past 50 years of progress in the wizarding society had occurred because its proponents had an uberwizard (Dumbledore) on their side and its opponents did not. Furthermore, she would conclude that Dumbledore has moved things as far as he is willing, and also, that once he dies from old age, things could easily backslide. (Her research might even uncover Dumbledore's history with Grendelwald.)

  - Some events will take place that would reinforce this belief. For example, after Sirius escapes, Fudge would authorise Dementors on Hogwarts Express without telling Dumbledore. After what happened to Hagrid, Dumbledore would refuse to let them near Hogwarts, however. The /Daily Prophet/ would be neutral, but then Sirius would break in, at which point Fudge would be seen as vindicated, and public opinion would turn against Dumbledore when Dumbledore persists in refusing to let Dementors near.

- Hermione would therefore set out to become her generation's uberwitch---or at least match the destructive ability of the uberwizards of the XX century---by any means necessary. That is, she becomes what Dumbledore might have become had he not fallen out with Grindelwald.
- Meanwhile, things actually go pretty well for Harry. In particular, when he learns the truth about Sirius, Fudge does still feel genuinely guilty about Hagrid, and so ultimately decides that he can spin the whole thing in his favour, get some photo-ops with BWL, and maybe some value out of Sirius, so he chooses to believe him.

  - Hermione, the Debbie Downer, might point out that someone not as rich or as well-connected as Sirius would not have received as much consideration---but Harry is understandably happy to have his godfather back. Sirius is happy to go along.
  - Hagrid's death would derail the Buckbeak plot thread, but some alternative subplot could be conceived, in which Hermione spends weeks putting together a legal case to no avail, and then Harry asks Fudge for a favour at the right time, and the situation is resolved in no time flat. For Harry, all is well. For Hermione, it's a matter of who you know.
  - More generally, Voldemort's return is delayed by a few years relative to canon, so Harry's adventures from Year 4 on are cancelled.

- Harry and Ron would notice that Hermione answers much fewer questions in class and asks many more, often with a destructive bent, and they get some indications that she is applying the knowledge.

  - For example, she asks McGonagall (acting scared of the prospect) whether it's possible to conjure poison gasses and such. McGonagall says that in principle, yes, but to master a substance you must understand it on a visceral level---so if you want to conjure poisonous gas, you basically need to breathe enough of it to be poisoned. McGonagall moves on.
  - After the Christmas break of that year, Harry and Ron notice that Hermione has burn scars on her hands and arms. She laughs it off as her forgetting how dangerous electricity could be from all the time she spends studying magic, and then goes to Pomfrey to get them healed.
  - But a few years later, they witness her electrocuting an opponent by shooting lightning from her fingers, and they realise that she had gotten those burn scars by electrocuting herself until her accidental magic gave her some control over electricity, which she developed since in order to have an ace in the hole technique that only a muggleborn with iron will, willing to suffer for power from a young age could develop.

- More generally, Harry and Ron find that Hermione has become much less averse to danger, challenging herself at every opportunity.

  - They are surprised when Hermione manages to get herself into the TWT.

- Hermione would like Harry and Ron to join her revolution, but she fails to convince them how broken the world is (partly because she is overstating the case, partly because things are going pretty well for them, and partly because she isn't actually that good at convincing people); as she begins to get the sense of what the price of power might be for her, she doesn't want them to get hurt; and as she sinks deeper, she begins to view them as security risks: both Harry and Ron have too many people watching over them.
- Dumbledore still dies hunting horcruxes. Before he dies, he passes what he knows on to Harry and Hermione. Harry, because he is still destined to fight Voldemort if Voldemort so chooses, and he still doesn't have a way to remove the horcrux; Hermione, because she is the closest thing he has to a successor, and she hasn't actually done anything Dark that he knows of.
- They graduate from Hogwarts a year later. Cornelius Fudge is still Minister for Magic, Dolores Umbridge is still Senior Undersecretary, Harry's on a pro quiddich team, and Ron is working at his brothers' joke shop. Hermione, she is somewhere between Bellatrix and Voldemort in combat ability---making her the single most powerful living combatant in Britain, but far from unbeatable by 2-3 elite aurors or 3-5 ordinary aurors---has a reputation as a prodigy but also as a troublemaker (with Fudge and Umbridge having some personal animus towards her), maybe half-dozen fellow Muggleborns she'd managed to persuade to her cause, and no idea what to do with what power she has to advance her political cause.
- And then, Voldemort finally manages to get himself a body. (Though, it may well have been the case that he had resurrected himself a long time prior and has been gathering his forces, but he hadn't used Harry's blood, so he had to wait until Harry was an adult and the sacrificial protection had expired.)

***** Awesome! Thanks for the write-up, it sounds really interesting! I definitely understand feeling like you can't do an idea justice, but do keep in mind the only way to get better is practice (assuming you have an interest in ever getting better :P). I often see ideas like this that I would love to read, but personally I have no skill or interest (or honestly, time! Kids are huge time sinks) in writing them myself.

Being late about the reply just made me get to go back and enjoy it all again, so no worries there :)

*** It's because "lady" makes no sense - a "lord" directly implies having power over someone or something (the Latin word for lord is "dominus", incidentally) whereas "lady" simply implies 'high class and female'.

A dark lady sounds like just some shady chick. "Dark mistress" might be more accurate, but implies BDSM or something.

**** It is simple. Lady is the female equivalent formal title to Lord in the UK. Makes 100% sense, and not "no sense" as you say...

#+begin_quote
  "According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word hlāford which originated from hlāfweard meaning "loaf-ward" or "bread keeper", reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers.[3] The appellation "lord" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation "lady" is used.[citation needed] However, this is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title currently held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lord Mayors are examples of women who are styled Lord."

'Of course it's not legal Ronald! But as were fighting the dark lord, it makes sense to know the dark magic he is using!'

'Yes, yes, i know that, but eh, you know, i saw you practicing crucio..'

'RONALD! Do you honestly think that i would even /think/ about using such a curse?!

'Professor Dumbledore'

'Yes, my boy?'

'Eh.. nevermind i'll just go..'

'Spit it out, Harry'

'I'm pretty sure that Hermione, well, i think she has gone dark.'

Professor Dumbledore, the ever so pragmatist man chuckles merrily and answers 'Harry, my boy, i believe you are gravely mistaken, Ms. Granger would never go down that path, no, i think that she is learning a valuable lesson, fight fire with fire. You cannot exactly stupefy your enemies, can you?'

DARK LADY HERMIONE GRANGER TERRORIZES NORTHERN EUROPE - Emmanuel Royal

Reports confirm that most of northern Europe has been conquered using battle gene-modified super elves. According to War Wizards a single battle elf can take out 5-6 soldiers. Currently the ICW is trying to figure out how to counter them. Many say this is even worse then the Grindelwald /and/ Voldemort war combined!
