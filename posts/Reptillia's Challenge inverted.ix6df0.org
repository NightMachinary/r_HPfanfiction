Harry's personal reaper is quite put out with him. Harry was supposed to be a martyr. Murdering the Potters, including the infant Harry was supposed to be the step that pushed the average wizard from fear to desperation, and cause them all to rise up against Voldemort

But the boy Lived. And he kept on living, no matter what his reaper threw at him


** Warning: English isn't my first language

Fate and Reaper had a plan. It was a well-thought plan. Harry Potter was supposed to be a martyr. Murdering the Potters, two very young parents and the infant child was supposed to push the wizards out of their countinuing state of shock. They should rise from the fear against the selfproclaimed Dark Lord. But then it happend. The girl wouldn't step aside. And the boy lived. That was where Reapers pain began.

The boy was only one day older when Reaper tried it again. It was a cold November night and the wizards thought it was a good idea leaving the lad out in the cold. Well - Reaper tried. They made a snowstorm that should bring the boy to his end. It would have been tragic. The Boy Who Lived frozen to death. It should have made the wizarding world look after their war orphans. But it didn't happen. The childs magic kicked in and kept him alive. Harry Potter grew up in a cupboard under the stairs. Neville Longbottom under the constant pressure of his overbearing family. Dean Thomas without ever knowing that his father was part of the world he would join at age eleven.

The third time Reaper tried to kill Harry Potter was when the boy was eleven years, three months and fourteen days old. Most of the wizarding world grew content in the last decade. Murderers got free and influencend their world like Voldemort has never died. A ghost haunted Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - but nobody knew. It should have been a warning. The boy falling from the broom to his death with everybody in school realising that the Dark Lord was still alive. Reaper whispered in the ear of the little idiot who got possessed by the monster who splitted his soul. The wizard started casting, the boy began to struggle... but with the help of a bitter potionmaster and a little know-it-all he survived again.

After three failures their boss wasn't happy with Reaper. So they asked their old friend Fate for help again. It was their masterplan. Fate helped Artur Weasley to pass his muggle-protection law to ensure the wrath of Lucius Malfoy. A little cursed book found his way in the hands of a innocent little girl. When the boy was twelve years and ten month old he stood in an ancient chamber with the deadliest beast known to wizardkind. Nothing could go wrong.\\
"Are you fucking kidding me!", Reaper yelled unheard to the mortal realm when the damn bird made his entrance... and the boy lived again. Fate and Reaper couldn't believe what was happening before their eyes. No twelve year old should survive this! After the boy, the girl and the bird left the chamber Reaper heard someone snickering. They shouldn't be surprised - it was Luck. She always loved to create chaos when Fate and Death tried to do their jobs.\\
"Why?", Reaper whined.\\
"I think I have a new favorite", Luck answered, giggled and then disappeared.

*** /grins/ I can't help but think this is canon compliant, with the Fate and Death both just existing in perpetual consternation thanks to the continued existence of Harry Potter.

**** Part II

Warning: English still isn't my first language.

Grim walked into the heaven of a thirty-three old alcoholic who had died of liver failure. Reaper sat at the bar and nipped on a bottle of whiskey. Grim scowled. It wasn't like their colleague to drink during working hours. They sat beside their friend.

"What happened?“, they asked. Reaper got a dark look.

"You remember the Potter case?“, he asked. Grim didn't look them in the eyes. It was an open secret that the boss wasn't happy with Reaper. Not happy at all. The case should have been closed nearly fourteen years ago but the boy was still going strong.

"Luck is on his side“, offered Reaper. "And now Time has joined her.“

"Time?“, Grim asked. That was unheard of. Time was a lazy immortal. She usually only floats in one direction. "I think you should start at the beginning.“

Reaper groaned.

"After Fate and I realized that Luck was on Potters side, we started with smaller things. Things she would maybe miss.“

"Okay...“

"We tried to hit him with a bus“, Reaper told.

"And?“

"At the last moment she gave him a push and he stumbled back.“

Well, it wasn't a very good plan. They didn't say so. Their friend was depressed enough.

"What did you try next?“

"So Potters father had this werewolf friend“, said Reaper. "We made his headmaster hire him and convinced both of them the wolf should stay at school grounds while full moon even if he could easily apparate away for the evening.“

"It didn't work, did it?“

"Oh it worked well... not like we expected, but that's nothing new with that annoying boy“, explained Reaper. "The werewolf didn't kill him but there were dementors. They ate his soul and that of his friend who should have died three years ago in a girls bathroom.“

Grim shuddered. Dementors were foul creatures against nature. Once a soul was eaten by them it never would join the afterlife. They had to be very desperate to see that as a success.

"But his soul is whole?“

Reaper slammed the bottle on the counter.

"Yes“, he snarled. "Because Time cheated.“

Grim dreaded to ask. "How can Time cheat?“

"She created a loop“, Reaper explained. "Potter and his friend shouldn't have been able to save themself in the past because they lost their souls already. But because Luck and Time decided that Potter was above the rules they made an impossible loop to save them.“

Grim didn't envy their colleague. Working against Luck was annoying. Working against Luck and Time - they never stood a chance. Before they could say anything, the bars door slammed open and Fate came in.

"I have a new plan. A plan that is so crazy even Luck can't predict it“, Fate said loudly. Reaper looked at their friend with doubt.

"What plan?“, they asked.

"What do you think about dragons, mermaids and a crazy labyrinth full of nasty creatures with a Dark Lord at the end?“

After hearing about the new plan, Grim was sure they were both going insane. But they left the bar and got to work. Grim looked after them. Grim was very happy that they dogged that bullet. Who would have thought that killing a child could be such an obstacle?

** I like the concept a lot. His reaper constantly fighting with some other being (Fate? Magic?) as they get in an arms race of killing/saving Harry
