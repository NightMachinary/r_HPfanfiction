I'm not looking for any thrilling adventures, blood curdling encounters or battles for the fate of the world.

I'm looking for teenagers doing stupid shit.

I just want to read a story about kids in Hogwarts and their lives. The pranks they prank, the lessons they miss, their romances and friendships.

OC's are welcome, as are any of the established characters as long as they are in character (for example, "We All Fall For The Yule Ball"'s Harry is inexcusable).


** Are you cool with slash? I have a few fics that fit this request if so - some with more and less graphic slash. I am sure there are good het pairing fics with this too but I haven't really read any because most het I read are canon pairings and/or post hogwarts.

**** Cool! I'll rec some that are a little more mild in their graphic-ness.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4552488][To Do A Weasley]] - A canon compliant, rare pairing fic of Lee and George during their 7th year. The relationship/friend group of Fred, George, Lee, Angelina, Alicia and Katie was awesome and perfect. I LOVED all of their characterizations. This is a great short read.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/992265][Laocoon's Children]] - This is the first book in an AU series where Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius, is sorted slytherin, and is best friends with Neville, Draco and Padma. These fics are really well written and are an interesting and satisfying AU. No romance with the kids.

- [[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/3156196.html][It Was Only a Kiss]] - This 7th year "get-together" story for Remus and Sirius is one of the best - it is pretty much perfect with the dynamic of the Marauders, the angst of exploring their feelings for one another and the dialogue is amazing. The fic starts off with Sirius and Remus getting drunk and talking about what it would be like to kiss another guy and then just spirals from there.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/344335][Starts With A Spin]] - 6th year fic with house unity parties, truth or dare, spin the bottle etc. I LOVED this fic. Harry and Draco were really in-character which is great. The party scenes were funny and well written. It was exactly the type of fic I like to read most as it is fluffy and smutty but still plenty of plot.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting_Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] - One of my favorite marauder fics. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom. The pranks in this fic are amazing. The friendships are heartwarming. It will make you laugh and cry. There's a reason why this fic has 7k comments and is such a favorite almost 10 years after it was started. The author is also a published author in her own right, so you know the writing is great.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] - Oh Gosh this fic is so good. It isn't plotty or action packed, but it is a really sweet and fluffy glimpse into how Sirius and Remus got together during 7th year.

- [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] - one of the first and most highly regarded MWPP fics. Some super mild wolfstar, but that's not the main thrust of this fic. It's a must read for a marauders fic.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] - This fic belongs in a series with 3 other next-gen fics. This one is the second in the series, but the first is not necessary to read to understand this fic. This is a next-gen fic with a large ensemble cast and 1st person POV chapters for Rose, Lily, James, Albus, Hugo, Harry and Ginny. All of the kids are really believably "teenaged" and most of them are totally unlikeable too. Realistically, they are all rather spoiled and are very popular due to the fame of their parents. There are a few romance plot-lines, but I would not say they are the focus of this fic necessarily. It is more about the family dynamics with the next gen kids/cousins.
