  He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by an icy statement that caused the hairs on his entire body to stand erect. "I know what you are, Harry Potter... Death will never touch you." SLASH, HP/LV. Darkly disturbing and all sorts of twisted- a tale of abduction, possession, and manic obsession. A 'Voldemort kidnaps Harry when he finds out he is a horcrux' story, only to turn into something far more convoluted. Sequel Posted: 'Hauntingly'

  Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)

** don't know if snily (severus x lily) is your thing, but here you go.

linkffn(2128790) - long, but it does have your questionable consent, depicting underage sexual feelings, masturbation (I think?) it's been a long time since I read it, but I do remember it being dark/darkish.

linkffn(7384352) - older than previous one. also has a lot of cheating, lily is depressed, etc, etc.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
