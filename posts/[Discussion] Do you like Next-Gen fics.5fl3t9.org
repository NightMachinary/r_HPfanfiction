If yes, what do you like to see in the stories? If no, why not?


** I don't care for the them. The reason is that I'm attached to the Harry Potter characters, especially Harry, usually in the Harry Potter world, but not the Harry Potter world itself. I don't have any interest in what happens to Harry's kids or whoever else.

** I do like next gen. My favorite kind of next gen are the ones that explore the effects the war may have left on the magical world and how it influences next gen characters lives. I also like the ones that look at how public perceptions of their parents for like Harry's kids or Draco's effect their relationships with their peers, authority figures, and their parents and the way they live in general.

** Not particularly... I'm attached to the characters we grew up with. I am not that interested in reading about their children when their adult life is vastly more interesting. I would much rather read about a 30-something or 40-something-year-old Hermione trying to navigate life with the odd mention of children/next gen characters sprinkled throughout.

Don't get me wrong though. If someone could point me in the direction of a really good piece, I certainly would give it a try.

** I really connected with Harry because a lot about him was relatable to me. Plus I tend to really, really hate how most people write kids. All syrupy sweet and full of lisps and sticky fingers and dimples. And authors can't even come up with original personalities for the little brats, they're just carbon copies of their parents.

** Not particularly. It's unnerving to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione written off to the side with a focus on what are generally OCs with only the guide of that beast of an epilogue to tug along those who try to cling to a canon-compliance.

Cursed Child doesn't count as canon to me, but it does highlight what I dislike about most fanfiction of this type - these characters lived through some trying times in their most formative years. Their development beyond the seven books seems stunted in most of the fanfiction I've read, 'moving on' usually entailing them remaining in effect exactly the same except with a mention of a receding hairline here and crows feet there to assure the readers that "they really are Grown Upsâ„¢ now, I swear".

I didn't realize I was so passionate about it, to be honest. If there are fics of this sort that people who disagree with me can link, I'd love to have my mind changed. I'm sure I've just not had the best of luck in what I've stumbled upon in my reading.

*** I think linkffn(questions and answers) does the next gen thing pretty well. Its kind of slice of life and very family focused though the pace is quite slow. Each next gen character has their own personality and mini story arc and challenges. I liked that one of the storylines is that the kids don't know the gritty details of what the war was like and they keep trying to find out. Harry and co act like adults and there is a lot of focus on parenting. I think the fic is kinda like the TV show called Parenthood..

Well said that man!

As an aside I'll happily road next generation Fics, as long as they have either a load of smut or feature them as a secondary storyline with the main being Harry and Hermione getting together.

** I didn't think I would, because what do I care about a couple of practically oc kids, right? But then I read a couple of really good ones and realized that, as with any other genre/pairing/era, the only thing that really matters to me is the skill of the author.

I have shipped ships I never thought I would and felt so deeply for characters I never really cared about, just because someone wrote them so well that I couldn't help myself. And that really sums up everything that I love about fanfic. Next-gen is no exception to that.

** As others have said, I'm attached to the characters I grew up with. I don't get enjoyment from reading about their (too convenient) offspring. They spark no interest in me, but I'm also on the "Epilogue, what epilogue?" train, so that could have an effect.

Don't get me wrong. I don't hate children in stories, and I tend to enjoy stories with Teddy as a supporting character, but I like the focus to be on the friends I grew up with. I especially like stories that delve into the effects the war had on everyone, not just the trio, and how the world rebuilds/becomes better along the way.

** The problem is the villain. If the villain is too powerful I feel like they are stepping on Voldemort's toes in a way that cheapens the main series. If the villain is too weak then it raises the question of why they're a threat at all - the Aurors should be able to take care of them easily.

It's a catch-22 but there are ways out. One is to have a clever rather than strong villain. Another is to tell drama or politics stories rather than heroic action-adventure.

But I don't think many fics do very well at those things in general, and post-Hogwarts is no different.

** Not necessarily, no. There's almost nothing a next-gen fic really offers that you can't find with the original generation. In next-gen fics, Albus will be a miniature Harry, Rose a miniature Hermione, and (more often than not) Scorpius a miniature Draco who isn't a dick. Lily will just be Ginny, James will be either one of his namesakes, and Hugo will be Ron. With the exception of Scorpius, there's not a single character that you can't get in some capacity with the original trio. I'd rather read about them than imitations. If there's an original characterisation of the above characters in a fic, I might be interested, but the vast majority of next gen fics follow safe imitation of the original series, which is boring.

I'd much rather read a post-epilogue fic with the trio and Ginny as the main characters dealing with middle-aged angst and old people shit like kidney stones and gout, before reading about expys of them run around Hogwarts doing whatever.

** I like the Harry Potter universe but dislike the epilogue, next gen has potential for showing a lot of new attitudes but often spirals into OC meets James Sirius potter and sparks fly meanwhile rose/Malfoy spawn. We have plenty of those. What about a next gen story where harry/Daphne post book 7 happened, how does Harry deal with having Draco as a brother in law and I would assume close children. How would Ron deal with this? I've read a few books where Hermione gets slapped down for her attitude but there needs to be more, she cannot succeed in the workplace with her attitude, how does Harry deal with this or has he moved away from those two as he explores the wider wizarding world.

** Ehhh. They're really hard for me to get into. I have no problem reading a fic where a child ends up involved (like Harry adopting Teddy, as one example), but some that I've come across have such inconsistent characterizations. Either the kids have the same personality as one of their parents (and often it's daugher = mother), or the parents become some caricature.

Then there's the issue of original plot. Some authors are amazing with it, some can take a common type of plot (new big bad, questionable ministry actions...) and do something awesome. But sometimes it seems like it's the main series just repeated with characters that we're supposed to believe are their kids.

To be fair, however, I don't seek out next-gen fics, so what I've come across may not be an appropriate sample size.

** I know for a fact that I'm going to be in a very, very small group here, so do bear with me. :')

I, in my sane mind, consider the Cursed Child to be canon. Full stop. Mrs. Rowling wrote it and I accept it, just like all Pottermore writings. If she tweets out that Harry Potter grew up to become a pornstar, I would embrace that and believe it. Somethings I disagree with, such as the trolley lady becoming some giant monster, but I don't need to use that in any of my fics, and neither do you.

Cursed Child essentially takes place in an alternate world, a world where anything is possible. We, as writers, do the same thing with what we write. We change the world to suit our needs. Cursed Child is essentially an alternate universe. I have always been iffy with timetravel. There's fics that take the person back to the Founders' Era, 1945, et cetera. It seems odd that something where everyone's in a fucked up world isn't plausible.

If I do read a next-gen fic, I'll only read it if it's Albus focused. I don't care about James. I don't care about Lily. I may read a Hugo related fic because my head canon is that he's adorable and walks around in clothes too big for him. But I will only read it if it's Albus focused, as I said above.

I disagree with a lot of Cursed Child, but I did the same with the world we were given. That's the great thing about fanfiction. We can change it for our stories if we want. None of us need to use it.

Oh my God, I rambled subconsciously. I'll read next-gen fics if Albus is in it. I'll read it if it's Scorbus, as well.

** Yes and no. I have noticed that most Rose/Scorpius rom-coms are just the author re-writing Draco/Hermione fics with their respective kids. I am not particularly fond of the pairing, just as I'm not fond of the cliched hate-to-love relationships in general. These stories I avoid.

(Ironically, their fanon characterisations were roughly switched in Cursed Child. Rose was rather arrogant and bitchy, Scorpius was genuinely sweet.)

On the other hand, Next-Gen adventure fics have some of the most original plots in fanfiction. Since they're completely free of canon rails, they offer that bit of originality that is difficult to find in the rest of the fandom. When I get sick of similar plots in other stories, I go hunt down one of these. I especially like fics that incorporate both the kids and adult characters of Harry's generation. I rate [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]], [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/11226787/1][Clash]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10573310/1/A-Fight-for-Love-and-Glory][A Fight for Love and Glory]] as some of my favorite fics in the fandom.

** I have never read one that kept me invested in the characters. Its hard though. You have to design these characters from the ground up (if you're a sensible human being and ignore Cursed Child).

So, my answer would be that the characters need to make me feel invested in them.
