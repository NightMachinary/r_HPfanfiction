I have been reading HP/MCU crossovers, but most of them start with phase 1. I was wondering if there are fics where Harry is introduced to the MCU after Civil-War or after Endgame. Maybe fics that crossover with the series on Disney+ (WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier). Thank You!


** I don't know any but it is a good idea

** This is a really cool idea but I can't think of anything I've read in the HP/MCU Xover fandom that goes much beyond Phase 1 and is also good. Head scratcher for sure. I'd be curious to see something along these lines.

  After the fall of Hogwarts, Hermione makes her escape as an animagus, but not before Bellatrix curses her. Trapped in her animagus form, she meets a grieving Thor who has lost everything post Infinity War and becomes his companion. Threats of Rape/Non-Con only applies to chapter one, but there's no actual rape or non-con. This was also written Pre-Endgame.

** Closest thing that comes to mind is Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble]]), which aside from Steve spending time in the coffee shop Harry opens, Clint using his roof to watch the Hulk fight Abomination, and Harry banishing some stray explosive boomerangs during a fight between Iron Man and a small time villain only really picks up the crossover aspect during the Battle of NYC.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
