Almost no cliches, slow-burn power-up, Harry has weaknesses and doesn't steamroll opponents, all of his abilities are taught over the course of years (no instant superpowers), international travel, Mesopotamian mythology, more villains, creative battles and fight scenes, canon divergent before the end of Year 1.

** Hmm...Nightmares of Futures Past is an interesting one, because it's old enough to use a bunch of tropes before they were cool. Whether they now count as clichés is for you to judge, I guess. Harry is powerful as a result of fighting a war for thirteen years and then sending his soul (including his magical core) back in time to merge with his younger self, but most of the story isn't about combat, it's about reconnecting with his friends and trying to support them better than the first time around, so his personal power doesn't unbalance it.

Harry becomes quite exceptional in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, but for me the story remains balanced, because all the attention causes her serious problems; she's trying to impersonate her cousin, and the last thing she needs is a spotlight on her. Not to mention influential wizards trying to manipulate her for political advantage or outright steal her magical reserves for themselves. Plus, a lot of her skill is justified by having grown up with both of her parents and full knowledge of magic, and further justified by attending Hogwarts with a good work ethic, serious commitment to her goals, and the knowledge that socialising too much increases the risk of being found out. She's rather a workaholic, but does make friends who try to get her to open up, with mixed results. It's only around her family that she can (mostly) relax and be herself.

  It wasn't that Rigel was smarter than Draco was, exactly. In class Rigel learned at the same pace he and Pansy did, and while neither he nor Pansy were what you'd call mediocre in the intelligence department, they weren't geniuses either. Draco was pretty sure Rigel didn't only pretend to learn slowly to make himself more ordinary-seeming (though he /was/ sure Rigel did other things to achieve that effect), so that meant Rigel wasn't inherently smarter than other people.

  He just apparently lacked the ability to not do five things at once.

  Draco didn't think he'd ever seen Rigel listen to a lecture without also reading a different book under his desk. The exception to this rule was McGonagall's class, because McGonagall wouldn't allow it, and Snape's, because Rigel loved Snape's classes. Still, he had taken a peek at Rigel's notes during Transfiguration once or twice, and always they looked more like an essay for another class than notes usually did.

  If someone had told him how much Rigel could learn over the course of a month without telling him anything else about the boy, Draco would have probably assumed he had access to a time-turner. Once you actually paid attention to what Rigel did with his time, however, it became clear that if Rigel /had/ access to a time-turner, he'd have graduated Hogwarts already and be halfway to solving Merlinian Arithmancy. He was just that alarmingly efficient.
