  Ginny tasted like fish. She was always fucking eating fish. Then she wanted to swap saliva with him. Harry didn't think he could gargle enough Listerine to get rid of the memory of that fish-breathed whore. Fucking Ginny, with her fanny like a wizard's sleeve. Good job he'd never gone down on her - he was a little bit afraid of the dark.
