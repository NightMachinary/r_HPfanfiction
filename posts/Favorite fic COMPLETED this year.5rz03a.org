I know we had a thread about favorite fics that were started this year, but I only like to read completed fics. What's your favorite fic that finished within the last year?


** My [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7441139/InquisitorCOC][FF.net account]] has a total 156 Favorites, almost all of them are complete. I usually keep incomplete/WIPs in my Story Alerts. I have a few more completed Favorites on other sites.

30 of my Favorites are finished within the past 12 months, far more than any other years. If I have to pick a top 5, they are:

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167)

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]

"Petrification Proliferation", linkffn(11265467)

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877)

"The Accidental Animagus", linkffn(9863146)

*** Can you tell me a little bit more about the Hermione Granger one? What is the rest of the series like? Should I read the previous stories? Who is Alex Mack? What universe is it set it? Do I need to know anything about it?

**** HG&tBWL is a standalone story, dw. From what I can work out (not read any of the other stories) the first story is about a group of YA heroines (HG, Buffy etc) being assembled from various universes to save the world or something. The primary universe is that of Alex Mack, who seems to be a 90s Nickelodeon show about a teen girl who is also a spy. HG&tBWL is set in her universe, starring that universe's version of the Hogwarts crew. It's a bit dumb (as an Englishman, all the aristocracy stuff is pretty risable) but fun.

TL;DR: Its basically a Hermionecentric non-magical AU with some mad science and super-spy shenanigans. No knowledge of anythign other than HP is needed.

***** Thanks! The summary wasn't too helpful, and I couldn't tell from the website name if it was a site dedicated to a certain genre of fanfiction - and if so, I couldn't see anything on the Alex Mack wiki page about Hellmouths, but eventually I realised what was going on.

I'm surprisingly enjoying the story, despite having never seen/read Buffy, Angels, James Bond (yes, really), or Alex Mack. Given that apparently James Potter was 007 at one point, apparently it's set inside that world?

****** Surprised enjoyment was my reaction as well! I don't think it really has anything to do with James Bond, aside from that reference, which is more of a shorthand to James' character than anything else. There is too much bizarre biotech to be Bond. I think it's really its own universe, and I certainly read it as such.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I liked linkffn(Exile by bennybear). Draco runs away to the muggle world after he is sentenced to live without magic for a few years. Follows him as he fumbles through trying to understand and integrate himself in the muggle world as a competely clueless wizard with no understanding of basic muggle things like phones or street lights.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** So I just looked through my favorites and considered everything that was updated in 2016. My personal top 3 are

Nr.1: linkffn(8295633) Harry/Tonks fluff which starts as a friendship and then slowly evolves.

Nr.2: linkffn(12296750) A fifth year Harmony romance set during the winter holidays with well written Grangers.

Nr.3: linkffn(11637611) FemHarry/Susan Bones, over the top violence and slightly crack. It is a comedy where everyone is lesbian. Despite this, the author has some rather unique and interesting plot points (especially in the sequel).This story has one of the best Lunas I have read so far. The sequel is currently being written.

Honorary mention of short stories:

linkffn(12175262) Harry/Luna after the Malfoy encounter during the Slug Christmas party. It depicts Harry and Luna's emotional state rather well and still is unique in both pacing and general plot. The second chapter is a smutty continuation of a one-shot but still has the same style.

linkffn(11950994) Harry/Tonks Hurt/comfort one-shot during the fifth year summer

linkffn(12307978) The hogwarts stuff is grading fanfiction. A parody of the current state of fanfiction. Also great guide for writers, rather hilarious and still has its own plot.

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.

  [ONESHOT] A different take on Harry's rescue from Privet Drive in OOTP, based on a prompt that I went back and pinched from an old season of firethecanon's Quidditch competition. I mostly agree with Harry's complaints in this story - I think that from his point of view they're valid, however different they may appear in the larger context that he lacks.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
