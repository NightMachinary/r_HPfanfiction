LF stories where one or more of the female characters (preferably Hermione) is completely obsessed with Harry especially if she doesn't let on that she's obsessed to Harry. Like how Bellatrix is usually portrayed as obsessed with Voldemort level intensity. Is there anything like that?


** I really don't understand why there's only Adorable Violence in this "genre". It's such a great basis for a lighthearted adventure romp through Magical Britain.

  “Ginevra Weasley," Dumbledore said.

  I shook my head, dismayed by their ridiculous expectations. "How was I supposed to guess that? We aren't even friends."

  Some distance across the grounds, a still-dripping Ginevra said, "We will be!"

  I shivered. This was beginning to remind me uncomfortably of the Bellatrix situation. "And I'm not sure why you think it's my responsibility to protect everyone. It's your competition. You should have expected I would do something like this.”

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** I vaguely remember a fic where Ginny goes to a mind healer after her ordeal with the diary. In order to cope with the damage, she needs something to use as a focus to ground her and keep her stable. I think her healer wanted her to use her family, but she ends up using Harry as the one thing to live for and becomes almost slavishly devoted.

The name escapes me, though.

** linkffn(A Question of When)

If you're looking for a girl that is legitimately obsessed, this is the fic.

There's also Amortentia (another Romilda fic), but it's not published on any website except as a zip on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/amortentia-by-excentrykemuse-t.16302/][DarkLordPotter]].

** linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen) is basically the default, rather cracky, answer.
