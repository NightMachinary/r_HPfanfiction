Post-war fic. Harry struggles with a transgender identity and goes to Snape (who is convicted of war crimes but is a fugitive in hiding) to brew a potion that will facilitate transitioning male to female. All of the characters in this story are kind of horrible: This Snape is honestly one of the most disgusting I've read. Ginny is pissed about Harry being a switch-witch (great terminology). Ron and Hermione are damaging and unhelpful in ways I couldn't have predicted. Please someone provide a link, I'd love to read this again.
