I've been perplexed by the huge popularity of this for many years now. There was never really any urge for me to know that much more about this, so when I see the large amout of fics about it, huge amout of fans wanting either books or a tv-show focusing on it, I'm always a bit baffled. Like; If there had been anything like that, I would probably have been interested in it in a "Ooh! More HP stories! Nice!" - kinda way. You know, I'd take it, but I wouldn't really care if it never happened. But I've seen so many people who actively *WANT* it, that I'm starting to think that there must be something really spectacularly fascinating about this era that I'm not seeing, and I wonder what it is.

I've reread the main books so many times, and still never really seen the huge appeal. If I haven't really seen it by now, I don't know if I ever will. So maybe hearing it from people who are super into it, would make it easier to understand.

Any and all answer are appreciated! (/+Added Alliterative Appeal? Amazing+/)


** I'm not someone who wants a TV series or anything, and I'm not particularly interested in the Marauders at school, but I do like them in those few years between school and James and Lily's death.

I think the appeal is that there's a lot of relationship and character potential suff there. We're just kind of told that James matured and Lily fell in love with him, but we don't see it. We're told that Sirius ran away from home and found a second family with the Potters, but we don't see it. We're told about Remus's fear of rejection from his friends, but that they accepted him, and the extraordinary lengths they went to in order to make sure he didn't have to go through all that alone, but we don't see it. We're told that they were friends with Peter, and that they trusted him enough to make him secret keeper later, but we don't really see any evidence of friendship or why he decided to turn against them. We're told that they made an amazing map, but we don't see who came up with the idea or the work that went into it, or why they did it or how they used it. We're told that James rescued Snape and that Sirius did something that would have caused utter devestation, but we don't see the fall out or the consequences or what was going through anyones mind.

Basically, we're told all this interesting, exciting, dramatic stuff happened, and more than that it happened to some of the more interesting and best loved characters in the series. People want to see it.

There's no attachment at all there, about as much as the next generation of Harry's kids. We know quite a lot about Harry's parents and there's potential for tons of drama. The founders... they're basically OC's and you have to invent a whole society because you know nothing about their time and what else was happening around then.

** I think one of Rowling's strengths as a writer is how she implies that really interesting stuff is going on just out of our view. That way she gets credit for all this interesting stuff without having to go to the trouble of actually writing it in detail. She told us these Marauders were brilliant pranksters, but she didn't actually tell us any of their brilliant pranks. How did they figure out Remus's furry little problem? How did they become animagi? Why did Sirius play such a dangerous prank on Snape? It all must have involved some tense conversations and scary scenes, but Rowling just implied them rather than writing them. There's a strong framework to build on.

** You know just enough to intrigue and that leaves people wanting more. For me at least, the trio is completely uninteresting as a fanfic basis because their story is told in the seven books. I don't care about NextGen because we effectively know only the names. The Marauders are where there's room to play while hitting the major events and base personalities that we know.

It's also dramatic as hell. I'm writing in 1979 now, and it's plausible to me that in this one year, James and Lily get married, the elder Potters die, Regulus becomes a Death Eater (and dies), Sirius's father dies, the Death Eaters begin to recruit Wormtail, and Lily gets pregnant...and that's /before/ you even get to the fact that they were actively fighting in a war, the ministry was falling around them, and everyone was terrified and dying. Every single one of them will die before forty. Their relationship is the reason for the events of the seven books. They're all talented, apparently at least on the level of Hermione, so you can have fun with the magic. And the personalities are known but not set; is Sirius darkly moody like he is after Azkaban, or was it prison that made him that way? Is James a bully or actually a morally upstanding guy? Peter is always shown as the syncophant but he's still the "group idiot" who managed to successfully spy and plot his way to safety (well, sorta). In school, they're running around with a werewolf, inventing strong magical objects and the war is ramping up.

That said: I wanted nothing more than a Marauders series when I was young but now I need WB and Rowling to stay the fuck away. I'll stick with my fanfics, thanks.

This.

I'm happy with the story in the books, I have no unanswered questions with those characters and their journey seem closed to me. I don't love the Harry/Ginny ship but I don't care enough to ship him with anyone else. I don't have strong feelings about Ron/Hermione, and everything is so nicely wrapped up its just... Done.

With that said, I really dislike the last chapter of DH which is the Genesis of NextGen so I just ignore that that exists.

With the Marauder Era there are tons of unanswered questions about... Everything. We are given a starting point showing that Lily and Snape are best friends and they hate James, but seven years later Lily is about to marry James, and has fallen out with her former best friend. How did that happen? Meanwhile, there's this huge social and political upheaval going on that Snape, James and Lily become enmeshed in where Voldemort becomes so feared people stop even saying his name. Did that all happen during those seven school years? How much did this wizard war spill over into the muggle world? How close was Voldemort to taking everything over? How wide spread was sympathy for his cause? Then there is Remus being a werewolf that has its own story in how his friends found out, how close he came to being outted, that he was suspected of being the spy, how Peter came to be apart of the Marauders, how Peter came to switch sides and when it happened, etc.

Then there is simply a canon romance story that hasn't been told and some people like romance stories. 🤷🏼‍♀️

** From what I understand of the Marauders-story desire, it's a mix of about four things. In no particular order:

First, I suspect a dominant motivation is a semi-headcanon war one. People bought in big time to the Marauders vs Snape thing and for those who care about it they usually feel passionately one way or another. Snape is a monster who deserved his treatment or Snape is a Draco-in-Leather-Pants type who the Marauders mercilessly bully. They theorise and feel and imagine and thus want a definitive canon display of that which justifies their perspective on things.

The second you've mentioned. "Oooh, more Harry Potter stories!".

The third, someone below mentioned - seeing the rise of Voldemort and the political interplay as a background to the Marauder-era adventures. The Blood Purists are kept really simplistic in canon; they're magical Nazis that hate Muggles and feel Muggleborns are invaders and deserve to die. As a psychologist and amateur socio-cultural obsessive/nerd, I can tell you that the reasoning behind the rise of the Nazi regime is one of the most terrifyingly fascinating things ever and seeing something that reflected that in a fantasy setting would definitely appeal.

The fourth, which is where my mild interest would come from, would be in development of world and character. Whatever you think of Rowling as a storyteller, there's a pretty damn good argument to be made that her current worldbuilding is thinner than most lunchable meats and has more holes than the cheese, holes which become outright contradictions most times. Giving her the opportunity to write books alongside the TV show (a la Game of Thrones) would give her an opportunity to build up more world and shore up some inconsistencies and such and also allow her to develop characters better. The Golden Trio-era characters either go from not having a character to becoming one (Ginny) or remain basically the same from beginning to end (Ron). Neville is the only person I think has a traditional character development arc in the entire series. But people like James are supposed to have changed a lot (Prankster to 'Worthy of Lily') and such, so seeing that would humanise the overly-idealised-ghosts of the Potters (I quite like the 'Lily was a hellion when her temper was roused' idea, for instance) and extended cast that we get bugger all on in canon due to Harry being a lazy, disinterested prat that took four years to find out what the surviving and still-active followers of the man who killed his parents were called.

I actually think that if Rowling was to do a fanfiction-competition to get someone else from the community to write the plot for this Marauders thing, we'd probably get a ridiculously good story out of it.

Personally though, I'd prefer either a Founders story or an alternative 'Voldemort won' story in the vein of The Man in the High Castle where Harry grows up under Voldemort's regime and has to fight back against it. Or even just a fanfiction-inspired anthology - one or two episodes to explore each story and just keep building a series of them.

** I think a big part of the interest is the characters who feature in the Marauders' era. We get Sirius, Lupin and Snape who are three of the more complex characters overall and three characters that get their personality explored quite fully in canon. Of course in canon, we see Sirius after Azkaban, Lupin after a decade of being alone and shunned from society, and a Snape who got the love of his life killed, but going back to the 70s' writers get to explore what these people were like before all of this happened, basically working backwards from those traumas along with using the few clues we get from Snape's memories as to what they were like at school. Filling in the blanks, as it were.

James and Lily can basically be written any way the author wants; they're almost just names that ended in tragedy with a few clues to their personalities thrown in. And Pettigrew somehow went from awkward, worshipful, trusted friend to murderous traitor, and that is obviously a pretty intriguing leap to explore.

The 70s' and early 80s' are interesting culturally; lots of clothes and music and films and popular culture muggle-wise that is fun to add to fics. Then the whole AIDS epidemic and its obvious parallells in Lupin, which makes for great social commentary. 1979 is when Margaret Thatcher gets elected, so the lead-up to that is another bit of muggle social and political history that may or may not have influenced/had parallells in the magical world.

The teachers at Hogwarts are mostly the same as in Harry's day, so Hogwarts is easy to write about, you get to make some new people up but not too many. We also have names of wizards and witches in the original Order, which can be used for supporting cast to make it feel more authentic, both for writer and reader. We have JKR's names for the parents of a lot of the typical main characters of the Marauders' era and know where in the country they grew up.

On a similar note, we already know a few very big events for the well-known characters; Lily and Snape fall out, James becomes Headboy, Sirius almost gets Snape killed, Snape tries to get the Marauders expelled, Voldemort rises to power and begins recruiting in Hogwarts which means there are teenage wannabe Death Eaters in the school, Sirius runs away from home, Lupin's mother dies, etc.

There are also people that remind us of Harry's time, for instance James and Sirius are described as a comedic double act and as predecessors to the Weasley twins. People who enjoy writing humour/pranks and practical jokes can do that with them. James is on the quidditch team, just as talented as Harry, so it's easy to write about that. Remus and Snape both appear to be bookish Hermione-types from what little we see from Snape's memories. It also seems as if the same Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry existed back then too.

Another part of the appeal is that a lot of the writers of Marauders era seem to be older, which usually means higher quality writing. Not always the case, especially not nowadays when there's such a wealth of stories, but you do find a lot of really well-written prose for this era.

Yet another part of the appeal is undoubtedly Wolfstar, which has got to be one of the most popular pairings in the fandom. I think it's fair to say it's mostly women writing gay porn for women, but there is a lot out there and it remains immensely popular.

** I think it's because in the books you get tiny little glimpses (from the stories Sirius, Remus, and other older characters tell) into what life was like for the Marauders in their youth, but you never get a full recounting. They had adventures, good times and terrible times, and the tiny glimpses you get jus make you (or me, anyway) want to see more. This, in conjunction with the fact that Sirius and Remus consider that the happiest time of their lives, makes me very curious about the way things played out.

Also, I think Harry himself is almost desperate to know about his parents' lives. Any little bit of new info counts and fills this gaping hole he inevitably has growing up as an orphan, and this desire to know more has definitely rubbed off on me.

I think the Maurader's Era is great to explore the events leading up to the first war and how the consequences from those lead to canon events.

Plus, we get to know Remus, Sirius, and Severus pretty well in canon, so it'd be amazing to get to know them as young adults making decisions amongst the backdrop of a war. That's just a good story setting.

The Founders Era would be my favorite setting for future, official HP content. Maybe whoever will be in charge of it will write a Slytherin that's more than the canon version proto-Klansman.

Second favorite is Riddle's school years and rise to power. Not even the first war per se, just the transition into Lord Voldemort.

I like the fanfic because you can delve into what was going on in the First War and what it was like for the Marauders growing up then. I love fics that have a good balance between the humor of the Marauders and the growing horror of Voldemort's rise of terror.

** For me, the Marauders Era is interesting because it has potential. You can explore the interactions the Marauders had, between Peter and the rest, with James and Lilly, even maybe some Sirius and Remus. The events that led Peter to join Voldemort are interesting ones and never truly explained in canon.

The interactions between the Marauders and Severus Snape aren't explored fully in canon. In canon, we don't know how James and Snape came to hate each other, or how James wanted Lilly for himself. I think this, if done right, is a major reason why people like the Marauders Era.

Additionally, the Marauders Era is during the rise and peak of Voldemort's power. The war reaches its peak during their 7th year and beyond, and stops 3-4 years after. The War has immense potential, because there is very little canon material on what goes on during that time.

** As a group theyre fascinating. I tend to like james the most - a lot of snape apologists forget that james fixated on lily very early and that snape in canon was hanging out with and getting along with people who advocated she be raped and or tortured and or killed. Given that, it's not shocking James would do whatever he could to snape. he just wasnt smart about t. then theres peter - the reason he changed is mostly left as a mystery. hes the most intriguing one. I think the one who comes off the worst is sirius. he felt like anything he did to slytherins was okay as it was a blow against the black family. and he was a careless womanizer. And while Snape was gunning for Remus, what Sirius did wasnt funny at all. He nearly committed a double murder. REmus had a tragic story. And as they finished school, the Malfoys, Notts, Snapes etc. were in the ascendance. So they (Marauders) were heroic.
