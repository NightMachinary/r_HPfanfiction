  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

#+end_quote

How do we know Arithmancy doesn't already cover all the maths they could need? My headcanon is that arithmancy is as much rubbish for actually predicting the future as regular Divination, but it's mostly an excuse to teach maths --- the "arithmancy" cover being the pro-muggles' way to slip it past the purebloodists' noses unnoticed.

  physical education (beyond Quidditch).
#+end_quote

Uh, why? Offering it as an elective like Flying Lessons, why not, but I don't think they'd need to make it compulsory, especially considering things like obesity as curable in the wizarding world.

Shame then that it is not a mandatory course.

******** That's probably just coincidence/dramatic irony in-universe, though. Either way, I have those cases covered by saying "usually" wrong. My main point is that all Divination is ever said to do in canon is predict the future (whether it /delivers/ on that promise is entirely besides the point).

******** I suppose so, but the best a writer who wants to showcase divination can do without too conspicuously veering into AU is to extrapolate from what /is/ seen (and it's not just Trelawney, there's also the Prophecies and the Centaurs) without adding any new elements. It's not /impossible/ that the Potterverse's Divination covers more than predicting the future, just as it is possible for all we know that sapient ice-breathing snow dragons exist in this universe as well, but including either of those things in a story would feel like additional worldbuilding rather than a natural continuation of canon.

** Most muggles take over the wizarding world fics usually have Hogwarts curriculum being changed to include muggle stuff, but i don't think i have ever seen a fic where Harry actually learns muggle courses of any kind in Hogwarts.

On another note are you sure they don't teach those things already off screen? Transfiguration sounds like it involves physics and biology. Astronomy is partly in highschool physics class too. English is probably covered by the great many essays they do in all their classes. I remember it being mentioned that in essays spelling errors are corrected by teachers. And we know charms and transfiguration have a lot of theory, not just spellwork.
