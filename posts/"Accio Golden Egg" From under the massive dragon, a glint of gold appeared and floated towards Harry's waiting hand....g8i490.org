There are a few fics where Harry doesn't even bother with the TWT.

In all these fics, the "Accio Golden Egg" strategy inevitably fails and it's explained as the egg having been protected, and Harry just gives up at that, takes a zero score and proceeds with the other tasks by also making a token attempt and deliberately failing.

What I'd want to see is a fic in which the Accio-Golden-Egg strategem actually /works/ (to everyone's surprise), and the rest of the tasks proceed in a similar vein (ie using deceptively simple strategies that the task-makers overlooked in their attempt to ensure it's a challenge).

  Ronald Weasley gave a great yell as he shot out of his chains like a cannonball and went sailing through the air - straight toward the judges' table. As the judges scattered, the screaming boy smashed through the wood, hit the earth with a distinct /ka-boing/, and bounced into the Slytherin stands.

In another, he does an accio on his opponent's shoes to pull their feet out from under them.

In another, he and the Weasley twins are in Grimmauld Place and possibly drunk, and they start having Harry do things like "accio Snape's dark mark" and then accio various body parts of Voldemort, finishing with accio'ing the rest of him - by then, just a head and torso.

Newt Scamander used it to summon his Niffler in September 1927 in the movie.

Harry Potter used it to summon books, feathers, chairs, Gobstones and Trevor the Toad in the Gryffindor Common Room practicing to use this spell in the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.

HP used it to summon his toad when he was practising his Silencing Charm in Charms class in HPOoP.

Ron Weasley used it in the Brain Room during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to summon a brain in a tank to himself while under the effects of a curse.

Ted Tonks used it to summon salmon to eat in HPDH.
