I'm looking for fics similar to "Harry Potter and the Veela", specifically the whole WBWL and Harry being ignored by James and Lily.

Preferably complete fics and no abandoned ones. Also, I've already read/am reading the "Sarcasm and Slytherin" series on ao3.

Thank you in advance!


** *Are you looking for WBWL or Harry x Fleur?*

​

*For WBWL:*

Linkffn(Antithesis) is one of my favorites. Very well written.

Linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) is a classic in this category

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived) I think this is the one where he goes to Durmstrang. Gets mildly AU

Linkffn(You get what you give) if you don't mind Fem!Harry

​

*For Harry x Fleur:*

Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

I don't read Harry x Fleur but I forgot to look at the tags on this one before reading it so I know about it lol. I don't know any others.

*** I was looking for the WBWL and harry being ignored by James and Lily since that is a lot harder to just search for on ffn as opposed to specific pairings. But Anithesis and Prince of Slytherin seems to be what in looking for and the 1.15M words will keep me busy for a while.

​

Thank you!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
