ie if you can think creatively enough to justify something working, and have the magical power to do it, it works? What are some fun stuff you could do by misusing spells?

I'm imagining Luna Lovegood, a basilisk fang, eye contact, and a well-placed Defenestration Curse getting rid of Harry's Scarcrux (/The eyes are the windows to the soul.../)


** I'm not sure where I read it, but there was a fic in which the greatest wizard always were hopeless loons, super flamboyant, mad as hell and so on and so forth. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort,...

As in: there is power in thinking around twenty corners at each given time.

I kinda took that into my headcanon. I like writing powerful wizards and witches as a bit mad.

*** It makes sense. Canon sort of supports this theory, in that sufficiently intelligent/skilled wizards can alter their spells on the fly (see D vs V duel in the ministry). Assuming that each spell (or continuous stream of magical effects like in the ministry duel) requires a given amount of mental discipline to produce, then this kind of spellcasting would require the caster to rapidly switch between mental states, which in my mind, does not exactly contribute to someone's mental well-being.

**** The rapid succession of spells and effects could just be a lot of training. Complex thought and movements so internalized that they come as second nature. If we go down that path, we could cite many activities done by humans in the real world that would lend themselves to a comparison. Playing an instrument, dancing, the Arts, acrobatic sports, and so on and so forth. Many things require fast processing of commands to the muscles combined with creative thought either during the practice or beforehand. You could argue that this also requires some form of insanity - the mad commitment to reach the apex of whatever it is you do.

Its just that I find the thought funny that in order to be a groundbreaking wizard or witch, the continuos need to think abstract and creative eventually rubs off on your personality.

*** I had an idea about how there are no muggles, everyone has magic but only those nutty enough to believe they can work magic can. This leads to the nuttiest being the most powerful.

Purebloods grow up in a household of magic nutty people so they believe they can do it and the statute of secrecy is there to stop more 'muggles' from figuring out they can do magic.

*** Mentioned in linkffn(Weres Harry) when Sirius explains why Harry's story is rather unbelievable to the average witch or wizard, because the powerful magic is, the more it strays from logic.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
