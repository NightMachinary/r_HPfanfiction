What I remember.

1. It's on ao3 and ffn.
2. Dumbledore uses the word paramour at the end. I have tried searching for this with Google, nothing came up.
3. It's a humorous one shot.
4. Someone hears James ask Sirius if he would let Lily ride him in the forest behind their house. We know that James is referring to Sirius' dog form but the person overhearing it did not know. I think it was either Frank or Alastor.
5. Sirius complains about not being able to get a date anymore. Marlene was in this fic.

This is what I remember. If anybody needs more details, please lemme know.

Thanks!

  The problem with alluding to secrets, of course, is that they can be so easily misunderstood. Or why the entirety of Wizarding Britain is convinced that James Potter, Sirius Black, and Lily Evans are in a happy threesome.
