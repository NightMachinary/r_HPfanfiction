Um, there's this story I've been trying to find where Harry is the Master of Death. There's this scene at the beginning that I remember vividly. It was set the day after the Battle of Hogwarts or so, he see's Fred's spirit and freaks out. I remember that at first Harry thought it was George, but realised soon it was Fred's spirit seemed to be in pain or something. After this Harry told Ron and Hermione.

That's all I remember, and though I can't remember if it was a crossover fanfic or not. Any help?


** Hmm...I know of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter & the Antiquity Link]].

Starts off the morning after Harry beat Voldemort - Check.

Features the ghost of Fred Weasley - Check.

I don't remember if it focuses on Harry being Master of Death, though, and I'm pretty sure Fred wasn't exactly in much pain.

*** No sadly. That's not the one. Fred seemed to be sad and depressed. I think he says something like, "They won't stop crying." or something along those lines, referring to his family if I remember correctly.
