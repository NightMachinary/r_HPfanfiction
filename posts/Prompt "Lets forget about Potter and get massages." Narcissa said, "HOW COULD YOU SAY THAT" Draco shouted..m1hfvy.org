** Oh I like this! But I'm not convinced Narcissa is the Iroh character... however, I can't come up with any better parallels. I was thinking Sirius could be an interesting pick.

Or maybe Sirius as Zuko and Uncle Alphard as Iroh... But Zuko feels more like Regulus than Sirius. Somehow I could see Sirius playing the part of Azula.

** So this came to mind:

-Tom never becomes Voldemort. Instead, he goes into politics and maintains the appearance of eternal youth to himself.

-He launches an invasion of somewhere and is remarkably successful. Unfortunately, he also 'dies' taking out Dumbledore, leaving his 'son' (aka himself) to take over.

-The Blacks are some of his die-hard supporters, with Bellatrix marrying Riddle JR JR and giving him a daughter (Delphini) before dying. Custody is taken over by Narcissa.

-Meanwhile, Andromeda has a kid of her own but opts to give her up in the hopes that she and her father will have a safer life in MACUSA territory. Grief-stricken at losing her husband and her daughter, she takes over education of the Malfoy brood.

-Narcissa, in on the con, assists her in exchange for help changing nappies and looking after the two hellions while she and Lucius try to keep themselves from getting drafted for the latest push outwards.

-Fast forward ten years: Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley come across a strange kid with massive magical powers, powers like their own, during a field trip. His name is Harry and he's being sent on a fetch quest by ghost Gandalf to find a Phoenix named Fawkes. Meanwhile, Draco and Andromeda are on a quest ordered by Daddy Riddle to hunt down the Chosen One in order to save their parents from ending up in Azkaban for draft dodging. Both are determined to do so for very different reasons.

-This culminates in an encounter in the Lost Castle of Hogwarts, where Harry is inducted as Headmaster.

Thus begins Harry Potter-The Last Headmaster

** If Draco is Zuko, Narcissa is Iroh. Lucius would be... the Fire Lord. Who would be Azula? Bellatrix? Yes, that sounds pretty right.

What about our heros? Who would be who for the gaang group? Harry I could see as Aang. He and Aang really don't like fights unless it's necessary. They're both the leaders and the peacemakers of the group.

"You're The Avatar, Harry!" lol.

Hermione would be Katara? Mhm... doesn't really fit right. tbh. Maybe Hermione would be Suki, potentially? Though she does care for others, which does fit Katara.

Ron would be Sokka. The jokester, feeling left out of the group, etc.

Who would Ginny and Luna be? Neither one really works for Toph. Ginny maybe with her headstrong attitude.

If Hermione played Katara, who would Luna play? Suki? Mhm... doesn't seem right. What do you guys think.

I'm overthinking it, lmao. Sorry. I love ATLA and HP.
