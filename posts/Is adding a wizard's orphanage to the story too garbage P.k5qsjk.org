I didn't specify a population increase in the fanfic I'm writing ... But I also didn't say if it was smaller or larger than in the canon, the only detail I gave was that.. for example in one of the houses only 6 girls were selected in 1991. Ok, I'm looking to add an OC, and I really wanted him to be very poor and orphan and not to go to hogwarts, but it opens up some holes in the story. The problem of the school can be solved with the canonical information that there is education at home (right?) If I add an orphanage (small, like a house where there are 5/6 children and a caregiver) but they don't go to school for some reason, will it make the fanfic seem cheap?

I really need a magical child from outside Hogwarts and that was the only way I found: / can someone help me? Thank you.... +first time writing fanfic here+


** I don't see an issue with creating an orphanage per se.

Yes, canonically there are plenty of wizards who opt for home-schooling or go to smaller, less permanent schools than Hogwarts. But you'd need to explain why the orphans are being kept out of a free education at Hogwarts. They'd not only be saving on the costs of providing education, even if that's just one teacher, but also on the general costs associated with having those children around for most of the year. It would be easier to explain home-schooling from a family than an orphanage, imo.

** IMO, inventing an entire orphanage just for one OC seems too much overhead. But naturally, it's your plot.

An alternative could be doing the "disliked relative" angle: Someone has no parents left, and ends up with a distantly related family that favours their own children. (Hence, no Hogwarts, and no nice things.) FWIW, this (minus the bad treatment, perhaps) is how I envision the Wizarding World dealing with the issue. Since everyone is related to everyone, you always find someone to take you in.

*** I would rather think that distant relatives would be happy to send off such child to Hogwarts. But maybe a distant relative, who keeps all the kids home schooled?

**** Well, it /does/ cost money. Even assuming no tuition, you gotta pay for clothes, books, other equipment. I was thinking they don't care enough to spend that kind of money on OC.

***** I don't quite buy it, though. You can send off kids without equipment, or give them second hand after the older kids in family. Generally, I think the "hateful distant relatives" trophy is overused in fiction.

****** /shrugs/

It's literally a fairytale trope so yeah. I think it's exactly the right kind of overhead for a random side character OC, because it's done in a single line without further fuss and no one cares, but YMMV.
