So.....I'm primarily a H/G reader. I love the pair but also enjoy angsty fics filled with relationship drama. It puts me in a weird spot because in my headcanon, they are great together and live happily, but it doesn't make for a good story. I read stories that put them through the ringer like a car accident I don't want to look at but can't help by stare.

Recently, I read a fic that was focused on R/Hr and had them go through a lot of tribulations. I really enjoyed it and never felt myself blanche since I'm not actually that invested in their relationship.

With all that said, what are some good fics that deal with Ron and Hermione struggling to make it all work? I don't care how bad it gets and even if they don't wind up together. Either can cheat on each other, even.

Preferably, I would like H/G to be a part of the story, but obviously they don't have to be the main part. I would not want to read anything that puts Harry with Hermione or has him with someone other than Ginny. I kind of prefer canon-based stories that deal more with the fact that Ron and Hermione canonically might have issues.

Thanks!


** There is a terrible lack of good postwar Hermione fics. Her rise to Minister would be heck a story to tell.

** linkffn(Faultlines by Pinky Brown). It's EWE but otherwise very faithful to the books, has R/Hr angst, and is very well written. On the other hand, while Harry /is/ with Ginny, they are going through a tough spot too, so if you're truly devoted to H/G, that might be a mark against. That's mostly in the background, though, and there's a lot of good relationship drama to the story that has naught at all to do with that.

*** You mind telling me the context behind both couples' issues? Don't really care what R/Hr is but I'm sometimes wary of exactly what issues H/G will face. And I assume H/G stay together?

*** Thanks! I'm cool with no H/G. As long as there is drama in the relationship, I'm ok with no H/G.

Ron suffers from PTSD. He and Hermione have broken up, but still love each other. The story is about him trying to get better, and the two of them getting back together.
