** Nah, they first riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault. Beside the gold, Dumbledore also got his hand on the Cup. He started the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, leading Lucius to get 20 years in Azkaban and Malfoy fortune in his and Minister Bagnold's coffers. The Diary ended up in his hand.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, and the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, Remus could definitely use some gold to hire some werewolves, and set the pack after Greyback? *Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective.*

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM methods. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‘donate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

“Ah dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.”

“Yes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.”

***** Holy shit, Harry Potter would actually fit great into a Series of Unfortunate Events styled narrative. I'm really tempted to try to write that now.

The second book even features an Incredibly Deadly Snake in both cases, and that minor detail makes me love this concept even more.

"But Professor, the Incredibly Deadly Basilisk isn't actually deadly at all! This is all a ploy by Lord Voldemort to scare everyone and somehow steal my inheritance. Why can't you see that Ginny Weasley is actually Lord Voldemort in disguise?"

"Don't be ridiculous, Harry. Everyone knows that Lord Voldemort does not have red hair. Ginny Weasley has red hair, and therefore could not possibly be Lord Voldemort."

****** I always thought ASoUE would fit nicely in the Potterverse. The VFD could be an offshoot of the Order, or reformed death eaters. The baudelaires could be wizards. The Mycelium would be a herbology project from hell. It doesn't even visit many real world locations, so all of the places the Baudelaires visit could be wizarding locations.

******* Oh, I really like the idea of a secret organization of wizards testing gifted Muggles to introduce them to the concepts of magic. Hell, how else would you keep and test forbidden Dark knowledge? /Only let the people who can't use magic learn about it./

VFD. The Vault of Forbidden Darkness. The secret room at the bottom of the Department of Mysteries. So dangerous is the knowledge that members must have their brains extracted toward the end of their lives, so that their ghosts can't spill the secrets. Those brains are so full of Dark knowledge that they come alive, lashing with caustic tentacles at any unsuspecting Weasley that falls into their grasp.

I like this a lot.

*** I'm going to expand on this idea in terms of DnD.

Dumbledore rolling up as a human warlock with disguise self and high Charisma. Flitwick as a halfling (goblins aren't generally good around people in DnD) rogue. Sprouts a half-elf nature cleric. McG is a druid who can only wild shape into cats. Snape is a drow ranger who specializes in herbalism and poisons. Hagrid would be a firbolg (half giant isn't really a thing afaik) barbarian multiclassed as a beast master ranger.

** If Quirrel could get into the vault that had the stone (a rather high security one) then I bet the staff could rob Gringotts blind, just empty the vaults of a few acceptable targets like the Malfoys and Blacks.
