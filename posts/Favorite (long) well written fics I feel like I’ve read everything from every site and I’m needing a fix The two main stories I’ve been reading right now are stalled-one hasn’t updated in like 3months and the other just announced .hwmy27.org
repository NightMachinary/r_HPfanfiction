I've been in the fandom long enough to have gone through most of the genres. dark/light, paring/no pairing, Fem Harry/ regular Harry, het/ slash, canon/ alt - it doesn't bother me either way, as long as it's well written. Preferably Harry is a main character and please NO harem. thank you so much for any suggestions!!

linkffn(6919395)

linkffn(637123) Criminally under read

linkffn(2859327)

linkffn(8262940)

linkffn(11080542) cant guarantee the quality of the latter chapters

linkffn(10099028) bellamoine, my personal guilty pleasure fic

linkffn(7613196) if you somehow havent read this series now would be a good time to do so

linkffn(7145549) a bit of a strange one but it was intriguing

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

** Ah, a slow day? I hate those days when nothing updates and you are just in the mood to enjoy something. Fear not for I, The Phantom Keeper, Qazs, will present you with some very long enjoyable stories. I hope you like crossovers.

*FILFY teacher* - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD Crossover: A super well thought out story has plenty of solid moments of family, action, and drama.

*Pack* - linkffn(13391615) - Jurassic Park Crossover: A surprisingly interesting one. Again lots of wizarding world bashing.

*Raptor* - linkffn(11689576) - Jurassic Park Crossover: This one is really good, less bashing in general but a bit of bashing of Hermione at first.

*When Harry met Wednesday* - linkffn(11674317) - Addams Family Crossover: There are quite a few of these surprisingly and they all are pretty good.

*Harry Potter, Squatter* - linkffn(13274956) - Percy Jackson Crossover: An amazing story about Harry explore the world of legends and myths all while finding a family.

*Heroes Assemble!* - linkffn(12307781) - Marvel Crossover: Probably one of the best stories I know. Everything ties into another really well and their is genuine chemistry between characters. Its an enjoyable read for sure.

*Amicus Protectio Fortis* - linkffn(11547735) - An interesting story about how the DA gets started in the first year and how it grows.

*Quoth the Raven, Nevermore* - linkffn(6652537) - An older fic that I think is still really good and certainly brought a unique take to Harry Potter and its world.

** Linkao3(To Be A Magical Boy) follows Dean and Seamus through the years. It's actually amazing, even if not centered on the main characters.

Linkao3(Professor Black by Haunted_Frost) is a really good Regulus lives fic where he becomes potions master instead of Snape.

Linkao3(A shrike (to your sharp and glorious thorn)) Is also a Regulus lives, but sent back in time to hopefully stop Voldy.

I'm on a Regulus lives kick so linkao3(He Comes Out of the Black Lake Quite Mad) is another fantastic one I've read. Oneshot though, and linkao3(As the crow flies) is also quite good, a Professor Regulus sitiation.

Linkao3(Ron Weasley and the Philosopher's Stone) is also a time travel fix it.

Linkao3(Golden Bullets) is just fucking good. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3(Chaos, Imperium, Scientae) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3(stay ahead and stay alive) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3(Back to Back We Face Ourselves) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3(Recipe for Disaster) is a Dudley redemption Drarry romantic comedy that's gold. You will not regret this one.

Linkao3(The Long Way Home) is a George grieving for Fred fic and him trying to find his way after Fred dies.

Linkao3(The Ousting of Umbridge) had Draco redemption! Harry and Draco friendship, and a different way fifth year should go.

Linkao3(A festival of traitors) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3(The Arrangement) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3(Playing Snape's Part) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3(Dudley Dursley's Most Unexpectedly Fortunate Flower) has Dudley redemption...and his daughter is a witch.

Linkao3(Stand by Me) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3(Just Another Nancy Boy?) Is Dudley redemption in which he is kicked out of his home for being gay. We love Petunia and Vernon.

Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3(Crimson Torment) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3(Silhouettes by nauticalparamour) is my last recommendation on Ao3. It's an incredible Theo/Hermione time travel fix it to the 1970s when Voldemort wins in their time.

Hope you enjoy! I hope the fanfiction bot actually gets these links.

The world of magic was a gentle wave and then roiling madness around them, but throughout it all that one thing would never change.From first year to seventh, together or apart, some things were constant.

  Kreacher's unending loyalty has allowed Regulus to survive the Inferi. In order to destroy the horcrux and ensure Voldemort's death, he goes back to Hogwarts, this time as a Potions professor. Years at this position give him new insights, even as the papers rave about how both the Blacks were traitors to their sides. When Sirius gets loose from Azkaban, Regulus knows one thing: he is not going to let his lunatic brother hurt his students. Inspired entirely by this tumblr post.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.
