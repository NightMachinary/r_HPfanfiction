Not entirely a recommendation since I just started it myself, but I wanted to share something I found. I read a lot of translated Chinese light novels (Xianxia, Wuxia, etc) through Novel Updates. I was a little surprised while I was on there to run across an HP fanfic. It was originally written in Chinese and was then translated into English. The translation quality is decent although if you have never read a translated Chinese novel it may come across a little odd.

It's called Harry Potter and the Rise of the Ordinary Person. A Chinese high schooler gets reincarnated into the HP universe as an incredibly overpowered OC.

So far it's not amazing and features plot armour pretty heavily, but the culture clash is interesting and the combination of cliches from both genres amuses me. If you want to try something a little different then check it out.

Edit: Translation quality dropped after book 1 (around chapter 42 of the 48 currently translated) when the translator switched. I'm unsure if I'll continue reading when new chapters are released. in addition, while the novel was described in some comments on Novel Updates as Xianxia and does fit some of those tropes, particularly the "weak to strong" ideal, there has been no martial arts or internal qi so far, just magic.


** Thanks for this, I'll check it out! I liked linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source). It's an AU from the Remo the destroyer series. Pretty OP and entertaining.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

** Having read some Xianxia and Wuxia novels, I want to point that tropes are VERY heavily used in this genre. To the point that it can be sometimes hard to distinguish novels, since most of them seem to repeat the same scenes with the same outcomes, only changing the name of the characters. Expect arrogant young master, unreasonable old men, plot armor and harem (the kind where the girl lose all substance once she joins the harem, only becoming a yes girl happy to welcome a new "sister" into the fold.

There are some gems in the genre though.

*** If those are the tropes, then I think a lot of fanfiction is ALREADY these types to novels. Except maybe the arrogant old Master. I don't recall seeing too many of those about...

*** That's a really good point, thanks for adding the explanation. It actually hasn't been too bad so far (just finished year 1 so no harem), but the MC is alresdy a godly chef winning the British over with delicious Chinese food. Also, he can learn the entire Hogwarts curriculum in a year and half (before first year) because of his good study habits formed as a Chinese student.

I admit part of the reason I've enjoyed it so far is exactly because of the mix of Xianxia tropes and fanfiction cliches. It feels like two genres that can often feel formulaic to me (overpowered Harry and reincarnated as a weak person), got mashed together so now it's something new. For people who haven't read Wuxia or Xianxia, it may just come across as strange.

** Is this the genre where there are a bunch of levels of like Qi based martial arts kind of like dragon ball z but more structured? Or am I thinking of something else.

*** I've never see dragon ball Z, but that seems like a reasonable description. It was described this way in comments I read about the story, but in the actual story so far there has been no martial arts or internal qi. I would say the reason it falls under kind of the Xianxia umbrella is mainly due to the common tropes and the idea of "weak to strong." Xianxia protagonists typically start out weak and/or disadvantaged, but are "cultivation" (in this case magic) geniuses whose power grows exponentially. They tend to be very obsessed with growing stronger. They remind me of a video game character who constantly levels and then goes into a higher level dungeon were they are still the underdog.

This is probably less of a Xianxia and more of an "oh no I got reincarnated into a novel and have to get stronger to avoid my doom." It's a pretty popular genre, in this case the novel is Harry Potter and the doom is due to MC being a muggleborn.

I enjoyed the voice, some of the fourth walk breaks, and a lot of the commentary, but it's not terribly original for either genre.
