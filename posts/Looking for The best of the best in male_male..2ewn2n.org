Apologies for the mess of a title, couldn't think of a better way to phrase it.

I'm looking for what you guys would consider the best of the best when it comes to any type of male slash fiction, I don't care how ridiculous the pairing sounds, or the ages, or the houses, or the relationships, or the species etc. Longer fics would be appreciated but I'll take anything you think is well-written and worth a read.

Not too bothered about the explicit parts either; if it's basically porn or if it's as innocent as the original books - don't mind either way.

For reference I recently finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]], which is Remus/Lupin in their school-days. That was a good read, quite long at 400k words too.


** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] by Cinnamon (Harry/Draco)

#+begin_quote
  Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon (Harry/Draco)

#+begin_quote
  Draco had no idea that the repercussions of stealing Potter's journal and shoving it down the back of his trousers would be so extreme.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3386][A Certain Kind of Fool]] by asnowyowl (Harry/Snape)

#+begin_quote
  For Severus, everything changes when Harry and his children move into Hogwarts. Little Albus Severus has taken a liking to him and it seems Harry Potter has a secret.
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48782][Sirius Is A Totally Helpful Advice Columnist 'verse]] by duva and fictionalcandie (Sirius/James) This begins with a couple of one-shots during their Hogwarts years, then really gets going in /Dear Sirius/. The rest of the series are smutty excerpts.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/][Reparations]] by Sara's Girl (And the sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/][Foundations]])

#+begin_quote
  Harry is about to discover that the steepest learning curve comes after Healer training, and that second chances can be found in unexpected places.
#+end_quote

[[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/100371.html][The Rules of Being a Godson]] by copperbadge (Teddy Lupin/James Potter II)

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin never gets too close or feels too much; his godfather's son never does anything else.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] by Lightning on the Wave (Harry/Draco). This is an epic length AU that covers all seven years and the slash is slow to build, but it is an incredibly written series with a lot of world building and well thought out plot. Be prepared to spare a lot of time if you plan to read this one.

** Oh damn, wait a second while I go sort through my favourites. Do you take crossovers and crossover pairings as well?

*Edit: No matter I'll just put them here whether you'll read them or not.

Purely Harry Potter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2427084/1/The-Abuse-in-a-Violently-Different-Dimension][Abuse in a Violentl Differnet Dimension]] It doesn't have all that much slash (yet) but it one of my all time favourites.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284190/chapters/452624][The Life of Another]] Very well made Snarry.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/63161][No Room for the Weak]] Also very well made Snarry, if confusing as hell at some points.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox]] Okay this is the last Snarry, I promise.

.

Crossover Slash:

Harry Potter/Avengers [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096486/1/Sowilo][Sowilo]] Harry/Loki

Harry Potter/Death Note [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5730598/1/Martyrdom-and-Paradox][Martyrdom and Paradox]] Harry/L

Harry Potter/Doctor Who [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5921269/1/Hanging-by-a-Thread][Hanging by a Thread]] Harry/Doctor

.

Also, everything written by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]].

** I read mainly Harry/Draco so that's what these will be. I'm at work and don't have access to my bookmarks so I'll do what I can from memory and add to it later if I remember

Anything by Maya. She writes Harry/Draco and various other (mainly het) pairings. My faves: Drop Dead Gorgeous, If You've a Ready Mind, and Underwater Light. FYI, but Quality of Mercy is NOT a Drarry romance fic but rather just a strong close friendship fic, almost pre-slashy (edited to remove the broken link as she pulled all her fics)

Anything by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/faithwood/pseuds/Faith%20Wood][Faithwood]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/femmequixotic/pseuds/Femme][Femme]]

The Harry/Draco Big Bang was the official Big Bang challenge and has quite a few awesome stories: [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/]]

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/180806][Survival of the Species]]

#+begin_quote
  Draco approaches Harry on the 9 Â¾ platform, after their sons have boarded the Hogwarts Express, and invites him over for tea. The discussion they have leads them on an adventure that neither could have expected. There be dragons! HPDH compliant.
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]]

#+begin_quote
  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]] a h/d classic but very dark and sad.

#+begin_quote
  Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it.
#+end_quote

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=2226][A Thousand Beautiful Things]]

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy struggles with changed fortunes, shifted alliances, an ugly war, and an unusual spell, with the help of a concerned professor, an insightful house-elf, and an unexpected Gryffindor friend.
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/10793][Left My Heart]] and it's sequel Surrender the Grey

#+begin_quote
  Auror Draco Malfoy has disappeared, and Harry Potter has been sent to San Francisco to find him. (Post-Hogwarts, set in February, 2004. Written before Half-Blood Prince was released.)
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP.html][Irresistible Poison]]

#+begin_quote
  Under the influence of a love potion, Draco learns that poison doesn't always bring death -- there are other ways to suffer and live. Chemical emotion runs feverish as Harry and Draco discover the intoxication of love.

** Once in a Blue Moon is very meh. That fandoms has much much better fics.

#+begin_quote
  Momentum (or anything by Children of the Shadows)

  Shoebox (+ accompanying fics, and oneshots/commissions done by the authors. Those may be hard to find though, because the original Livejournal died

  Ton of stuffs over at RS Games. 2014 version finished last months AFAIK. I haven't kept up, but there was a couple in the 2013 edition that stole my heart

  Beginner's Guide to Being Dead. There are a lot more fics done for the 2009 big bang blackout, but the host died at the start o the year. 9 months on, still no change. I have a copy of this particular fic if you want it emailed though

  Mercy, Pity, Peace and all other works by that author. She goes under multiple pseudonyms, so finding them all can be quite hard.

  Mapmakers (remix). I linked it here maybe around a year back? Search with my username and you can probably find the link.
#+end_quote

In general, for HP Fanfiction, I'd recommend digging around Livejournal/InsaneJournal/etc... and other old 2001-2006 era blogging/personal sites/communities. That was the prime era of HP Fanfics. The selections available at FF.net and AO3 are pretty limited. The big ships (R/S, H/D) have multiple communities, and their rec list is massive. Watch out for remixes as well. Some are even better than the original.

** The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry Verse]] by Copperbadge is mostly gen, but there's a pretty strong Remus/Sirus sideplot which I thought was pretty good. The last book in the series is dead, but the author posted a plot summary.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182][Cartographer's Craft]], also by Copperbadge is pretty decent. It's Sirius/Harry, but not as creepy as that first sounds - there's all sorts of time traveling antics.

I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2685324/1/][All Kidding Aside]] was a funny, light-hearted Remus/Sirius. I haven't read it in ages , but I remember it being a nice light read.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] is the famous Remus/Sirius. I haven't read it, but I've heard it highly recommended from tons of people.

I'm going to second people's recommendations to google for rec lists - it's the easiest way to find well written fics of any kind, and I know there are a ton of them for Harry Potter.
