I did warn y'all that this is a slow burn. Hermione and Tom Sr. haven't caught fire yet, but they're finally getting a little less chilly.


** I love your story! I binged it in one day and it has some really well fleshed our characters. The Riddles aren't good people per se, but you grow to really like them. Tom is just so wonderful. He's so selfish and vain, but you can see he does have a heart somewhere- and he's so much a man of his time, so his dynamic with modern day progressive Hermione is funny.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
