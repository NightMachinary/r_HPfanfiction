In his first attempt at reading tea-leaves he predicted that Harry will get an unexpected windfall of gold, ( Harry winning the TWT and Sirius' death), he also sees a blob shaped like a bowler hat (Fudge) and in the Goblet of Fire, Ron also predicted while doing homework that Harry will get burnt ( 1st task)


** I like the idea that Ron actually does have some skill at divination and thats why he is good as a keeper and at chess. He actually sees the things before they happen, just sometimes he's too nervous to act on the instinct.

** And what," she said, in a whisper that carried all around the Entrance Hall, "are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?"

"Oh, that won't be a problem, you see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he already has temporary lodgings." He spoke

"You've found - ?" said Umbridge shrilly. "You've found? Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Number..."

"The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if - and only if - the Headmaster is unable to find one," said Dumbledore. "And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded. May I introduce you?" Dumbledore paused for a minute 'Ronald weasley, may you come here for a moment'

Ronald nervously shuffled towards dumbledore uncomfortable at being drawn into this conflict. 'How can I help you headmaster ?' ron said trying to cover up his nervousness

Dumbledore merely smiled and patted Ron on the shoulder 'May I introduce our newest professer of divination, Ronald weasley'

'He cant be a professor... he is .... he is still a student' umbridge stuttered out 'your more deluded then fudge belives'

dumbledore merely smiled 'there are no rules against students being professors after all, former hogwarts headmaster Alexander proudmore showed that when during the wizard pox plague of 1312 he was made a professor of defense against the dark arts while still in his fourth year a postion he held for 50 years afterwards before becoming one of the finest headmasters hogwarts has had'

'Mr Weasley is not qualified to teach Divination' umbridge snapped hastily

'Professer weasley has showed a remarkable aptitude for divination, as seen in his exams with several of his predictions coming true, he predicted during his first attempt reading tea-leaves that his fellow student harry potter would come into a unexpected windfall of gold and the very next year harry won the triwizard tournment and come into a rather large gold prize' dumbledore then smiled and looked at Ron 'I am sorry Delores but Its getting rather late and I feel I should help our new professor settle into his role'' dumbledore then guided ron by his shoulder out of the room.

'this shall be your office, if you are inclined to it professor weasley' dumbledore said looking at ron. 'Professor dumbledore ?' ron started ''is this a Joke ?'' he continued Dumbledore sighed softly 'I have complete faith in your ability to rise to this task, I selected you as prefect for a reason and while you had not rose to the challange like I had hoped, I belive you can rise to this one' dumbledore paused ' though I must apologise for misleading you''

Ronald stood dumbfounded staring at dumbledore

'Yes I must apolgise, Alexander proudmore started teaching in 1310 not 1312'

** This is an ancient fic (~2003) that has seer!Ron but not professor Ron. I remember it (and its sequel, both complete) being readable.
