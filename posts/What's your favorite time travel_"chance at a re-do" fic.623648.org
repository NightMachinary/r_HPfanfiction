  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** A tie between NoFP and The Hogwarts Strike Team.

Nightmares of Futures Past is probably the defining time-travel fic in the fandom along with the Backward With Purpose series. It set tropes and cliches for other fics, and it predates Deathly Hallows. NoFP was one of the first fics I read, and so it has a kind of charm that I associate with it. It might not have aged well, but it's always worth a mention.

The Hogwarts Strike Team is the only other full-length canon-following time travel fic I can stomach. It gives a valid reason for the backward journey, it doesn't bash characters, and the main characters actively begin undoing Voldemort using their foreknowledge. All while staying secret (I dislike time travel fics where the traveler(s) outright tell everyone; it takes away from the "magic" and air of mystery/suspense).

#+end_quote

I dislike time-travel fics where the traveler(s) are super-duper secretive about their origins, just because it would make the story more exciting if they have to sneak around a lot (all the while all other characters have been lobotomised and never figure out the obvious) . If the author can't come up with a valid reason for being secretive that isn't immediately and massively outweighed by the potential benefits of working together on a common goal with allies it's just lazy writing.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Snape/Lily is my guilty pleasure so my favorites would have to be linkffn(the moment it began), linkffn(his greatest wish my andromeda marine), linkffn(second start by 8thweasley kid), and linkffn(come once again and love me) as [[/u/Lucylouluna][u/Lucylouluna]] also recommended.

linkffn(reboot by Kallanit) is a recent find that is also awesome and is Snape/OC. Snape, Harry, and Hermione all get a second chance. My only complaint is that the Dumbledore bashing is laughably over the top.

#+begin_quote
  It has been Severus Snape's greatest wish to go back and fix his life with Lily. What happens when he suddenly gets the chance, remembers everything, and has changed enough to avoid Slytherin? Marauder-era, pre- and established Severus/Lily. 50/50 COMPLETE!

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.
