:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, this is driving me nuts. I can remember large chunks of the plot but can't remember the title or the author of this fic.

Something happens and Harry is assumed dead I believe. The goblins help him, Sirius, Remus, and Snape escape to America where he attends a school there and plays Quidditch. He has a fun nickname as the seeker but I can't remember what it is.

If anyone knows which one I'm talking about, I was wanting to reread it. I'm also open to any of your favorite Sirius raising Harry (before the series or during) fics.

Thanks!

  Harry is not content to hear how he is "perfectly safe" and turns to the only adult he feels he can trust. Sirius helps him gain his animagus form, its down hill for the bad guys after that. Then one shock after another leads to a new life for Harry and his three 'Uncles". No pairings. For missgsmith51 who picked the animagus form. **Mercedes Raine is a continuation on this story
