I LOVE Hermione, but every fic has her with those guys. Any good ones with different characters? Cedric, twins, Krum, etc etc. Rare pairs fine, slash fine. Just a good fic that is completed or regularly updated.


** linkao3(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by Brilliant Lady)

linkffn(Icarus by MarbleGlove) is where Hermione begins an anonymous correspondence with both Dumbledore and Voldemort because she wants to learn more about Transfiguration.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

** I recently found Air by Cakebski ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12096740/]] ) which is a Hermione/Krum story. I'm only 10 chapters in but so far is really good and quite well written.

Hermione/Remus [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/73/]]

Hermione/Fred (also not far into this one) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7292302/19/]]

Hermione/Bill [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752462/35/]]

*** Can I ask about the story Air? Have you read all 44 chapters? I just read the Prologue and think the setup for Viktor/Hermione is excellent. But how does the story, itself, progress? Is it worth the read?

**** Well, I'm only ten chapters in, but it seems set to progress well, certainly canonically for the events, I can't tell yet how that will affect the relationship and whether it will be angsty at all or if it will be HEA.

I'm happy to let you know once I finish reading it, if you would like. 🤗

***** Sorry, but what's "HEA"?

I'm going to read it too. Many Viktor/Hermione stories don't grab my attention, but this one definitely has.

Thank you for recommending it!
