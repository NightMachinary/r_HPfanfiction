Hello,

I am looking for a beta reader for a story that I publish on fanfiction.net and AO3. Grammar is particularly important to me, since I am German and I previously gave the individual chapters for proofreading to non-native speakers as well.

I find it difficult to find a potential beta using the settings on fanfiction.net. Maybe someone can help me here?

Around 60,000 words have already been published. I would be happy if someone could read it critically again. And then especially the new chapters.

I would then discuss the details privately.

Thank you very much and have a nice day!

** Hi! I just created a blog to help betas and authors find each other. You don't need to have a Tumblr to submit. Here's a link in case you're interested [[https://lookingforabeta.tumblr.com/]]
