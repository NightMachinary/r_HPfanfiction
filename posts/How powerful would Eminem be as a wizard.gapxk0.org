** Realistically, magical power level is probably a blend of a lot of things. Knowledge, first and foremost. Mental fortitude, which makes Occlumency a really useful thing to know. Actually practicing magic, the same way as you train for a sport. Sheer willpower. Basically, healthy mind and healthy body make for healthy magic. The wand you use could also make a difference. I don't think it's something innate, like magical core, or blood. Only way in which blood/genetics factors in is for traits like Parseltongue and Metamorphing.

** Given that non-verbal spellcasting is a thing, speaking fast doesn't mean much.
