** Some female protagonist fics...

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) - this series is really amazing despite the terrible summary. I really enjoyed it. The ruse that fem!Harry is pulling off is simply incredible in scale, and the series keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's a thrilling read. There are a few flaws but plot-wise this fic is more innovative than most.

linkffn(The never-ending road) is different. Instead of being strong and independent, Harry is a weak child - not in a bad way, it's actually written in a very endearing manner. The writing quality is great but it's mostly a canon rehash with fem!Harry. On top of this, the Snape/Harry interactions leave me nauseous... I feel a slowly dawning horror as Snape projects a 2-decade old crush onto a mere child. Reading Snape's thoughts here makes me feel a bit sick, so I'm dropping this fic. It's a shame because the writing quality is really top-notch, and the thoughts and voices of the characters feel natural and believable, but that just makes the Snape/Harry interactions that much worse.

** Currently reading Albus and Harry's World Tour by ZebJeb on FF. It's still being written but I find it enjoyable that it really goes to show a fluidity in magic. It's a goofier story as well, a nice break from some of the other fanfics where it's angst and high stakes political drama. I do wonder if the intent of the story was to try and give explanation to weird story direction in canon as it nods to reasoning some of those things even when not strictly necessary.

**** It starts as a fix it fic, as the mentioned ghost helps kid Harry fix his life at Dursleys, with suffietient amount (my opinion) comeupance, then it veers off into worldbuilding. All those things that seemed awesome as a kid, but now are a bit absurd in reality are fleshed out into a logical extremes while not making a ghostly god.

** Vacillation is about Lucius and Narcissa's early marriage and how they navigate their growing feelings for each other.

Told mostly from Lucius' POV, it also glimpses at Narcissa's earlier life and shows a lot of Bellatrix and Rodolphus' relationship, the latter of which I also found super interesting (and am low key really into---they're hilarious together)

So, yes, Lucius comes across as a dick at first, but I surprisingly don't mind all the passive aggressive fighting he and Narcissa do, especially towards the middle of the story. His character development is really evident and believable, and now I just want to hug him and say dude it'll be okay you don't need to be so stiff about things.

I love that many characters (Lucius included) are still evil, and the author never tried to justify why they're awful murderers, but just depicts it as part of their existence. Villains can have overall human existences too :)

The Pureblood world pretty deeply developed, which lots of glimpses of drama, and I'm really shipping both main couples.

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.

I definitely would have as a kid but that's because I was naive and believed in the best of everyone. I guess my reasoning is that most of the non muggleborns have an idea of what his family's like? I don't always like canon Draco but even as a kid I always felt kind of sad for being so lost in his family's beliefs. And Justin's similar to me as a kid: too nice for his own good.

"The Odds Were Never In My Favor by Antony444 is a Harry Potter AU fanfic where Neville Longbottom is the Boy-Who-Lived, his family's location betrayed by James Potter, who was thrown into Azkaban. Furious at this treachery, a mob killed Lily Potter and nearly their daughter, Alexandra Potter.

"Now going to Hogwarts, Alexandra is the school pariah, viewed and hated as the daughter and heir of the one the whole Wizarding World regards as Voldemort's greatest lieutenant. It soon becomes clear that even just surviving Hogwarts is going to take all she has got, even as Voldemort makes his moves against Dumbledore. Only barely less a problem is how Neville Longbottom has embraced his role of The-Boy-Who-Lived at Hogwarts--- and has the muscle to back it up.

"Worst of all, within the shadows, an ancient organization continues its careful moves to achieve total domination..." - Excerpt from TVTropes

The Odds Were Never In My Favor is an enormous masterpiece, emphasis on both /enormous/ and /masterpiece/. At nearly 600k words, it is a heavy bit of literature. It updates regularly tri-weekly and shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon.

I love this story. Words cannot properly describe just how much I love it. It just has it all, relatable characters, excellent storyline, believable plot, action, drama, a little bit of romance and just a dash of intrigue. It's a recipe straight out of the cookbooks of greatness.

Unlike the majority of HP fics, The Odds broadens the picture from just Hogwarts and keeps you aware of the wizarding world around you, while still staying connected to Alexandra and her exploits. The fallout from the yearly adventures at Hogwarts has actual tangible effects outside its walls. Things like this create better immersion, and just make it a better fic.

Antony's skill with writing is shown best through his use of OC's and AU elements that are so flawlessly integrated into the story that you'd swear they were always there in the first place.

One of my favorite parts was the portrayal of Neville as The-Boy-Who-Lived. You can really see how fame has gone to his head, but it's not jammed down your throat like other WBWL/NotBWL fics. So often in those fics the (W)BWL is twisted into an arrogant, self-entitled whiny bastard that's basically the second coming of Joffrey from GOT. A one-dimensional character, if you will. In The Odds, Neville is an actual human being. He's arrogant and entitled, sure, but he acts like a celebrity with his fans rather than a king and his subjects. He's grown up with a certain level of respect and awe being pointed in his direction and he's come to expect it from those around him. It's masterfully done.

I'd rate this fic forty out of the Original Forty and tell you to check out some of his other works as well.

*** Hmm. I'm only up to chapter 3 so far, but it's been engaging enough to continue. A few yellow flags with her inheriting a Wizengamot seat and hundreds of thousands of galleons and going shopping for an expanded trunk, but it hasn't gone over the top. The political seat is less useful when everyone will be prejudiced against her; the main vault is inaccessible until she's of age, which leaves her with just a few thousand galleons in a trust vault; and the trunk is just two compartments and password protection, rather than a mobile home. She preserves canon Harry's snark, and seems to be doubling down on his ruthlessness, but mostly to protect her own life. Will see how it goes.

(600k isn't really enormous by my usual standards, by the way. Anything under a million words can't be more than "a bit hefty".)

It's not that good. I would actually go on to say that is more bad than good. IMO.

The below are just some of the few things that I thought were done badly. Sure there are some really good aspects, however, sometimes the bad outweighs the good. Especially when its not particularly well written.

For example in beginning of first year. Alexandra has no friends is an absolute loner and people literally disperse when she walks into a room and yet she knows every detail of what happens with Longbottom, Black and Weasley. It's also quite annoying that the first year is largely her recounting the New Marauders exploits. The author would probably be better off doing point of views from Longbottom, Black and Weasley if they are such a major focus. Humm what else, oh, a lot of what's written is redundant. The 16 or so chapters of first year could have been cut down to five.

I was holding out hoping that she'd become friends with Blaise or Daphne due to the meetings beforehand but for some inexplicable reason she ends up with surprise surprise - Hermione and Nigel (who is literally a mix of Ron and Neville put into one character). Also, her reasoning for not being friends or having alliance with Blaise, Daphne and Davies is that they haven't stuck up for her which is ridiculous. Hermione and Nigel would never have done so either before she saved Hermione and since then they haven't either. All, I'm saying is that its clear there is a Slytherin bias here - just have a better reason. Whatever!

It is very clear that it's a male writing this fiction. There are so many things Alexandra thinks and says that no women or girl would ever think or say. Honestly, if the author just wanted to write a Harry in Ravenclaw, he should've just written a boy Harry in Ravenclaw. There was no need to change the gender. Actually, I should probably copy it into word and replace all mentions of Alexandra with Harry and it would read better.

There are also these little niggly things that bother me and I'm not sure if anyone else notices. Like almost every time Blaise is mentioned there is also a mention of his skin colour. Visibility matters, YES, but when you're speaking of a Caucasian character how many times do you mention the colour of their skin?? Then there was the bit that mentioned Blaise mother - '...fairly suntanned skin but not up to Blaise dark colour' - Colourism much!! As if a dark skinned women cannot be beautiful. Then there's when Alexandra sees Daphne and mentions the ice queen look (that's another rant for another day). Alexandra says something along the lines that Daphne should smile more or else she won't get a husband!?!?!?! Like WTF Sexism!!

There is so much more.

I don't agree fully with the criticisms after this one, but this is a deal-breaker for me.

I'm a dude and I can totally tell when it's a woman trying to write relationships (C'est La Vie, Stages of Hope) and it's just easier for me to mentally correct their gender.

If I read this, I'd just rename Alexandra to Alexander!

**** I binged this in about 1 1/2 days and I can say that it definitely is a stand out fanfic and the tropes that are used are only used to further the excellent writing of the story. It's not cringy and there is enough intrigue and intricacies to the characters that certain actions that are usually tropes have actual reasons. It's really good!

***** Struggling a bit with the spelling and grammar, but the plot seems ok. Rather more violent than canon, eg the troll attack, but that's not necessarily bad writing. I'm a little concerned about the characterisation of Dumbledore, though; it's taking "sweeping things under the rug" to a new level.

****** I like the characterization of Dumbledore personally. In the fic he's very much a politician and working like 3 jobs. The students just aren't his priority. He's not canon Dumbledore, and is manipulative and not an ally of Alexandra, but he's not just an evil caricature either. I'm not a fan of Dumbledore so I actually enjoyed the portrayal (especially as it didn't devolve into annoying bashing), but I suppose if you like Dumbledore as a character it might be frustrating.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

*** Oh man, I decided to give this fic a try based on your comment and I have to say it is damn good. I've never read a female!Harry fic before but I'm really enjoying it so far.

Alex is kind of an OC in my opinion, based on how different she is from canon Harry, but that only makes things more interesting since it's not just one of those "Harry is super smart and avoids all canon problems" fics. Instead there are genuine challenges and conflicts but Alex approaches them very differently from Harry. Also, the AU elements of the world raise different challenges than canon altogether. It makes for a super refreshing and cool take on magical world-building, politics, and Hogwarts.
