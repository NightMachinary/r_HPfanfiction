[Inspired by R'Blot's Mister Black's backstory and Phoenix series by Midnight_Jen]

This may be a bit too squicky/cracky for most people, but I like the idea of basilisk venom, being at least partly composed of dark magic, would have an interesting virus-replicating effect in a victim.

One horrific aspect of basilisk venom is that not only is it venomous and corrosive, it's also forged from dark magic as befitting its carrier's origin: an infected being's magic and variously needed proteins et cetera in the blood actually helps to create /more/ of the venom.

Fawkes' tears didn't eliminate the basilisk venom coursing through Harry's veins: it merely made him immune to it through either constantly healing him on a cellular level, boosting his body's defenses so that he isn't constantly poisoned by it, or adapting his body to merely be unaffected by it, with the venom just passively lingering around like an unwanted roommate after a certain threshold has been reached.

Unfortunately, that means every body-fluid Harry possesses is contaminated by the venom: blood, sweat, tears, urine, poop -- /everything/.

Harry just became the most venomous being alive. I wonder if his skin would frequently change colour to something bright, like how toxic animals are brightly-coloured to warn off predators/annoyances, depending on his moods.

(On a squicky note, this probably dooms him to a life of celibacy too, unless an obsessed fangirl tries to repeat the process... actually, that could be darkly amusing/utterly horrifying if a loathsome character like Pansy or Daphne, or a deluded one like Cho post-Cedric, tries and actually succeeds, and they're each others' only choices without boinking off every man/woman they respectively boink).

...Oh, sugary-shitty snap.

A truly sociopathic, power-hungry Daphne Greengrass tries this and actually succeeds: she can't understand why Harry is beyond horrified and why he wants nothing to do with her.

She's ambitious, beautiful, wealthy, and from a family of good standing: why wouldn't he want to eventually marry her? She just can't conceive of any reason why he's reluctant and so against her plan.


** Holy sh*t this is a darker version of what I know. It also explains Voldemort's nose cause it was maybe burned off by the venom XD.

**** Ha I was more thinking about the Dursleys since that would be funny. And horrific if he accidentally sneezed on them and they melted or something. Not that I'd care.

***** "Harry!" Hermione would've been giving him a stern look, had she not been averting her eyes. "Stop urinating on the dungeon wall! It's disgusting!"

"I'm just marking my territory, Hermione."

"Weeing 'Snape is a dick' in the stone is not 'marking your territory', Harry James Potter!" She blinked, and then resisted the urge to facepalm. "What am I saying! You shouldn't be doing this in the first place!"

Ron, who had been acting as a lookout, merely chuckled, giving him a thumbs-up.

** I never liked the case of them "cancelling" each other out. They are the extremes of light and dark, with magic involved them "cancelling out" would most likely be explosive or destructive. Nah, I like the thought that they are constantly circling each other, attracting and repelling. Like the Tai Chi symbol representing Ying and Yang.

I'm of the opinion that the fang went straight into the bone, into the marrow. The venom cleared out some marrow, and the tears replenished the marrow, sealing them both in. This causes his body to end up creating each of them.

Now he has context-sensitive bodily fluids. Is he surprised or pissed off? Venomous fluids. Concerned, love, etc? Healing fluids. Neutral? The fluid has both properties, keeping each other from working. This effect continues until they run out of energy and disspiate.

** Awesome idea, and what would his/their offspring be like?

And maybe Voldemort`s ritual would utterly fail because while the blood is immune, the rest of the potion isn`t and it just blows up.

*** If ('cause dark magic being unpredictable) he/they can have kids, it could be unpredictable -- detrimental or beneficial.

Their kids could be as venomous, could have venom sacs in their mouths, could have the same colour-changing effect their parents have or just randomly shift between having green eyes, blue eyes and blond/blonde and black hair, like a limited metamorphmagus.

Possibilities are endless, really.

Nothing personal on Daphne. :)

She is a blank slate: while there's a common, fanon interpretation of her (blue eyed, blonde haired, for example), she could be a saint, a sinner, a mini-Death Eater or a "blood-traitor" outcast, green-eyed, hazel-eyed, a brunette or even a wizarding punkette with blue hair.

The most we know about her is that she's a Slytherin, in Harry's year, has a two-year younger sister called Astoria that married Malfoy, and IIRC hung around with Pansy's "gaggle of girls".

Her family is part of the "Sacred 28", IIRC.

Oh, and there's a blood-curse on their family which eventually kills Astoria, if Cursed Shite is taken as canon and not the worst of (canonized) fanfiction.net trash.

Now, extrapolating possibilities...

She might have the same views, or eventually come to have the same views, as her sister does, when she married Malfoy (apparently Astoria's views on muggles and muggleborns caused tension with Lucius and Narcissa).

She hung around with Pansy: she might be like her at that age, or just hang around the more popular girl/gravitate towards her, socially.

...I think that's it?

*** She has a breakdown/has a further degradation of her mental-health during the year and goes through with it.

Basically, she's more of a basket-case than the grief-stricken, irrational, envious Cho seen in canonical Fifth Year.
