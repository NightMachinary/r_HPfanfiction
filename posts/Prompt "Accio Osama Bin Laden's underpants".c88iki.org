** They were several drinks in.

No. They were several handfuls of shots in.

/It's Neville's fault/, a sober Harry the next day would reason. /He's the one that wanted to play a drinking game./

Right now, Harry was attempting to pour another shot into the clear glass in front of him. He was getting more alcohol on the table than in the glass which was making Ron laugh next to him. Neville was trying to pull the bottle out of Harry's hand but only received at a bony elbow in his gut.

"Truth," Harry shakily shoved the half-full shot glass as Ron, "Or dare?"

"Truth! Truth! Truth!" Neville chanted leaning against Harry's back. He was also trying to get the bottle again.

"Nev, g'off," Harry slurred pushing against his friend who giggled. After nearly falling off his chair He straightens up and went back to chanting truth at Ron. Harry tapped the wood table in front of Ron. Ron looked at Harry's fingers before rolling his head to meet Harry's green eyes.

"Dare!" He cried out. Neville cried out in disappointment before starting to giggle again.\\
"Steal, uh, steal underwear!"

Harry giggled, "Yeah! Bin Laden's guy's stuff." He waved his hand in front of his face as if to try and wipe the words out of the air, "Steal Osama's underpants!"

Ron snorted, before stumbling to get his wand out of his holster. He playfully pointed the wand at Harry before laughing. He then raised his right hand and bellowed out loudly, "Accio Osama Bin Laden's underpants!" After a moment of nothing not happening Ron groaned at the failed spell.

"You lost, Drink up!" He shoved the glass closer to the redhead.

Suddenly Neville cried out and stumbled off his stool. After sitting up on the floor her looked to his left to see a pair of underpants laying on the tiled floor. After a second of staring at them in shock, he started a deep belly laugh. He grabbed them and waved the cloth in the air. Harry laughed at after a moment of surprise. Ron cheered at his win.
