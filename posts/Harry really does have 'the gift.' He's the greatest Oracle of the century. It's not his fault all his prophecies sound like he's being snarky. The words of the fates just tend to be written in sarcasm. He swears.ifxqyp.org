*** Haven't read the fic yet, but I wonder if telling the exact opposite of what's going to happen will work? i.e., If Harry sees that Voldemort is going to rise tomorrow, instead of telling the truth, he'll say Voldemort will never rise instead. Will people think he's lying and therefore assume that Voldemort /is/ going to rise (therefore, tricking them into believing the truth)?

** Little did anyone - especially Trelawney, who seemed to mark Harry's essays lower the more certain he was - know, Harry's essays all had a habit of coming true. This was first evident when Harry predicted Scabbers would get lost and be found again four times, being lost forever the fifth time - sure enough, he counted. When Scabbers was finally outed as Pettigrew, it had indeed been after five attempted escapes, each of which Ron blamed on Crookshanks.

Harry's prediction that Trelawney would fall off the Tower but be saved at the last second, after she predicted yet another death for Harry, caused him to receive a detention - before Trelawney's indignation caused her to stumble backwards out of the open window, only for Lavender Brown, who had been sitting nearby, to have an adrenaline surge and catch her at the last moment.

No-one even bothered counting how many flies Trevor the Toad would end up eating that month, but somehow no-one believed Harry's extremely high prediction - including Professor Trelawney who marked that homework as "poor".\\
Of course, Harry got the blame when Trevor the Toad managed to get into the Potions cabinet, where the opened jar of lacewing flies was promptly emptied.

During a particularly bad argument between Ron and Hermione, Harry stated his decision to put a prediction for their marriage in his essay, wherein tragedy befalls one of the guests but the groom won't mind. Sure enough, the wedding 5 years later was beautiful, until Aunt Muriel got struck by lightning - then it became the best day of Ronald's life.

Even Harry's multiple predictions of his own death had a habit of coming true, despite sounding more outlandish each time - it's not Harry's fault Voldemort accidentally made each of his bones into a separate Horcrux (thus ensuring Harry would indeed die two hundred times - another prediction for which Harry received a Troll grade), or that his life was /profoundly weird/ even for a wizard.

**** I justified the Troll grade in my head because it'd sound like Harry was mocking Trelawney's very serious predictions of his dire fate (the prompt /did/ say his predictions sounded snarky). If he'd managed to spin it so it sounded as sincere as it was, he'd have gotten an Outstanding.
