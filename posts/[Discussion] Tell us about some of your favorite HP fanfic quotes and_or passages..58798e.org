Doesn't have to be a one-liner, you can do a bit of dialogue or narration. And please include some of the scene setup, analysis, why you love the quote. I'll start with two of my very favorites. Spoilers for the Black Comedy and (especially) for the Sacrifices Arc.

*Firstly* from Black Comedy, chapter 27:

Harry has just crashed into Madam Puddifoot's, killing Death Eaters left and right, in order to save his AU sister, Sarah. After he reaches her, he produces a /Fidelius/ cage, where they recuperate a bit, drink some healing potions and so on. She asks about the spell, Harry explains that he created it, how it works and the line goes like this:

/She was watching the magic flowing out of view into the floor and ceiling. "How long can you keep it up?" Sarah blushed when Harry bit back a snort. "The spell, you pervert."/

I just love how brilliantly this small exchange helps in narrating the scene - it shows so much with so little. It tells us that despite facing two dozen Death Eaters, Harry's confidence is through the roof - he's a wizard far beyond them; that he's a true juvenille at heart; that he frequently thinks about sex (how quintessentially male..); he uses humor as a defence against difficult odds... just like we do in real life.

*Secondly from the Sacrifices Arc*, year 5, chapter 61:

In this intermission, the scene is set in Tulianum, the new wizardring prison; Albus Dumbledore is confined in a /still-beetle/, a magical creature that paralyzes powerful wizards (since he cannot be confined by normal means).

Dumbledore has fallen from grace; his part in the torturous upbringing of Harry Potter has been revealed. Child abuse is abhorrent in this AU society - Harry's parents have already been tried and sentenced to life imprisonment and loss of their magic. He awaits for his trial.

In the beginning of the scene, a gryphon materializes in his room. Dumbledore fears it is a construct of Harry Potter or Voldemort. He has just performed a distant mind control spell on Kingsley, compelling him to assassinate Harry.

Instead, the creature is the living embodiment of Light magic: and Dumbledore is a Light Lord, one of only twenty-eight lords and ladies of magic in the world.

The Light has come to deliver judgement: Dark Lords may do whatever they want in service to the Dark; but Light Lords must respect the light's tenets.

/“You changed,” said the gryphon. “You began to make sacrifices. That would not have sufficed to change your good intentions to twisted ones, if they had been sacrifices that you made yourself. But you asked them of others. You bent their wills with tactics that any Light Lord should have scorned. A true Lord of Light has no need of compulsion to enforce his will, nor deceptions and subterfuge and glamours to make others believe that which is not true.”/

/Albus was sure now that this apparition had come from Harry. The words about free will proclaimed it---they were not words that Tom would have used---and so did the thick disdain for his use of compulsion./

/“And even now you doubt me,” said the gryphon. “Even now you think this is a falsehood. You have fallen so far into yourself that you have lost the ability to distinguish between truth and lies. Only a short time ago, you were desperate. Do you remember that? You were convinced that you needed to destroy the vates. And now, you think that you are glad that you did not succeed, because you believe you can still control him. Your thoughts run and flow like water, molding themselves around you, so that you can think anything rather than think that you are wrong.”/

The whole chapter is marvelous, managing a solemn, dramatic tone that wouldn't be out of place in a novel of the highest caliber. But the last line especially is chilling to the extreme - it's such deep insight into human nature. Being unwilling to admit that you are wrong is a trait of most human beings. It is a learned behavior, and children (and adults) struggle with it all their lives. And all of us have met people who never learned, who are constantly shifty, who can't be reached by discussion, who won't ever admit their mistakes even to themselves - and this thought experiment, of taking this flaw and giving it to one of the most powerful wizards in the world... here lies Dumbledore, once lauded hero, now paving the way to hell with his own good intentions, dropped from grace, reduced to almost nothing and in almost Shakespearean fashion he has /only himself to blame/.

/“I have come because I think now that there is no chance you will ever change,” said the gryphon. It moved forward, its feathers rippling like light on water. “I waited on opportunity after opportunity for redemption, and you have never taken any of them. The Dark does not care what its Lords do in its name. I care for mine. You have lost the right to call yourself a Light Lord. Even cornered, you do not admit the cornering. Even presented with proof of your wrong, you do not admit the wrong. And that is not what a Light Lord should do. A Light Lord must see.”/

/The gryphon bowed its head, clenched its beak on what seemed a corner of the air, and ripped his ability to practice Light magic away./

/Albus felt the comfort, the center of his life, the warmth that beamed in the center of his chest and which he always reached for instead of Dark Arts, blaze and then fade. Frantically, he groped for it, a purely internal movement, like the race of his thoughts. He could still do magic, there was no doubt of that; his power was still there. But he found that he could not remember the incantations for Light spells. He could not remember the words that would have framed them, nor the will that would have driven them in the proper direction. He was like someone deaf for years, who could not remember what voices sounded like, though he knew that voices had once existed for him./

/Nothing could have taken the ability to perform Light magic from him---/

/But the Light itself./

And the axe falls.


** Potter Vs Paradox

To Ron's brief relief, they didn't find a present from Lillian Moon. They did find one from Malfoy though, which soured both their moods. The accompanying letter pompously proclaimed that he was sending his good friend and cousin Weasley a strange and wondrous rare item that he was sure no Weasley had ever seen and would be highly valued in their House.

Wrapped up in multiple layers of fancy fabric and parchment was a single Galleon.

** From *Seventh Horcrux*:

I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.

--------------

I smirked. "So, you wish to join me. Your foresight is commendable, and I assure you that -- should you choose to be my minion -- I shall allow you a sliver of my eventual glory."

Malfoy sputtered in indignation. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys are not minions."

--------------

Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

--------------

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

--------------

Dumbledore was a far greater dark lord than I could ever hope to be. He was fifty steps ahead of everyone else, so far ahead that -- by the time his plans came to fruition -- everyone involved had already died. My only hope was to throw him off balance by planning no steps ahead.

--------------

Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.

--------------

"You're going to regret that name in a few years," I said, "and I'm the real Lord Voldemort. You're just my horcrux."

Diary sneered. "You're Lord Voldemort? No, I think I'm Voldemort."

.....

"You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man."

The Weasley girl smirked. "Of course, you could always join me. I might let you rule at my feet -"

"Avada Kedavra," I said, pointing my wand at the diary. The Weasley collapsed as the book glowed green and the soul inside screamed. The Horcrux was destroyed. Or released, or something like that.

It was a necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around.

--------------

Dumbledore appeared troubled. "My boy, just how many times did you put your name in?"

"Oh, three hundred or so. A lot bounced off the rim, so it was difficult to keep track," I admitted.

--------------

"Yes, exactly, and I won," I said. "In fact, I'm the only one who brought his hostage back at all...whichever one she was."

"Ginevra Weasley," Dumbledore said.

I shook my head, dismayed by their ridiculous expectations. "How was I supposed to guess that? We aren't even friends."

Some distance across the grounds, a still-dripping Ginevra said, "We will be!"

I shivered. This was beginning to remind me uncomfortably of the Bellatrix situation. "And I'm not sure why you think it's my responsibility to protect everyone. It's your competition. You should have expected I would do something like this.

--------------

"Obviously," she huffed. "I'm just threatening to report that she's an illegal animagus. I also kept her in a bottle for a while."

I frowned. "For how long?"

"A couple of days," Hermione said.

"Did you feed her?" I asked.”

Hermione paled. "It didn't really occur to me."

"You gave her water at least..." I said.

"Um..."

I have a great distaste for most forms of torture. My only exception to this is Crucio, which is much cleaner and does not have as many long-lasting side effects. Well, unless the victims are driven insane. I rarely kept prisoners long enough to reach that point, however, and opted to kill as often as possible. Further, I sought to never leave a child orphaned for more than a few minutes.

#+begin_quote
  “The Headmaster's beliefs weren't conjured-on-the-spot platitudes. You knew he meant every word that he said. Dumbledore's word was as certain as the money in Gringotts, as definite as the stars in the sky, and as enduring as the castle I'm looking at right now. That is what Albus Dumbledore stood for. If he were here right now, he would encourage all of us to realize our potential. He would say to look for greatness, not in the amount of money in our vaults and not in the spell books we have on our shelves. No, he would smile and say that true greatness comes only from within; it is measured not in power, but in lasting friendships and good deeds. He would challenge us to find the greatness that lives within each of us. That is the currency our Headmaster most coveted, and that is why his departure leaves the world a poorer place.”

** linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita) has so many passages that left me kind of speechless. They can get a little purple prose-y at times, but I think the author has an amazing talent for descriptions. Here's a particularly beautiful passage:

"Winter had left already and spring was heavy in the air: there, in the damp mist that rose up from the bushes and shone golden in the early sunshine; here, in the quiet birdsong among the old trees.

On some days life and everyone in it choked her and she needed to get away for some time. Away from school, her responsibilities- away even from Tom- or should she say, especially from Tom? His possessiveness smothered her at times.

Minerva wandered along the half-hidden paths that led her deeper into the forest. Surrounding her was the heavy, rain-damp smell of the old oak-trees and beeches.

On a clearing, she stopped and marvelled at the patches of sunlight that lit up the mossy ground.

When she craned her neck, she found herself gazing up along the bark of gargantuan trees that must have been there long before her birth. At the tops, the little structures of the branches nearly seemed to become one with the milky blue sky.

She turned to her right and nearly gasped at the spectacle taking place right in front of her.

From the treetop down to its roots that sunk into the mossy ground the entire tree seemed to be glowing, sparkling, gleaming in the spring light. The sun's rays were caught on its orange-hued leaves, illuminating them like dancing flames caught upon the dark branches that were covered with dew drops.

The dew drops, on the other hand, gleamed like a world of rainbows captured in a myriad of glass shards. Webs crafted by miniscule artists were also made visible in an ethereal golden glow, spanning across the ground. Minerva marvelled at them and at this moment and then stepped into that magical world, closing her eyes to hold her face into the warm sunlight.

It was silent, no birdsong could be heard; only the crackling of branches and leaves, there in the sunlit solitude.

And for a moment, all was perfect.

Life was the most beautiful thing she had ever encountered."

"I'll catch up to you, Cedric," I said and crossed the floor towards my father.

He regarded me silently for a moment and then his eyes fell upon the crucifix around my neck.

"I was under the impression that you despised religion."

"People change, father."

There was a brief uncomfortable pause.

"You think you can manage this?" he asked finally

"Yes."

"Well I never doubted your courage," He regarded me for a moment with something like sadness and then reached out an arm which I shrugged off. A look of hurt flushed over his face. "Harry-"

"No," I interjected sharply. "You're going to say something like good luck, or I love you, or I'll see you on the other side. You've never wasted platitudes on me before, so don't fucking start now."

"You've become a great man," he said, his face suddenly flushed with anger. "But you've always been an awful son."

I stood for a moment, flabbergasted at what he'd just said to me. Then I bit back the angry retort that came shook my head and turned away from him.

"Harry," he called after me and though I didn't stop, it didn't make his parting words any less heartbreaking. "It was your damn fault, Harry."

** Beginning of Chapter 12 of linkffn(Dear Order by SilverWolf7007)

#+begin_quote
  A temporary truce had been called over the next two days in order for everyone to organize the procuration of birthday presents, wrap them (or have someone else wrap them, in several cases), and send them off into the darkness.

  On Harry's sixteenth birthday the Anti-Elmer Squad and the Defenders of the Camel resumed warfare and the Tea Club reclaimed the kitchen. Leadership of the Religious Squirrels had been transferred from Luna to Kingsley, and Molly was making sure that all three factions received regular deliveries of sandwiches and pumpkin juice.

  Luna, having abandoned the Religious Squirrels early on in the day, had taken to sitting mysteriously still in the corner of the kitchen and staring blankly at the wall with a vague smirk. Occasionally, she would chuckle. When asked, she had assured the Tea Club that she was 'quite fine, thank you', and seeing as she was eating regularly and taking bathroom breaks they let her be.

  The next day Luna rejoined the Religious Squirrels just in time to assist with a raid on the Defenders of the Camel that nearly resulted in Elmer being camel-napped. Luckily Bill intercepted Charlie and Neville just in time to prevent them making off with the animal and the Squirrels were forced to retreat. Luna chose to have Kingsley remain their leader, as he was having entirely too much fun to give up the position without, as she put it, 'sulking away the rest of the war'.

  At around seven that evening, Molly enlisted the rest of the Tea Club to assist her in locating everyone in the building and bringing them into the kitchen for 'a proper dinner' (using force, if necessary).
