Hey guys, I've got a friend who tagged me in a fb post about what some characters dressing up as each other would be like and I told him that things like this were fairly common. I'm blanking on things to recommend other than the eighth year by holz, I'm trying to get him into fanfic so preferably a one shot or crack!fic maybe and we can work toward other stuff.
