I just finished reading Harry Potter and the Last Chance (Which is a response to Reptilia28's challenge) and I loved the concept. I was wondering which were considered the best ones that also respond to this challenge. If you don't know, Reptilia28's challenge is the following:

"STORYLINE:

*) Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.

*) Harry's Death (who can have a human name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting perilously close to getting this particular one fired.

*) When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl...") and lived to be a centennial age. But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.

*) Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.

*) Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.

REQUIREMENTS:

*) Harry must have died at least three times before this one

*) The memory keeping contract must be included

*) Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant

*) Obviously, must be H/Hr

*) Have fun

OPTIONAL:

*) Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises"


** - linkffn(A Fair Life by Rtnwriter) ... fem!Harry (with femslash Harmony), decently written, some scenes with relations to homosexuals which make me wonder, how could it be written by somebody who supposedly supports gays.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin) ... nice Harmony take over Prefect duties after completely negligent Ron/Lavender.
- linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) ... really nice with good Petunia, good Snape (with Slytherin Phoenix!), Lady Hermione Graynge (tearing Malfoy as fake pretender to nobility)
- linkffn(The best laid plans by Lowten) ... very original start (one of few who use Hermione's Polyjuice accident for something interesting), but it turns into rather plain vanilla Harmony.

Each of them has some interesting idea, but each of them without an exception have the worst signs of bad Harmony story: extensive Dumbledore and Ron bashing for example.

  Harleen squirmed in her seat, her cheeks flushing a brilliant red as her eyes darted about and her fingers plucked nervously at the potions vials in the box in front of her. "Uh... i-if you're asking if I'm at-attracted to girls... well... well, I'd have to say yes," she admitted meekly. "But I swear, I would never-"

  "I have already said that I believe you, Miss Potter, let us let that lie. This does present a small problem however. The boys and girls dorms are separate in order to help discourage any... explorations amongst the students, however there is no such consideration for students of the same gender."
#+end_quote

Now, I understand her point and I understand why are boys and girls dormitories separated, but tell me where exactly does this leave gays and lesbians to sleep? On the top of the Astronomy Tower? McGonagall then doesn't follow on her talk and she is quite an enabler of the Harriet/Hermione explorations (I mean really, you give Harriet this spiel and then you put them two alone in a dorm, really? Of course, I know, that the story is a soft porn, so they need to be alone, but it doesn't make much sense in the logic within the story), but still I don't understand what are the policies of McGonagall towards gays/lesbians. If there are thousand students at Hogwarts at any given time, it is statistically probable that there are around forty of them homosexual. Did McGonagall ever met another one?

  Harleen nodded and took out the box of potions from the inside pocket of her robes, expanding it as Minerva continued speaking. "Miss Brown... from what I was able to gather in speaking to her while you showered and dressed this morning... it appears that her primary concern in sharing a dorm with you is that she is uncomfortable sharing a space with someone that she thinks might look at her in a... less than platonic manner. Now, while I do not believe that you would ever use your situation to take advantage of any of the other girls, I fear I must ask if there is any truth to Miss Brown's concerns?"
#+end_quote

This is the context of the quote. The reason they're discussing the dorm arrangements is because another student is uncomfortable, not purely because Harleen is a lesbian. So this:

#+begin_quote
  Now, I understand her point and I understand why are boys and girls dormitories separated, but tell me where exactly does this leave gays and lesbians to sleep?
#+end_quote

doesn't really present much of an argument, since we really can't say that Lavender would be uncomfortable if it wasn't for Harleen's change in sex.

#+begin_quote
  I mean really, you give Harriet this spiel and then you put them two alone in a dorm, really?
#+end_quote

In all fairness, she essentially says that she trusts them not to do anything inappropriate, even if she encourages the relationship.

Anyway, I don't think the fact that the author possibly didn't put too much thought into the history of gays and lesbians at Hogwarts means that they're not supportive of gay people, just that they didn't put a lot of world-building into the history of gay people at Hogwarts. However, I'll act as if they did and play author's advocate.

Like I pointed out before, the main reason for the dorm change is because Lavender is uncomfortable with Harleen because of her transformation. It's possible that, normally, students don't have much of a problem with their gay or lesbian dorm mates assuming that they've been friends for a few years before they start becoming more interested in romantic/sexual relationships. So they'd have a friendship established before they come out as gay or lesbian, and it isn't seen as deceitful like it is in the Lavender/Harleen case seen here. However, if a student does take issue with it, then there's already a solution presented within the story: to give them their own dorm room, open to be shared with friends if they want. They aren't completely isolated or anything since the common room is still open for them to see everyone, it just provides them with a private room to change and sleep.

There's also the fact that many not-straight people stay in the closet, or at least don't talk openly about their sexuality. Especially considering the fact that this takes place in the 90s, and we don't really know how canon wizarding culture views those people. This is somewhat supported by the fact that Hermione is a lesbian but never tells anyone. However, if it's generally an accepting culture, then this would only be a discussion that needs to happen occasionally when someone is uncomfortable, rather than for every gay/lesbian student. If it's generally an unaccepting culture, then they would be more likely to stay in the closet, which, again, would make this a rare discussion needed to be taken on a case-by-case basis. I also don't think presenting the culture as not generally accepting of gay and lesbian people means you're not supportive of gays and lesbians, since it's a certain culture's views and not your's. The author is clearly accepting and supportive and shows that type of culture to be wrong.

As for where would you keep the gay and lesbian kids, if no one takes issue with it why would they need to be moved? The seperation of boys and girls makes sense given the vast majority of the students will be straight, and not comfortable with the opposite sex seeing them or sleeping in the same room as them, but unless other students are uncomfortable then there's no real reason to move the gay and lesbian kids to a completely different dorm. That would kind of defeat the purpose of separating them anyway. Moving all the gay kids to one dorm and lesbians to another would potentially encourage the behavior the separation is trying to discourage, as you pointed out in Harleen/Hermione's case. Though McGonagall does seem to trust those two particular students to not be inappropriate.

Anecdote: From my own experiences, in high school I was bi and in the closet, and there were two guys in my year that I remember who were openly gay. None of us had to use a different locker room than the rest of the guys. If one of us were staring at the other guys or making comments about them then I'm sure we would have at least had a talking to, but as far as I'm aware no one was bothered by it.

So, I don't really see what the big deal is. The author might have just not put a lot of thought into how gays and lesbians are treated at Hogwarts, but even with the info we have I don't think there's any evidence to really say "how could this be written by someone who supposedly supports gay people?" If the rest of the story shows support towards gay people and this one section just isn't fleshed out very well, that's not really a fair reason to question if they're really supportive or not.

****** I don't want to drag this thread longer, because one throw-away comment is not worthy of it, but just two points:

I didn't say that the author is a homophobe, just when writing femslash it was surprisingly not well thought through, but my conclusion is that this is one of 99% of all slash/femslash stories which are not the authentically interested in the LGBT situation, but it just a soft-porn using homosexuality for titillation. (I am not a gay myself, but I was very touched by the raw authenticity of linkffn(12507814) ... it is about the transgender Harry, so we actually still don't know what orientation he/she is, but it was written by somebody who is transgender him/herself and it rings as real).

So, no I was not questioning his support for homosexuals but how much thought he put into their world-building.

******* That's fair enough. I assumed based on your statement that the author was a self-proclaimed supporter of gay rights or something, and that the story made you question that (I didn't think you were saying they were homophobic, just not really supportive of LGBT like you implied). And like I said, it could very well be that the author just didn't think too hard on the world-building of that portion of their story. I definitely think the story has quite a few flaws, but I enjoy discussion/debate so I figured I'd defend the author since I didn't really see anything wrong with it. Personally I wouldn't call it soft-porn (granted I haven't read it in a while so I might be forgetting some stuff)- there's a bit of sexual content (I'd say PG-13 level) but not enough for me to call it that. It might turn to that, but I'll reserve judgement until later on.

​

TL;DR: I don't heavily disagree with your argument, I just enjoy discussion/debate and found what you were saying lacking in evidence. The story is definitely flawed in quite a few ways, and I agree that if the author really wanted to make an in-depth story about gay relationships in the wizarding world they should have done better in the world-building.

******** Soft porn is difficult to define, because it is somehow in-between category. On the one hand the proportion of sexuality v real story is too skewed (how much story other than Hermione thinking about Harleen or doing something about it, there really is? Not that much, and whatever there is, is mostly just a rewrite of the books; similar case is linkao3(4876630), where the real story is so well hidden beneath smut that it is hard to find it), on the other hand it is not linkffn(11396276) or linkao3(21206021), where story evaporates completely.
