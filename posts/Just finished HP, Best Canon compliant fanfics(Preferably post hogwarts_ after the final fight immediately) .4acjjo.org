*** I second this! Northumbrian is hands down my favourite fic author. If you've a lot of time, I'd recommend reading through all his content (in chronological order, unless you want to be like me a give yourself a billion spoilers). It's /all/ canon-compliant, and the characters stay pretty true to canon too, if you take into account that they've grown up for the later stuff.

** Firstly, straight after the battle I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo]]. It gets a little silly towards the end but is by far the most realistic version of how people would act afterwards I've seen.

Also, anything by Northumbrian (posted about above by Inquisitor) who has something like 80 stories that follow the lives of the main characters post Hogarth, keeping canon.

Lastly, sorry to self-promote but you might be interested in my DH from Ginny's pov fiction called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]. It keeps canon as best as I could, and gets recommended here from time to time.

Hope this helps, I'm sure I'll think of more by the time I get home!

  Deep within the Department of Mysteries, a clandestine unit dedicates itself to the destruction of Voldemort's surviving forces in the aftermath of the Wizarding War. This group, lead by Harry Potter, does not officially exist. But for those who fight the darkness that threatens to engulf their world, it has a name, heard only in the shadows: Operation Wrath of Merlin.

** Here, take this:

“Cauterize” (linkffn(4152700)); “My Master's Bride” (linkffn(6435018)); “The Elite” (linkffn(5190766)); “The Sky Is Orange” (linkffn(8385017)); “On Rags and Other Things” (linkffn(7480987)); “If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd've Baked a Cake” (linkffn(8637362)); “The Four Laws of Golpalott” (linkffn(3991871)).

They're not all post-Hogrwarts, but I believe they are all canon-compliant. They're also all fairly short stories, which is why there are quite a few there.

The story will get quite non compliant quite quickly but from the information we have at hand, it's very much canon compliant.

The First Day by little0bird. Literally covers the first day after the battle. And the author has many more stories covering the same time period of the fic from different characters (Ron and Hermione's POV is in Tree Houses and Daisy), all the way up to Questions and Answers which covers the children going to Hogwarts and realizing who their parents really are (all the cousins, not just Harry and Ron's kids).

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** For canon compliance I would recommend linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness).

*** Ugh, no. Not canon-compliant in the least, and the female characters in particular are offensively written. And God knows who the protagonist is supposed to be, but it's sure as hell /not/ Neville Longbottom. Plus Seamus' 'Oirish' dialect is just bloody painful. The prose clogs its own pipes with a million unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, and everything is melodramatic and everything hurts.

**** Huh. Call me a teenager but I really liked the story. Then again, on the other hand, I mostly skimmed it through, partially recognising that the prose wasn't that hot. The melodramaticism I found very nice, giving the Second Wizarding War a far heavier and harder tune than HP ever managed to.

By the way, can you give a short answer as to your opinions on why the female characters are particularly offensively written?

*** Worst story ever, full of OOC developments and illogical plot devices.

**** I agree it's not fantastic and while it was the first fic I ever read I've never been back to it, which probably says a lot, but the one thing I remember is that it clings to the canon plotline as hard as it can. Maybe I should re-read now that I've been at this a while.
