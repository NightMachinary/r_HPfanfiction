So there have been loads of recs for people going back in time to the marauders era and I've loved reading some of them but it got me wondering.

I've never seen any marauder gets transported forward in time fics. Any of the marauders would be interesting to read. Do these exist? Are there by good ones you would recommend?


** I've never read it because I'm always looking for "Hermione goes back and meets the young Marauders," but I've come across this fic many times and it's quite popular. I've read a few of ShayaLonnie's fics and she's an incredible author.\\

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

  When Sirius Black fell through the veil, he didn't fall to his death, he fell to his future. But it's not his- at least, it shouldn't be. What can they do with an ex-convict who's been legally declared dead for the last sixteen years?

** If you're cool with slash (secondary IMO to the adventure aspects of this fic) Linkao3(979182) Cartographers Craft is great! It's a DH - AU where 16 yr old sirius comes back somehow out of the marauders map. There is a lot to like about this fic - really great writing, interesting characters who are well-developed, a slow building and believable love story etc. Not too creepy Sirius/Harry because there wasn't an age-gap between them. Also the search for the horcruxes was believable and interesting. This is a really nice fic and I highly recommend it.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** Also, for a great het one of these, check out Choices by Aebbe.

The basic premise is that Lily Luna Potter time travels back 47 years and meets Sirius and James. She finds out she cant change the past and has a brief romance with Sirius and then travels back into 2028. But THEN Sirius time travels forward 47 years and a bunch of the other next gen characters time travel too and exciting adventures happen.

ALSO this fic works (nearly) completely within canon which I love. I think it is so creative when authors can use the events from canon but change our perception of them to tell a different story.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)
