We've all read fics which start out great only to end in disappointment. Are there any with endings so bad you'd rather the author left them unfinished?

*** I agree. The story would have been way better if they did not end up back in the future.

*** One of the writers stopped after chapter 15 (Claihm Solais). 7 paragraphs after that I dropped the fic.

It was really jarring to read how not only the continuity seemed to have disappeared, but the characters all of a sudden didn't seem alive anymore. After reading that everyone seems to dislike how this fic ended I feel like that writer stopping was probably the reason.

Considering this, I think you could argue that the fic /is/ unfinished. It was abandoned after chapter 15. before that it was a stellar fic and I like to honor that by thinking of that the actual fic "delenda est".

**** The latest review the other day was on chapter 15 and said that they would rather kill themselves then finish the story.

***** I had a feeling that if I expressed myself that way here on the sub not many people would have come across my comment after all the downvotes.

But thank you for sharing.

** The Weapon (Revised) by Qtani (mobile so author may be spelt incorrectly). The fic was building into an interesting depiction of war and then performed a rocks fall everyone dies ending.

** I forgot the title, but I recently read a pretty good Daphne/Harry story from her point of view that had a horrendously bad epilogue.

*** Well, this one isn't from Daphne's POV, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]] should have quit after Chapter 5 or maybe even 4.

How much of a slog does this thing become? Well, the author even has a line in Chapter 6 where they mention how anti-climactic the whole thing is, and by that point, there's still another two chapters to go.

*** By Marshall Angmar? Awww man I really liked that story. I will admit the Hogwarts years were much better than the politicking but it was still a solid read

**** True, I really lived both the Hogwarts years as the politicking. However, I felt that the ending was rushed. I mean it happened so fast, you can barely understand anything. And the ending itself doesn't make any sense
