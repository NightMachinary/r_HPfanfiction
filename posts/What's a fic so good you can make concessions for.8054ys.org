As in, what are some elements you would usually hate in a Harry Potter fanfiction, but this one story is so good that you can look past them?

For me, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by Murkybluematter) and its sequels. I mean.... Fem!Harry? Smart 11-year olds?? So many OCs??? MAGICAL CORES????? (and even the mentioned possibility of Mpreg, which I absolutely despise under most circumstances). Like, how did this become one of my favorite series of all time?

And I was surprised by how much I loved linkao3(No Glory by ObsidianPen), considering I generally avoid explicit sexual content, HarryMort, and unfinished stories.


** Poor magical cores, so much hate....

Anyway, I dislike way too many characters from canon so it is a huge challenge for an author making any of those tolerably enough for me to read.

I remember being highly surprised when I read "Remus Lupin, PI", as he is one of those characters that I heavily dislike, nothing good was said or shown of him in canon, but this fanfiction fixes most of the problems I had with canon Lupin.

These kids totally don't behave like children, but I fully embrace the hand-waving away with Occlumency, because it's totally worth it for everything that happens.

The "these children are too smart"-criticism is mostly stupid anyways. Most fiction that involves children has them being very remarkable for good reason: Realistic children are annoying (see Anakin in Phantom Menace). I don't want to be annoyed, ergo, I don't want realistic children. [Not to beat a dead horse, but same goes for Ron: "Buuut he's a realistic teenager, they are annoying and stupid sometimes!" - "Yeah well, I'm not interested in a documentary right now and I'm still annoyed?! How does this help?"]

*** Saying that the "too smart" criticism is mostly stupid is plain wrong. It's never as simple as "they are smarter than the average child of their age," at least in my experience.

Most people don't complain about that when children are remarkable or competent, since most characters tend to be competent at one thing at the very least or when they act slightly older than they are (most fiction does this to a degree), but when it completely breaks their Suspension of Disbelief.

Breaking SOD is a big no-no in any story, although it should also take into account what people expect and what promises the story does. For example, many actions in the first books are forgiven because it's a middle-grade novel and not YA or plain fantasy.

There's only so much you can hand-wave. Maybe if you wanted people to take it seriously, instead of making an AU with 11 year-olds playing politics with the "Wizengamot," you could make an AU in which they are old enough not to laugh or cringe while reading it.

Besides, many of those fics tend to make children not only in a way that is OOC with canon, but also not consistent with their background--really, how many stories have Harry abused for 10 years and as soon as he gets in the train he starts talking like a politician about to give a speech? A lot of authors don't really take into account how just because the protagonist is smart doesn't mean he has /experience/, or that the character wouldn't act certain way given their background.

/rant

And that's why I almost never read fics that start below fourth year--plus many other pitfalls that fics can fall into because of it.

But that's one of the central conceits in the story - that those kids have been raised /their entire lives/ to take their places as part of the political process while still in school. These are kids that spend their formative years at their father's knee learning /realpolitik/. With that in mind, it would be odd for them to behave any other way.

4) [[/spoiler][Harry's original plan to ingratiate himself with Luna was to rescue Mrs. Lovegood... but he's completely forgotten about that and she is still alive... because Luna saved her herself.]]

5) [[/spoiler][The Centaurs mention one too many time jumps than they should have, so SOMEONE came back that we don't know about yet.]]

6) [[/spoiler][Harry is able to train Ginny because of that special necklace that allows him to access her dreams... but he didn't make it, he FOUND it. He FOUND a necklace shaped like a lightning bolt which allows him to do exactly what he needed to do to make Ginny stronger? That absolutely REEKS of a setup by another time traveler.]]

*** With the "super-magic" stuff, whether or not it's combat related, I'm of two minds. On one hand, it's almost never done well and often feels like it's just thrown into the setting. They're usually just a shortcut to superpowers of some kind. Fanon seeping in and being accepted as canon can also be annoying.

On the other hand, JK Rowling introduced some new form of magic or legendary item in basically every book, beyond what would be "normal" for a magic school. 1st book had standard magic stuff (i.e. wands, brooms) but also the Philosopher's Stone and a legendary invisibility cloak; 2nd book had the Sword, the Chamber, the Diary; 3rd book introduced Azkaban, Dementors, and time travel, etc. FB went in with more beasts (most of which were previously mentioned at some point, but actually fleshed out there) and the Obscurus. In the same vein, shouldn't fanfiction actually strive to introduce new magical contraptions that exist beyond what we've been shown, both for daily life and on a world-bending scale?

  "What do you mean Poppy doesn't know she's Potter! Why didn't you bloody well tell her?" James snarled at his former headmaster. He couldn't believe that no one had explained it to her in five years at Hogwarts. Lily spoke up from his side, "What...what happened to her while we were gone? How did she get those scars?" She whispered. (AU with humour, angst and romance)

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** Linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW)

Well paced and believable romance involving marriage contracts. Some say it's way too drawn out, but I like how long the romance takes to occur.

Linkffn(You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki64)

Tries to redeem the actions of the Malfoys. It had me crying, I actually cared what happened. A great and realistic portrayal of the other side during the 2nd Wizarding war. Neville/OC romance that is incredibly well written.
