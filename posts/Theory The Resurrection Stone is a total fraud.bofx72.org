** Eh, I think this runs contrary to the established theme of the Hallows as powerful but flawed magical objects. The other hallows do perform their intended goal, just not in a complete way. So it would be odd for the resurrection stone to be a complete fraud, rather than similarly partially successful.

The Elder Wand is a very powerful wand, it just isn't unbeatable.

The Cloak of Invisibility does make you invisible, it just isn't immune to all detection.

So similarly: the Resurrection Stone does bring back the dead, but it doesn't bring them all the way back. We know it brings people back as shades who long to return to death, rather than truly resurrecting a person to their body.

Also, in DH Dumbledore states that Grindelwald would have been able to create an army of inferi with the resurrection stone. So it definitely has some power to resurrect.
