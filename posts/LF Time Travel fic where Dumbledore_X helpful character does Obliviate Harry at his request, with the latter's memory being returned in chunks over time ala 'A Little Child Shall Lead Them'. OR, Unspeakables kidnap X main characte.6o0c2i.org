Most of the Peggy Sue fics I see have the time traveller not telling anyone about their time travel, on account of not wanting a meddling do-gooder Dumbledore to oblivate them or not wanting to be kidnapped by Unspeakables or whatnot...

...But can I have one where Harry (assuming he's the time traveller) does get obliviated, but it's at his own request so he can have some normal years at Hogwarts while Dumbledore uses his various offices to get the legwork (tracking down Horcruxes, apprehending Peter Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr, giving the Dursleys a stern talking to, etc)? And possibly he gets the memories of his original years back later?

...Although come to think of it, a 'Just Harry' going through a normal school life while a background character does all the plot relevant stuff would probably be boring...I wonder if there's any that go 'Dumbledore was assassinated, McGonagall brings Harry to a special red pensive in the late Headmaster's office, Harry looks into it and gets all his memories of the future back'.

--------------

Also, looking for another variation on the whole 'why time travellers don't let it slip' thing; one of the students /isn't/ a time traveller, they're just smart and/or mature (Hermione Granger, maybe?), but they get kidnapped by Unspeakables who think they're a time traveller...who knows, maybe that's what happened to Sally-Anne Perks.

** Might as well just bring back another character and show the story from their perspective. Reading about 'just harry' sounds kind of boring and i don't think i could respect a character that would let someone delete a large chunk of his memories/life/personality just so he could do 11 year old stuff.

A non timetraveler kidnapped sounds like a very short story cause it should be pretty easy to verify that they dont have any meta knowledge.

*** How about this: Harry's old personality and memories start bleeding through, not enough to get a clear picture, but enough to make him paranoid. He distances himself from his friends and starts scheming against Dumbledore, who he suspects is manipulating him. Acting on his misguided beliefs, he does something terrible (murder?) only for Dumbledore to restore his memories, but at that point, it's too late.

For bonus points, write it as a typical cliche manipulative!Dumbledore story, only making the big reveal at the end.
