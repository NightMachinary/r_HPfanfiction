You know what that means....

​

"F u Dumb-as-a-door! I knew that you were stealing my money to give to Ron to be my best friend and spy on me for you. I also know that you are trying to fix a marriage contract with Ginny and I.

But I, Lord Harrison(wtf) James Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Hogwarts-Windsor-Malfoy-Evans found your dastardly nefarious plot with the help of my beautiful, chocolate-eyed, girlfriend Hermione.

Now I'm going to do what every normal teenager would do and sit in a boring court for 6 hours to pass and utilize ancient laws for no good reason to make your day more miserable.

Also, me and my good goblin friend Griphook are going to go check my accounts, because that's what any 15 year old would do!"

** I used Clueful because I have legit seen that on like 5 different independent Harry fics.
