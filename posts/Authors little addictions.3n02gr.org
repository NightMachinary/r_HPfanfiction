Do you ever notice when you read stories from the same author that there is a commonality in all their stories? Perfect example is Lady Lanera she (I assume it's a female) always has Aurora Sinistra as a love interest for Severus. Sometimes Sinistra ends up taking over the bloody story. I swear she is addicted to this, it's in all the stories I see of hers and it's led me to not want to read hers anymore......bloody summaries trick me, I should know better.

Do you like the common element or has it lead you to never read (or at least be very, very wary) from that author again?


** I'm pretty certain I have obsessions I don't realize when I write, but I'm not sure what exactly I do. I already know in all of my unpublished stories, I work with an O/C that is part self-insert (though appearance is usually way different) and part "whatever personality fits the fic I'm going for."

However, since everything I write devolves into smut, intentionally or unintentionally, I will admit that I am /obsessed/ with the word *thrust*.

; ; I can't not put it in a fic. I just love it so much. It's such a good sex word. ^{^{don't}} ^{^{slay}} ^{^{me}}

** TheEndless7 uses the same OCs in all of his stories, and usually has them going through the same situations. Like, there's this Slytherin Beater named Titus Button in all of them, and he dates Tracey Davis, who is several years younger, in all of them. I find it to be more annoying than endearing, to be honest

** I haven't, but as an author myself, I can tell you we all have those things we constantly use because we love them. This could be a plot point, a phrase or a way of creating a story. Authors create stories because we love them, more so than the few who give the people what they want. So, you will always find a common thread between the stories of a single author, even the use of the same character.

*** I don't want to nitpick, I'm just curious if the little addictions are endearing or distracting. It was just something I thought of when I went to try a new Lady Lanera story, thinking it would be different and the opening bit was....then it all went to pot. Her addiction came sweeping in which turned me off. Here I am thinking, oh cool she is doing an after Battle of Hogwarts story, Snape will be dead, but gets vindicated....nope, happily married with kid to Sinsitra, WHY?!?!? I really should just stay away, but like an idiot, I forgot, did you ever forget, it happened to me.

**** No problem. I think it really depends on the reader/writing combination. Reuse of the same character in the same situation is extemely irritating to readers, and in general, unnecessary. I agree with that, but for people who like that situation, they eat it up. I think when it is a writing style, it is easier to see past, but when it is a situation al la Sinestra, it is irritating. Personally I haven't run into many writers who do this but I find authors who put the same character in the same situation for every story lazy and not entertaining to read.

** As a writer I've found myself coming up with certain explanations for why I write characters the way I do and having to carefully ration how many I use in a given story.

It's tempting to just throw every cool character detail you've thought up for, say, anxious-and-somehow-broken post-Voldemort Hermione into every story you write, but if you do you'll leave yourself either without cool character details or repeating yourself in your next story that jumps off from a similar place.

**** All authors have little topics and tropes they like and I think they're relatively aware of them. Our writing is a reflection of ourselves, things that interest us, things we may want to read. Not like the specific pet details mentioned in this thread, but more like overall themes and archetypes - writing crutches, too, that they rely on when they can't bother to write something better. It's quite fun to parody yourself.

My schtick is all about emotionally stunted heroines and overly emotional heroes, and my writing crutches include food-related metaphors and lists that come in threes. People notice my archetypes, but its only been in a positive way, in that it's a reason why they read my fics. I notice more myself, but that's an author's lens for you.

****** Oh, authors love talking about this crap. If you made this clear, you'd have essays all over here ;)

I write because there are certain stories I hardly ever see done well, stories I wish I had growing up. I had a hard time finding heroines I could relate to. My lead character tends to be a girl defined by her intelligence. I don't mean just a "smart girl." It's like the difference between Sherlock and Tony Stark; both are geniuses but only Sherlock's genius defines his personality, his relationships, and most importantly, /his flaws/. That's something I almost never see for female characters; I rant about it [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/82265005880/talk-to-me-about-the-dark-side-of-nerd-girl][here]] in more detail. Smart female characters always rub off as a male-fantasy version of the smart girl--too ideal and without agenda. I want to see smart heroines who struggle with their pride and cynicism and morality but are unashamed about who they are. Genuine, complicated conflicts.

And the emotional hero is an accidental result of that. They're good foils to my main characters, and fill the role that's usually handed to the lead female role--the love interest, the emotional heart, the moral compass.

So writing these archetypes is very important to me in that they brought me to writing in the first place, and I'll continue to write them in different ways. I've written anti-heroine who wields power with both relish and reluctance, but also a childish genius that no one takes seriously and a femme fatale whose allegiances are uncertain. There's so much to explore still, even though it's a common theme I've been writing for a long time.

**** I think he's talking more about the fact that a lot of stories will bring them together and then in the midst of Voldemort and everything else throw some minor problem at them that spirals into them either breaking up (temporarily) or being on the verge of doing so and then (usually) Harry making some grand gesture to save the relationship.

I'm not saying this doesn't happen in normal relationships but I've seen this stuff happen several times in one story. Once is alright but after that we can stop with the angst and concentrate on the actual story. Also the problem is never solved by them simply sitting down and talking it over like normal people, it's always some melodramatic explosion that makes little sense.
