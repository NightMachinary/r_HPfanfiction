which leads to muggleborn flunking their math and science class (except hermione)?

well, I've seen harry potter fic that twist the gravity because harry learned that the gravity acceleration is not 9.8 m/s^{Â².} I'm looking for fic where muggleborn is transmuting the material for their chemistry class, rearranged organ in their frog specimen in biology class (because they misremembered the organ placement/existence), and having their observation data in physics class match their theoretical calculation, even if it is wrong?

edit: forgot my physics class.

** Huh, I'm reminded of Arcanum again. That one game with the steampunk technology and the magic and the airship crash and stuff.

It's basically a description of three scientific experiments being driven awry by magic.
