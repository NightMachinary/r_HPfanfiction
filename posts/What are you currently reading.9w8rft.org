** I'm actually currently out of things to read. I'm up to date on all of my long long list of fav's, on ffn. I'm skimming this subreddit, the Naruto fanfic Sub and the Fanfic Sub looking for more.

I'm only on chapter 2, but I'm enjoying the writing style. It's definitely AU, though, bit the changes are interesting.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][Leave No Stone Unturned]] is a series of standalone stories. Some relate to each other and some don't, but they're all well written. I am in the second to last story currently. Remus has always been a favorite character, and I like getting to explore him here. Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow in perticular is a favorite of these stories - Remus and Hermione's intellectial conversation was brilliant - but I also liked the ones that explored Remus as a teacher. Some of the stories are dark, and deal with some heavy subjects, but I'm enjoying reading things that fill in some of the gaps from canon. (The story about Petunia was great - the author nailed her character IMHO.)

** Summer of the Phoenix, based on a rev here, which fills in some blanks about how the Order set up in Grimmauld Place. It's unusual for me to read a non AU gen fic but I'm enjoying it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1517816/1/The-Summer-of-the-Phoenix]]

** I'd recommend if you like AU(post OoTP) and actually bad-ass Horcruxes (At least on the same level of the Diary in matter of danger) A really fleshed out OC with interesting past and unique to the fic, definitely not a Mary Sue, considering she has several issues, from health to stubbornness, a more paranoid Harry but also stronger (there's a curve, he isn't remotely OP, but it is a lot stronger than canon as the fic goes on) and lovable Hermione and Weasleys (I gotta be honest, I really dislike Hermione's in general, even going as far as quitting or not reading a fic if she's a MC, but I absolutely loved this one, even if she's not a MC by any stretch of the imagination) a really well done Albus with close as possible to canon's personality but with more shit happening. A funny Snape and Harry being sassy and sarcastic with him. Tonks is absolutely hilarious and crazy, like pregnant-women-crazy, while trying to bag Remus, which that itself is funny. Remus is all-around great guy here though. No douchebag-wife-leaver Remus.

IDK, I loved this fic so much that I could sing praises to it till my carpal slaps me in the face. Also, Voldemort is way way way more evil and smarter than canon, and the war is actually global, and it has that feelling of chaos and desolation and its quite grim at times. But the romance is fantastic, so it balances out.

If I had to summarize this fic in one sentence, it would be, "The type of story that makes you miss the characters when its over"

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake. Dark Harry/OC - Rating for Mature scenes - AU after OotP

** Currently reading a bunch right now. I'm on chapter 40 of Delenda Est, book three (year two) of an Artemis Fowl crossover called King of Serpents, fourth year of SuperPotterLock, ch 23 of When Harry Met Wednesday, and ch 12 of an odd one called Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Also rereading the Weasley Girl series and the Lionsnake Chronicles.

My thoughts on each:

Delenda Est: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/]]

God damn. This one is a classic.

King of Serpents: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7581967/1/]]

Eh, scratches the itch for this particular cross (if anyone has a recommendation for a better one, I'm game)

SuperPotterLock: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8871828/1/]]

Man, this one likes to play with plots. Never seems to lose track of them though.

When Harry Met Wednesday: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11674317/1/]]

Never has murder been so satisfying.

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702269/1/]]

This one stumps me. I think Tom is going through an identity crisis.

Weasley Girl: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/]]

Interesting. The author certainly knows how to defy expectations.

Lionsnake Chronicles: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10179438/1/]]

This one comes off as a little "child-politics" for my liking, but Harry calls Snape "a bloody queen" at one point, so there's at least some good snark to look forward to.

** I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022404/1/The-Divide][The Divide]]. It is a next-gen OC-centric story focusing on identical twins, one of whom is magic. This is a great tragedy to them. The story is only just over halfway through their first year so far, but it's been interesting so far see them grapple with their abrupt separation from one another's sides and carving their own paths in their respective worlds. It also looks like it will only get more interesting as the twins' goal is to turn the non-magical one, magical. So they're looking in ways to do that and their attempts to do so will only become more fascinating as the years go on and they learn more and mature.

And The Snakes Start To Sing: Year One By floralandfading

Summary: The one where Draco isn't the biggest prat in the world and Harry doesn't hate Slytherins.

Slytherin AU ft. Anxious!Harry and Mentor!Snape

--------------

One of the best slytherin! Harry storys I read till now. Its taged as slash for possible sequels, but as this is a first year story, I also recomend to people that dont like slash, as this is great as a standalone story too. The author also doesent turn anyone evil or make Slytherins all love muggleborns. I also loved that the 11 year olds act like their age. Also the characters are, in my opinion, not too ooc and very belivable.
