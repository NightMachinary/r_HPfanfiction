I often see fics where he is a "war hero" but i feel it would be more complicated than that ... He did kill Dumbledore after all. And he did willingly become a death eater. Would the wizarding world really turn a blind eye to that because of his double agency?

Thoughts?


** I think dying was best for him. Harry, thanks to the protection he received from his mother and Dumbledore's views on love means Harry has a warped view on love. Voldemort was evil and irredeemable because he was incapable of feeling love supposedly. Therefore love means there is the potential for good. Harry has such a warped view on love that he thought Snape's creepy obsession with his mother meant Snape wasn't evil and instead had good inside him. That's not to say Snape didn't do good things for Harry but it doesn't make him a good person. The rest of the world wouldn't buy that.

To the rest of the world Snape is a petty horrible man. Anyone who had gone through Hogwarts with him as a teacher would have bad memories of the man. Remember, Snape didn't originally stop being a Death Eater because he thought being a Death Eater was bad, he went to Dumbledore because he put Lily as one of the Dark Lord's primary targets. He didn't so much pledge himself to doing good as hedge his bets. He asked Voldemort to spare her but didn't give a shit about James or Harry. If Lily had stepped aside and lived I don't think Snape cares about Dumbledore's lot too much. If it comes out that Snape was a Death Eater who's only redeeming feature was a creepy obsession with Harry's mum, then they don't see how that makes him a good person. He was a Death Eater and now a borderline stalker of a Death Eater. Snape wasn't a good person. An interesting character for sure but he was a dick of the highest order. Never forget that Neville suffered as much, if not more than Harry. Even if you could justify Snape's cruelty to Harry, which I can't, its impossible to justify it to Neville. If it happened to Neville it could easily have happened to other people. He brought Hermione to tears over her front teeth in fourth year in front of everyone. Him being a Death Eater wouldn't surprise anyone. People were tortured at Hogwarts while he was Headmaster, good luck telling the parents he was a good person.

I honestly think Darth Vader has a better chance at being a war hero after killing the Emperor for his son than Snape, and I think the chance for that is somewhere between remote and non-existent.

Edit: I want to add a bit more on why I think Dumbledore has warped views on love. The man was a great wizard, arguably a great man. I'd call him so. I would never say however, that he had the experience to talk about love. After his mother's death Dumbledore had to care for his sister, Aberforth suggests he wasn't happy with that. Dumbledore didn't love his sister until after she died. He didn't love his sister, he loved her memory. No matter what you think of his relationship with Grindelwald no matter how platonic you think it was, you can probably agree calling it dysfunctional would be an understatement. The person who understood him best either killed his sister, caused him to kill his sister or caused his brother to kill their sister. Then he became a Dark Lord who Dumbledore himself had to stop. From what we see in Canon Dumbledore is alone. He has always been alone. He speaks of love but he loves the idea of love but has no idea what it truly is. He can see its power, he is willing to believe in its power but he himself doesn't understand it. He shared his love of the idea of love with Harry but neither of them really knew what it was.

*** I disagree with your analysis, simply because the public would never have all that information that we have from the books and no-one would tell them.

Harry would do his best to portray Snape as a hero and ask for favours in the Ministry. Propaganda works (and the wizarding public isn't critical/savvy in the least)! There'd be lots of articles about how Snape tried to protect children in his year as headmaster, lots of talk about how he was a spy for Dumbledore all along and had to keep up appearances and how he has a golden heart under the creepy exterior. Add to that a press photo of Snape and Harry shaking hands or whatever and he'll be totally redeemed.

It's important to tie a neat bow around a conflict like this in the end. Everyone in the higher ups will be in support of this. Giving any appearance of "greyness" and outstanding issues is completely out of the question.

*** I disagree that Dumbledore doesn't understand love. Firstly, I think that he did love his sister - but he was a promising eighteen year old that seemingly had to put his dreams away to care for her. As someone that's been in that situation, I can tell you that the love is there - and so is the resentment. Both are present - the presence of the latter does not mean the absence of the former.

We honestly don't know what Dumbledore's relationship with Grindelwald was. It might have been closer to unrequited love than any actual relationship.

But finally, about Dumbledore always being alone - that's a false equivalency there. Just because someone is alone doesn't mean they don't know or experience love. It suggests that to be loved requires you to around people, but that's not true. I can be loved even if I live alone and mostly do my own thing. It also tends to place more unwarranted importance on romantic love.

*** Snape was a hero. Simple as that.

For years, he played spy, putting his life in the gravest danger. He asked for nothing in return. He was returning a debt -- but it wasn't a debt to anyone, it was a debt to himself.

As for the Eater Eater angle: he was a kid in a bad situation with a bad group of friends. He followed them down a dark path. In the eyes of everyone, he was rehabilitated.

And regarding the children: Snape willingly put himself up against a homicidal megalomaniac that would torture him mad and feed him to a snake. He didn't have to. Comparing that to "He made Hermione cry", and "But think of poor Neville," well boohoo. Poor Neville took it well. In fact, he grew up and slashed a snake's head off. Not bad for pedagogy.

Ok, I was facetious in that last sentence. But there is this erroneous thought in the fandom that Snape was a bad teacher. And -- in parts -- that's true. But, first of all, remember that Harry is not the most reliable of narrators. Second, think about this: if you have a problem with a teacher, what do you do? You contact the administration. If Snape was /that/ terrible, there should have been dozens of parents clamoring for Snape's removal. Were there? No. And besides, if he actually was a detriment to the school and the student body the Headmaster should have removed him from the position. Did he? No.

So there you go.

Snape would have been a hero.

Edit: Oh, and I just wanted to add that he probably saved a bunch of students during Voldemort's reign in Hogwarts, but that's speculation.

Both sides knew he was a spy. Voldemort thought Snape belonged to him, Dumbeldore knew Snape belonged to him. So long as both sides thought he was there he was safe. He was safer than normal members of the Order who Vodemort's lot would have actively tried to do away with.

Lies. he asked for Lily's life to be spared. He asked for help to clear up his mess.

#+end_quote

Harry was a kid in a bad situation. He didn't develop a fascination with dark magic. Snape knew what he was doing was wrong and did it anyway. Lily called him out on it, why was it different to call her a mudblood when he'd do it to others. He knew what he was doing. He didn't have an easy childhood but that's no excuse. Plenty of people have become good people after rough childhoods. I think its disgraceful that you are so willing to shift the blame. It massively undermines the hard work put in by good people from good backgrounds. A perosn who had a happy childhood's work for charity is still a good thing. They didn't have to do it, they choose to and they should be respected for that.

#+begin_quote
  You contact the administration
#+end_quote

You what? You contact Malfoy on the board of Governors, a known friend of Snape? You contact Dumbledore, the one who kept Snape out of prison. Snape had to work at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was the one protecting him. He was protected in the same way the Trewlawney was. He couldn't leave.

***** Those are good points. I disagree.

First, the claim that he was safer as a spy holds no ground. Voldemort was powerful. Voldemort could read minds. One slip up from Snape and he would have been Nagini's lunch, right after several weeks of insane torture. I'm not sure how that is in any way safer to the alternative.

Regarding Lily: that's true, he asked her to be spared, but I was actually referring to his actions /after/ her death. After she died, he had no obligations. He didn't /have/ to protect Harry. He could just leave. Run away. Be free and live his life. He didn't. He stayed.

Now, about bad childhoods: plenty of people with them become good after assistance/help/rehabilitation. We have a social support network that -- flawed as it is -- which is aimed at getting people on the right track. Snape had nothing. He got by on his strengths and the only people in school that we know accepted him were the young pureblood death eaters. The forces of "good", so to say, bullied him mercilessly -- and almost managed to murder him, too.

Finally, the original question was how he'd be viewed by the public at large. You brought up his competency as a teacher to answer that. I'm merely pointing out that a large percentage of the student body didn't seem to actually have that huge of a problem with him, otherwise, yeah, he'd be gone. The fact that you bring up Malfoy just proves my point. The Malfoys supported him, he was obviously good to Draco. And to, probably, many others, who'd continue to see him...not very negatively in the aftermath of the war.

******* Lockhart was /perceived/ as competent, though. This was based on his fame and popularity. Over time, it would have eroded, however. In fact, he probably would have been removed soon; the incompetency wouldn't stand, no matter how many books he'd written. The faculty was already fed up with him.

Quirrel...I'm not sure why you're stating he was a bad teacher, or had to be perceived as such. I don't think canon supports that, although I could be wrong.

And Umbridge was a whole different issue altogether.

So, really, the argument stands. If Snape had been truly horrible to a large percentage of the students body -- not a select few -- Dumbledore would have been forced to call for his removal.

He taught OWL and NEWT classes for a whole year. We only get to see his incompetency in silly and whimsical 2nd year classes. His incompetency was already blatantly obvious there, I can't imagine what it must have been like in years 5-7. A giant shitshow I assume.

** I think he would have certainly stayed out of Azkaban. The Malfoys were able to avoid it just by lying to Voldemort one time when Narcissa asked Harry if Draco was alive and claimed that Harry was dead.

I think that Snape would have most likely just lived out the rest of his life alone, possibly either back in Spinsters End or another house and just did Potions research. I doubt he would spend a lot of time around other wizards since I definitely think that a lot of people would still be prejudiced against him. He was Headmaster during the Carrows reign at Hogwarts and many students were tortured while he was there.

And many would still blame him for Dumbledore's death even with Harry's testimony. Since Pensieve memories can be altered, there's nothing in even the Wizarding world to provide the real truth of everything that went down.
