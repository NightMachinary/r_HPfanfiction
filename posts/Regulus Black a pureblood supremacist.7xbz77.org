What are your opinions on Regulus Black. Do you think he deserted Voldemort because he became a so called "blood traitor" or because he thought Voldemort was too brutal. I think he believed in pureblood supremacy but in a more peaceful way. In my opinion Regulus story is one of the saddest in the entire series he was just 18 when he died.


** He was a full on teenage pureblood fanatic who jumped ship when he realized that Voldemort crossed a line by splitting his soul into pieces.

But I would say he did redeem himself with his sacrifice. In some way at least. He must've been cool with the gang going on fun genocide trips.

But this seems to be the only reason he jumped ship. There's no evidence for or against his commitment to the cause otherwise.

**** True, but since OP asked for opinions I assumed we could just headcanon it out.

Otherwise the answer is a simple: Nobody knows.

***** My headcanon was that he was fine being a mass murderer until he found out about the horcrux. Like, fracturing your soul a hundred times is okay, but if you move the sliver around, you're gone too far.

** In Sirius's own opinion, Regulus got cold feet and tried to back out of the death eaters and then tragically died. It's also mentioned by Kreacher that he was a kind person. (Granted he is not a reliable source.) So, I'm inclined to believe that he sort of forced himself to believe the ideology but never truly did and ended up following his heart when Kreacher got hurt. I also love Regulus by the way. His story is told so vaguely, and everything about it is so interesting. The possibilities are endless.

A lot of SS members were very kind to their families and servants; it didn't stop them from participating in a genocide.

** I think Regulus had his own pureblood agenda going on. By that, I mean that he wanted to preserve the pureblood because he believed in ancient traditions. But he didn't really hate or wanted to kill the muggleborns or halfbloods. And he followed Voldemort because, 1. Due to family. Like Draco or many other death eater kids who really didn't want to turn dark. 2. Maybe, he someway believed in Tom Riddle. So, when he found out about the Horcruxes, he began researching Tom Riddle. In his research, he found not only that Tom wasn't a pureblood, but also to what lengths he had gone to establish himself as one. Then, he, maybe, went against Voldemort.

What ancient traditions? I don't recall there being any ancient traditions mentioned or that ever being described as a reason for blood prejudice in canon.

**** There might or might not have been traditions that purebloods followed but they were surely taught what was expected of them by their elders. Even little kids were ordered to follow what they considered ancient traditions. And Regulus being born and raised around everyone who valued the pureblood principles, definitely believed in some of them. And in canon too, we learn that there was blood prejudice because children were taught by their parents to do so, and those parents were taught the same by their parents and so on, thus making a long train of tradition that the pureblood followed.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.
