The Battle of Hogwarts was a critical point in the story, and just like the whole series, it featured a more heavy Gryffindor presence than any other house. There were sparing mentions of the other houses, while the Slytherin's were completely non existent.

Every time for 6 years, the Sorting hat pushed the topic of staying together and showing solidarity against the foe and yet, in the end, it wasn't there. The Slytherins were the first to be sent out of the hall.

Maybe an eternal foe appeals to a teenage brain more, but a united Hogwarts victory would have looked better than a victory for the ‘Light'.


** In their defence, Slytherin are kind of forced from Hogwarts by McGonagall. Not saying that's the wrong decision but the student who make up Slytherin aren't really consulted.

#+begin_quote
  /“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then,Horace, we duel to kill.”/

  /“Minerva!” he said, aghast./

  /“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your students, Horace.”/
#+end_quote

Later on in the Great Hall Pansy calls for Harry to be handed over to Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  /“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. “You will leavethe Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.”/
#+end_quote

Followed shortly by:

#+begin_quote
  /Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted/
#+end_quote

Plus it's only the older students who are allowed to stay from *any* of the houses. So there's selection bias at play here as the students most likely to be targeted for recruitment are the older students. Even if the younger students did want to stay and fight for Hogwarts, no one was going to let them.

I can understand readers (especially fanfiction readers) being frustrated with this but I don't really see another elegant solution. By book 7 Slytherin is conceptually locked in place, and the only other options are to ignore it and have some good Slytherin's show up out of nowhere. Have Harry rehabilitate the house in the space of a chapter or have everyone go full French Revolution and have students start accusing everyone else of being in league with the enemy. But Rowling hadn't laid any of the ground work for any of that meaning she was forced to contradict her own themes because she just didn't have the pages left for it.

Ironically she did was was easy, not what was right.

** I think J.K. made a mistake in not establishing the Slytherins working together with the rest of the students during the seventh year. I don't think for a second that every Slytherin were somehow happy and not absolutely horrified by students /being tortured/ in their school. Especially among the younger years.

It would have been so much more interesting for Harry, Ron and Hermione to step into a changed Hogwarts. Where students during an abhorrent point of history had found themselves working together and it could have been so easy to set up. Stepping into the room of requirement and seeing Slytherin students scattered among those there. A throw-away line here and there. To have a Slytherin speak up against Pansy, one of those who had stuck to the "dark side", so to say. Bet ya anything that the students would be very aware of who were playing on their side and not --- it's such a missed opportunity. Instead of the houses uniting the Slytherins were condamned in the presented narrative.

It will forever frustrate me something fierce because all the pieces for it /were there/.

** I agree with this so much. It felt like the prior books were building up to something big. As the Sorting Hat alluded, the Houses must join forces. I thought we'd see Charlie fly in on Norbert, leading a fleet of dragons. Flint would swoop in with a few allies on brooms. A handful of giants would join Hagrid and Grawp. Draco would defy his parents and openly fight Voldemort. Snape would publicly renounce the Desth Eaters and fight Voldemort to take the focus away from Harry. Adults from all houses would come together. But that's not what we got.

We get the Order, Dumbledore's Army, some older students, and the professors, as expected. A few random alums, and some Hogsmeade shopkeepers. That's about it. Slytherins forced out. No Norbert or giants. Snape dies without the chance to confront Voldemort. Draco seems to have a redemptive arc, only to turn against Harry in the Room of Requirement. Lupin and Tonks' deaths merit a single sentence, which I actually missed on my first reading. I'm not saying what we got is necessarily bad, but it felt like the story was building in a certain direction, giving us hinted promises, and then fell short.

*** I totally agree with you. Honestly the battle of Hogwarts was one of the most disappointing part of the entire series for me. I feel like Harry should have gotten a little bit fucking smarter in the last two books. Because, if he hadn't still been looking for horcruxes right before the battle and indeed during it, then the battle would've been more interesting. But because we are stuck with Harry wandering around the castle like a total idiot still looking for horcruxes, the battle kindof sucks.

It really does feel like she ran out of room. I know everyone says this and it is long hashed over, but I really wish she had spent less time with the stupid camping. I wish they had found the Horcruxes a bit faster, maybe even known about them at the end of book 6; then book 7 would've had more room for a proper battle and other non-camping scenes.

I think it was actually pretty realistic for him to still be a coward yet not evil at the end because that's what Draco is. A bully. And bullies are usually immature cowards. Just because someone isn't actually as evil as they seemed to be it doesn't mean they're heroes.

** I feel like all the Slytherin students were taught (by necessity and circumstance, not overt instruction) that self-preservation came above anything else (except maybe family). So after a year of Voldemort's regime, none of them have the slightest urge to combat him and the Death Eaters.

And that is fine. You can't demand that children fight a war.

/However/.

I like to believe that in this whole situation, the maxim /To the victor go the spoils/ is 100% true. The people that risked their life throughout the second war and during the final battle are those that get to reap the rewards.

The slytherins on the other hand risked nothing and they /get/ nothing.

My headcanon is that, as the years passed, the slytherin families in the sacred 28 (and their sympathizers) were slowly but surely shunned. Not overtly, but they found themselves more and more on the background, not invited to social gatherings, kept from wielding political power, always whispered about (/never stood against Him, you know/), always watched by the new ministry. Slowly became more insular, intermarrying only among themselves and maybe mail-ordering brides and husbands from the continent. Until a few decades later, they are mostly an afterthought. The only thing they have left now is their money and a worthless, "pure" lineage.

****** You'd have thought she'd do a lot of shit she either entirely forgot or just abanonded. Slytherins probably DID show up with Sluggy, but like everything else she wrote, she just messed it up.

I love Harry Potter, but everyone here analyses this shit when it's obvious not a whole lot of thought went into anything outside of the yearly mystery for this CHILDREN's series.

********* This is what always annoys me with these arguments.

Either the children would be fighting their PARENTS or fighting their school friends. It was an impossible choice and one that they weren't forced to make.

If they'd been allowed to stay, everyone would be looking over their shoulder. They were removed for their safety and the safety of those remaining.

** it's a bit silly overall, the logistics of it are just too off for me to suspend disbelief. imo it would have been better as more of a siege---we'd have more opportunities for slytherin redemption & interaction, we wouldn't have death eaters physically charging a magic castle, and harry would still be able to give himself up as a sacrifice in the end.

Rowling kind of forced a rushed end with how she forced Harry to go to Hogwarts (V. discovers horcrux hunt), but it wouldn't be hard to make a different motivation. maybe they hear Neville & Ginny are captured later than as written and head there immediately as they've exhausted all of their other leads

** Couldn't agree more. Would have been fantastic if during the final duel a complete swarm of randomers flooded the battlefield to protect Harry, made up of Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff AND Slytherin students, one's that he'd never even spoken to before.

That's all we would have needed - if Slughorn, Kreacher, Aberforth, the Centaurs and Percy can get a last-minute redemption by choosing fight, it really is just selective hearing on JK's part to not include the Slytherin's.

** Would you really expect the Slytherin students to stay and potentially face off against their own parents though? That's a hell of an ask for anyone never mind 16yo kids.

Also it's Slughorn (a Slytherin) who turns the tide of the battle by collecting the residents of Hogsmede. He doesn't do a dramatic ‘stand and fight' he analysis the situation and works out what is needed. The battle would probably have been lost without him.

** The anti-Slytherin attitude was something that troubled me greatly since before the last book I really dismissed it as it is Harry's perspective so of course, he doesn't speak to people outside his friend group he is a kid that's normal... But really no muggle-born Slytherins, even if we have 1/2 blood ones, only Draco really gets a voice then some Pansy, It is weird reading it as an adult since you notice what your younger self didn't, and it's highly uncomfortable that a group of children are deemed evil at 11 when the traits they list are ones that I think everyone develops by the time they are an adult. When we learn to be clever and sneak in our teen years, we go to college for our ambitions. I don't know I guess since I was an 11y Claw and adult me has Slytherin tendencies it shifts your perspective.

** I really liked The Changeling's take on house dichotomy and fighting against it, especially from a feminist perspective which examines the roles of gender in wizarding society. The battle of Hogwarts is much more satisfying there imo. The writing isn't perfect, action writing could be improved but it's definitely above average and the story makes up for any stilted writing.
