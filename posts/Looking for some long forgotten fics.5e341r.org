It's been a few years since I've read these fics and haven't been able to find them again. Help is very much appreciated!

1. Possibly Hermione/Severus. All I can remember is that Flitwick was a wand collector and there some sort of mission to find...the elder wand? There was some get together of collectors in a mansion somewhere in Europe. Snape may have worn a kilt.

2. Hermione/Severus. Teacher student fiction, possible marriage. They were both animagi, cats I think. Some weird nasty things happened with them both in their animal forms in the dungeons.

3. Possible Hermione/Draco. Draco's parents and other death eaters were on a tour around the country after the war. Their empty bodies, that is. The museum head was obsessed with Lucius, called him his angel? Did rapey things to poor Lucius.


** This hits so many red lights I'm currently beating my brain in an attempt to make it go away.

** Sounds like in annulo by ladyofthemasque. It's been a while since I read it but snape wears a kilt and flitwick is in a dueling club and collects rare wands.

** My time to shine! I knew my questionable reading choices would come in handy someday!

1. [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=1480][In Annulo]] by ladyofthemasque. HG/SS.

2. Sounds a bit like a scene from For Someone Special, also by ladyofthemasque, involving an animagus/lust potion. Things got freaky. Unfortunately, the only place I'm aware of it being archived was restrictedsecion.org, which is gone now.

3. [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=8755][Objects of Desire]] by Azrael. HG/SS and HP/DM.
