Yes, you read that right, I want a fic in which Harry is a wimp. Cowardly, possibly magically weak, scared by his own shadow, etc. You may ask, "SoundwaveSuperior, why would you want this?" and I will answer that question with 2 statements.

1. Have you ever seen this before? You've probably seen a million fics in which Harry is not a wimp/is an OP Marry Sue/Dark!Edgy!NoOneUnderstandsMe/Harry-Lord-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Potter-Black-Merlin-Prime-KnightOfUnicron-HeraldOfGalactus-OtherTitles. These fics either turn out great, or utter garbage. But this leads in to statement two.

2. I have never seen the opposite of this. I'm not even sure fics of this nature EXIST.

The story could either be a parody of all the tropes I just mentioned, or it could be a story that actually tries to run with the whole "Harry is pathetic" thing I'm looking for (I'm fine with either).

Another reason is that I saw that awhile ago someone posted a request for "Harry is not a wimp" and that got me thinking about this :D

TLDR: Pathetic!PotentiallyTropeInverted!Harry in either a fic that legitimately goes with this or a parody

** For a second, I misread your title as having the word "gimp" in it and my mind went in a somewhat related but utterly NSFW direction. Anyway, I'm not sure if I've read a fic where he's actually pathetic (or into the safe, sane, and consensual either), but it'd be a nice change from some of the douchetastic!Harry fics I've come across.

EDIT: Wait a second, what's a gimp? /googles/ "twisted silk, worsted, or cotton with cord or wire running through it, used chiefly as upholstery trimming."...Uh, am I missing something? Because that doesn't seem very NSFW...I'm missing something blatantly obvious, aren't I?

** Mm, I came up with an idea once where Harry was afraid of ghosts.

Well, specifically, afraid of invisible things; stuff levitating or moving around without any visible sign, or stuff being animated or transfigured without an obvious connection between wand and object. He'd be okay with the ghosts of Hogwarts (they're visible and don't touch anything), but terrified during Flitwick's lesson on Levitation Charms.

I've seen Squib!Harry here and there before, but the one that most readily comes to mind (Almost a Squib) has him becoming fabulous regardless.

  Friendless, bullied, seen as worthless by the Dursleys, Harry's natural rebellious and adventurous nature was repressed. Life was only bearable if he kept out of the way so he grew up unwilling to step out of line. He lives by his wits but has high ideals and courage below the surface. Harry is simply reluctant to draw attention to himself --- it's less painful that way! H/G. Ron/Hm.
