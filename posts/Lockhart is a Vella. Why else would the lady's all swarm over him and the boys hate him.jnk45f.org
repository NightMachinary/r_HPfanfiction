** I think I've seen this done before, though I haven't a clue where. It would make sense, and you could play on it being a reason he's so bad at magic. Maybe obliviation could be a spell that works on the mind in a similar wash to the allure or something so that's why he is successful where he isn't with things like bone mending

**** yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at but my brain isn't working good. So mayhap he's good at some things like how he's perceived and the allure and obliviation (and possibly something like imperious) but bad and things like mending bone
