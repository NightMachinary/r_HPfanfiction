So, in many fics I have seen that muggleborns are descendents from the squibs whom you threw away, so you should welcome them with open arms. But what if the children of squibs are not able to wield magic unless they are also the descendent from another squib line...I mean both the parents have to be squibs or squib descendents to have a magical child.. this would explain why there are not so many muggleborns...(This is totally a fanon concept)...


** I think that's generally considered part of it for a lot of people who work with that theory, like a bit of a numbers game.

** In lots of stories where Harry is an actual Heir of Slytherin (Slytherin by blood) this is the explanation use. His mom is just a witch from a long line of squids.

*** I assume you mean /squibs/, unless it is a cephalopod!Harry story, which is a new one for me.

** The Muggleborns descended from Squibs or Magicals thing is from an interview JK did, so it's technically canon, if you consider her post-additions canon.

I don't know about that, I just know that the interview in 2007 is when the wikis cite from.

** I have always considered the 'descended from squibs', 'magic is just a gene' theory unrealistic, if plausibly convincing for characters in the story to believe. There are three main reasons for this.

Firstly, as magical humans have been around for at least several thousand years, and given that your number of ancestors doubles every generation, until they are all the same people, probably everybody is descended from multiple squibs, so muggleborn 'getting lineage test and finding magical ancestors' isn't proof of anything, it is just statistics, and if just being descended from magicals was the criteria, there would be far more muggleborn.

Secondly, that that still raises the question of where does magic come from. Sure, everyone today has magical ancestors, but if you go back far enough, you have to find some sort of OG witch/wizard, so you are still left with the problem of magic appearing out of nowhere.

Thirdly, it is implied that witches and wizards are found all around the world from every ethnic group (although magic being a western European trait would explain some of JKR's worldbuilding, especially for the US). Unless there were a whole bunch on completely independent 'original magic' events all around the world, the common magical ancestor must have probably preceded humans leaving Africa. If magic is just a genetic mutation, even a recessive one, then I feel that is more than long enough for 'muggles' to be made extinct by natural selection. Even if you don't have formal education in magic, accidental magic and resistance/immunity from mundane diseases would be enough to give magicals an evolutionary advantage to outcompete muggles, unless you had mass squib-off events.

*** Unless the Weasleys are even more unusual for their huge number of children and magic is linked with reduced fertility and most magic families have to try their hardest to get one and ever more for two children.

It is just the Weasleys that for some reason are not affected by this.

If you assume that, it makes sense that muggle outcompete witches and wizards in natural selection

** Not realisitic. If that were the case there would be far more muggleborns. And magic usually just skips one generation. Also, Squibs do have magic but they can't channel it to cast spells, etc...
