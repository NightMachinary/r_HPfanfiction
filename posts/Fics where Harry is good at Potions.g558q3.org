So other than my beloved /"Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions "/ fic, are there other stories where Harry is good at Potions, or eventually becomes good through hard work? He doesn't have to be a genius, but I get sick of Harry's incompetence and laziness sometimes.


** There's the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels - though it's not /quite/ the same as Harry being good at Potions, given that it's a female version of Harry. Definitely falls under the category of a potions genius, however, and it's a fun read - at least, if you don't mind a fairly powerful interpretation. I haven't read the fantasy novel inspiration for it, either - which I'm not sure if it'd add to the enjoyment.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
