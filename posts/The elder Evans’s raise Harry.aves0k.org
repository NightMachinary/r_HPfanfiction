Hello! I was just wondering if any of you have seen a fic where lily and petunia's parents survive and end up raising Harry instead of petunia. Maybe they don't tell Harry about the wizarding world because they don't like it anymore or something. Any help is much appreciated, Thanks!


** This is something I would like to see as well. Even if someone else takes care of Harry other than the Dursleys it ends up being from James' side. I guess authors don't find the plot device as interesting since they can't introduce magic to Harry earlier than canon if its the Evans'.

*** Well the Evans' would know about magic, given that their daughter was a witch. I don't see any reason why they would not tell Harry. Though perhaps they would hold off because they resent the world that stole their daughter's life at such a young age.

**** Eh.. They can't really do much about it, unless they want to venture into the wizarding world as a couple of muggles guarding Harry Potter.

Telling Harry just seems like a good way for him to cause a scene at school or something. Regular 7 year olds don't keep secrets well. Explaining to teachers why their adopted son is convinced he's a wizard and that they told him he was would be awkward.

***** Maybe they don't tell Harry about magic right away, but I can see them telling him that he's special, talented, and gifted; like his mother was.

***** I'm sure there have to be /some/ halfblood children out there that interact with the Muggle world with some regularity. Surely not every one of them is at risk of spilling the secret. The Obliviators would never get any sleep otherwise.

And honestly ,11 year olds don't keep secrets all that much better than 7 year olds do. So if they're telling muggleborns they're witches and wizards at age 10-11 who have never had any interaction with magic, why not tell Harry who was born in the magical world to magical parents?

****** 11 year olds are definitely more mature than 7 year olds.

The thing is, with a regular half blood kid there is a benefit to telling them early - you can actually take them to the magical world and whatnot. The Evan grandparents can't.

If one parent is magical and they wanted to keep magic a secret from their kid, they would have to actively keep their abilities secret every day. The Evans don't need to.

Most half blood kids aren't world famous and at risk of assassination. Harry is.

At 11 years old they go to hogwarts so of course they have to be told. They're then going to spend the majority of the year there, at hogwarts where they don't have to keep a secret. They don't go to muggle school anymore. Much easier to keep quiet about it.

With Harry there is hardly any benefit to telling him early and the risk is so much greater than with regular kids.

*** They could sort of introduce it, but it would really be limited to telling him the truth about his parents and recognizing his accidental magic. He wouldn't know any more about it (though honestly it seems like canonically even the purebloods don't know much before Hogwarts, so this isn't a big deal).

I think the main thing is that the only difference is he'd be happy at home, all the stuff at Hogwarts would probably go the same way.

** Yeah, this is one that baffles me. I mean, James and Lily were super young IIRC when they were killed. I can't remember where I read this, but I vaguely seem to recall reading somewhere that the elder Potters had died of some disease(dragon pox, maybe?) prior to Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow.

Even if that's true, what about Lily's parents? Surely they would have been preferrable to a resentful sister who treated her sister as a freak(But then again, perhaps not. Who knows what they were like?)

*** I think I canon they died in a car crash or something, but I might be totally wrong.

EDIT: apparently they died "normal muggle deaths" so probably a house fire or car crash.
