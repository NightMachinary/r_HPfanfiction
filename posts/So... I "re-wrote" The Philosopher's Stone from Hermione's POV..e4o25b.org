I've always wondered what the books would be like if told from Hermione's point of view so I did the #nanowrimo challenge during November to do it! All 17 chapters, almost 73k words. It was a lot of fun... and WAY harder than I thought it'd be! I'm thinking of doing the rest of the books too but we'll see!

A few friends of mine have graciously agreed to edit it for me. As they edit each chapter, I am going to post them on AO3 for people to read. If you're curious, you should check it out! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21636112]]


** It looks good so far! I really love all the detail you put into this. Everything works together so nicely. Although I would be careful with repetition and formatting. I can't wait to read more though! If you ever thought of writing more pieces and books it would be a pleasure to read those.

*** Thanks a lot! Yeah... I tend to get repetitive when I write really long things. I have a friend going through the other chapters (which I will post once she is finished with them) and hopefully she picks up on some of the repeats!

I just started a new google doc for the Chamber of Secrets but the words aren't flowing yet... but if I do start writing it, I'll make sure to post!

**** I noticed a couple - you refer to "math" at least once (should be "maths") and the bit where Hermione is upset about not getting "credit" in "exams" is odd - in English primary schools, the only test you would ever call an "exam" is the SAT you take at the end. Even then, it's quite rare. There isn't really any concept of building up credit either, or of grades - you certainly wouldn't be given an A, B, C etc. at that age. Maybe have her stressing about having "marks taken off"?

***** Yeah, I agree with a lot of this.

Hermione wouldn't take an exam in primary school. I'm not even entirely sure she'd of taken a grammar test at that age either. Perhaps a spelling test or a maths test would fit a little better?

Instead of grades, the marks are usually just the correct number of questions out of the total number of questions. So twenty correct out of twenty, 20/20. Or say you only got fifteen correct out of twenty questions, you'd get 15/20.

Hermione could be upset that has to resit the test because she was accused of cheating. While it's not a big deal to most people, it would be to her. Or as suggested above, she had marks taken off which meant she wasn't at the top of the class like she normally was.

But other than that, I'm really impressed with how British this felt.

***** I really wish everyone who tried to write a Harry Potter fanfic was taken through a tour of the British education system, especially its early 20th century incarnation. "Credit" that adds up to a cumulative "grade" at the end of a "semester" is something totally foreign to the British system of that time, and the many Anglophone colonies that emulated it.

You attend classes and do homework, not because it all adds up to a grade but because you will be punished for not doing so. Internal exams happen at least once a year but more often twice. There are two external exams at the end of high school, one to certify you as having a high school education, and one to qualify for university entrance one or two years later. Coursework does not count towards this grade, and there is no concept of doing "extra credit" to improve your grade. You either performed well in the exam or you didn't.

**** I just have to say, I'm really impressed with how many Britishisms that you got right! The flow also felt very natural, there's a certain kind of 'stiffness' you can sometimes find in writing where the author is trying to portray something they're not familiar with. But your writing is really lovely, and I didn't even realise you weren't British until the exam part.

I noticed that you used 'crib' for Hermione's baby bed, while over here we would call it a 'cot'. You also use 'catch-all' which I had to Google as I wasn't personally familiar with what it was. 'Shelf' might work a little better?

Also Bert and Mary - Mary Poppins?
