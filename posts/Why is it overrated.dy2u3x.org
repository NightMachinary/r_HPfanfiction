Well there is this fanfiction that i read, and well for some reason it is over rated, with too many likes and controversy

Harry potter and the Daft Morons

I thought that the Idea was quite good, sounded funny at the start, but at several points it literally made me want to bash my head on the wall because of the writing style, in no way do people in real life speak in that way.

What are your thoughts about it?


** Err... That fic is looked on with enormous contempt for being a badly written Indy!Harry tropefest. I don't think I've actually ever encountered someone who likes it.

*** If you search FFN for all HP fanfictions sorted by most favourites, it's on page 2. I have no idea how it got there either, but people like it.

***** It's relatively long and it's complete (and it was fast-updating when incomplete). That's the only requirement for a lot of people.

** It was fun for people who were new to the fanfic world. But it was full of overused tropes that makes many regular readers want to bang their heads.

** Wow, weren't you all just a bouncing board of opinions, but for the sake of discussion I'll play devils advocate.

The fic ticks all the boxes when looking for a new story.

Length-The story as of right now sits at 745 K in words, each chapter is the perfect amount when reading it

Pairings- It's a Harry Multi fic so it will automatically get attention. It involves the most sought after Pairings of the fandom

1.Hermione 2.Daphne Greengrass 3. Fleur - Just think about how many new threads asking for DG/HP alone

It brings interesting premises- The idea that the killing curse is the ultimate Oblivate and that's why it can't be blocked

While the story isn't top ten or anything, It is a quality story that has some tropes...... like most fanfictions at this point

This thread is just an excuse to bash Sinyk. Heaven forbid people have different opinions then you "regular readers"

** Because it's Sinyk. Everything he/she writes is overrated, they have absolutely no idea how to write children. I have absolutely no idea why the HP fanfiction readers like their work.

** Can't judge a fanfic by it's favorites unfortunately. I mean look at Harry Crow.

** When it comes to fics like these - likes and favorites are not an indicator of quality, merely of exposure.

** I keep a list of fics I've stopped reading and why (there's so many I needed to keep track after a few years so I didn't accidentally start them again), and for that one I wrote "Rant, rant, rant, rant". I think that's also the reason why a lot of people like it: they want Harry to 'tell people off' for all the shit they're responsible for in regards to him and see it as a form of justice that Harry makes them feel bad for their sins. I think it makes him sound like a whiny brat, very different from the canon Harry that bottles everything up inside.
