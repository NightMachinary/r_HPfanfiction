I'm looking for a very specific fanfic in which I believed to be called twelve returnees. People like the Maudraders, Lily, Moody, Regulus and more are brought back to live. They have no idea what happened after they died only that Voldemort died. Sirius finds out he has a son, I think he was Emmalines son called Regulus that Andy has been looking after.

â€‹

I am also in need of similar stories or good fics with a good, healthy brotherly bond.
