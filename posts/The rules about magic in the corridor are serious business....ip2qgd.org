Voldemort started at his wand in confusion, he had cast the killing curse, but the spell fizzled out of existence before making it a few inches. Everybody stopped and stared at him, he was the first to attempt to cast any spells.

Suddenly, as if from the shadows, a grizzled and vicious Argus Filch hobbled out with his broom, Mrs Norris mewling angrily from behind it.

“What have I told you bloody kids about using your stupid magic in the halls. I ought to hang you from your toes and feed you to Mrs Norris.” He then, to everybody's surprise, began to literally beat Voldemort around with his dripping mop.


** I totally headcanon that the lax enforcement of no magic in the hallways was because hexing one another was great practice with magic. It's how all the great schools do so well on their OWLs.

*** How do we know he's not?

Perhaps Dumbledore kept Filch around not to allow Filch to stay in the only home he's ever known, but to keep Filch from unleashing ungeometrical chaos upon the rest of the Magical World!
