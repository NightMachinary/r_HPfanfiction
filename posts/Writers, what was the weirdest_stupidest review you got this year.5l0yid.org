Depending on the site, possibly by reporting such a thing. It's toxic and if there's a chance of taking the possibility of being heard from such people, it's good to take it.

That said, as far as what you feel personally goes, it's clear that such a person is ... well, worthless as a person, so you shouldn't take anything they write to heart.

******** Which is why I'd started with “Depending on the site”. Alas, in that particular case I do not think there is anything to do about it unless you just block the user from leaving reviews on your stories (and as I've never done that, I'm not sure if you can actually do it or if blocking theme merely blocks messages).

** I think the stupidest reviews tend to be on the worst written fics. I've click on a fic, quickly realized how awful it was (no hate to the author's, they have plenty of time to grow and improve), and then out of morbid curiosity looked at reviews. What I usually find is a bunch of reviews more poorly written than the story showering the poor writing with praise.

**** 0/10 review sucks

Seriously though (because the above bit was a joke), yeah, when one sees reviews like that as the only ones the story have it's probably a good guess that the story itself is not going to be very good. Though there are exceptions, since there are always exceptions.

*** I think that's because after you've read a few fics you realize you can just /not read bad stories./ When you're used to book you had to pay money for, simply dropping a story once started is weird.

So the better writers / more mature readers don't leave negative reviews unless the story was /almost/ good. Then they leave a comment that usually starts with "I really want to love this story, it does X really well, but you need to work on Y."

Otherwise my infuriating reviews mostly came from people who couldn't stop asking me about veritiserum in every review they left, despite me explaining myself, resolving it in the story, and it generally being a very minor flaw.

In regards of my House Greyjoy profile picture... I actually laughed because a friend and I think it's true. I explained that to the reviewer and got this response:

"Well the tree is at the bottom as black on yellow and the stags antlers are the curved lines. I'm guessing that person who designed the family crest was probably originally designing a stag crest when they suddenly were ordered to design one for a kraken and decided to be lazy so they just modified the stag crest."

Honestly, I don't get where she saw the pine or the stag...
