:END:
One of my favorite lines from fanfiction I just read

Remus was allowed to bring home the unsellable books. The ones that had been in exposition too long and were roughly handled and creased and the cover eaten by the sun and some pages falling. Sirius read /Good Omens/ and started calling Remus Aziraphale.

What are yours?


** " He wasn't alone. Not really. Suddenly, he remembered Tom's words five long years ago: 'Know this, Harry - you are never alone.' He couldn't beat Tom Riddle....but Lord Voldemort could." From Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux

' "Then how do I know if the Diary is actually your horcrux?" , Harry asked. Tom smirked. " Give it a few weeks. My younger self had a fairly one-track mind." X From Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux

#+begin_quote
  *...And one he wished he did have.*

  He misses Fred every day. They all do, but losing a brother is something that he never realises can hurt so much. Brothers are special. And now he has one less. Fred was his brother...and now he's gone. That was one wish gone wrong.

  Ron Weasley always wishes Fred was there because then... he'd have five brothers again.

linkffn(Five Brothers by Elledreamer)

#+begin_quote
  Fortunately, Percy finally broke down one day and ate the cake (after Bellatrix and Lucius tied him to a chair and force-fed him). After that, his fiery little fox's defenses slowly came down. He no longer ran in fear or tried to hex Voldemort when he showed up. Instead, he simply acted resigned to his fate. That was progress! Voldemort was quite pleased.
