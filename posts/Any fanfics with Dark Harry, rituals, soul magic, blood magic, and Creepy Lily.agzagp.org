I remember reading various random fanfics that have elements of these, if you ever encountered stories with these tropes, can you list them?

What I mean by these concepts:

Dark Harry - Harry uses Dark Magic, has more ambiguous morals than in Canon, might be Slytherin.

Rituals, soul magic, blood magic - A lot of emphasis is given to ceremonial magic, soul magic, blood magic, and other obscure branches of magic that are usually considered unusual, dark, and creepy by most wizards (like Voldemort's resurrection potion, Lily's protection of Harry, blood wards, etc.)

Creepy Lily - Lily knew a lot about these obscure branches of magic and used them to protect Harry. For example I distinctly remember two stories I've read some time ago. In one of them Lily visited Mesoamerica with newborn Harry, and had protective runes carved into every bone of his skeleton. In another, Harry is hit by Voldemort's AK in the Little Hangleton graveyard after his resurrection, and when Harry meets his parents in the Afterlife, Lily is lovingly taking care of the Harrycrux-Babymort soul fragment.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

*** Just finished reading deathly hallowed, and can I just say this is one of the more confusing ones out there? I'm all for "reality is breaking, Cthulhu is awakening", but I had a hard time with this one. I mean, where it stops is really cute, spooky but still cute, but I honestly have no idea what's going on and wish the author had continued because it seemed really interesting.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

It's dark Harry who uses dark magic. From what I remember it's also implied that Lily used dark magic in order to protect Harry.

linkffn(Blood Crest)

When Harry was a small child he got rescued (or more like kidnapped) by some insane dark wizard who then teaches him a lot of "shady" magic.

linkffn(Too Young to Die)

It's dark Harry and has a lot of ritual stuff.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** Seconding Accidental Horcrux. It's sequel gets more into what Lily did, but it's obvious she was messing with dark magic to get Harry's protection. The way the protection starts to manifest in the sequel definitely qualifies as creepy

Lily studies the archway in the DoM and don't wanna get into spoilers, but uses dark magic to protect Harry. Though as this is a no-prophecy AU, it's not Voldemort's AK that she uses dark magic to protect harry from. But anymore info and I'll be giving heavy spoilers.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12203742][Scenes from a War: The Marriage of Alice and Frank]] has Lily as a Dark witch and Order healer saving Frank Longbottom's life using ritual magic. The ritual itself is described with a lot of intricacy, and Lily definitely spooks at least James and Marlene McKinnon with how cavalier she is about it all.
