Hey! I'm jaythekoala, sometimes known as James018 or James, and I've done a lot of reading and a bit of writing of Harry Potter fanfic for a long time. For reference: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1585368/][my FFN profile]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jaythekoala/works][my AO3 works]]. I'm also an admin of a Harry Potter roleplaying server on Discord, known as Model Hogwarts.

To the uninitiated, what is roleplay? Basically, it's what it sounds like: roleplaying means creating your own character, and then writing from their point of view as they go through life within and outside of Hogwarts. What do they do? How do they interact with people? Where do they end up? In many ways it is like writing a fan fiction, except you're co-writing with many other authors, each writing their own OCs. This roleplay is set in the Harry Potter world, so you can roleplay as a student in Hogwarts, engaging with classmates and attending classes (yes, we have actual professors who run classes!), or a member of the wider wizarding world, shopping in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, going for a drink in the Leaky Cauldron, talking about the latest Quidditch results. Characters progressively age from child to adult: my once wide-eyed 11-year-old Muggleborn has now been out of school for a year and is a trainee at St. Mungo's :,)

I joined Model Hogwarts initially with the goal of improving my writing and character development for fanfic. I definitely believe it's done that, and when I return from my fanfic hiatus I believe I'll be a much better writer for it. But, more than that, Model Hogwarts is an amazing community, very active with 900+ members, extremely welcoming no matter how good/inexperienced a writer you are, and you quickly make genuine friends there. The roleplay experience is excellent, with a diverse cast of characters, an automated spell learning, casting and stat training system inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, and server-wide events and plots to get involved in. There is so much on offer.

If you would like to join, the link is [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM]]. If you have any questions, please either comment or message me! :)


** Im interested, but im not sure which fanon or just canon we would use. Is there a list somewhere of assumptions? Such as, is arithmancy used to make spells? Is Runes used for enchanting? Etc

*** Yes! There is an established server canon, based on the Harry Potter books and J.K. Rowling's writings first and foremost. There are obviously plenty of gaps in that information, and we fill it in with our own worldbuilding: we have an entire server dedicated to that. There are some areas we're still developing, of course, given the Harry Potter universe is so wide-ranging.

Server members are encouraged to discuss new ideas and thoughts on what already exists!

To answer your particular questions at least, enchanting is considered a variation of Charms. Arithmancy is one of those areas we're struggling to worldbuild - my personal opinion is, yes, it would probably have some relevance to spell-crafting, but the relationship isn't too clear at this point.

****** I mean is it a nice server with pleasant people? Is it active daily or near daily? How many people are there? How strict are the rules? Do we assign ourselves as who we want to be?

Also what year is it? Are there canon characters? Can we be canon characters?

Sorry if I seem damanding or rude I'm just wary of joining servers with strangers

******* Oh, no, it's fine! I get it completely, you don't want to join a place that isn't what it's cracked up to be :P

It is a nice server and the people are very pleasant. It is very active daily without being overwhelming/pinging you all the time. The server size is 900+ and quite a few of those are inactives since we've been around a long time: I'd estimate maybe 100 or so are regularly active.

The rules are, I would say strict but commonsense. We're an age 13+ friendly server which basically guides a lot of our rules, particularly no NSFW stuff, and also being respectful of triggers and so on. There is a channel dedicated to the rules and moderation system that we encourage new members to read first. Our mod team is excellent and again uses common sense, we favour talking to people nicely first and foremost, and certainly won't be banning anyone for an off-colour joke.

Model Hogwarts is OC-only, no roleplaying as canon characters. (This is largely to avoid mischaracterization, and also locking people out of who they want to be.) Minor interactions with canon characters can be allowed but only with permission.

The current year in Model Hogwarts is 2031. This is because the server started back in 2017, and the three months=one year timeline has led to us fast-forwarding into the future. Most people just assume the world hasn't changed too much from where it is now. (For the record, we made the decision that COVID didn't happen in the Model Hogwarts universe, as it would have messed with server canon too much.)

Hope this is all helpful and please do ask any more questions if you want!

** I've recently become interested in roleplay type stuff and just started watching critical role. I also have always wanted to start writing fanfics. The only problem is, I have what I think are good ideas sometimes, but I don't have the confidence in my writing/writing style to write anything down. I'm also really socially awkward and don't know if I would be very good at roleplay. I get nervous even typing something into Twitch chat sometimes.

*** I totally understand!

I do encourage you to give Model Hogwarts a go. If there's a safe place to try out writing a little bit it's there. The people are really nice and helpful, we have everyone from accomplished writers to beginners, and you're able to go at your own pace and do only what you're comfortable with. Who knows, maybe it can give you more confidence and ability to write other stuff in the future.

*** A lot of the server is dedicated to roleplaying channels: there are separate "places" to roleplay like the Great Hall, the shores of the lake, the common rooms, Diagon Alley, The Three Broomsticks and so on. Each of them represent places your character could go and interact with other characters. You would write about that with other people (writing their characters), progressively building stories.

There are also places for "out-of-character" chatter, whether that's introducing your character and getting ideas for friendships, relationships, rivalries, subplots and so on - or just chat about fun, non-roleplay-related stuff!

Does that answer your question?

*** Hello there! :) That's a common feeling, and there are two bits of advice I'd give to that.

1. You don't need to know every single detail of how everything works before roleplaying! There's a lot of information but that is largely for people who want to push the limits of what the server allows and that doesn't apply to everyone. Focus on making a character first, and then when you're in, getting into a few roleplays and getting to know people. The technical stuff can wait.
2. ASK QUESTIONS! There are lots of really nice and helpful people on the server who will drop everything to help out a new person. It's just, we don't know what newbies are struggling with unless they ask. So if you're not sure how to do something, just speak up and someone will help :)

** I made a separate reddit account just to talk about this issue without being connected to my main, as I am afraid of any retaliation from anyone related to this server. This server banned me without any warning and claimed that I was another user they had previously banned. They refused to talk to me about it, show me the alleged "evidence" they had, or allow me to send any proof whatsoever that I am not the user they claim me to be. Due to the incompetence of the administrative team, I highly discourage joining this server.

*** The reason we are not sharing our proof is that if you know how we figured out it was you, you might try to rejoin again and would be better at hiding your identity. It's enough for you to know that we are 100% certain. We would not have banned you otherwise - we never take bans lightly.

If you have any questions you're more than welcome to contact me privately. Just please don't expect us to change our decision. It is final.
