  The war was lost. Voldemort had won, and her brother was dead, just as she should have been. But Fate decides to give Alexis Potter a chance to fix everything, sending her back in time sixty years. However, Fate never mentioned her having to parade around as Tom Riddle's twin sister. Warnings of False Twincest and Dumbledore bashing!

  JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different? And how much different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it?

  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

  EWE. The war is over, but Voldemort isn't as dead as everyone believes. Harry returns to Hogwarts, expecting a normal school year, but a sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle has other ideas. It seems sometimes the line between good and evil is very blurry and fascination and hate can easily coexist. Features: powerful!Harry, Dark Arts, Slytherin schemes, and very twisted love.

** If Thems The Rules [sic] by MayMarlow. Harry goes back in time to kidnap Tom Riddle from the orphanagr and raise him right. He falls in familial love with Tom and becomes Oblivious!Harry, but speaks to Tom as though they were spouses (I suspect accidental magic-powered love charms). Tom develops a jealous, posessive love of Harry and "protects" him from the advances of Blacks and a Malfoy. It's creepy and adorable all at the same time. (I haven't read past the FF dot net cutoff, since the author stopped updating there for what I consider spurious reasons and now only updates to Livejournal, so there's a tiny chance that it may develop into Tom->Harry->OC.)
