** Are you thinking like a weekly/monthly/semi-regular ‚Äúrecommend fics that fit this criteria!‚Äù thread?

*** I was thinking of having a permanent tag of let's say Harmony, there's always things mentioned like the lady thief, Not like a sister, so on and so on. Have it for that people recommend them but then there always up, that way if someone has a new recommendation it can be added to the list. Rather than that question being asked what's a good Harry/Hermione once a week and the same 10 answers.

**** It's hard to leave something permanent up because we only have 2 sticky slots. So while you might want Harmony recs, someone might want Harry/Daphne, someone else might want Time Travel, etc.

I don't know if there's an elegant solution but we will think on it some more üòä

***** Thanks for even listening, it means a lot. I just threw up harmony since it's a big one. I'm actually Harry/Susan fan. Tried daphne and not badüòÜ but generally not my taste. The other might be is to have a wiki page like the Harmony Reddit were once a month there could be a list made of a significant trope picked and everyone starts building a permanent, this is quality list? And then knew stories could be brought up more... since well fanfiction.net has what 800000 thousand now. There's got to be some we might be not getting the good attention

***** Hm, you could make one sticky thread, which is like a list of lists? Like, the Curse of Strahd subreddit ([[/r/curseofstrahd]]) has a mega-megathread, which just links to other megathreads.

*** The Worm fanfiction sub does a weekly "What are you reading" thread that generates a good amount of posts linking to new and old fics. I don't recall this sub ever trying something like that, it might be a good option to try.

Maybe alternate pairings and themes? E.g. H/G then dark!Harry then H/D then best fic with OC main character type thing?

*** I think a centralized recommendations thread of some sort with active conversation would be a good idea, and this would help keep it fresh and sortable, so I like the idea of themed recc stickys.
