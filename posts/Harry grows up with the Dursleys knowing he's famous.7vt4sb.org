I've been having a rather difficult time finding a fic where Harry grows up with the Dursleys knowing he's famous - and why. He should be getting numerous owls during this time, learn about the wizarding world before he enters.

Petunia doesn't even have to tell the lad. Just have the information of Potter's location leaked and a bunch of wizards move to Harry's neighborhood, nearing having a heart attack at all those muggles aren't treating their savior right.

"John, I don't care what Dumbledore says. Those MUGGLES are starving the BOY WHO LIVED!"

"Lucy -"

"We have to buy a child a broom and teach him Quidditch. We have to teach him his heritage."

"Lu -"

"We need to give the child the proper prescription glasses he needs."

"Darling -"

"We need to feed him."

"Lucy, you're forgetting something."

"What?"

"We need to abruptly crash into the Dursley home, vandalize the place, grab the boy, and make sure those MUGGLES get the message that if it we're legal, every wizard would Apparate to their house and kill them all. Oh, and we probably should file papers for guardianship over the lad before all that..."

My attempts to find a fic matching that criteria have proven futile, and I hope someone has wrote a fic of this.

Any fics similar to this idea being shared will be greatly appreciated too!
