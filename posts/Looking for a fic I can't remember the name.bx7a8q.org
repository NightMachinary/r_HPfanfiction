Most likely published on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I believe it is either a fem!harry who is in slytherin or a twin sister of Harry's in slytherin. In this fic, a significant event I can remember is the accidental death of Milicent Bulstrode in the slytherin common room during or after a party or something. Draco Malfoy may have been involved in this scene and I believe was romantically involved with the fem!harry or twin sister of Harry's
