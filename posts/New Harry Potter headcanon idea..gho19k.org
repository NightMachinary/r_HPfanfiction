Well, I'm reading this fic, linkao3(The Road Less Traveled), and it got me started on some thoughts about Harry. (Beware of spoilers for the fic.)

Basically, in the fic, Harry is not only the Lord to the Ancient House of Potter, but he is also the Lord to the Most Ancient and Noble Houses of Slytherin and Peverell. It would make sense that there's a really old vault from the original Peverell brothers and its ancestry or descendant thing didn't update or whatever. I also kinda like the idea of Harry being Lord to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Gryffindor, as well, specifically from his mother's line.

Tom Riddle is technically the heir to Slytherin after many years of having Squibs in the family. Imagine if Gryffindor's heirs also became Squibs to the point where they were identified as Muggles. What if Harry was related to Gryffindor through his mother? Both Godric and Lily had red hair and green eyes (and yes, I know that other people can have the same coloring, I'm just saying), so it would kinda make sense. Also, all Muggleborns are technically from a long line of Squibs that intermingled with other Squibs and muggles, so there technically /is/ a chance that Harry's mom is related to Gryffindor.

My thoughts on Harry becoming the Heir/Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Slytherin would be after Voldemort's death since they're very very distantly related to one another even though Harry's not technically related to Slytherin through blood at all, but rather through marriage.

Also, from the fic, Harry is the Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. I like the idea that Sirius would have named him the heir upon his birth in a will or something and when he took the Oath to always protect him or whatever.


** Fresh . Exciting. Innovative

  When Harry first joined the wizarding world, he did everything he was supposed to do. He sorted to Gryffindor, he was part of the Golden Trio and he was willing to die to defeat the man that had killed his parents. Unfortunately all that got him were seven uncomfortable years leading to an even more uncomfortable conversation with Dumbledore after he had apparently died. But while Harry was still considering his options between staying dead and Dumbledore's suggestion of somehow returning to finally defeat Voldemort once and for all, a third path was presented that would give him the chance to choose a different road to take on the day he'd first learned that Magic existed.

** This is actually a pretty popular trope. You'll see people on this subreddit talk about "Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-LeFay"? This is what they mean, Harry inheriting a bunch of titles through his parents, forgotten squib lines, right of conquest, etc.

*** I've seen that, I just simply met what I mentioned and it's just a new Headcanon for myself. I've only read a few political Harry Potter fics but I think they're so cool. I would love to read a rewrite of Harry Potter with wizarding politics.
