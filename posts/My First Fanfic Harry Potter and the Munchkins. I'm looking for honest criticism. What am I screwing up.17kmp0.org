** Punctuation is a big one. The first few sentences definitely need some commas. The writing feels a bit... dull. I can't really sink into the story, I feel disconnected from everything that's happening.

*** Thanks. I know my grammar needs work and I've bought a workbook to improve it.

I'll have to figure out how to write in a more immersive style I guess. Not sure how I'm going to do that.

**** Maybe try reading some of the most highly-rated fics in the fandom and see how they do it? Compare different authors' styles.

** It's my first fanfic, heck it's my first story longer than 3,000 words, and I'm looking for criticism. What am I doing flat out wrong? What could I do better?

*** In general - interesting and funny, as intended. I like your description of classes. I think that main problem is lack of plot, now it is disjointed set of scenes rather than story. And there is a noticeable lack of updates.

Random betaing:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923104/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Munchkins]]

"He left a note on the fridge and called the Knight Bus. The Knight Bus was packed." - repetition

""No more,n four to a boat!" Hagrid called." - there is something wrong here

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923104/5/Harry-Potter-and-the-Munchkins]]

"Ny the end of class his potion" should be "By the end of class his potion"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923104/6/Harry-Potter-and-the-Munchkins]]

There is a stray newline after "All my client wishes for "

"Finally Harry just invited Zebulon back to Privet Drive to watch the video. This led to another discussion because Zebulon couldn't just apparate blindly and he refused to take the Knight Bus. They settled on taking Zebulon's car. Harry was surprised Zebulon had a car but Zebulon just said that the arrogant muggle across the street had one so why shouldn't he?" - again, repetitions.

space after "Seven Words You" is missing

"out of date Professor" should be "out of date and Professor"
