WBWL story where Harry was a punch-clock supervillain/merc who had already fought the Titans.

It was some ancient contract that House Peverell could have triggered but never did. Dumbledore triggered it, and the Order basically abducted Harry for the wedding.

Constantine was best man. Harry and Darkfire had a lot of chemistry.


** Is it "contract of convenience" by Ybarra87?

  Blackfire was about to arrange for her sister to marry an ugly swamp alien only for a contract to appear before her. After reading the contract she realizes she had no choice but to go along with this but she the groom was not what she expected. This is just a one shot. I do not own anything belonging to Harry Potter or DC Superheroes.
