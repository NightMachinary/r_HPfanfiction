I have recently found the world of Harry Potter FanFiction and find myself totally enamored. I have so far really happened to love Marriage Law fan fiction as well as few Harem pieces that I have read on Granger Enchanted. I was wondering if any one had any pieces that they loved that might want to pass along! Thanks!

And if that isn't enough harem for you, here are some serious picks of mine:

Witches of Westfield: A very easy-going post-battle fic. Its not exactly harem, but we're getting there.

The Firebird Trilogy: Super-heavy-AU with fantastic worldbuilding and one of, if not the only marriage law fic that get this thing right.

Harry Potter and the Curses Cure: I loved this - in a guilty pleasure kind of way.

EDIT: I just saw the "without Harry as the star" bit. Sorry, I should really read the entire question before answering.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Actually, tons of the Marriage Law fanfics star Hermione.

Edit: I've been looking at old threads on the topic and there are plenty of reccomendations there.

My absolute favorite is "Spellcaster" by SGCBearcub. At this point, its very AU because when the story opens Voldemort is still a threat and (spoiler) he's defeated in a different way than in canon.
