So, is it believable that after the Ellen Cracknell (Umbridge's mum) left with their son when he is 12/13. She would've changed his name to her maiden name since she doesn't want to be associated with the Umbridges? It's either that or when Silas (the name I gave Umbridge's brother born in 1952) gets married he could take his wife's name?


** Probably the former.
