Dumbledore certainly was, though he did also defeat an entire room of death eaters so there wasn't much of a need to use lethal spells. The order seems to have no qualms about lethal methods though. They stun enemies in mid-air and even force Fletcher to risk his life in a mission. What do you guys think? I think a lot of fics way overplay the nonlethal means thing. Death wasn't the ultimate goal, incapacitation was. It was probably easier to stun or banish enemies to render them a non-threat rather than toss out avadas though if killing death eaters was the only way, they did. If you take movie as canon (though most don't), they even cast a shield that vaporizes some death eaters.


** The Order can be quite ruthless. Lupin chastises Harry for using Expelliarmus. Moody suggests to Dumbledore in the Wizengamot that they should toss Karkaroff back in Azkaban even after he gives up intelligence on the Death Eaters. Aberforth suggests to Neville that they should have Slytherin students as leverage/hostages. Sirius was about to execute Peter if Harry didn't step in. In the Prince's Tale, Snape pleads with Dumbledore not to kill him, suggesting that he could've used lethal force in the past.

The Order(and the Aurors) are also unfortunately just a heavy bag for the Death Eaters and Voldemort to wail on. Aurors are hyped to be dark wizard hunters, I was expecting magical Jason Bourne/Mitch Rapp/Courtland Gentry level of badasses where they pull up on dark wizards but instead they lose almost every engagement they're in. Moody, Tonks and Kingsley all go down in the battle of the DOM, making Dumbledore carry the Order through the fight. Tonks gets killed by DH, and John Dawlish is so incompetent I expect him to fuck up making a glass of water. He loses an unarmed Dirk Cresswell en route to Azkaban and gets outmatched by Neville's grandmother despite likely having the edge of trailing her and the fact that Augusta failed her Charms OWL.

*** I definitely agree with most of your thoughts thoughts; I definitely wanted to make sure bashing fics didn't capture the consensus of HP readers on the Order for once. I think Snape pleading might be simply what he expects, however, as a death eater. Dumbledore doesn't kill Grindewald and spends a whole book trying to protect the life of a death eater. It seems to me that Dumbledore is so skilled, he's never felt the need to try and kill someone right away. I could be wrong though, my memory of canon isn't perfect.

We don't know that. They might be fighting with other Death Eaters in the background, we just don't look there any more while we are focused on the Dumbledore-Tom fight.

**** Hermione said in HBP that Tonks was duelling Bellatrix before she lost and Sirius stepped in.

Kingsley straight up loses to Bellatrix after he takes over for Sirius.

"Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius's duel with Bellatrix....There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dias. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain"

Moody gets dispatched almost immediately after joining the fight when the Order showed up.

Aurors taking losses is one of my biggest pet peeves with the series. McGonagall takes about how tough it is to get in, with Tonks being the only candidate and none following her after but they frequently get their asses handed to them.

***** I think Kingsley might be one of the strongest Aurors there is. In Order of the Phoenix, he was dueling two Death Eaters at once (if I remember correctly). On the other hand, Bellatrix is an extremely talented which is why she was able to defeat him. Hell, she even blocks a curse from Dumbledore!

****** Kingsley also injured quite a few Death Eaters in the Battle of 7 Potters as well I believe.

That being said, Aurors just seem to take L after L in the series. Moody gets jumped in his own home and locked in a trunk. He goes down immediately after the Order joins the fight.

"For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody's magical eye spinning away across the floor.

Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee."

Tonks doesn't get much time to shine, she gets blasted by Bellatrix, spends HBP moping and gets killed in DH.

Dawlish is next to useless and even Hagrid said four Aurors couldn't take on McGonagall without the element of surprise. So what's the point of magical special forces if they're not special at all. All they do mostly is get their asses kicked. The DA lasted longer than Moody and Tonks in the Department of Mysteries.

***** Yeah, people seem to forget that the Death Eaters aren't an army, they're an insurgency. That means that asymmetrical warfare should be their greatest strength.

Aside from a few standout Death Eaters such as Bellatrix, most of them should /lose/ to Aurors in a straight up fight- hence why in the first war they ambushed people's homes, presumably outnumbering them by a significant margin instead of directly invading the Ministry. They should do everything they can to /not/ fight on even terms, and lose when they are forced to.

****** Yeah. The Longbottoms were outnumbered by the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jr, and the Prewett brothers were killed by 6 Death Eaters in the first war. They definitely operate as a terrorist cell rather than open warfare which Grindelwald did.

**** Tonks definitely is hit by Bellatrix and falls down. Later Moody is seen trying to revive her. I doubt she just got up at some point and started hexing the death eaters. That leaves only Remus, Kingsley and Sirius, and it was only when Dumbledore showed up that the death eaters really were stopped. We don't even get to see an order member hit a death eater with a curse that incapacitates him/her.

** A major plotpoint in the books is that Harry is the one who has issues with using spells that could cause death (Stan Shunpike). Dumbledore is a wizard of the calibre where he doesn't need to kill to beat everyone in the room. He's just on a different level to everyone else (except Voldemort) but he also isn't scared of dying in the same way normal people are. We don't know what every member of the Order thought about killing Death Eaters, but we know Lupin was fine with it and we see Molly fight to kill. We're told Moody always tried to catch Death Eaters alive, which suggests he killed when all else failed. I think the impression canon wants to give is that Harry is rare and special for not wanting to kill anyone except Voldemort, that this is one of the reasons he was such a good person, an extention of how he would sacrifice his own life for everyone else's life.

To answer the question, I think the Order wasn''t above using lethal magic but Harry was. Dumbledore was too talented to stoop to killing people, but I don't think he was philosophically against it.

** As other people have said, the order probably wasn't all that against lethal force. The problem is that we never see them use it to great effect.

It all ties in to the fact that adults in general seem extremely incompetent while the kids have to go around fixing the mess. It doesn't matter if there were moments (in the books) that adult characters shined. It doesn't matter, people don't tend to remember the details of a book they read a long time ago. They only remember the general feelings they got from it. And (imo) the general feeling was that adults that everyone build up as these awesome badasses ended up looking like incompetent fools.

We were told Dumbledore was this super wizard. The only one Tom feared. The defeater of Grindelwald that basically ended the War on his own. Where do we see that? The battle in the ministry? And then he drops dead a year later. So much for that all powerful wizard.

I think JKR's vision of the story was extremely different when she wrote the first book than what we got and that is creating a dissonance. It went from amazing mystical magic to /pew pew pew/ fighting. The movies didn't help with that either.

Again, I know there were moments and scenes where we do see bits and pieces of that kind of magic. But they are the minority in my memory. The general feeling doesn't really include them.

** What you've got to remember is that there are many lethal spells which are not the killing curse or dark magic. Any kind of blasting curse is basically an arcane grenade, any cutting curse a stroke of a sword and so on. If anything, a seriously injured enemy is better than a dead one since it forces your opponent to either have someone help them or listen to their screams as the wounded person tries to keep their guts inside. Against non-suicidal enemies, that is more efficient than outright killing them and one of the reasons why most military rifles switched to a smaller calibre in the past few decades.

And trying to take an enemy alive isn't necessarily stupid. You can interrogate them, and, assuming that you have a secure holding facility, you can keep them as hostages against their leadership (kill our people and yours will die as well).

OotP is pretty good with appropriate force usage. Where things get stupid is DH. Voldemort's charge should have ended like any WWI frontal assault, in a bloody slaughter of the attackers as they charge a fortified hilltop across hundreds of yards of open space. Hell, Sprout's mandrakes alone should have been enough to defeat the Death Eaters.

** The order is not against using lethal means to fight. They have their own personal ideologies that they follow. Dumbledore is so skilled that he does not need to go for lethal spells. Moody uses them as a last resort and it is implied that Lupin goes for the throat(anyone catch that reference). Sirius is also shown to be ruthless. Most of the order was fine with stunning the Death Eaters and let them plummet to their deaths. Harry is the only one shown to be reluctant to go for the kill and uses non lethal means.

This is unfortunate because this makes the order seem even worse as compared to Harry when we compare the fights in which both the order and Harry are present. Many people have commented about the battle in DOM so I won't.

I will however talk about the battle of Astronomy tower. Harry was the only combatant from the goods guys who was reluctant to use lethal means or was not running on Felix Felicis. And he was the only one to incapacitate a Death Eater in the entire battle. Yep neither the Order who knew about the possible attack and were prepared and capable of going lethal nor the DA running on Felix Felicis and had knowledge of where they were through the Marauders could take out a single death eater. Harry however after having a draining experience in the cave, having just suffered the loss of his mentor and being half mad with fury took out not 1 not 2 but 4 death eaters in his mad dash to get to Snape and Draco. 3 of them had initiated the fight with him and despite having surprise on their side were taken out quickly by Harry.

Just seeing this battle shows how incompetent the Order was. Harry does not go for lethal spells and does his best to take his opponents down non lethally because he is skilled enough to take out most threats using non lethal means. And the above battle demonstrates it.

*** but this is...bad would be an understatement. Or is dueling not supposed to make sense in this series? Because the order members surely have more experience. Remus fought in the first war. Tonks is an auror. And what about all that training DA got from Harry?

**** There is a reason the fate of the wizarding world depended on a seventeen year old with little training. People forget while making fun of Harry for being weak exactly how good he was despite Rowling constantly nerfing him into the ground. The entirety of the Order and DA presence at Hogwarts could not hold off 6 DE excluding Snape and Draco.

Only the ministry six answered the call for help. Hermione and Luna did not fight IIRC. Ginny was barely saving herself from getting /Crucioed/ until Harry came and slammed Carrow against a wall. Neville was lying on the ground injured and Ron was dueling a DE who fled. I think one or two members of DA were shown to be standing around confused.

As for the Order; Bill got mauled by Fenir who was promptly paralyzed by Harry when Fenir got the drop on him.

As soon as he escaped the Paralysis Harry promptly paralyzed Yaxley. He then dealt with Fenir and forced Carrow to disengage from Ginny. McGonagall, Lupin, Ron and Tonks were fighting presumably the remaining 3 death eaters (four if you count the Carrow Harry just fought. McGonagall forced the Carrow twins to flee while Harry did the same to Rowle. Notice how Lupin could not do anything despite being more ruthless than Harry. (This happened when Hermione, Ron, Luna, Ginny and Neville were under the influence of Felix Felicis and we know how OP it is. Presumably Hermione and Luna would have died if they fought so they were not in the fight)

As he was reaching the grounds Harry was ambushed by the twins and took spells to his back before he took them out with an Imperdiment Jinx. Gibbons died from friendly fire (an AK). This takes care of everyone but Rowle who managed to flee after setting Hagrid's hut on fire.

People forget the amount of fatigue Harry must have been under by the time he reached Snape. He had to deal with the cave which was a really high stress situation and taxing. Then there was the death of his mentor and the multiple fights he got into and the spells he took on the way there. Add in that he was doing this in a dead sprint to catch up to Snape who had not gotten into single fight and was left to flee unimpeded. That fight was already stacked against him. Not saying that he could have taken Snape if he was fresh but that the fight was far from fair and Harry was far from weak.

** My thought is that the order would have been more lethal during the first wizarding war where the aurors could use unforgivables on death eaters, so if they had Aurors in their folds those people could get away with it. We don't see what the Order really gets up to in DH, but before that they'd effectively be killing people in what the ministry considers peacetime.

** I remember thinking that the order is no good at fighting because they don't seem all that successful. I actually got the impression they don't generally kill and are sort of more on the defensive. But I forgot what Remus said to Harry. And the text made such a big deal about Molly being prepared to kill that I was more annoyed about it than impressed. I made a post recently asking whether an order member had any chance in a duel against Bellatrix. Some responses went on about how Bellatrix has nothing to lose and is willing to go further than any of the order. Fine. But if this is the reason, then I hate the order. They are just a bunch of fools. Dumbledore didn't capture her either, so I'm still curious how powerful she really is. And quite honestly, I can't believe that the order wouldn't know what she's capable of. And if she is willing to go pretty far, then why on earth don't they start using dark magic against her or something? Tonks and Kingsly are literaly trained to face someone like her and she finishes them off pretty quickly.

*** Aurors are not front line infantry. Remember how Fudge says that it took a group of Hit Wizards to arrest Sirius?

Also, there's a reason why the police has special forces to deploy against armed terrorists and a reason why they try to force situations where they massively outnumber said terrorists.

You only want to engage when you are sure that you'll win. But in the DoM, they were forced to go in since retreating or not going there would have meant leaving the kids to die.
