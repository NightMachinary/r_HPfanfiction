A black comedy

​

I don't think that i need to introduce this particular fic, but what do you think of it?

It has a lot of troopy stuff, and some cliche lines and some of the things that may screw up many fics, but for me it remains one of the best i've read that i keep re reading, Just the light tone of it and the banter makes me appreciate it, and the best thing is that it doesn't try to stick to one thing, but it does move from adventure to another.

​

Without harry turning into angst drama filled kid

Edit: Linking the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][Here]]


** This is actually one of my fav fics. I love it because it doesn't take itself seriously. It's a parody that makes me laugh. That's why I love it. It also is a little dif in that Harry becomes Sirius' partner instead of vis versa and that makes it fresher than most fics with this many cliches. It's teaching old cliches new tricks. :) I actually have this fic saved and archived JIC it's taken down somehow.

** It's a product of its time that has aged poorly since.

The original books used timeless situational humor that fits the context and characters involved (Harry mouthing off to Snape with the "No need to call me 'Sir', Professor" line), which is funny and doubles as Harry losing his temper when lashing out in a situation where he is made to feel powerless. They're not just funny moments, but great character-building moments.

Fanfic humor uses OOC exaggerated traits for cheap laughs ("Ron stuffs his face like a glutton" or "Dumbledore laces his lemon drops with loyalty potions"), referential humor, and "punching down" humor. ABC uses "punching down" humor in spades, which loses its charm in the current age where alternative lifestyles and experiences are no longer acceptable as a quality by which to use for teasing or ridicule.

This is why ABC's midget jokes, "teehee, no homo XD", and Nappy the house elf jokes no longer land as well as they did when the fic was first published.

The rest of the comedy has the "popcorn humor" of a frathouse flick. Like the fanfic equivalent of Zoolander, it features zany character antics, which, due to the suspension of disbelief in crackfics, don't have to follow the rules of OOC that more serious fics are expected to adhere. Memorable, quotable zinger one-liners, like Zoolander's "But why male models?" or "Is this a house for ants?". And just as many juvenile jokes that are more antic than real jokes, like the situation where Sirius and Harry slept with the Bones women. "Haha, I banged the aunt, and you banged the niece, isn't that weird, teehee XD".

You can read it and find it funny, but I'd personally hesitate in recommending it to others, unless I know their tastes well.

*** The one thing I'd like to add to this comment (it's pretty spot-on) is that underneath the humor is actually a fairly decent plot with a well-foreshadowed twist at the end. I'm always fascinated by this, actually, because you /really/ don't normally associate "lowbrow fratboy humor" with "good plot," but here we are.

It's pretty much the only thing that has me still recommending it on occasion.

**** It's popular, but only within a certain subset of HP fanfic readers. On [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/a-black-comedy-by-nonjon-m.5224/][Dark Lord Potter]], it's rated as one of the top fics on the site.

It's very similar to HPMOR being hugely popular within another subset of readers, the Rationalist community, who like reading fics about insufferable SI's and MC's going around +breaking the setting+ fixing shit, because they're the only ones smart and competent enough to do it.

***** Hey no need to sell me on it

MOR is a major to pain to read for me, as a matter of fact the only part i liked about it was the scene in the tailor shop, for some reason it tickled my funny bone, but otherwise it didn't click with me and dropped it couple of chapters later.

​

I know that i would never be able to read that fic.

Another fic that i absolutely hated that has this type of things was harry potter and the daft morons, the premise was good, but the over use of cliche and the thousand repetition of the word daft moron and generally the way of writing made me contemplate actually breaking my laptop for a bit

**** I'd like to clarify myself if I may on this one. When I wrote the review I had somehow managed to convince myself that the depiction of Nappy was not as deliberate as it obviously was, and that it was simply borrowing from an unconscious image of slaves held by the author. This was obviously overly naïve and incorrect.

That said, what exactly IS the purpose of using satire of house elves this way? There's room to argue (and some of the commenters certainly did) that portraying house elves as Black American slaves is subversive because it is a criticism of the blasé attitude the Wizarding World holds about their enslavement. That you can equate the two and that if one is absurd to accept, so too must the other be. If even now I believed that this was the intention of the joke, then I would eat my words about that whole section. However, absolutely nothing in the story's content serves to bring this joke full circle.

Not just the bad guys, but the good guys keep slaves and have zero qualms about it, even characters (like Harry) who did have qualms about it in canon. Sirius sodomises an unconscious house elf and this is portrayed as fine and hilarious. There is not a single character or even throwaway line that draws any attention to the ridiculousness and awfulness of house elves as slaves, even with this exaggerated portrayal. Kingsley Shacklebolt doesn't give anyone the side-eye about it. No muggles or muggleborns gape at it. Harry doesn't bat an eye at his parents owning one. There's no meta wink at the audience anywhere - it's just played straight the whole way through.

So if it's not an unconscious association on the author's part, then the portrayal is not as insidious as I made it sound. However, I'm not going to go so far as to say that it wasn't racist. It's still using black Americans as an acceptable target and playing straight that while their being enslaved might be absurd, it's also hilarious and look how funny they talk. It's one of those things in humour in general where you get away with the joke by calling it satire through exaggeration, but without saying anything at all about the issue itself. So slavery isn't the butt of the joke here - the slaves are.

And I should point out as well that the type of humour shown throughout the rest of the fic is mostly about punching down at 90's acceptable targets. Is it more likely that the author chose to be subversive and statement-making about this one issue while using punch-down humour about all the other minority groups, or is the humour consistent on this front too? My money is on the latter.

The part about the author being white was mentioned only to tie back into my earlier comment about how I could tell far too much about who was writing the story based on what they were writing. Honestly I'd be quite interested in getting the opinion of an actual African American on this one, but I'm pretty damn sure they wouldn't have written it this way.

***** I think the elves-as-slaves thing is just another example of the fic's lowbrow humor. Elves are a slave race, so what's the most obvious parallel to that? Actual slaves. What's the leading pop culture perception of RL slaves in the US? (I'm assuming the author is American.) Black people working on antebellum plantations for their master/mistress and singing "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" to themselves. Take a house elf, give her a stereotypical slave's speech patterns, have her sing while working, and voila, a low-effort joke character.

To be clear, I'm not advocating that any of this makes it /okay./ But I think it's a possible explanation for the character's origin.

(You might have already said this in different words. I kind of skimmed your comment.)
