A friend and I were talking about the potential implications of Draco succumbing to sectumsempra. Does Snape die because of his unbreakable vow? Does Harry even become master of death? How does Dumbledore die? Etc.

Is there a fic that explores this? I don't usually read Draco, so I'm not familiar with what's out there. TIA if you're able to help steer me in the direction of a fic my friend might like!


** Even if Draco dies, Snape would not be dying as he had no legitimate way of saving Draco if he simply was late or did not know Draco was dying.

The wording matters:

*Narcissa: "Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?"

Snape: "I will."

Narcissa: "And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"

Snape: "I will."

Narcissa: "And should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail... will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"

Snape: "I will."*

And as Snape does not die, rest will still go in similar vain cause the vow does not put a time limit, and as long as Snape still plans to kill him at some point.

The DEs coming in to Hogwarts will change though, and might not even happen, instead end of the year we just see Snape kill Dumbledore and be with it

Edit' thought I was in general HP sub and not the fanfic.. I will leave the comment though.

No fanfic recs though

*** That's a great point though! I appreciate your input... especially if I can't find a fic, I might have to write one! üòâ

** So I actually wrote a fic on this. I'm sure you'll find grammar errors and it is marked as incomplete but it is a one shot. I haven't decided to turn it into a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù for the rest of books 6&7. Right now I'm working on ATLA fics. I've seen some other stories like that but they are all Draco/Harry stories and I'm not into slash. I tried to be realistic with it, but I think I made Harry more intelligent than he actually is.

** There's a fic where Snape doesn't get there in time, but I can't remember it.

*** Why would Harry struggle with killing Malfoy? He had no qualms about Quirrel and Quirrel did not do nearly as much evil as Malfoy? Malfoy was trying to torture him, it was valid self defence and not his first kill.

**** I mean, one man housing Voldemort and the other is a boy who was raised wrong, and in the end didn't want to kill. I'd be sad about the latter

***** One committed a long list of crimes, the worst you can pin on the other would be killing the unicorn if that is criminal and not merely sacrosanct or endangerment from the troll.

Treason, aiding Voldemort and such (if applicable) apply to both.

  Sectumsempra for enemies, Harry thinks. And Malfoy crashes to the ground with a soft thud. Draco bleeds to death in the Slytherin bathrooms, and Harry struggles to cope with what he has done.
