I, being the idiot I am just realized (after 7 years in the fandom) that 'Remus Lupin' comes from the names 'Remus' the twin brother of Romulus who is said to be the founder of Rome that nursed from the goddess 'Lupa'.

Also Remus (the historical figure) dies *following the end* of an dispute about where to build the city of Rome. Similarly Remus Lupin die in the *final battle* against blood purists on how their society should operate concerning the matters of blood purity.

Wt do u guys think?


** Nah, JKR was just determined to make him the wolf guy.

She certainly has a way with her character names:

Sirius was the Dog Star, and his initial was SOB (Sirius Orion Black)

Pandora Lovegood conducted dangerous research and it blew up in her face

Arthur Weasley named his daughter Ginevra (or Guinevere in English, wife of King Arthur).

Tom Marvolo Riddle could easily become â€˜Marvel Motor Dildo'

Fleamont Potter was a great duelist because people made fun of his name

Scorpius Malfoy, enough said

Albus Severus Potter....

At least, I'm really glad she didn't go with the name Hermione Puckle.

I dunno, her violent tendencies go well with being related to a guy who invented a gun that, among other features, shot square bullets that would, in his estimation, hurt more when they hit. Expressly for use against non-christian enemies.
