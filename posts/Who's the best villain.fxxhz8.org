So, a recent thread about interesting villain ideologies - link below - got me thinking. What are the best villains in HP Fanfiction? I know the obvious answer is 'Voldemort and the DEs, duh', given that they are the series villains, but I'm looking for specific examples of fics that wrote their villains well.

Did a fic do Voldemort particularly well? Or make Lucius an interesting villain? Or even just turn Draco into a threat instead of an idiot who got lucky? Or actually made Villain!Ron an interesting character? Is there an OC villain that you thought was particularly cool?

What fics wrote their version of whatever character they made their villain in a really fun, interesting, or generally good way? Who made their villains human and relatable? Was there a Knight Templar villain that appealed? Or an egotist desperately striving to prove themselves? An altruist gone down the path of violence? The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all that.

So yeah. Fics with a good villain, or one you took particular note of, please. They don't have to be canon villains, they can be good-guys-turned/revealed-as-bad, or OCs, or SIs, minor league or Big Bads (main antagonists), cool random enemy soldiers/agents, or whatever else. They just have to be villains or antagonists in the story you recommend.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

** I mean I'd say the obvious answer is Umbridge - everyone talks about how she's so much more hateable than Voldemort because Voldemort is a fairy tale villain, whereas Umbridge is very /real/. But she tends not to be as good in fics because fics tend to bash her (understandably, since we all like seeing her taken down a notch).

Personally I've liked the way linkffn(Innocent) and linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) (in 3rd year) use Greyback. He's vicious and cruel (and a perfect counterpart for Lupin), but he's barely used at all in canon, so he's prime villain material for fics.

I forget which, but one of the above fics makes the interesting point that Wolfsbane Potion is near-impossible to find because it's highly regulated, /specifically/ because if Greyback got his hands on it, he'd use it to turn entire villages of muggles and raise a werewolf army.

*** Yeah, that's a really good point (and a really weird thing to suddenly get pointed out to you), actually. Greyback is underused in fanfic, isn't he? He gets a pretty eh death in Make a Wish and the only time I really remember seeing him particularly prominently is in fourth-year fics where they already removed Pettigrew and Barty from play and that one fic where Cedric gets turned and freaks out at his Dad's racism at Werewolves (no idea what it was called though).

I do like that idea - Greyback being that dangerous that he impacts international policy is really interesting. I think I've read The Accidental Animagus (though it's so long, I remember bugger all of it aside from the start), but Innocent is new to me. I'll check 'em both out (and if I finish them before this thread gets archived, I'll letcha know which one is the dangerous Greyback control-Wolfsbane-potions one).

** I really liked Peter Pettigrew in Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235). He's a lot smarter and more competent than canon and most fanon Peters, and his hatred for James and Sirius is understandable.

Pureblood Pretense + sequels linkffn(7613196) has my favorite Tom Riddle in fanfiction. It's an AU where Riddle became a politician instead of a Dark Lord, and the author does a great job of making him sinister and dangerous without being a deranged terrorist.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

And man, Prince of Slytherin gets more and more interesting every time I hear something about it. I can't wait for it to reach the top of my to-read list (About two-dozen from the top now, ish).

Thanks for the recs!

*** How lemony we talkin'? Could I skip the sex scenes and not miss out on plot? I find them very dull, so I tend to skip them more often than not.

And what's good about the villains? What did you like about what they did? Were they particularly evil, particularly cunning, sympathetic, interesting in motive or planning, etc?

**** Very lemony and it does drive a lot of the hero side plot.

Umbridge is the big bad, not Voldemort. She basically uses him and the Dumbles/Harry sides as stalking horses to consolidate power en route to going full Nazi. Even cooperates with muggles to get what she wants. Other than the hamfisted Fox News/Boris Johnson is totally the same as Umbridge, I thought it was well written and pretty chilling.

Umbridge sounds very interesting there - I do love a good competent sociopath. Sounds very like Palpatine in whatever we're calling the 1-3 movies trilogy these days, but scary instead of camp.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
