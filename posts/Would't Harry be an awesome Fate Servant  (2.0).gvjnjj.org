Hey guys, awhile back i made a post similar to this one, where i idealized Harry as a Caster class servant.

Well im back, and after some great ideas from you and VNs as well i may have improved this idea.

Name: Harry James PotterClass: RiderTitles: The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, The Master of Death.Age: Late teens/Early twenties.

Overall description. Harry Potter is the legendary British wizard hero that defeated the tyrant Voldemort and freed the European warlocks from it's opression, having faced dangers from his early life, and tricking death each time, his name became a legend, and his existance a symbol of freedom, his wish for the grail is to simply be able to move to the afterlife.

Habilities: Harry was a very powerful wizard in life, with his faithful Holly and Phoenix wand he's capable of working miracles trough magic, he's also an advanced user of mind arts, being able to invade and defend making him a formidable foe, as advantage he has a pretty high luck in adition to a very strong will wich makes him pratically invulnarable to external mental influences, trough one of his Noble Phantasms he's capable of independent action and is also able to speak the ancient language of the snakes, in spite of the basilisk venom and the phoenix tears in his blood, he is immune to all toxics and heals pretty fast.

Noble Phantasms:

The Deathly Hallows: Objects of great power, wielded by his ancestors and that were said to be gifts from Death itself.The Deathstick: The wand of destiny is the most powerful magic wand in the world, when used by Harry it can increase his magical power to the highest level, turning a simple blasting curse into an explosion with the power of an anti fortress NP.\\
The Peverell Family Ring (The Stone of ressurrection): A necromantic artifact that links Harry to the dead, allowing him to summon shades of the deceased, that can provide him with information, sometime during the second wizard war, the ring was tainted with dark magic, carrying a very powerful withering curse that can weaken the ones affected by it.\\
The Cloak of Death: A silvery and very regal looking cloak that is always attached to Harry's shoulders, when activated it grants him the power to hide his existance from everything, only being detected by the highest levels of Clairvorance, the cloak also protects the user from centain damage.\\
His status as the master of Death is another Noble Phantasm, that makes him able to use the power of independent action, as Master of Death his existance as a spirit in the world don't cost him any mana and as long as the artifacs are whole he can't be destroyed or "killed".

The Sword of Gryffindor: Used by Harry to slay the king of serpents, is a very elegant blade with and eternal sharpness to it, and don't old or rust, the blade has the power to absorb all of that can strenghts it, having in it's core the venom of the basilisk defeated by Harry while he was 12, making the sword an extremelly toxic object with a poison that just have one cure.

Hedwig: A very smart Snowy Owl, that scouts and sends messages for him.

Buckbeak: The Hippogriff tamed by Harry when he was 13 and then became one of his most trusted allies, Buckbeak protected him from a werewolf attack and fought by his side during the battle of Hogwarts.

The Hogwarts Thestral herd: Capable of travel long distances, Thestrals just can be seen for those who witnessed death, they're skeletal like horses with a like for meat, are capable of flying long distances and have a very good orientation sense.

The White Ulkranian Ironbelly: Harry has a story with dragons, being able to speak with their limbless cousins, facing one when he was thirteen and then, freeing and riding the Ironbelly during his hunt for the Horcruxes.His Dragon Ride is the most powerful of them, it's able of breathing fire, is very fast and strong, it even has almost total magic resistance, but in the end, it's not Harry's most powerful NP.

Reality Marble - Hogwarts: Harrys trump card is Hogwarts itself, once summoned this reality marble reproduces the place most loved by Harry in his life, it has everything that will fight alongside him.The castle is a terrain that Harry knows very well, all of it's corridors, secret passages and towers, once there he can use one of his minor Noble Phantasms, The marauders map that makes everyone within the castle, trackable by him, it also has all of the ones that fought with him, including the Dumbledore's Army, The Order of the Phoenix, The Mermen and the Giant Squid in the black Lake, the Giant and Acromantula in the forest and even the house elves, Hogwarts even has very powerful wards that are almost impenetrable by normal means, making go on against Harry inside this Reality Marble, suicide.

Obviously the power of certain artifacts and habilities were buffed by his legend in truth everyone knows that the Hallows were just artifacts created by the Peverell Brothers, but the legend overcame the truth and in the end the NP became more than the relics itself.\\
I would include the Firebolt and it's in fact one of his minor NP like the marauders map, but you guys have to admit, a broom is pretty pathetic compared to a Hipogriff or a Dragon.

That's it.Hope you guys liked the idea !
