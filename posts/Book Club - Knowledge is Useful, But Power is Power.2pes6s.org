Sorry everybody, I've been busy and kept putting this off.

The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]].

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power]]?

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

** It's been a long time since I'd read it, but my impression was generally negative. Here's what I remember:

- It had interesting, original ideas.

- The technicals were good.

- The character interaction was generally good, they were generally IC, though I recall Harry and Hermione being somewhat OOC in the fanonish direction.

- The premise involved huge, plot-making/shattering differences in arbitrary, unearned, costless magical power; and, arbitrarily giving an arbitrarily chosen character overwhelming unearned power always leaves a poor aftertaste, at least for me. It doesn't mean that it's not worth reading, it just means that the rest of the story needs to be that much better.

- Perhaps I am forgetting something --- so please correct me if I am wrong --- but I don't think the narrative gave due consideration to the notion that it may, in fact, be a /good thing/ that the society --- however flawed or corrupt --- binds its most powerful wizards: in a world where randomly selected individuals are endowed with overwhelming and unmediated (by things like society, the way power of wealth is) personal power, it may, in fact, be morally justifiable to limit their ability to exercise it. I am not taking any particular stance on whether it is justified and how it should be done, but I recall the story being entirely one-sided in that respect; please correct me if I am misremembering.

*Edit:*

- To expand on the above point, consider the very title of this fic: it's basically a dismissal of something that is earned through investment of time and effort, something that can be shared and accumulated without being diminished, in favour of an arbitrary magical power meter specific to a given person that appears to be set at birth. Which side are we supposed to be rooting for, again?

*** Character interactions were a touch weird. Harry didn't consult Hermione enough and it left them basically avoiding actual discussion.

Overall it was a good read, my one point of technical complaint would be the different aspects of magic. Find it hard to believe a single person could awake "Magic" and then manipulate it.

I remember thinking that it was a pretty standard Gray!Indy!Harry dynamic in that respect: Hermione gets sidelined, occasionally popping in to provide strawman arguments about the morality of what Harry is doing or planning, while Harry does his Gray, Indy things to Do What Must Be Done, etc.. In other words, OOCish in fanon direction. In this case, the premise exacerbates this dynamic, since the whole thing about only one of those two having Power in effect means that only one of them has any agency.

** I liked the story and thought it well-written, exploring some lesser known aspects of magic (or Magic if you will). However, I feel like the author bit off more than he could chew by giving Harry the power of 'channelling' magic, and the side-plot was kind of pointless. I liked the character interactions, as well as the ideas of a corrupt ministry. I think it was a well-done story that wasn't over-clich√©d but could have used better planning.

** - I really enjoyed the idea of Magical Oaths controlling the power players to limit their power

- I thought this was one of the best original ideas in order to cause a 'Harry vs the Ministry of Magic' scenario

- I really disliked the premise that you were either born with Power or you were not.

There does not seem to be the possibility of increasing one's power by any means, thus causing Harry to essentially be a Gary Stu. He is powerful without a powerful enemy.

I think that the author realized this later in the story and then invented another antagonist, Magic. Because this section was not part of the author's original plan for the story, and grew as an idea almost out of a plot bunny, it did not mesh very well with the rest of the story.

IMO, it would have been best to end the story with Harry ending Voldemort in the Crystal garden and to allow the reader to imagine now the world reacts to Harry's changes.

** The story started boring, then had some really good spots when Harry was powerful and all the angst about the weak fearing power.

Then it became this absolute dumpster fire when it tried to make "Magic" into a woman. The story messed around for 3 chapters going no where and losing it's initial vision: Harry bringing down to corrupt government.

You could see the author going "Screw this!" and ending it on the very last episode, leaving all sorts of plots lines hanging.

Ultimately, a very unsatisfying end to an otherwise interesting plot and a decent build up.

** I liked the Harry vs. M of Magic but the raw power rules over experience I didn't like. I also didn't like the style of writing, it had very short sentences and minimal wording variation, IMHO it made Harry seem pretty stupid.

** The bits about enchanted objects that build up incredible structures really struck home with me, just that made this story one of my favorites. It's such a good idea I just want to see more of it!\\
One of the reason why I love Hogwarts so much is because the building feels to me like it is rooted in magic, secret passages, towers and dungeons that in my mind are like some Escher drawing incarnated (and that's why I didn't watch the movies, the castle just looks too plain). If you know stories with similar concepts feel free to point me that way!\\
On the minus side:\\
* The plot of the story is captivating but fails to deliver in many aspects and after a while strays from the original path and wonders off in other, interesting but ultimately unimportant directions.\\
* Hermione feels a bit pointless overall, I expected her to be either in or out of the game, not some kind of walking moral system for Harry\\
I liked the story but I have the feeling that I loved more the ideas that were put into the story than the actual story itself, does it make any sense?
