*** 40 upvotes for the thread - I'd say there's some interest. I certainly think it sounds like an interesting change to Harry as auror.

**** Alright, I'll give it a go. Don't expect anything for a while (or maybe at all) but I'll try my best to produce something. If that happens, I'll post a topic here so that you guys know.

Cheers!
