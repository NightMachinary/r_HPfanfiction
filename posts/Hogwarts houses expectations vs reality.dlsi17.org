How do the description of the houses, the fanon idea of the houses, and the canon characters from a house differ?

So there is a description that a sorting hat gives for the houses which can be kinda broad and there are the typical type of people the fans expect to be in the house. Both of these ( or at least one) can conflict with how the canon characters from the houses are depicted.

For example Ravenclaw. Its the house of intelligence. It wants intelligent knowledgable people who like learnin.

Yet the characters known for being intelligent in series arent Ravenclaw. Hermione Dumbledore Tom Riddle Jr /Voldy Snape Grinderwald Lilly Potter

Not to say that Ravenclaws arent smart or knowledgable. But they often are not the conventionally smart the way people think of conventionally intelligent people. The Ravenclaws you meet for the most are specialized in things or have hyperfixations or both and regardless of practical application.

Ollivander good at making wands passionate about it

Lockheart passionate about being popular good at memory charms

Trawleny obsessed with Divination ...somehow botn the best and worst at it

Luna: obsessed with knowing conspiracy theories knows like all of them

Etc

Now with the exception of maybe Ollivander none of these people i listed are the intelligent archetype or what you think of as intelligent. But what they are is thirsty for knowledge. A very specific set of knowledge though. Not in all subjects like Hermione who may be the archetypical Ravenclaw but resembles few cannonical ones Ravenclaws are highly specialized in knowledge. Maybe even useless knowledge. Still knowledge, but that doesnt necessarily make them intelligent.

So have you noticed this with other houses? Or do you have more things to add about Ravenclaw discrepencies?


** Well we aren't show most of the positive things about ravenclaw because in canon just about every house seems vastly inferior to Gryffindor seeing as almost our entire cast is made up for them.

*** Ah ya you do have to assume that the Ravenclaws you see are representative of Ravenclaws at large which isnt necessarily true but you do get some good representation in slytherin and for pottermore if you count it at all your House letter is from Merlin. And Slytherin is the evil house so i think you can still extrapolate good qualities from the limited info you get.

** Honestly Ravenclaw gets the short end of the stick. You should have either academically savvy characters who raise their hand in class and otherwise compete with Hermione (I love hermione, but canon hermione isn't the only one who can read. There's no reason why every other student forgets how to answer questions) or characters that dive into esoteric branches of magic and otherwise push their boundaries. But they don't do literally anything except bully Luna in canon, which turns them into the mean group.... except that already belongs to the Slytherins. Do we even meet ravenclaws in the Order? Do they do anything? The fact that they're so interested in knowledge and somehow irrelevant to everything in canon is bullshit. At least the Hufflepuffs get Cedric and Tonks. I love Luna, but her personality is distinctly defined, and as a main-ish character she doesn't work well as an example of a good Ravenclaw. JKR dropped the ball

**** I love Luna too! I just think it ruins what makes her character special if we assume all Ravenclaws are like her. I think she's one of a kind, and also represents some of the best potential of the House. I just think that the average one is probably just a smart kid, none of whom show up in the books.

***** Ok but up to (I think it was?) OOTP, you guys have got Cho. She's pretty much a jock - good at Quidditch, popular, gets the handsome boy (Cedric), and everybody generally either likes her or wants to date her. You guys also get Ollivander (which is arguably good/meh depending on your POV), so Ravenclaw isn't exactly dry on good/established characters. But I do get your point, they're not as great as the characters we have in Gryffindor.

Also, may I suggest the Anguis series by Slide (since this is a HPFF subreddit), she creates really good OCs, and in it is a spunky lil Ravenclaw called Nat Lockett - she's smart, popular, cute, and most importantly, doesn't buy very much into house biases and prejudices (but she's also far from perfect - see her traumatised characterisation in the Stygian Trilogy)

** Hermione resembles few canon Ravenclaws because she's not an archetypical one lol. She's an archetypical Gryffindor swot. Look at Remus, McGonagall, and Percy. She fits right in with them. Intelligent and rational. Percy and Remus less so, but still.

Trelawney, Luna, Xeno, and Ollivander, who all probably are archetypical Ravenclaws, all have one thing in common: they're weird. Or eccentric. Oddballs if you will. Ravenclaw isn't just the house of wit and learning. It's also the house of eccentrics and creatives.

When I was younger I expected them to fit their houses perfectly. Only Tom Riddle and Slughorn do and that's perfect. Well rounded characters and it fits the choice theme like a puzzle piece.

If only we saw more growth...

** My headcanon is that the Hat doesn't put you according to the qualities you /have/ but according to the qualities you /value/ the most. That is why people like Granger, Dumbledore and the Dark Lord are in different houses rather than Ravenclaw.

*** I super like this head canon and of course they are all young with room the grow and change. So maybe they don't start out smart and just want to be smart and value knowledge and grow up around with people with similar values and desires in a culture that pushes you towards that so eventually by the time you leave school you might fit people's ideas of a typical Ravenclaw more than you did in school. And this can be true for the distinctive qualities of all the houses

*** I think you have to have both. You can't get into a House you aren't qualified for, but of the ones you do qualify for, the Hat puts you into the one you value the most. Rowling said the Hat offered Hermione Ravenclaw, and it took a long, long time to decide. Hermione even says to Harry that friendship and bravery are more important than books and cleverness, and that Harry has much more than her of the former, for all she has of the latter.

** I think that we see many of the more egregious examples of this house or that house, but rarely focus on everyone else who I think are in fact the majority. Remember how the hat goes about sorting Harry for instance? It doesn't say 'you have 25% courage vs 11% intelligence, therefore you go to GRYFFINDOR!' I imagine some people (see: Lily, Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy) have such exemplary showing of one house or the other, but in the overwhelming number of cases its the Sorting Hat merely eliminating each House to find the one that fits the kid more appropriately. Most sorted people are like Colin Creevey or Peter Pettigrew or Percy Weasley - that just appears to have been the best fit for their personality at the age of eleven.

And that doesn't even get into the effect of /being/ in one house or the other. Think about it - you enter a group at possibly the most impressionable period of your life, spending seven years within a group that is based specifically around certain virtues, ethics and behaviors. Of course you are going to become more like that just by existing in that (for lack of a better term) culture. And thats not even getting into the affect that peers with similar character traits will have on one another (the term group think stands out here for me). To be honest, the Houses are in many ways kind of an Orwellian nightmare of influence.

Perhaps one of the most poignant lines in all of Harry Potter was Dumbledore's "Sometimes I think we sort to early." Sorting has a profound affect on each individual, and in many ways shapes them along a particular path.

*** I mean wanting recognition and appreciation is knowledge for a different goal. It's a less dramatic goal than Riddle or Dumbledore but in my opinion it still is very Slytherin. Hermione might be smart but I honestly see her more of a mix of Griffindor and Slytherin than Griffindor and Ravenclaw that might actually be more like the Weasely twins. Very intelligent to be able to come up with their inventions but could care less about being recognized for good grades of applying themselves for any reason other than their passions

** I've always had the head canon that Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are the bigger houses.

When it comes down to it they're boring houses. A normal person who wants to do well in their new school => Ravenclaw. A normal person who hopes to have a friend in their new school => Hufflepuff. You have to be a special type of person to go to Gryffindor or Slytherin, other than those who just default there for family reasons. Stories are about special people because regular people are boring. The moment you make them proactive with the knowledge/ability they acquired then they're probably in the wrong house. If they're using it for their own reasons its a Slytherin thing, if they're doing it because its the right thing to do then that is pretty Gryffindorish.

Since in my mind Ravenclaws and Hufflepuff are full of normal regular people who just happen to be witches and wizards then it makes sense for them to not interact with Harry all that much and we see 95% of the books from his perspective. Harry is special, he does special things. He tends to interact with special people.

Take fifth year, when the DA started is when we see Harry branch out a bit. We see some regular Ravenclaws, they come they study they leave. Its only the special/bizarre one who sticks around. Its not that they don't want to know more, its that they're normal people who are just more focused on academics than others.

Being sorted into Ravenclaw doesn't make anyone a genius any more than Neville gets over his fears instantly because he went to Gryffindor. Its about goals and values.

*** I mean to be fair all the house traits are common things kids wish they had or do have. So I don't think based on qualities alone Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are more likely to be big.

But I think Hufflepuff might be the biggest because while each founder had qualities they wanted in the sorting hat song Hufflepuff said she'd take everyone. Yes everyone just and fair but also everyone who has no strong leaning towards any house. And while the other 3 houses have common enough traits to have many students , they are specific enough traits that might not fit many people too.

So yes this does give Hufflepuff the reputation of being the leftover house the ones that didn't fit in anywhere else. But that's not a negative thing . It means you couldn't be put into a box. It shows flexibility and being well rounded in indicates uniqueness and individuality .

Honestly I would have loved it if Hufflepuff had no defining qualities and were initially mocked but soon were shown to be really the best house as a result of being able to explore themselves without feeling the pressure to identify with any specific qualities and became known as the house of individuality

Gryffindor: You must be bold and unafraid. Ravenclaw: You must enjoy study.

Hermione's hand is constantly the one in the air, demanding to give answers. The Ravenclaws, who are either less intelligent but value study more or are just as if not MORE intelligent and just want to learn quietly are thanking their stars she isn't in their House.

** There's Ernie, the pompous Hufflepuff. And the ones that were cruel to Harry during GoF. That doesn't seem to mesh with the general accepting, friendly stereotype they have.

It's difficult as a reader to think too long on the house system and make sense of it. Cause what we're told (by the hat, character preconceptions, etc) is mostly stereotypes and those obviously aren't great for truly understanding a group, in any setting.

Honestly, I like to think that the actual sorting doesn't say that much about people. Most 11 year olds are probably nearly blank slates in regards to their house qualities, anyway. The importance given to the specific differences between the houses is only so heavy because people (students, alum, etc) regard it as such.

I imagine the sorting hat sorts people in certain houses based on balancing numbers, staff availability, etc as much as anything else.

And in terms of attributes, I imagine it's like liberal arts colleges choosing students in essence - certain schools may value a person creative initiative, others may care more about the gpa's, others still may look for certain extracurriculars or legacies. That doesn't mean that there aren't all sorts of different people in all of these schools. I know it's not a perfect analogy, but it's the best I can come up with at the moment.

So the hat will consider a few things when sorting, but all in all, these gifts and differences are a lot less pronounced (at the very least during the beginning) than the school culture gives it credit for.

That's how I've come to (kind of) make sense of it, anyway. I know this doesn't directly answer your question but it felt tangentially relevant.

** Canon Slytherin seems to a shithole infested with rampant bigotry and racism. No one seems to be bothered by Malfoy's actions or the image that paints of them. Not one person from there wished to stay and fight against Voldemort, which on its own says enough about that house (and evacuating civilians from an area of imminent battle is smart and right, not discrimination).

In comparison, fanon Slytherin is the house of high culture.
