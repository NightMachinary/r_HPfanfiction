Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog Card in the first book mentions that he "enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling". But... this never comes up. Not in canon, and, which I finder stranger, never in fanfiction that I recall. He loves /sweets/, and that's what fanfics use and overuse (especially sherbet lemons/lemon drops), but these two things just never seem to catch people's eye. Am I wrong? Do you know of any fics that mention these hobbies? Even in passing! (Copies of the Chocolate Frog Card's text do not qualify.)


** I wondered about this for a long time too, which is why I included the 'Dumbledore holds his staff meeting in a bowling alley' scene in Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

** You know, I've been working on a fanfic where Sirius escapes in Harry's second year. One of the chapters I've partially written takes place after the botch up that is Lockheart's dueling club.

Basically Dumbledore creates objects for the students to shoot their spells at to improve their aim and music comes out of them in the theme of In the Hall of the Giants when they get all the targets in the right order. I've got two chapters before that happens to still write though. I thought that would epitomize the fun and wonder aspect of the Harry Potter series that's so often missing from stories, they are initially children's books, there should be fun.

I'm really glad someone else is giving credit to Dumbledore's other interests, he's such a fascinating character.

**** I liked it but I am not a fan of Sherlock and it has fem:watsonXSherlock which some people may find strange.

I would recommend that you give it a go.
