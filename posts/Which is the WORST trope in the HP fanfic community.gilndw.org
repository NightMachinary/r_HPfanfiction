I hate a lot of tropes, but the one I hate the most is when Sirius calls Harry "pup" or Moony calls Harry "cub". Which is your most hated one?


** I hate super motivated and overpowered Harry. I mean I get why he might want to learn magic to beat Voldemort, but I hate it when he decides to actually try and learn and then bam next chapter he has learned everything there is to know and it is like only a week later in the story.

*** Bashing fics are what you read and wrote as a 13 year old. Seeing it used later in life feels immature (IMO). And it indicates that a fic is somewhat half baked. The author that does the reductive bashing misses a great opportunity to make more substantive claims about why Harry shouldn't be with the Weasleys etc. the most outrageous Weasley bashing fic I read had Molly Weasley siphoning $$$ from Harry Potter's gringots acct and got found out by some cannon jerk (who was rebranded as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù blood supremest that actually just wanted the best for muggleborns). Cue Molly Weasley ugly crying, begging for OP Harry's forgiveness. Ugh. Give me a break.

*** See, that's one that in moderation, works fine. Harry has a good relationship with the goblins? Great. They're willing to help him out a bit, especially due to the obligatory Manipulative!Dumbledore? Awesome, I'm fine with it.

The issue comes with the fact that many writers (cough cough RobSt, as much as I think he's got a somewhat undeserved bad reputation among some) use it as a crutch, and more than that they /overuse/ it. If a handful of stories of decent length were based around it, then fine. But Harry Potter, sorry Harry /Crow/ (?!?!?) being raised as a goblin and singlehandedly spearheading wizarding-goblin relations by being given every award possible and some that you'd think weren't at the ripe old age of 11 while singlehandedly handing out goblin-jewellery like it's going stale and attacking anyone and anything that ‚Äúgets in his way‚Äù for 737K words? Really!

Given that I've just ranted about it, I feel the need to link it, so linkffn(Harry Crow) because I feel I have to. I personally don't think it's that bad, it just changes canon so totally in many ways as to be almost unrecognisable and different, as well as leaning on lots of tropes and requiring some suspension of disbelief, that having been said, the first 30 chapters or so (all I've ever read before getting bored) seemed alright to me, if a bit out there. Worth a try, I'd wager, but don't be at all surprised if it's not for you.

I think the worst part of it, aside from the super-young marriage, harry acting like a 30yo, handing out goblin jewelry like candy and such, is the fact that he went into the transfiguration classroom, did his thing then suddenly he's at the base of changing transfiguration forever.

** Slut Ginny. Also Love Potion Ginny and Golddigger Ginny, but Slut's the big one that shows me the author has no grasp on characterization. It always reads like the author's stuck in the high school mindset of being catty to the popular girls. "I heard she had sex, that slut."

When really, canon Ginny's a normal high schooler who dates a couple of different boys at different times. There's nothing in canon to suggest that she cheats on them or that she uses sex to manipulate them. If you're gonna bash Ginny for being starstruck or childish, I'll still read it. But if the bashing is because she ~dared~ to date someone who isn't Harry, I'm done.

*** In defense of the 'Mione nickname, people have a tendency to shorten their friends' names --- unless that friend objects. People named Thomas usually go by Tom, David becomes Dave, Jennifer becomes Jenny or even Jen... even Princess Diana was called Di. If the person in question requests to be Christopher instead of Chris, then of course you should honor that. Otherwise, it's a friendly contraction.

We're never told how Hermione feels about her name. She could enjoy having an unusual name, but it's more likely that she has been teased about it all her life (kids are cruel), plus has the irritation of nobody pronouncing it right, most likely including her teachers in elementary school --- with her pedantry, that would have really irked her. Would it have made her determined to make people say it right (and in full) every time? We don't know, but certainly an argument could be made for that.

An argument could also be made for her feeling that she'd finally made true friends, one who would call her by a nickname that was not intended to be scornful. Perhaps even something that she allows her friends to call her, but not others.

Mia? That's right out.

** Harem fics, whether it's two girls or six. First of all, they are usually written with absolutely no concept of how heathy polyamorous relationships work. Secondly, they usually have the girls in question sexually harrassing Harry (crawling into his bed or "accidentally" stripping him naked is NOT romantic, nor is grabbing a boy's hand and putting it on your boob). Then there's just the ganging up on the lone male because he's just a clueless boy and we've got to teach him better, usually while laughing because isn't that just so funny. They almost always include the cringe-inducing "we're making you take us shopping as punishment for saying something we don't like." But worst of all is when the group starts forming in first or second year. Oh, and let's not forget that of course Hogwarts has suites for these precocious youngsters who are entering into intimate relationships before they hit puberty.

The worst offender I ever read (and no, I won't name it) has "only" two females, and they're in a three-bedroom suite --- this is a relevant point: they EACH have their OWN room. The girls decide (basically without his input) that they are going to trade off spending nights with him, so he has no privacy but they do. Then one of them gets in a huff and literally threatens to kick him out of HIS OWN BED. All of this while the author claimed that Harry was the dominant one in the relationship.

** IDK if it's a trope but whenever Harry (normally after going to Gringotts and finding he has a bizzarro number of titles he didn't know about and Dumbledore is an ass) starts sassing people they are aBsoLUtELy SpEeChLESs.

Poorly written dialogue and characters, basically. But HP fanfics seem to be the worst offenders of this variety.

** Top Five in no particular order:

- ultra powerful Harry
- Harry without Ron (it's just not Harry Potter)
- Lord Potter fics
- wards do everything

Hmm... looks like there's only four I might call my least favourite. Wait, is "mom" a trope? Because that's a really egregious Americanism.

*** That's true! I've seen lots of Americanisms in fanfics. For example, words as "center", "color", "theater", "neighborhood", etc. are a few examples. The spelling is quite important (at least for me) but few people seem to notice that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

**** wait how do you spell "center" and "neighborhood"? I'm just curious.

Also why is it such a big deal? It doesn't change the word too much spelling it either way. It's usually one or two letters rearranged or removed.

Wait do you spell "center" as "centre"? Again the 'r' is just a one space difference, not really a big deal. Though I do find "centre" as more appealing to read.

** What I dislike is Harem, especially when it's straight from 11 years old.

But I can't really say it's the "WORST trope" because who am I to judge what people enjoy?

I think people can like whatever they want (as long as it isn't harmful to themselves or their surroundings - if you like rape/pedophilia/zoophilia, /please,/ get professional help. That is not okay and could lead to you actually raping a person, even a kid, or an animal/corpse.)

So calling a trope "THE WORST" is pretty rude towards the author and the people who enjoy reading said trope.

Just say "I hate this trope," implying that you hate it but not shaming it.
