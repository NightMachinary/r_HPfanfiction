/"...And again, I thank you for this opportunity, to ensure both mine and your daughter's future happiness, Lord Greengrass./

/Gratefully,/

/Heiress Potter, Harleen 'Harry' Potter"/

Cyrus sat at his desk rereading the last three words of the letter that came with the signed contract (which thankfully could be annulled in a few years while the kids found someone they actually like), wondering how he's going to explain to his wife and daughters that he fell victim to the common misconception that was assuming Harry Potter was a boy and that Daphne was betrothed to her.

â€‹

...or something along the lines. Cue shenanigans about the girls falling in love despite having agreed to just be friendly and help each other find a nice boy.

**** I must admit, I enjoy most of them as well. Since the character was invented from whole cloth, it avoids most problems with 'canon compliance' and is often taken in new and interesting directions. The 'Ice Princess' copy-paste excepting.

***** I actually enjoy the ice princess trope. But what I like about the pairing most is that is allows the author to take harry in completely different directions or at least take ones that wouldn't be expected of a pure gryffindor pairing. Being paired with a slytherin opens up a lot of tools and thinking he wouldn't have otherwise, which I think is good for the story

*** From what I can tell, it's something that sprouted among the writers themselves, which then grew into the trend it is today when other writers took that idea and ran with it. She then kinda became the go-to "nobility" character to ship harry with. There's nearly nothing known about Daphne in actual canon.

If your alteration changes a core feature of the prompt, then don't post it as an alteration underneath. The prompt-maker had a vision and a reason to word it like that.

It's not your place to change a prompt just because you personally think it becomes better. Just post your own.
