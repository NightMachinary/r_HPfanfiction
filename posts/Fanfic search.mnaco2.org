  In a world larger and more complicated than anyone could expect, how will Harry Potter navigate and survive when raised by House Black -- an Ancient and Noble family with a long and bloody history? Surrounded by powerful new players watch House Potter rise from the ashes of defeat and reclaim their place in the annals of history, by any means necessary.
