** Fun as it is, we know it is possible to seriously harm ghosts (i.e. Petrify them) or to bind them to a single place (i.e. Myrtle being confined to her bathroom), and I think this magic would have been well within Voldemort's reach. Ergo, such a scenario would not have ended well for Myrtle.

**** I don't think it's mentioned anywhere, and if it is, it goes against canon. Myrtle haunted Olive Hornsby for laughing at her glasses and followed her around for years, well away from Hogwarts. If memory serves, Myrtle says that Olive Hornsby had to go to the Ministry against her, and Myrtle returned to Hogwarts afterward.

Edit: Clarification.

Edit 2: Upon reflection, there is said to be a Spirit Department in the Ministry of Magic (It's mentioned in the introduction of /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/). So I think in theory, the Ministry could order a ghost to stay somewhere. But Ministry decree is apparently not the default.

Honestly, this is an area of canon I wouldn't mind Rowling clarifying.

*** She's not just confined to her bathroom. She's in the prefect's bath in GoF and in the boy's loo in HBP. So maybe she's been doomed to exist only in bathrooms, but definitely not just /hers/.

edit: apparently she appears in more than just bathrooms, according to [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel][u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] and [[/u/streakermaximus][u/streakermaximus]]. Thanks for pointing that out! :)

**** She /is/ canonically bound to her place of death, but with some "wiggle room" --- she is able to travel through the pipes to visit other parts of Hogwarts. She cannot, however, leave the Castle Hogwarts altogether. Which is the reason she doesn't haunt Olive Hornby anymore.

I think this is from Pottermore.

****** Yeah. It's on the grounds. And, presumably, connected to the school's water system --- the implication is, I believe, that Myrtle got to it by following the pipes from her toilet all the way to the sewage disposal into the lake.

*** Not sure about the bound to one place thing, but I got the impression that actually harming ghosts is just not something wizards can normally do. Short of breeding another basilisk (and if Voldemort could do that then why didn't he?) I don't think he could hurt her.

  She wasn't planning on dying, but it's not going to stop her from living. Aurelia Potter, didn't regret comforting Myrtle when she was crying in the girls bathroom, not even when it resulted in her death. Now she's a ghost,and she's getting revenge. Riddle, prepare yourself. You shouldn't have pissed the Slytherin Head Girl.
