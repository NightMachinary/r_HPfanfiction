Are there any stories where Harry is paired with a Squib or a Muggle?

For all the claims of non discrimination, almost all fics have Harry paired with a witch(or wizard) or some wierd magical creature.

No slash, preferably a completed story(or one shot) and the pairing should not end with Granger.


** There are two complete ones I enjoy. First is linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy), which is post-OotP and Harry meets up with an old classmate from primary school. Second is linkffn(Hocus Pocus Adelle Polkiss), where Piers Polkiss had a younger sister.

And one WiP I'd say to check out featuring Harry-as-widower: linkffn(Grow Young With Me).

Only Without a Trace is complete, don't know if sbmcneil plans on completing Journey and Ash Darklighter quit fanfiction, I think.
