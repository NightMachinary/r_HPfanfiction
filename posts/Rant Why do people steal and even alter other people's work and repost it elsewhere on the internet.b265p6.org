It's not cool. I just discovered today that one of my stories was reposted elsewhere without my permission. And it wasn't just a bot grabbing the site code from FFN and posting it, but someone decided to change the title, remove my author's notes, change the chapter headings, etc. I mean, what the hell? Who does that? I've already written the damn thing and posted it on multiple places on the internet so anyone that wants to read it can do so without worrying that it's going to suddenly disappear - why the need to post it elsewhere? And who the hell has the gall to alter someone else's work like that? If you enjoy someone else's work that much, why would you be so blatantly disrespectful?

Shit like this makes me want to quit writing and take my stories down. I'm not actually going to do that, but it's tempting.

Just needed to get that off my chest. Here endth the rant.


** Easy internet validation.

It's the same reasoning that goes behind people grabbing fan art from Instagram or Tumblr, then reposting on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] for the karma points, regardless of whatever the original creator might have said about sharing their work without permission or proper crediting. It feels like a rush when other people look at it and comment, "This is nice" and "I like it", even if the poster never made the content themselves.

Many people are also under the mistaken impression that anything posted on the internet is fair game.

** I don't like it. One of my fics was changed, like, they just changed the names, to an anime series. From Supernatural to Kuroko no Basket I think it's called. It wasn't even that good of a fic! Just a longish smutty one shot. And they just replaced names and hair/eye colors.

** I view it as a bit of a compliment, to be honest.

Anecdotally, one of my AO3 stories was once reposted to FFN. Almost all the reviews called the person out for plagiarizing, many using less-than-kind language. Felt all warm and fuzzy to have my fic defended like that.

** This has happened to me as well. I periodically Google a few of the more obscure lines from my stories to look for copies. One site I found had many copied fanfics with the stated intent of making the stories more accessible. In this case, the original story content and author credit was retained. Unfortunately, the site had no means of tracking reader traffic or leaving reviews/comments. The site closed down a few months later.

I've noticed a recent uptick in some of my story stats. Additional Googling may be in order.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

***** You could categorize it as such, but it's a very slight crossover at best. I never felt it was enough to warrant the crossover label. The paladin in question is a character from an old video game - /Baldur's Gate II/, but I made some rather significant changes to his character. You don't need to know anything about BGII to follow what's going on in the story.

Seriously? So I take it this /isn't/ the troll who keeps spamming plagiarized stories on 18 different accounts (yes, really)? Either way, I don't get who would go to that much trouble.

(At least I hope it's not him, because if he's doing /that/ now, this is going to be even harder. Luckily, he's banned as of Thursday. For the moment.)

But yeah, I've had stories stolen a few times. It didn't put me off writing; I just grumbled and reported them. It did, however, motivate me to make an AO3 account--partly so no one could preempt me there, and partly because it opened my eyes to how unreliable FFN's admin/mod team is, so I'd have a backup if the site went under.

** Back in 2007 I had a LJ account specifically for my story, and it was the initials of the story with an underscore 'inscribed.' I found out a few months later that someone wrote a weird copy of the story and named theirs the exact same way. It was before there were websites that would rephrase things if you plugged in text, so that was something they basically just did on their own for the fun of it, I guess?

​

It's a backhanded compliment, really. It's okay not to take it that way of course! It's just so ridiculous because unless your particular corner of the fandom is super huge, people WILL find out and think poorly of the copycat.

​

Please don't take your stuff down, though. That might encourage them to think that they can put their copies up and you won't ever find out about it and they'll get all your accolades. I'm sorry this happened to you :(

** "The problem with living outside the law is that you no longer have its protection." - Capote

By and large, fan-works are considered illegitimate by the current legal scheme. This is problematic because it puts in a grey area a lot of items that an average person would consider acceptable. (Not-for-profit derived works, that do not compete with the original work, shared between fans who have purchased the original work is one example). There is fair use, but it is unclear and hard to use.

Of course, this results in a lot of people ignoring the law because of its stupidity. But then, once you are no longer following the law, where is the line if you stop? Its hard to complain about someone appropriating your work when you are appropriating someone else's work?

Bullshit. Look up the copyright arguments regarding fanfiction and transformative works. There's a big difference between that and copying someone else's work word for word.

**** Copyright law is pretty unambiguous. Fanfiction is clearly a derived work, and the law clearly gives the copyright owner exclusive control over derived works. There is an argument around fair use, but fair use is case-by-case, expensive for all parties, and is NOT clear what it applies to before the fact. (I hold that fair use in the US fair use is way weaker than it needs to be). Basically, unless you are doing a clear parody or criticism, it is far from something that can be relied upon.

I'm not saying there isn't a moral distinction. Their clearly is. But as far as the rules are currently written, we are all playing outside the rulebook.

Edit: Or to put another way: If copyright law clearly laid out what kind of derived fan works are acceptable and what kind need approval, and it was either more in line with what is considered acceptable or moved the culture of fan works toward the approved model, then it would be a lot easier to call out people for violating those standards. They do not exist, so it is much harder.

​

For further reading, [wikipeidas]([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction]]) writedown. This also only applies to US law.

Just saying, if we reformed copyright law to put clear, distinct rules on what is acceptable fan works and what is not (not the current, unclear mess), it would be a lot easier to draw these distinctions.
