*** I know. You're right. It's kind of a long shot and I'm at a loss for other plot details. I put some possibilities in another comment I just replied to, but those details may not even be from the one I remember. It's been years since I read it.

** "Harry trying to be good." This could be the original seven books or any Harry-centric fic that is not Dark!Harry or Gray!Harry...

*** I guess you're right? But what I mean is it's central to the plot. It was something like, Voldemort/the horcrux gets stronger if Harry indulges his dark side. Or maybe Harry gets weaker? Or maybe the power he knows not depends on it?

Either way, a central plot point was Harry noticing the habits and thoughts that fed a vicious cycle of darkness and tried actively to stop them. Like I said, schadenfreude was a big one. I think the author might have just learned the word schadenfreude. Another was probably his quick temper.

This may be a different fic but it may be one where Harry discovers countercurses/shields against the unforgivable curses in his dreams when Voldemort invades them.
