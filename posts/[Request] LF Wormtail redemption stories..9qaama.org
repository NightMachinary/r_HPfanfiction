  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** Oh, I would recommend Promises Unbroken, by Robin4. It's a Marauders fic, and it's focused on Sirius. It's very lenghty, with 41 chapters. It is continued in Promises Remembered, and later on in Promises Honored. As I said, it's focused on Sirius, but Pettigrew gets a prominent role in the story, and eventually earns his redemption. That's all I can offer, since I have never read any story focused on him specifically.

I hope I didn't screw up the link.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.
