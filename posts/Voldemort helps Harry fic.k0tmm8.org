:END:
All I remember is that Harry and Hermione live in a flat and Harry has a large painful scar on his back that keeps him inside. Voldemort finds them and helps, eventually as the curse is about to kill Harry he takes him to his manor into a circle of runes to keep him alive. Both Malfoys are present. Going crazy trying to find it, if anyone recognises it can you please let me know (:

  Harry's had it with his destined role after the Order does something he can't forgive. Now he's done with both sides of the war and wants to be left alone. But since when have his wishes ever counted for anything? LV/HP Slash & MPREG.More warnings inside.
