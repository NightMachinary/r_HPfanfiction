"First up we'll have a look at the Potions classroom. What floor is it on?"

"Floor?"

"Yes, it's standard regulation for all Potions classrooms to have access to windows for ventilation purposes"

"It's been tradition for the Potions class to take place in the dungeons for a thousand years"

"... Do you at least have spells to ventilate any fumes or smoke?"

"Uh..."

"Merlin help me"

They get to the classroom and the Inspector looks around.

"Where are the drains and the emergency shower?"

"Why would students need to bathe during class?"

"No, the emergency shower is for washing off any volatile mixtures that get on the skin."

-----------------------

"Now, the brooms you use to teach First Years how to fly, when were they last replaced?"

"Replaced?"

"Yes, training brooms need to be replaced every 15 years for safety reasons"

"Our budget doesn't allow for replacements"

"Have you at least had someone come in to refresh the stabilization charms? You leave these old brooms alone for too long and students will go shooting into the air at the slightest touch"

Dumbledore has a flashback to Neville Longbottom's incident and breaks into a cold sweat.


** "Oh, and mind the trick step."

"Mind the /what?!/"

*aaaaaaaaaa*

"We do in fact have a security measure in the dorms. When a boy tries to go up the stairs to the girl's rooms, the stairs turn into a slide."

"And why, pray tell, couldn't have made the doors not open for boys instead?!"

*aaaaaaaaaa*

"I notice this hallway has no paintings."

"Hm? Ah, yes. It seems you're right."

"And I'm guessing you don't see the issue with that?"

"What issue?"

"Kids. With wands. Unsupervised."

"Oh... oh dear."

"Yeah. 'Oh dear.'"

*aaaaaaaaaa*

"Okay, and who's your child councelor?"

"I suppose Madam Pomfrey."

"Oh, she's certainly got a lot of qualifications, must be busy."

"She only has two for Mediwitchery and Paediatrics."

"You mean to say that you have no one qualified to look after your children's mental health? At a /boarding school?!/

"Why should that matter?"

"Because kids that don't get to see their parents for months on end don't get homesick. /Why do you think it matters?!/"

*aaaaaaaaaa*

"When were the bludgers' cushioning charms last replaced?"

"..."

"Oh for Merlin's sake, what about the Quidditch Grounds?"

"..."

"Please tell me you don't allow kids to play Quidditch according to league rules."

"..."

/Inhales sharply./

*aaaaaaaaaa*

"What's that smell?"

"That would be Fluffy."

"And what's Fluffy?"

"The Three-Headed Dog we used to have."

/Stares./ "Used to, as in, not there anymore, right?"

"Yes."

"And when was this?"

"The 91/92 year."

"You're lucky you're past the statute for that one."

*aaaaaaaaaa*

/They walk into a classroom in which Peeves is vandalising./

"A poltergeist."

"He has aided the school multiple times in the-"

"A /poltergeist!!!/"

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

However, Rowena died before she could teach people how to properly trim the input datasets, and Hogwarts has just been chugging along for a thousand years, collecting data on random wanderings and people trying to find rooms. By now nobody can train out the bad habits without wiping it all and starting fresh.

**** Yep, the books never explicitly state that the stairs move. In PS, when the castle is being described, it does say that everything seemed to move around a lot. But I always took that to mean the suits of armor, and the people in the paintings visiting each other. (Plus the whole bit about walls pretending to be doors or only opening on a specific day or whatever.)

If the stairs moved the way they do in the movies, surely we'd have seen a lot more staircase-related shenanigans in the books.

********** American here. I went to a Middle School back in the early 2000s that divided students into competing groups that functioned nearly identically to the House system. Whichever group had the most points at the end of the year got pizza.

The only difference between that middle school's system and Hogwarts Houses was that the groups were year-specific. The groups in Sixth Grade were not related to the groups in Seventh Grade or Eighth Grade, for example, and students were sorted into the different groups randomly each year before the school year started.

I wasn't aware most schools in the US don't use that system until after I went to college!

*********** Yeah, I am a military brat. So, I have been to schools across a number of different states. I have never heard of a school doing something like that before. I had always thought that the Hogwarts system was just something that JKR made up. I thought it was needlessly divisive considering how politically charged the different houses were. Whenever I think of how Hogwarts could have been better, the first thing I do is get rid of the house system. I never liked how they, in fanon and I think canon, tried to define a person purely by what house they were sorted into. I see people having all of those traits in one form or another, to one degree or another. They are not mutually exclusive.

** The irony of this kind of indy!Harry LARP concept, which has been done before, is that Dumbledore massively improved the safety and health standards of Hogwarts.

It used to be common for miscreants and rule-breakers to be tortured for punishment. Dumbledore ended it.

There's a thousand horny teenagers locked up in a castle in Scotland for eight months out of the year. Nobody ends up pregnant.

A basilisk was set on the student body twice, but somehow only one person died. This strongly implies there's some kind of passive probability manipulation going on at Hogwarts, when a person seeing the basilisk directly is the outlier in a sea of freak accidents with reflections, mirrors, highly-polished armor stands, camera lenses, and conveniently placed ghosts.

The real joke here is that Hogwarts probably is the safest school of magic in the world. But nobody ever wants to take that and then wonder what the actual fuck might be happening in Durmstrang and Beaubaxtons.

Here's an idea. The delegations from the other two schools refuse to leave Hogwarts when the tournament is over, because it really is safer. They have now tasted the (relative) safety of Hogwarts, and refuse to be dragged back to their own schools that are awash in feral werewolves, menaced by cruel pixies and fairies, and frequently raided by cheese-addicted trolls.

*** I'm imagining a story involving the very confused Beauxbatons delegation, armed to the teeth and expecting Hogwarts to be like their school:

Fleur approached the Great Hall a few minutes after dinner had begun. Her blue cloak was streaked with green blood that resisted even her strongest cleaning charm, and a lumpy burlap bag floated behind her. Fleur had hoped to be more punctual, but it took her longer than expected to find what she needed.

As Fleur entered into the Great Hall, she stopped, confused. There were students eating at tables full of food, but no payment table. Uncertain of what to do, she approached a table of students.

"Pardonnez moi. Where can I exchange my kill for dinner?"

"Your what?" Ron said, nearly choking on a buttered roll.

"Yes, my kill." Fleur reached into her bag, and carefully removed a fresh acromantula corpse. "I hope this will suffice" she said. She knew that it was probably too small to merit a full serving of dinner, but hoped that she would at least get some salad for it.

Fleur's thoughts were interrupted by a scream and then a crash. The red-headed boy was now sprawled on the floor. Sighing, she returned the spider into her bag and decided to try another table.

[Was re: Beauxbatons being so overrun with dangerous creatures that students must kill one to get dinner each night]

"No, why?"
