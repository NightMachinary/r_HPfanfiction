:END:
Snape is experimenting with a potion (possibly with plants that were thought extinct) and some one has been writing suggestions in his notes. Snape thinks that it is Flamel who is helping him. The help included telling him to make the potion outside and at certain times of day/night I think. Thanks.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
