*** Yeah, the key scene in this whole sequence is when the antidotes class comes along and Harry has no idea what to do.

The problem with the potions book isn't that it has better instructions that give Harry an advantage. The problem is that Harry doesn't learn anything from it. If he studied the alterations so as to understand why they were made, then I would have no problem with him using a book with better recipes to his peers. The book would be succeeding in teaching him Potions. But as it is, Harry uses it to get good results while still having no idea what he is doing.

That first lesson is clearly an open-book test, as there is a reward of a vial of Felix Felicis for the student with the best results.

Harry uses methods made by someone else without even knowing why those instructions work the way they do in order to brew his potion and win the prize. That is pretty much the equivalent of using a cheat sheet in class.

**** I don't care how the average Potions lessons are - that first session was an open-book test. I don't know about you, but you're only supposed to use the material in the textbook for the open book tests.

Using additional material, especially one which you had no intellectual ownership over, is cheating.

If Harry had researched those instructions, and observed their results by himself and understood the logic behind why they worked the way they did, it would be fair. But he never does that.

This is a non-argument. The question of sharing the notes with everyone else does not even arise if he ignored the hand-written instructions.

Again, a non-argument.

Not that it pertains to the discussion at all, but Snape studied in the same school Harry did, and he was the one who made the notes - he had access to virtually the same resources Harry does. If Harry had devoted enough time and effort to Potions as Snape did instead of lazing around, he'd be able to make a few of those modifications himself.

...That's false I don't have time to look through the HBP now, but here is the quote from wikipedia synopsis of chapter 12 (the lesson itself is in ch 9)

#+begin_quote
  While reading the Half-Blood Prince's textbook one morning
#+end_quote

Even if he cheats on the first lesson, as far as I remember Harry spends a lot of his FREE time with the book, learns new spells and new ways of brewing, so using it later is not cheating at all. It is just an exclusive advanced potions book. In fact, there were not so many descriptions of Harry willingly spending his time with a book, so it gives him a motivation to learn.

As for Snape attending the same school - true, but 1) they use the same book after more than 20 years, and I doubt that there were no inventions or developments in brewing - so it is outdated 2) pupils are expected to follow the instructions, Snape's punishments discouraged them from any experiments. Not that I disagree - the experiments can be dangerous - but there is no chance for them to understand that crushing is better than cutting, because trying new ways can cause troubles 3) again, I agree that Snape was more focused on potions and achieved a lot because of his hard work, but don't you think that the book should contain the easiest and the most effective ways of brewing - and yet it doesn't. In fact, there are wrong instructions

#+begin_quote
  “How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. “Add a clockwise stir ---” “No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise... Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his.
#+end_quote

So the best way to brew this potion is to do everything opposite to the instructions in the book. Thus, the original potions book is an outdated below standard shit.

Edit: P.S. I've just reread my own comment and it might sound a bit offensive. I've never meant it to be, so just in case - excuse me.

I realise that it sounds like common sense, but the bean in question is described as a shrivelled up bean, which upon crushing produces much more juice than it looks to contain.

#+end_quote

It's not just things like crushing beans, the direction of stirs is quite different - while the official instructions have you stirring counterclockwise throughout, Snape makes it clockwise, while adding a counterclockwise stir every seven clockwise stirs.

That's a fair bit more than just doing the opposite of what the textbook says. If Snape came up with his modification by trial and error, it would have taken a lot of time. I'd give credit where credit's due and hand it to Snape for his persistence.

Harry was running a club where they practiced stuff like the Reductor curse, the Blasting curse, and the Exploding curse - if he can disregard caution there, he can disregard it here as well. They are two different scenarios, yes, but he does do it anyway.

#+begin_quote

My issue with his cheating is specifically for that first Potions session, when the vial of Liquid Luck is on offer. For regular classwork, the only thing that's harmful is that Harry is lying to himself by making his skills with Potions seem a lot better than it really is - which does not affect the other students in any way.
