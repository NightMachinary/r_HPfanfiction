*Why I love it:* This story is a love story. There is little to no fighting, its all post deathly hallows, its just romance. That said, this is the most powerfully human story I've /ever/ read. Not "the most powerfully human fanfiction" I've ever read, the most powerfully human /story/, I've ever read. It captures the essence of emotion, from the highs of joy to the lows of grief, this story has a dynamic range of feeling unlike anything I've ever experienced in literature. Not only that, but it has life. It's not just a static record, it feels like it breathes. This story has captured what it means to love and lose, and then to find love again, and it has /put it into words/. That is why I love this story. And it's not even done yet.

* 2 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]]

*Why I love it:* This is one of the earliest fanfictions I ever read, just when I was getting into fanfiction at all. And still it has only ever been passed by one other story in nine years of reading fanfiction. This story is an Independent!Harry story. Except, it is nothing at all like what that phrase makes you think of. This is a masterclass in trope writing, just because something has been done before does not mean it cannot be done better. This story takes the idea of a Harry who decides to be better, and to become so on his own terms, and explores it to perfection. This is not its only highlight though, as it contains the best explanation of blood magic I have ever encountered. As well as a climax that, while you could never see it coming, once it has arrived you will find yourself thinking that it could not have ended any other way.

*Why I love it:* This is a story about responsibility, grief, love, family, and most of all maturity, in that order. It explores each theme and does so to a standard of excellency found in every work by this author, and it does so without the reader ever realizing what's going on. (Now that you know what to look for you don't count, that's cheating.) It explores the core of Harry Potter as a person, from the child whose heart's desire was to merely have his parents and family surround him and look upon with love and welcome, to the man who walked willingly to his end so that others might be saved, it explores it all. It also has some the best characterizations of Andromeda Tonks and the Malfoys I have ever read.

*Why I love it:* In a word, Power. This is a story about power. About those who seek it, about those who have it, about those who bargain it away. But it is not only about power, but about a very literal evil as well. What defines evil? Can an evil person do good things? Can a good person do evil things? Can an evil person, someone who is utterly selfish and who desires nothing save their own benefit still be a force for good in the world by choosing to act in ways that will certainly benefit themselves, but others also? I don't know, but this story explores the question. It also has really cool magic and explosions in it. And swords, swords are cool too.

*Why I love it:* "What if we lost it all? What if had a chance to do it all again? What if we didn't have a choice?" These will be familiar words to anyone who reads time travel fics, and while I admit this is perheps the most contentious of my choices it is also here for a reason. This story sends harry potter back to before the first blood war began, and it explores that time period thoroughly. It was time of shadows and intrigue, and as a result Harry must learn to be a part of those things. It also has one of, if not the, best exploration of Bellatrix's character I've ever seen. Not only who she is, but who she was, and how she became who she did.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: limpieza-de-sangre-by-theendless7
  :END:
*Why I love it:* This is Voldemort's Story, also known as Emily Riddle. (Technically a spoiler but its in the first chapter) Emily Riddle is hands down the best version of Voldemort's character I have ever read. It explores her journey of transformation from beginning to end and manages to make her a genuinely noble character, even up to the end. It is indescribable, and truly worth the read.

* 7 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10015981/1/][West of Here by MK-ONE]]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: west-of-here-by-mk-one

*Why I love it:* This is a western. It takes the themes and motifs of the old silver screen and tumbleweeds and translates them perfectly to the world of Harry Potter. Not only that, but it manages to achieve that zenith of dynamic storytelling and make its readers laugh and cry in great measure, sometimes on the same page. A journey comprised entirely of mountain tops or valleys would be little more than a slightly twisty road with a view or lack of view respectively, this story takes you from the top to the bottom and back up again.

*Why I love it:* This is a story of Revolution. At what point does it become an evil to support stability? At what point does it become righteous to tear it all down? At what point do the scales tip, how far is too far, and once you've started that path how far are you willing to go? This is the story of how a good man donned the face of evil to change the world for the better, and how his closest friends decided to march along with him.

  :PROPERTIES:

*Why I love it:* It feels like history. Not like stuffy classrooms and Goblin rebellions, this feels like listening enraptured to the best history teacher on the planet telling you all about the great turning points of history, about war and death and change and turmoil, about the rise and the fall of great powers, about the sacrifices of thousands who die with the certainty that their deaths were for a worthy cause. This is not a small thing, this is not some insular british community of wizards. This is the story of Harry Potter, who forsook the magical world and decided to conquer it all instead. /"For there are some men who it seems are born with fire to swallow the world"/

* 10 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/][A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh]]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-long-journey-home-by-rakeesh
  :END:
*Why I love it:* This is a story in two parts, the one about transformation, the other about reunification. It is almost impossible to put into words, but in the end this is a story about relationships. About those that are doomed to end all too soon, and yet are worth it anyway, and about those that last a lifetime and more, and for whom friendship is an unassailable fact as sure as the rising sun. (Note: This story is technically incomplete. It ia told out of chronological order and contains three stoey arcs. Thw girst two are the most inportant, and are both connected with each other and complete. The third is incomplete and extraneous, but worth reading).


** I'm currently reading A Cadmean Victory, but I can't say I'm particularly impressed with it. It's good to know that it apparently has an interesting ending, because the knowledge will probably help me have the motivation to finish reading it.

What I don't like about it:

1. The romance parts are dull. However, the problem may be with me rather than the story, because I generally find romance uninteresting.

2. I can't sympathize with Harry's character. The story is supposed to be a single-point-of-divergence except for minor changes to Harry's personality earlier on, but Harry's character development lacks something crucial. When he finds out that he is Voldemort's Horcrux, he quite easily accepts the fact that he will have to die. However, for a few chapters he is absolutely adamant that "he will not become nothing" or something like that. In other words, he gets some morbid satisfaction from the thought that even though he will have to die, he will die in such a remarkable way that his heroic sacrifice will be remembered and admired. The problem is that this is wildly out of character for Harry. He was never a glory hound. I would be okay with this kind of mindset if it was explained well. It was not explained at all. Also, Harry is suddenly more talented than in canon. It is explained that he found the motivation to read a lot more. But if reading is all what it takes, how is it even possible for Harry to get so much ahead of Hermione? She reads all the time, too.

3. Paintings are sentient. Really? If they are capable of learning new things and interacting with living people like living people, why is it not customary in the wizarding world to immortalize everyone in paintings? If paintings are just as good teachers as living people, why are they not in charge of teaching at Hogwarts? Paintings should not be some kind of good Horcruxes.

4. Some things in the writing annoy me. Especially the excessive use of direct quotes of thoughts. Every now and then there is a short line in italics telling what Harry thinks. My problem is that usually people do not think in complete sentences. Thoughts are quick realizations and associations, and that's why it would be much better to let the narrator tell what kind of thoughts go through the mind of the main character. This is just a minor detail, but when it happens over and over again for no good reason, it gets annoying.

*** I literally just finished this story half an hour ago. I was disappointed by the ending actually. I think the last 10 chapters really lost me. It might be different for you though so don't loose hope !

Dark Harrys in other stories tend to be so dark that it's unreasonable and that's what makes it fun to read. This Harry just kills left and right without any consequence to his soul. By that I mean that he justifies it and there's absolutely no second-guessing of that justification, which actually makes the deaths really meaningless.

Raskolnikov's murder in crime and punishment basically causes him to spend the next 3/4 of the book falling ill, psychologically, second guessing his life and philosophy and religion, and eventually becoming a paranoid wreck. Finally he finds absolution. Obviously I can't expect that from FanFiction, especially not one about magic and fantasy, but I would enjoy at least a hint of psychological self-torture for killing every now and then. It might lend the actual murder some credibility.

*** I would highly recommend reading A Long Journey Home. The story the author wrote feels very much like it was finished, but then the author decided to make a continuation of it and it didn't quite work. The first and second parts of the story are self contained and satisfying, while the third part is like an incomplete DLC that isn't truly necessary to appreciate the rest of it.

**** Having read the first 11 chapters, I see what you mean. It kind of starts by giving you the ending, and then the rest of it is fleshing out the journey - so however much or little you read, it's always complete, the only difference is how deep it goes.

Edit: Finished now. Ugh, a bit of a cliffhanger, although it seems likely that Rahji will face his wife dying in childbirth and want to resurrect her.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Definitely an interesting list. I've not read What We Lost or Emperor but I know the others.

Limpieza de Sangre would definitely make my top 10 except I usually limit myself to one story per author and for various reasons, Vitam Paramus tends to be the one I pick from TE7. I honestly can't understand the other commenter saying there's nothing memorable about it: I think it has some of the most remarkable scenes in the whole fandom. Emily taking Harry on holiday to Chicago, anyone?

A Long Journey Home is probably my favourite non-TE7 story and I wish he'd finish it. Grow Young With Me is a great love story although I can't help but feel it's coming off the rails a bit. I read West of Here ages ago and recall it started out brilliantly but gradually became more and more outlandish to the point I stopped enjoying it. The others... well let's just say they wouldn't make my top 10 *best* stories.

But thanks for posting the list. It's always a brave thing to do given how nice and welcoming this sub often is, and I'll add the two I haven't read to my reading list.

** Interesting list. I'm familiar with 8 of your 10 choices, I wouldn't put any of them in my top 10. I've seen lists that overlapped with mine and some that were completely different. I think our largest disagreements here are LdS, Emperor and Sum of Their Parts.

I found LdS to be dreadfully boring and sluggishly paced. It tired me out, and I can't for the life of me recall a single memorable thing about it.

Emperor in parts yes, scratches that historical fiction itch but draws too much from anime (it's barely HP, pretty much just names remain) and it was too often dreadfully boring and sluggishly paced.

SOTP wanted to be a story of revolution but the author wrote all the wrong scenes. Motivation I thought was meh, I wasn't sold on Dark Lord being an official legal title, recruitment of allies was repetitive and boring imo and the epilogue was completely unearned.

**** I wouldn't directly rank stories, because I like them in different ways, but I'll offer 5 that are particularly memorable for me.

For Great Laughter: Lots have had LOL moments (I've probably completely ignored a lot of strange looks from other train passengers before), but for consistent hilarity all the way through, it has to be linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). It's very British humour, so YMMV but it works for me.

Made me cry: Well, not literally cry, but I'll second Grow Young With Me for hitting me right in the feels. The chapter about Ginny's last Quidditch match is so /real/, you know? Harry's reaction is so very believable. And the characters are just as lifelike throughout.

Food for thought: It gets a lot of flak, but unquestionably the winner here is Methods of Rationality. Even if you don't like this Harry (and I doubt I'd enjoy his company much myself), he challenges you to examine your own thinking. From small things like the planning fallacy (not being pessimistic enough when planning a schedule), to big things like how you weigh a life in the balance (when does it become ok to say that saving someone's life is too expensive, because that money could save other lives? A million dollars? A billion?), and all sorts in between, like picking your battles and whether or not it's sometimes better to let evil have a limited triumph rather than suffer the casualties and side effects of fighting it. And what makes someone 'evil' in the first place, how much is chosen and when is it the child's fault vs the parent's? It also has a fantastic antagonist and extraordinarily few spelling or grammar errors. The alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR), is my recommended starting point.

Honourable mention to The Snape Chronicles for making me rethink Harry himself. He really was too touchy and quick to violent retaliation against insults, and he did awfully wrong by Snape when he snooped on the Pensieve during Occlumency lessons.

The richest world: This is a hard one to judge, because there are so many different ways a story can expand the world, and each has its own merits. I'll proffer linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) on the basis that it just kept revealing more layers as I kept reading. It starts off with a fairly straightforward premise, but fleshes that out with imperfect heroes, understandable villains, logical explanations of magic, innovative plotlines, and increasingly complex entanglements. Tom Riddle turned to politics instead of violent conquest, but if anything, he's more dangerous than ever - while also having /some/ good intentions mixed in with his very real prejudice.

And the one I just keep rereading: Even though it's extremely slow to update and was taken down by FFN for bogus reasons, the hands-down winner here is Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. I just really love how he uses his future knowledge to give his friends the support they need and build them up to become their best selves; boosting Neville's confidence, encouraging Hermione in her studies, helping Ron to appreciate how great his family really is and how much Harry values his friendship. The coming war always looms over him, but rather than trying for a quick take-down of Tom, he's preparing people to fight the blood supremacist faction no matter how it arises (he knows he can kill Tom when the time comes, but he wants everyone else to survive this time). The only version I know of that goes up to chapter 43 is the PDF/ebook on [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][GitHub]].

**** I had a list written up at one point but I deleted the gdoc. I can give you the short version.

1. Prince of the Dark Kingdom --- It's riddled with grammar/syntax/typing mistakes but it builds an awesome world, Voldemort is great (my favorite Voldemort in the fandom), Harry's relationships with Voldemort and Snape are great--they're complex, they develop. Characters grow and change. It just hits all the right notes for me, from worldbuilding to characters to relationships and plot.

2. Renegade Cause --- It's quite a bit too long and convoluted (could've dropped some of the sideplots) but I still love it for the way the author brings all the plotlines together in the end, the take on Indy/Dark Harry, the original take on the Order of the Phoenix (it still is OotP under the paint, but the author spun so much original content into it that calling it a canon rehash is disrespectful imo). Plus some awesome OCs (and original takes on canon characters). Probably the biggest influence on my own fanfic writing. My novel fic has been called a shittier verson of RC--I try to accept those opinions with grace...

3. The Last Enemy --- Oneshot, about 5k words, a very cool take on the Master of Death trope.

4. Circular Reasoning --- If you enjoy noir and being depressed, this one's for you. It's not a happy story. Dark Harry as in Dark is how he feels.

5. What You Leave Behind --- Its abandonment stands as one of the great tragedies of the mid 2010s for HP fanfic. Brisk pace, original ideas, deft writing style, brilliant scenes of Harry learning magic.

I thought about writing a longer list but I think top 5 is enough. Beyond top 5 I'm too undecided as to which fic gets which spot so some honorable mentions:

A Black Comedy (I don't care how problematic it is, I laughed my ass off---You can keep my sandwich, indeed)

The Lie I've Lived (also made me lol many, many times)

Seventh Horcrux (as far as comedy goes, this and the two fics above are the top tier of the fandom)

Cauterize (I dunno man, it got to me)

An Unfound Door (the best of joe6991's HP fics, deep AU, proves that starting an AU in media res works if you know what you're doing)

Perfectly Normal, Thank You Very Much (a family story--I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did)

Uncle Harry (in a similar vein to Perfectly Normal)

Wastelands of Time (it has its charms, though I know many people don't like this take on Harry)

Victoria Potter (lacking in plot, but lots of flavor)

***** I have read quite a few of these, from what I see it seems that the biggest place where our tastes converge is in seriousness (not so much in the subject matter as in how the world is built) and pacing. I enjoy a nice slow dramatic build, whereas from what I remember many of these stories are a bit more fantastical in nature. Could be wrong though, what is your opninion?

****** I wouldn't say that. There's humor in my picks but also plenty of serious moments. I like stories where things happen. Waiting for one thing to happen for ages is just boring to me. And in my picks there are big events that receive a lot of build up. Whether a story has fantastial elements has nothing to do with how serious the tone is.

I'd rather say we differ in what tropes we like in stories.

I'm ok with "bad endings", but having the ministry, and Fudge(?!), win, felt forced to me. it didn't feel satisfying, like a culmination of events leading to that. It felt more like an incredibly melancholic and surreal series of events. I'd have been OK if Dumbledore was a driving force behind the end, but it felt like Emily decided to take up the idiot ball and suicide herself.

>!Emily realised relatively early on in the story that her method had failed. She still believes the same things but now appreciates that bludgeoning people into acceptance isn't going to work. Now she has a new plan. She's already pretty much converted Harry to her way of thinking and at the end she makes the ultimate sacrifice so that he is unburdened by her continued existence and can start moving forward. I know what you mean with your comment but I don't see her ending as ignominious; rather she's sacrificing herself so Harry regains his hero status and can continue her work.

When you put it that way it makes sense, but iirc Harry doesn't really regain his hero status. He's at best neutral, and marginalized by the rest of society. From Emily's perspective you're right in that she "wins", as Harry will eventually continue her legacy.
