Hey! I saw that on the "worst tropes" thread from yesterday some people mentioned indie fics or indie!Harry. What does this exactly mean? Fics that are out of the ordinary in some way? I've been reading HP fics for 12+ years and have yet to encounter this term. I'd love for some examples and recommendations. For context, would you consider "Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run" by waspabi (on ao3) to be an indie fic? It seems like the vibe to me but I'm not sure what people mean.

Edit: spelling.


** As I understand it, it means independent Harry - a Harry who decides Dumbledore doesn't know best, makes the most of his wealth in Gringotts and his random nobility titles that he discovers he has, and lives as an adult despite being a teenager. It usually comes with great magical talents or powers, plenty of character bashing, and a darker/edgier Harry.

I can't recommend any because I don't like that kind of story.

**** Yes, I haven't read enough to know but I imagine none of them detail arguing with your significant other in the middle of marks and Spencer's about whether to have prawns or beef for dinner.

*** Ah, got it! Thought it would be fics with an indie vibe that out of the ordinary and in a different style to typical fics. Thanks!

** I WISH indie fics meant that that have an indie movie vibe, but alas...
