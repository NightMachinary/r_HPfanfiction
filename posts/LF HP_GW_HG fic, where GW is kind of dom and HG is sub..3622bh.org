** I know of a one-shot where Hermione winds up the sub for Harry and Luna, but I'm on mobile so I'll come back and link it later. I'm also interested in these H/Hr/GW stories because I want to write one with that ship but I can't ever find any good ones.

*** I'd be interested in the HP/LL/HG one if you can find the link.

** Ruskbyte's adult-themed side-story to his /Order of the Phoenix/, [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Alternate_Sleeping_Arrangements/Alternate_Sleeping_Arrangements/][Alternative Sleeping Arrangements]] has the roles something like what you describe.
