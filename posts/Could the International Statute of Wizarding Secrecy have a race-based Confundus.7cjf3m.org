My speculation is that the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy comes with a Confundus that covers, at the very least, the entirety of Magical Britain causing either side to be unable to properly comprehend the other.

If you think about it, there are several examples that seem to back this up.

Vernon and Petunia, for instance, can never properly pronounce Magical creatures or items. To the point where the spellings aren't even similar.

Meanwhile, Magical users can't even seem to be able to process the simplest of muggle contraptions. You could, perhaps, chalk Mr. Weasley up as a simpleton, but for someone who's so goddamn excitable and crazy about Muggle technology, you'd think he could at least pronounce some of the words. Or figure out what a rubber ducky is.

We also know that magic on such a wide scale is at /least/ possible, due to the Taboo that Voldemort applies to his given alias.

Thoughts?


** I think it's more JK Rowling simply exaggerating.

** I think it's a bit more fundamental than that: Muggles miss magic which occurs before their eyes because it is not part of their world view and their expectations mold their reality. So it is, for example, that Muggles fail to notice the Knight bus not because it has Muggle repelling Charms, but rather simply because it is so beyond their capabilities to comprehend something so absurd.

*** I can see what you mean, but I think there's quite a big difference here.

Muggles, in my mind, are willing to forgive certain things because there's just /obviously/ a more reasonable explanation for what they've just seen.

If you saw something flash super quickly before your eyes, how many likely possibilities would you go through before accepting some mundane answer? Possibly one your brain just automatically fills in for you, even. The likelihood of you jumping to and accepting "magic" as the answer is /fairly/ low, even for a Harry Potter fan.

/That/ type of missing magic is /much/ different than being wholly incapable of even /properly pronouncing the words/.

**** I think you're under-estimating the effect. Remember that the Knight Bus causes entire buildings to jump around in space in order to get out of the way. The Muggles fail to notice this not because they are confunded, but because they have a kind of psychological anti-magic defence which prevents them from realising that something is magic, not just when they miss it in passing, but also when it is staring them directly in the face.

  “This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said. “Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?”

  “Ar,” said Ernie.

  “How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?” said Harry.

  “Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'.”

  “Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern. “We'll be in Abergavenny in a minute.”

  Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed.

  ...

  Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo,” he said.

  “What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.

  Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.

You will also find references to this effect in Fantastic Beasts. There are footnotes about a book written by a wizard about the effect: The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know by Mordicus Egg

** That is an amazing theory and one that I'm going to steal going forward. Honestly that's great!
