  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Does he try to change the past when he goes?
#+end_quote

No. He doesn't go out of his way to not change the past either. The fic is a stable time loop story, so it's not a concern.

#+begin_quote
  Does he hang out with his mom and Marauders or avoid them?
#+end_quote

Yes. He didn't time travel voluntarily. He just hangs in the past with his parents while he waits to go back.

***** I might look into it. I'm on a huge time travel kick, but I've read so many where he tries to avoid his parents as well changing the past. I think my favorite parts are interactions with Regulus Black, Snape, and Neville's parents.

** Blood Magic by Gateway Girl has a Gryffindor Death Eater OC mentioned a few times: Augustus Maitland.

Resolution by Frances Potter (unfinished and abandoned) has Ronald Weasley as a Death Eater.

** Kinda fudging your requirements, but The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) features what I'd consider fanon's best competent!Peter. His rise/descent from string-along Marauder to budding dark lord in his own right is exceptionally well done.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Is it canon that Lockhart was a Ravenclaw?

I've always held that the sorting hat line that Gryffindor wanted those who had "brave deeds to their name" indicated that people who were glory seekers, which Lockhart undoubtedly was, would fit naturally into Gryffindor.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
