Hi, does anybody have recommendations for fix it stories or just stories with competent adults? I'll read pretty much anything but adult/child romances, incest and Dark!Harry


** Competent adults? I love family fics!

Grow Young With Me: Harry/Muggle OC

The Purpose of Wings: Harry/Fleur

Strangers at Drakeshaugh: Harry/Ginny

Madley in Love: Harry/Laura Madley

Are my favorites.

** Competent adults

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]] has a 40 year old Harry leading a Coronavirus response. It's a fix it but it definitely takes you for a ride meanwhile. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973][73 Aberdeen]] is wartime absolutely competent Marauders and /not a fix it!/ but really good. It's tragic - giving a heads up if that's not your thing!

Fix it [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/1918284][Remain in Light]] is Wolfstar. It's decent but maybe kind of not good as other two in the competent adult department. I have been trying to read happy Wolfstar recently because the majority of Wolfstar fics are sad.

No adult/child, incest or dark Harry stuff in these. Also you'll prob get more recs if you add to your post some details about what characters, eras and tropes you like.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Harry as a competent DADA professor (one-shot):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][*Hogwarts, to welcome you home*]] *by gedsparrowhawk:* “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

Regulus Black as a competent potions professor who teaches the younger years (on hiatus):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667][*In the Name of the Brave*]] *by LullabyKnell:* “Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” “Oh, that's Professor Black.” - A slow-paced, self-indulgent, canon rewrite Philosopher's Stone AU.

I highly recommend both!

**** In the Name of the Brave is /awesome/ and partially responsible for my story linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18335585/chapters/43406147]]) which is still going

My other one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15911484/chapters/37090059]]) is finished.

As for recs, lullabyknell has another regulus one who is adorable it's, a sort of fix it? I think? In that the adult is extremely competent but he did not sign up for taking care of a kid but no one else is doing their job so he's like ‘oh no. I guess it's me' linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24500287/chapters/59141077]])

I honestly have a lot of recs because this is basically my favourite type of fic but you honestly might be better off raiding my bookmarks on AO3 lmao

For two more here is an [[http://ellywinkle.com/judgment-and-justice-1-2-ellywinkle/][external link]] to a fic called Judgement and Justice and it's about a competent Arthur Weasley getting an awesome lady from the Wizardinv Child Services involved when his kids steal his car and come back talking about bars on windows

And I have a bit of a crush on Morraine's Healer Brady in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]]) it takes a bit to get there; at the beginning it's Dobby being competent, which still counts, right?

We Love Dobby!

  Albus Dumbledore's hiring habits leave a lot to be desired. Even if the choice of teachers weren't questionable, the methods are. Who would expect a headmaster to use blackmail quite so masterfully to keep his staff quiet about his regular bouts of negligence and ideas that put his students at risk?Thankfully there is one professor who has the heart and the means to help.

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.
