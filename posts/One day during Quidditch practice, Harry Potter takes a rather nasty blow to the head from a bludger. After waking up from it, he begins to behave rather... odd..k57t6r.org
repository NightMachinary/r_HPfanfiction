For starters, he's convinced that he's dating [insert minor character here], even though they've barely shared two dozen words with each other over the years. For another, he's convinced that he's got a younger sibling at Hogwarts, and is growing increasingly distressed at not being able to find them anywhere. Finally, and possibly most worringly, he keeps wondering why the letters he writes to his parents are getting returned unopened.


** Harry: Why are my letters coming back unopened?

** Ah, a sixteen-dimensional Bludger that hit him in a nonstandard direction, I see. That's on the list of Quidditch fouls, you know, but only if you view the list from outside the normal angles.

**** And they're so friendly he doesn't notice it, the Gryffindor Harry actually has never spoken to them before but he doesn't know it because he's vibin so well with them.

No one knows what happened but suddenly Potter is attracting the death-eaters-to-be to Hufflepuff common room and dude, they're so accessible, basically, Harry and Hufflepuff members themselves by being nice are becoming a new party, the best party. They all might fight in the incoming war but they won't let anyone fall for it. They all are going to be there for each other and that's actually what most children and young adults needs; not someone that plays them like pieces of a board game, but someone that sees them as actual people and treats them as well.

Idk if I made my point clear but that's what I think would happen.

** Reminds me of linkffn(In Another Place), except AU!Harry is hit by a bludger, exaggerated-abuse!Harry is nearly killed by Vernon, and the two swap lives. Fic seems like it got abandoned just as they're figuring it out, though :(

  He had done it. This time, he had done it. His uncle had gone too far, and Harry had to pay the price for it. As he lay dying on the floor of his Number 4, Privet Drive bedroom, what unexpected force will save Harry? (Rated T, warnings inside, rating may go up later; AU).
