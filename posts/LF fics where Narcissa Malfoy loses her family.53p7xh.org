What would she do? Go on a revenge rampage? Marry again and have another child? Reconnect with Andromeda? What would the family-oriented Slytherin do if she lost the people who belonged to her?


** The way I see it, Narcissa loved her family. Her family was everything to her, especially Draco. I'm not sure what her relationship with Lucius was like, but I imagine there was some degree of affection, if not love, between the two of them. She has just come out from a war where she thought they were all going to end up dead in. But she survived, family intact, and she was happy. Only to lose them all anyway.

If both Lucius and Draco died in a very short time span, leaving Narcissa floundering in the grief of losing both her husband and her son without any visible support, I can see her trying to reconnect with Andromeda because she needs the support system Andromeda offers. Not to mention, Andromeda gets it--she lost her husband and daughter in the war, as well. And if she doesn't find any support in anywhere she looked, I think it's quite plausible that she could fall into madness caused by her grief.

On the other hand, if Draco was brutally murdered, she would very likely go on a murdering rampage. If it was soon after the war, Narcissa, the Slytherin she is, would know that the Aurors would be too busy with the rebuilding efforts to put in any real effort into finding the person who murdered her son, a known former Death Eater. Of course, she probably wouldn't have trusted the Aurors to do their jobs properly anyway, what with how much Lucius has been steadily erroding the structure of the Ministry over the years through bad laws and bribery. And I imagine she probably wants a more personal brand of revenge, which waiting for the Aurors to find her son's murderer doesn't seem to offer.

Like I said before, Draco was everything to Narcissa. She is as protective of him as a mother dragon is of her eggs. She lied to Voldemort's face for Draco. I think it's very likely in the event Draco was murdered, she would hunt down his killer and slaughter him/her.

I specify Draco, because I have no idea what her relationship with Lucius is like. I can't speculate how she would react to Lucius' murder, because I don't know how much she cares for him. Also, Lucius was probably in Azkaban at the time, for crimes committed in the war. If he is murdered, it's probably an inside job. And that's a whole new tangent of possibilities that I'm currently too lazy to explore in detail. Suffice to say, it could range from Narcissa joining up with Kingsley to rid the Ministry of corruption to her trying to kill everyone in the Ministry. I don't know. Or maybe she would just sit at home, twiddle her thumbs, while the Aurors pretend they're investigating Lucius' death, while in reality, they're covering the murderer's ass because they secretly approve of what the murderer did.

And I'm sorry, but I just realised this is a request thread, and I don't have any recs, but I've already written this long af comment, and I feel like it'd be kind of a waste if I don't post it. Oops.

** That's a fantastic question. Lucius and Narcissa have a fascinating relationship and now I'm curious.

** Probably get arrested and imprisoned, if it happens close to Voldemort's defeat. Or dies fighting for revenge. I don't really see her realising that her own family's bigotry is at fault.
