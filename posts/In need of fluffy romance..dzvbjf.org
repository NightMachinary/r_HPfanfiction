Anything and everything that could be considered fluffy with a focus on romance. No explicit sexual content between children please. Fade to black at most.


** Which ones have you read? linkffn(Grow Young With Me) updated recently and is excellent, with a widowed Harry who is very devoted to being a good dad, but struggling without Ginny. And then he meets a clumsy, slightly crazy, but fun-loving waitress, who drags him out of his shell and helps him to start enjoying life again.
