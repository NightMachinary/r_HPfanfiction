The evilest one I've found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizard's Fall.]] In this lovely piece of literature, Dumbledore gets up to shenanigans like taking credit for Voldemort's defeat and gulaging the muggleborns.

I need to find more so I can create a comprehensive guide to Evil Dumbledore in his many and varied forms as well as a possible bible for the odd religion known as Greatest Goodism.


** Shenanigans, you say?

linkffn(Partially-Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart)

Albus is the super overpowered villain for the insanely wanked protagonist that might have once been Harry Potter. The Headmaster has numerous horcruxes and automatic respawning schemes to aid in his uber-evilness, assisted by his butt-monkey, Snape.

linkffn(the Little Veela That Could by Darth Drafter)

Dumbledore isn't so insanely evil in this, except that the good guys in this case are so much good-er than canon; [[/spoiler][The Veela are basically angels, and Harry effectively is an archangel, able to liberate Saint Joan from her French church haunting to ascend]]

** I don't have the fic on hand, but there was this awful Harry/Draco slash fic. Harry gets pregnant (during the school year) and everyone's happy. Harry's always wanted a family, after all. But Plot Twist: Madame Pomfrey is giving Harry and checkup, and they discover that the child isn't Draco's... but Dumbledore's. Turns out that Dumbledore's been raping+obliviating Harry ever since second year. Dumbledore tries to get custody of Harry's unborn kid, and there's all this drama... I can't really remember all the details, and I exited out after the trainwreck-horror feeling left me.

I'll try to find it for you. But I may not come back with my sanity intact.
