#+TITLE: When Harry and Ron were much older, Ron tells Harry a secret -- He was a Death Eater and he and Draco set up Draco demeaning Ron in front of Harry so Harry will take Ron in as a friend. Ron was to be a deep mole within The Trio for Voldemort. At some point, he had a change of heart.

** Many years ago, I read a fic where the author made fun of the "Ron the Death Eater" trope. ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater]]) Because it was ages ago and the writing wasn't stellar, I did not save it on my favorites list. But your prompt reminded me that a story like that existed.

Anyway, while I don't think I can write something for you, I think it would be funny if your prompt was combined with this one: [[https://amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aw0csj/draco_thinks_the_trio_are_his_best_friends/]].

So we have a Ron who was acting friendly with Harry but was actually an enemy, and a Draco who antagonized Harry but was actually being friendly. What a headache this would be to write but hilarious if done properly.
