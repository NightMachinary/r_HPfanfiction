:END:
I am trying to find a really good Harry Potter fanfiction. In it Harry Potter leaves the wizarding world. He eventually becomes prime minister of Britain. I think there is a sequal. I also think it was Harmione.


** That sounds like Damn Wizards linkffn(7782623) which has a one-shot prequel Harry's Had Enough linkffn(7573003)

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

  Title pretty much says it all. OotP AU, some swear words. No pairing, though HP/HG is hinted at a little. Harry does what he should have done. Complete for now. Author's Note added!
