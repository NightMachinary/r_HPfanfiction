'Nutters' isn't an adjective, it's a plural fucking noun, people. One nutter, two or more nutters. Nutters, collectively, are all bloody mental. Like I go every time I read this, sends me completely doolally. Doesn't make me nutters, there's only one of me.

Well, originally, so's "nuts". If people want to start using "nutters" as another slang adjective for "crazy", they have about as much right to do so as they did "nuts" back when /that/ got started, really.

So that's less a typo than it is a verbiage difference stemming from the different editions of the novel. It's like describing the visitors' entrance to the Ministry as a "phone booth" vs. a "telephone box"

Also the extent of the destruction in the Battle of Hogwarts; the Great Hall should not be reduced to a smoky battlefield for the final duel, as far as the books tell us.

(Another thing I don't think the movies got quite right is the Forbidden Forest; or, rather, they didn't get it right until /OotP/, in one of that film's rare redeeming qualities as an adaptation. The trees in the first few films were far too sparse and thin.)

  I loved the design of the RoR in OOTP - but that might also be part nostalgia on my behalf?
#+end_quote

True, it was very neat-looking. In general, for all its story flaws, /OotP/ looks great. The only things in it I openly dislike, design-wise, are things that are the case throughout the film series and can't be blamed on this one in particular (Hogwarts robes, Death Eater masks, Voldemort's general appearance).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, book Hogwarts is much larger. Still, they did pretty well.
#+end_quote

Another bit I miss is that they turned the talking Gargoyle from Dumbledore's office to a random non-talking, inanimate Griffin statue. Not only was it really funny and picturesque for Dumbledore to have this ugly stony fellow as his guardian (and hysterical to imagine it telling Umbridge off when she tries to become Headmistress and settle into Dumbledore's office), but it was, in retrospect, great foreshadowing of the statues in /DH/.

(Which were also hugely underwhelming, for that matter: they're not supposed to be all alike, Merlindammit! They're the picturesque, ragtag bunch of every wacky bit of decoration from Hogwarts coming alive, not Attack of the Clones.)

#+begin_quote
  Even in something like this? (I don't disagree with you on the robs btw, am just curious =).)
#+end_quote

Well, yeah. It's not that they're bad-looking as original creations, mind you.

But they gave post-movie fans the entirely wrong idea of what "robes" were in the /Harry Potter/ universe, as, for that matter, did giving trousers to anyone. Snape, Voldemort and Dumbledore end up looking like vaguely-transvestite weirdoes for wearing actual robes when everyone else is running around in Muggle Edwardian dress, pants included.

It also makes Hogwarts look much stricter than it is to have this strict dress code. The very clear picture you get in the books, which fits much better both with the fact that Dumbledore is the headmaster, and with the Wizarding World's general eccentricity, is that Hogwarts only enforces that you have to wear the black robes; whether you choose to wear anything else underneath (be that a Weasley sweater, or elegant green silk robes, or indeed nothing at all) is entirely up to you. And they won't even ask you to wear the pointy hat if you don't want to (which very few people do).

Also, the movie costumes gave rise to the fanon trope of identifying people by the color of their tie, even though this makes absolutely no sense.

  Oh? Why didn't you like the masks?

They didn't look much like skulls, is the thing. The books say skull mask, I think skull, freaking, mask. Not... [[https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/342l8V0LGgc0GkSGMeo4Ia/51cbbd50857bce2942d38794509f7095/DeathEater_WB_F5_DeathEaterMask_V5_Photo_land.jpg?w=1200][whatever the heck this is]]. It's creepy. Yes. But it is a skull mask only in the sense that after you're told what it was supposed to be, you can kinda tell by what series of leaps the designers came to this result.

As a reader, I was always imagining (a less plasticky version of) something [[https://inst-2.cdn.shockers.de/hs_cdn/out/pictures//master/product/1/kapuzen-skelett-maske--totenschdel-maske--totenkopf-maske--16515.jpg][like this]]. Not the freaking /masque de fer/.

  re: robes:
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'd heard of the anecdote. And... sure, but Voldemort's robes are especially long and flowing, and are described as such in the books, I believe. You could have robes that are still robes while not reaching the ground. [[https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/images/Product/medium/RC-889688.png][See this cut of monk robes]], for example.

#+begin_quote
  I agree! But also OTOH Mcgonagall is very much the stereotypical British boarding school disciplinarian - and the Hogwarts acceptance letter is worded rather authoritatively, too.
#+end_quote

True, but it does not in fact say anything about a dress code, that letter. Besides, much like McGonagall for that matter, the letter has strong wording of what are really some rather shallow rules. About the strictest thing on there is that you have to choose between an owl, a cat and a toad, and A), I don't think very many people actually wanted to take both or all three at once in Hogwarts's history; B), it doesn't even cover pets /other/ than owls, cats and toads, you can have a rat or a dog or a flamingo for all it cares.

** Since you list it, "Cersei's tits!" and similar.

Canon has /Merlin's beard!/, /Merlin's pants!/, and a few nastier variants that Ron uses in Deathly Hallows but if fanfic is to be believed Wizards and Witches swear by Morgana, the Morrigan, Lugh, Zeus etc. all the time.

Extend it perhaps to paganism in general. Some fanfic authors love to portray the Wizarding world as pagan, worshipping Odinist or Celtic gods, yet in canon, we see they are celebrating the 'Christian' holidays of Easter and Christmas, not openly pagan celebrations of Ishtar/Astarte/Eostre and Yule.

All the evidence we have from canon is that British wizards are from a Christian background if anything and the exclamations referring to Merlin are not religious in nature.

--------------

Second, since it is partially related: the worship of the four founders of Hogwarts, with people swearing by them. "By the Founders!" or the Founders' heirs having some special powers over Hogwarts. We have two canon heirs in the series: Voldemort as Slytherin's Heir, and Zacharias Smith as a relative of Hepzibah Smith who is supposed to be a descendant of Helga Hufflepuff.\\
While it makes sense Tommy Riddle isn't on the board of governors or similar, we never see Zach or his parents being treated as some kind of royalty as fanfic would have you believe when they make Harry into Lord Harold James Black-Potter-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Emrys.

No, actually, my complaint is that the author isn't staying true to the source. I would have the same complaint if it was someone using British grammar in a fanfic written about an American source. Because to me, when I'm reading fanfic, that is something I'm unnecessarily aware of. It's probably because I switch between British and American all the time (I write British English when criticising British literature and American English when criticising American literature), and because my native language has two written forms and when I work I'm required to switch between them depending on which I'm addressed in (completely disregarding which one I would use in everyday communication).

******* If it's an original work I don't care about which form it's written in. Fanfiction is derivative, though, and that's when I get thrown by changed forms, because I have an expectation based on the source material. It's fairly similar to someone disliking OOC or AU in fanfiction, it's just a preference based on what I want to get out of reading fanfic.

**** I'm kind of guilty of that, actually. I'm good at avoiding the obvious, /mom, color, liter/, etc., but I need to remind myself every time to edit out all the /-ize/, and no matter how much time I spend googling whether a certain colloquial expression is British or American, something always slips under the radar.

The stupidest mistake I've made so far was listening to a reviewer telling me to change /pretences/ to /pretenses/ in a title of my fic. I thought that it was weird, but maybe it was like /realize-realise/, and anyway native speakers know best. So I changed it without checking. Then a couple of weeks later, I've got another comment telling me that I spelled /pretences/ wrong. Which, in hindsight, should have been fucking obvious, because I used /Defence/ all throught the fic.

***** I would never mention it directly to an author, because I can't expect everyone to care about it just because I do. I have sometimes noticed an Americanism slipping through an otherwise very British narrative, and in those cases I'm usually pretty impressed because it shows that the form of the text is intentional and that a lot of work probably went into it.

I do wonder at the reviewer saying /pretences/ should be /pretenses/, though. Possibly an American who didn't know that you had the correct British form? It is sort of pretentious to comment on it when they were the one who was wrong.

In the entire series, none of the students ever use DADA / D.A.D.A as shorthand in speech.

Even if they did, say it out loud, as if you're speaking it - D.A.D.A. would actually be four syllables as opposed to Defence's 3. And yes, in speech, students would definitely use D.A.D.A, as DADA sounds ridiculous.

The only shorthand they ever use inside the books is for the DA, which they did because they didn't want anyone finding out.

OWLs and NEWTs at least sound okay - those shorthands are elements that identify with the magical world somewhat.

DADA, on the other hand, sounds like a toddler calling for its father.

Besides, none of the students or teachers ever use DADA/D.A.D.A in the entire series as shorthand.

At the end of the day, using DADA instead of Defence is essentially being lazy. If using DADA instead of Defence is easier, why bother writing any names at all? Hermione is a fairly long name - why not use HJG all the time since it is, as you said, easier to type? Or Dumbledore? Why not use AD?

Stop being lazy. Even if it is fanfiction, get some standards for yourself.
