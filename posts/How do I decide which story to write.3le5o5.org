I've got a plethora of ideas to write, a short story, and some longer ones. But how do I decide which to write? Has anyone else ever had to choose? How did you decide?

Also, anyone know of a way to ensure someone with a summary. One thing that makes me avoid stories is people who put in the summaries something along the lines of "I suck I summaries, its better than it sounds". I'd like to make sure that my summary for when I finally do decide, is amazing.


** Choose whichever one you have the most fun in writing

or

Figure out which idea has the best ending in mind. The strongest stories are the ones with a clear direction and plan for resolution. The ending may eventually shift as you write, but it's much easier to decide if a change in course suits the story if you have a baseline destination in mind.

As for the summary, avoid the trite framing phrases like "what if so-and-so..." "Follow our hero as he..." "In a world...". A clear summary catches the interest of fic shoppers and gives them an idea of the tone of the story. You can always ask others for guidance, and don't be afraid to change the summary entirely if the story ends up going in another direction.

** If you indeed have a great idea for a story, the way you know that it's fleshed out enough to begin writing, you have to have at least one signature scene in your mind, the one that frames the rest of the story for you. /Don't start writing if you don't have that scene./ You're not ready, seriously. Spend more time thinking.

Now, if you find you have multiple such story nuggets floating around in your head, then choose by starting with the one that has the most compelling, interesting, signature scene--and (this is key!) /write that scene first before you do anything else/. You're not going for polish here, just for getting content on paper (or on screen).

Get it down. Look at it. Did it turn out to be as awesome as you thought it would? If yes, then you're lucky (and you have all the motivation you need to write the rest of your story). If not, then repeat with your next idea.

/Don't/ begin a story with the beginning. It's too long a journey before you get to the good stuff and, statistically speaking, you'll never get there from here.

This is what works for me, at any rate.

** Do whatever you feel the most, really. If you cant decide you can start writing it, eventualy you will find one to continue and finish.

** This may be bad advice but it worked for me. Firstly, how fleshed out are your story ideas? If they're mainly just singular plot point (like harry being a werewolf, or AU voldemort never heard the prophecy and won, or maybe Harry is 2 years younger and has a whole new set of friends) you can combine them together, and make a more interesting, complex story.

** If there isn't one story idea that you want to write more than the others go for the one you have best planned. Nothing worse than getting to the middle of the story and realizing you never figured out how to end it. Frustrating for the writer and the reader.

** If you truly can't decide, just start writing down some of your ideas and develop a story until you've got a good feel of them. It will make choosing between (and maybe combining) those ideas a lot easier!
