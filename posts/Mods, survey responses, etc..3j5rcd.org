First off with regards to mods. [[/u/tusing]] has been invited to be a mod. Additionally [[/u/NaughtyGaymer]] has decided to step down due to inactivity. As we start implementing new stuff we'll reevaluate along the way whether we need more. The rest of this post will be informal and disorganized responses to stuff brought up in the survey.

Most seemed happy with how the subreddit is currently moderated though there were a few that felt that we sometimes missed problematic things. If you think something is out of line please do report it, though I usually prefer to allow the community to self-moderate via the vote system and issue warnings if people violate the rules. I've yet to see a violation so egregious that I felt the need to remove it.

  BAN HPMOR
#+end_quote

No.

I'm definitely going to work on doing a better job with the book club. A good percentage were either dissatisfied or disinterested. It's clear that waiting a month is too long. With regards to fic choices I intentionally try to feature a good variety of fics so as to at least eventually include something that will appeal to everyone (and expose people to fics that they might not normally pick out themselves). If the fics so far have not appealed to you please do submit recommendations. There's a comment field in the submission form where you can explain why you think it'd be a good choice.

#+begin_quote
  BAN HPMOR
#+end_quote

No.

I was surprised at the number of people who wanted less restriction on NSFW content, but the current policy carried the day.

#+begin_quote
  BAN HPMOR
#+end_quote

Okay, seriously? C'mon.

#+begin_quote
  Deep breath, here it comes: the sub, to me, is one giant circlejerk. You have a very vocal minority and their tastes, their (negative) reactions to anything that falls outside of their norm is very off putting. At this point the sub is nothing more than an extension of DLP. ... Encourage your redditors to rec or discuss more openmindedly than parrot DLP like stories every freakin time.
#+end_quote

You must not be very familiar with DLP. They would strongly disagree and from what I've seen not many of the really active members of their community are also active here.

There was more than one request for making the community more discussion-oriented rather than request-oriented. The amount to which we can influence this is limited. We can make more sponsored posts, but if there's to be a shift in bulk of posts it'll have to be a community effort.

#+begin_quote
  BAN HPMOR

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

#+begin_quote
  I think it would be hilarious if you made a really controversial fic the book club choice. Like HPMOR or Harry Crow.
#+end_quote

It's becoming tempting...

#+begin_quote
  The amount of work the different moderators do varies quite a bit, any reason for this?
#+end_quote

This will hopefully improve. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] is the founder, not an active mod, but [[/u/NaughtyGaymer]] has stepped down due to inactivity, [[/u/kemistreekat]] has joined and been very active so far in behind the scenes things like flairing and clearing the spam queue and [[/u/tusing]] has been invited as well.

More than one person mentioned not knowing how to submit book club recommendations which confused me because it's a giant blue button in the sidebar. Are a significant number of people visiting solely from mobile? In any case one of our plans is a general info sticky post that should help mobile users discover stuff that currently lives in the sidebar.

#+begin_quote
  Various people complaining about how others like X, and that's /wrong/.
#+end_quote

You'll be happier if you accept that different people just like different things and move on. Moderation's not going to favor any particular kind of fic.

There've been a few suggestions of book club discussions being more guided. Carefully reading each fic and having prepared talking points and whatnot would be a pretty big time commitment on top of existing and planned mod stuff (as well as real life responsibilities). If someone would be interested in taking on that job, though, please do post here.

We'll definitely be trying out themed posts. [[/u/AWookieeFromKashyyyk]] has been trying to start up community-driven debate threads so I'll see how that goes rather than jumping right into mod-driven ones.

The response to the “fic tournament” idea was much more ambivalent. We might revisit it but it's not an immediate priority.

We've also been talking about writing prompt threads to engage the authors in the community more.

  Kick denarii out and hire mods who read fics for how good reads they are instead of "b-but I can change this death eater and turn him into a good guy!!"

** So, wait, are we banning HPMoR or not? /s

** This was a highly amusing read. I wanted to stop in and say I'm in here primarily from mobile (Reddit Sync) so it's hit or miss if something will get noticed in the side bar. The suggestion link is just a plain small blue link at the top from my point of view. So I'm all for a general sticky post.

Thanks for updating us.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3iwsjp/the_great_hpfanfiction_debate/][In regards to the debate thing mentioned please see this post.]].I'm hoping to get that sorted in the next couple of days.

I wouldn't mind doing talking points for the book club of there was high demand cause I read them all anyway but I don't know how feasible it would be long term. Willing to give it a go though.

*** Personally, in your heart, yes. For the sake of this sub, all Potter fanfictions are subject to discussion... though since they have their own subreddit, we citizens reserve the right to downvote such posts into oblivion.

*** I think you need to read it first to understand why it's not liked. Then you'll ban it willingly.

Also under no circumstances are you to go into the fic with an open mind, you need to search for discussion on it, read the tumblr review and find out everything you can about the author (he's...well actually he's Harry in his story so you could just read it).

**** Whats with all the hate for HPMOR? I thought it was one of the top Harry Potter fanfiction's I ever read. Granted the author is a little long winded at times, but it's not bad and is pretty good at times.

***** People have issues with the self insertion, the fact that the author begs for donations for his 'rationality' organization, OOC-ness, the dropped plotlines, the moments where the plot drops out to explain some principle that may or may not actually apply, etc.

Personally, I didn't mind it very much, but it wasn't my favorite either.

** I would be willing to prepare some talking points for book club fanfics I've already read (it helps that I've submitted way too many suggestions =P). And maybe some that I haven't, depending on whether or not I find it interesting.

**** I'd absolutely be willing to lead some discussions if I could have access to the fic a week or two beforehand.

It would be really cool to get a rotation of people going... Might help with the time commitment aspect. And also would work well for the nature of fanfiction, since people who like various genres/pairings could tackle subject matter that interests them.
