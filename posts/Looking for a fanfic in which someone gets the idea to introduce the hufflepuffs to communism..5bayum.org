** IIRC this author ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3205163/Arpad-Hrunta]]) did a one shot of commie Harry that was really funny, I browsed his fanfic site and didn't see it, could be in a drabble collection. The denizens of the Teacher's Lounge would know for sure.

  /Hermione Granger and Harry Potter, 100 words./

  "I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"

  Harry lowered his newspaper. "Harry Potter."

  "Is that the Morning Star?"

  "My uncle's copy. He's arranged a subscription for me for Hogwarts."

  "Is your uncle... red?"

  "Yeah. We all are. You want to make something of it?"

  "I didn't know there were any Communist wizards. Do they even allow that?"

  "Doesn't matter. The Revolution is coming, whatever the wizarding bourgeoisie wants. The dialectic, you know. The working wizard's day is coming. Soon."

  "They just banned the Communists in Russia, you know."

  "Our victory is inevitable."

  "I'm going to find another compartment."

** I'm laughing so fucking hard right now, thinking of the Hufflepuffs singing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DTbashsKic][The Internationale]] at the Welcoming Feast.

/"So come, brooothers and siiisters, for the struggle carries on. The Internationale unites the humans raaace.."/

And Comrade Diggory is hailed as martyr, fallen in the fight against the bourgeois pureblood cause championed by the fascist-pig Voldemort.

**** It's a Harry raised by Deadpool fic.

Very lite hearted, doesn't take itself very serious and is pretty cracky through most of it, but at the same time it is a wonderfully funny read and I personally enjoyed the dialogue between Harry and Wade.
