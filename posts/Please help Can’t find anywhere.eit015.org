:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for two different fan fictions.

The first one is a fan fiction about the wizards moving to another planet. The goblins and the prison get their own planet as well. There are gods and goddess (??) spirits that are specific for all the planets too including earth.

The second one I am looking for is a fan fiction about Harry being rescued by someone (I don't remember who). The people who rescued him get Snape, Remus and Sirius (they rescue him as well) to raise him. When Harry decides to go to school (he doesn't go in his first year), Snape, Remus and Sirius de-age themselves and get enrolled with him.

Any help you can give me I will appreciate. I have searched everywhere I can think of and can't find them. Thanks!


** If anyone can help please do.
