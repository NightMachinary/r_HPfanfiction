Thanks!


** I mean... Voldemort is already a lich in canon, if you go by the idea that a lich stores its soul in an item(phylactery) in order to keep it from passing on. Though usually a phylactery has a lich's entire soul, not pieces of it. I'm fairly certain liches' phylacteries are where JKR got the idea for horcruxes to begin with. I didn't actually do any research to confirm this but that's what I've always assumed, since the idea has been around for ages.

I don't actually know of any fics off the top of my head where Voldemort/Harry are named as liches though, sorry. I'm sure someone will come through.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei][This guy]] is the earliest example I know of in the folklore, although I first ran across the idea as a kid while reading the Chronicles of Prydain. Which might be where JKR got it from, since she's a few years older than me and unlikely to have run across it in D&D, which popularised the notion. She's a nerd, just not /that kind/ of nerd.

**** *Koschei*

In Slavic folklore, Koschei (Russian: Коще́й, tr. Koshchey, IPA: [kɐˈɕːej]), also Kashchei, Koshey or Kashchey, is an archetypal male antagonist, described mainly as abducting the hero's wife. In Vitali Vitaliev's book Granny Yaga he is described as tall and although in excellent health, extremely, almost inhumanly, thin. In book illustrations, cartoons and cinema he has been most frequently represented as a very old and ugly-looking man.

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
