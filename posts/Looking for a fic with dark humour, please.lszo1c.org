I'm trying to write something at the moment that counts as "so morbid it's funny" but getting it to read as funny rather than just depressing is not easy. I'm looking for books and fics I can read which manage to pull this off, so if you know of any fics that made you go "that's /awful!/ ...But also hilarious" then please link it! I'd prefer it not be crack, by the way, but beggars can't be choosers.

Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] is a time travel in which Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan exact terrible revenge upon their enemies. Tons of dark humors, the part with Goblins is especially fun

** Crack, sorry. But has a lot of dark/morbid stuff that is presented in a very funny way but if you stop to think about what is actually happening it is quite horrible (esp if you are a fan of Snape, or the Death Eaters org).
