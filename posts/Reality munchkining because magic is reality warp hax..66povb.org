where is the acknowledgment that magic is the power to break reality just because you *really* wanted to. magic is the ultimate hax and nobody cares. WHAT. THE. FUCK. it makes no sense.

Where are the fics where the MC actually legitimately take advantage of the fact that he can fuck reality and reality will usually consent (or just need a little coercion). it's fucking magic for crying out loud magic+brain=badass as fuck its simple badassery you don't need a spell to boil blood are instadeath when you can just cleave armies in half, you don't need to worry about food when you could analyze the contents of the food a rearrange the atoms in the air into food, animagi prove that you don't need a brain to think so that means you could Deadpool's best healing factor, there is no limit.

so where are the fics where the mc fucks reality because he can rather than conforming to the un reality fucky standards of the people who should be fucking reality just because they can.

tldr: reality munchkins where the fuck are the reality munchkins.


** The closest thing is linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) but I don't think it is what you are looking for. Worth reading all the same.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
