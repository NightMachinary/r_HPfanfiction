The prophecy, instead of been created post Voldemort's rise, was actually in play long before his birth.

With the previous Dark Lord, Gellert Grindelwald, unexpectedly stopped by Dumbledore, despite all of fate's attempts to prevent the sugar-frenzied headmaster's meddling. Fate now needed another as it had long since decided that one of the Potter's family descendants would become the saviour of the wizarding world.

But for a saviour to exist, a Dark Lord must rise.

Tl;dr The prophecy didn't create a Harry Potter to stop a Voldemort, but the opposite. It created a /Voldemort/ for a Harry Potter to stop in the future.

Edit: This would in fact help push the reason for Dumbledore's lack of intereference, if he knows what's up. Given putting down Voldemort would only result in another Dark Lord to rise in the same century. The cycle perpetually going on until a Potter finally takes out a Dark Lord.


** Turn it to a crack fic. Somebody else kills voldy and harry dies by being hit with a meteor, but he left some girl pregnant so another dark Lord rises. And the cycle just keeps repeating.

*** I really would. Crack fics are favourite of mine. But I am pretty sure my readers would have a fit if I started another fic with a long update timer on it

**** Could make it a one shot. Just a snap shot of each potter who killed the dark Lord and what killed them getting more and more outlandish. Having one where it was twins born a but one was a girl and she killed the dark Lord when it was supposed to be her brother. The last snap shot is of a potter dark Lord who accidentally kills himself in some dumb way ending the prophecy and banning the name potter from ever being allowed to be a family name.
