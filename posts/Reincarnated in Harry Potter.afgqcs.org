** I never watched Naruto, yet I understood this crossover without a problem: linkffn(7648998)

An old Naruto is reincarnated as Harry Potter. An OP Harry. I loved it. Sadly incomplete.

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

** IMO there is not really any good and complete self insert fic in this fandom...

LOTR lives and thrives with SI and ASOIAF also has interesting ones, especially at Alternate History :[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/gaemon-redux-si.438278/page-132#post-18111078]]
