So I was reading this fan fiction that was recommended to me by a friend. I was sceptical at first because really - evil!Harry or something similar is not my cup of tea.

But I am really astonished with the way the writer maintains a perfect balance in the story. Maintaining such thin line between the budding relationship between Harry and Rabastan and Harry's neutral stance, it has left me speechless. Won't say more. -spoiler-ðŸ˜…

I seriously don't have much words to describe what I'm feeling after reading it. It's definitely given me a new perspective and world view. I really would recommend it to people.
