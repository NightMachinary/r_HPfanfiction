#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** In Corvus Black by Firazh, Harry gets the 'I must not tell lies' scar turned into a rune tattoo. This is a minor plot point but has been brought up multiple times. It is a great story! linkffn(10478838)

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.

** I saw a Fable/Harry Potter crossover once that mentioned them but never got far enough into it to see how they were used. I mused on A runic array fire tattoo for Harry in my Darkness!Harry story. And my currently very hiatus HP& Earth-binarycode will have them if I ever work on it again.
