"Mister Fury!", Doktor Selvig called Said man replied, walking towards him. "What is it, Selvig?" Selvig looked nervous: "The Tesseract, it-it seems to be misbehaving." "Did you just say it's 'misbehaving'?", Fury wanted to know. "Yes, I did. But I can not see why or what the cause of its behaiv-" He didn't get to finish his sentence.

The Tesseract started to rattle and shake. Everyone backed off and got distance between their self and the brighter and brighter glowing cubic. "Any idea what's happening, Doctor Selvig?!" "No!" The Doctor answered shocked. The blue cubic glowed brighter and shook even more till everyone had to shield their eyes. First a pop, then sharp breaths and a shocked and confused voice were heard and as they were able to see at the table again, there sat a black-haired boy with glasses about 13 or 14 years and another boy around 16/17 who seemed to be unconscious. Both were dirty and the younger boy looked more distressed the more he took his surroundings in. His hand hold a stick with which he pointed at those who stood directly in front of him: Fury and Selvig. In the very next second, 12 weapons were focused on him and the boy froze.

Director Fury took everything of the boy in and took a step forward, only for the boy to twitch back. He stopped and waited for the boy to calm down. Then he said calmly but strict: "I am director Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., right now you are in one of our bases and I would like to know who you and your friend are and how you got here, kid." Said kid could only open and close his mouth till he looked at the other boy and whispered nearly too quickly: "We We were attacked. We were at the end of the tournament. I-it wasn't part of-. B-but then we were at the graveyard an-and Pettigrew was there and Volde-demort. He told him to k-kill the spare and then they p-performed some ritual and then, and the-then" The boy started to shake and his breath became too short. His hands fisted into the short of the older boy reluctant to let go.

Fury stepped forward again, this time with his hand in a non-threatening gesture and slowly suggested: how about we get off that table and something to drink to calm your nerves. Then you can also tell us your name, how is that?" The boy only nodded, though if he really heard him was a different story. Five minutes later in another room, sitting on a chair with a blanket around him the boy finally replied still quietly: "H-Harry Potter. That is- w-was Cedric D-Diggory."

  The Cube sparked again -for the room to shake. It continued to spark more, bigger each time - to which a beam of energy was suddenly brought forth and -an explosion... Once visual returned, it was only for Fury to tense further as he took in the unknowns now of the platform. A dark haired kid complete with a bloodied sword in hand. And the brightest tropical bird flying overhead.
