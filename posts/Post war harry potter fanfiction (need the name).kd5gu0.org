** So with the tech, and the resort (I think that was in the book) sounds like parts of The Last Mage of Krypton.

I don't remember anyone working for him and it is during Hogwarts, but he manages to broadcast quidditch games on "tv" makes a whole city/resort/mall underground.

** I know I'm late to the party, but it's probably "Harry Potter Happily Ever After" by PotterFanSteve

I personally don't like this fic, but whatever I'm not one to judge
