For example, in this story - Building Bridges - Linkffn(6427995) Harry is an excellent example of storyteller.

In some stories where there's an active /sorting hat/ tends to turn like this. For example, Wit Beyond Measure - Linkffn(6168029) - sorting hat here represented as hilarious as awesome storyteller. A bit in this story too - Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë).

As much as I don't like the story for some weird reason - Linkffn(Stages of Hope) - Luna, here, is an excellent storyteller. Many writers try to give Luna this type of weird feature but 99% turned into cliches rather than productive.

Suggestion on storyteller character having major part in a fiction?

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family.

  Born two years before the prophecy, Tom Riddle does not mark Harry as his equal, but life has never been easy for Potters. How will an intelligent, and independent Harry, fit into the two dimensional wizarding world? Will he conform to the prescribed paths or will he resist the manipulations of the powers that be? Harry/Fleur eventually. OCs major part of the story. More inside.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
