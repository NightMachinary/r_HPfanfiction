When it comes to listing Hermione's flaws, people often say that she's narrow-minded, just because Xenophilius Lovegood said so. However, while one can argue that Hermione has certain flaws, being narrow-minded is not one of them. If anything, Hermione is shown to be more open-minded than even Harry and Ron in some cases.

Lets see some reasons why people call her narrow-minded and why I think they're wrong:

1)*Not believing Luna's theories.* The thing is that /nobody/ believes Luna's theories, except Luna and her father and for good reason. We never see any reason to believe Luna's theories. Why is Hermione narrow-minded for not believing absurd theories? It's like saying you're narrow-minded just because you don't accept fake news.

2)*She didn't take the Deathly Hallows seriously*. The thing is that Hermione was at least partially right about this. It was a terrible idea for them to start hunting down the Deathly Hallows at that point when they had way more serious issues. Even Dumbledore didn't want them to rely too much on the Deathly Hallows. Hermione just uses common sense.

If anything Hermione is quite open-minded, in some cases even more than Harry and Ron. One example of this is Kreacher. Hermione was literally the ONLY ONE who thought there was something more to Kreacher. She was one of the few who thought there was more to house elves in general. Another example is how she didn't say anything about Lupin even though she knew he was a werewolf. She showed that she was open-minded towards him when basically everyone in the wizarding community hates werewolves.

I would argue that Harry is usually MORE narrow-minded than Hermione since he is more likely to be prejudiced (examples: his perceptions about Kreacher, Snape , Slytherin etc.)


** While I do agree that Hermione isn't narrow-minded, I disagree with your assessment of Harry being more narrow-minded, however just because you're not completely narrow-minded it doesn't necessarily mean you're open-minded.

His reaction to creature and Snape came about after first impressions and weren't given reason to change for a pretty damned long time post their meeting.

His change of opinion with Dobby and Snape alone show a willingness to change his mind about people after a bad impression.

It's far more than that. Hermione isn't just dismissive of Luna's theories, she's actively antagonistic.

First, you mention that nobody believes Luna's theories, except for Luna and her father. That's not true: the /Quibbler/ is a collection of articles, more than a few of which are comprised of interviews with people who saw or experienced something they can't explain. These people had nowhere else to go, and nobody else who was willing to listen to them.

Going to Hermione herself:

Hermione says /The Quibbler/ is a load of rubbish and then gives a thoroughly unconvincing, half-arsed apology when Luna interrupts that her father is the editor.

And more to the point, Hermione will interrupt otherwise neutral conversations for no other reason that to prove she's right. When Luna stands up to Parvati and Lavender for laughing at her support of Harry (the girls were laughing at Luna's radish earrings but that's beside the point--Luna legitimately thought they were mocking Harry), saying that others didn't believe in the Crumple-Horned Snorkack and Blithering Humdinger, Hermione says that those people were right.

Hermione says that Harry can find better supporters than Luna, who "only believes in things when there's no evidence whatsoever."

This is war. You can't afford to be choosey with your allies and reject them for eccentricities. And Hermione is skating on /very/ thin ice by implying that some people are better than others, when the "other" in question is someone who has not done her any wrong.

I'm pretty sure that when she dismisses them, she says that there's never been any proof, implying that she read about them, did the proper research, and came to the conclusion that they couldn't exist. That's the textbook definition of a logical, open-minded person.

**** I dislike Hermione immensely for a variety of reasons. But we have no earthly idea if she did or didn't do any research.

Of the two characters, Luna is far more likely to make up something and believe it as fact without any proof than Hermione.

Hermione is more likely to look into something and figure it out and make a decision from that. It's far more in Hermione's character to do the research and decide it's all crap than it is in Luna's to make an informed decision.

Could she have been dismissing them out of hand like we would with say, the existence of Twilight Sparkle? Sure. But if there's any character in the entire HP universe that is going to at least try to see if there was any merit to it, it's Hermione.

It's funny that you whine about Hermione apologism and then ignore an argument that promotes one of her worst traits. She's obsessive with knowledge to a fault.

However; in this situation, she is almost certainly 100% correct. Luna's reaction is more akin to a put off child taking their ball and going home.

Hell, as a writer I'd probably use Hermione intentionally in this case. If the dismissal comes from say, Ron or Harry, who are less 'factually' reliable, it holds less weight than if it comes from the only character in the book that might have actually tried to find the truth in it.

Your entire assumption that she did no research could very well be true. But, given that she researched everything to the point that it's practically a running joke, ignores what's presented in the text in other areas.

The one thing we absolutely know about her is that she reads everything she can about wizarding culture and the magical world. She openly says that she's read the Quibbler before in that conversation, and then says that there's no proof that the creatures exist. That's a pretty heavy implication that she's looked them up or had already seen something else that called it a hoax.

****** Hermione has no real flaw at all. Well, if you want to get technical she does have traits that could be considered flaws, but in the plot they're not portrayed as flaws at all, as Hermione is portrayed as being right 99% of the time. The plot is simply written in such a way that Hermione turns out to be right even if only by chance. (example: her saying that the HBP book was dangerous in some way and then it turned out that it had dangerous spells inside) The only time where she was shown to be somewhat wrong was with the house elves and with the DHs , but even then she was only "partially" wrong.

I am not saying it as if it's a good thing though. I actually think it would have been better if her flaws were explored more, but I feel that it simply didn't happen. Even when she did questionable things, like attacking Ron with birds, the text made it look like she was justified.

Think about it. Did we ever see Hermione screw up the way Harry and Ron sometimes did? Did we ever see her actually face any consequences for her mistakes? Did she ever even have to apologize for anything? Of course not. Saying that Hermione is "perfect" is an exaggeration, but not far from the truth.

Right, I think people are misidentifying the dichotomy between Luna and Hermione. It's not between being open- vs close-minded, but about chaos vs structure. Maybe even idealism vs. materialism.

As a materialist (for the most part) myself I'm not unfamiliar with the notion of people claiming that this somehow makes me close minded. Being able to entertain different ideas isn't the same as accepting all of them. Clearly Luna doesn't accept all ideas either.

The only really closed minded one of the trio is actually Ron, he's barely capable of understanding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind][theory of mind]] ("Clearly Harry must have put his name in the Goblet! I'd want to be in the tournament and therefore Harry would want to be a champion too")

*** *Theory of mind*

Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states---beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc.---to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own. Theory of mind is crucial for everyday human social interactions and is used when analyzing, judging, and inferring others' behaviors. Deficits can occur in people with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cocaine addiction, and brain damage suffered from alcohol's neurotoxicity. Although philosophical approaches to this exist, the theory of mind as such is distinct from the philosophy of mind.

** WOW...you weren't getting brownie points in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a3d9m0/from_a_character_perspective_hermiones_backstory/][original thread]] so you had to create an entirely new one to try and prove your flawed point. This is a first. I don't think I've ever seen that done on this platform before.

But at least now you admit she [Hermione] has flaws. In the previous thread you claim she "almost has no flaws."

Also, just because "in some cases" she has proven to be more open-minded than Harry and Ron doesn't automatically mean she isn't close-minded herself. Like I said before, you argue with Kreacher and I'll argue with S.P.E.W. And Hermione not outing Lupin (initially - because she did out him later in Prisoner of Azkaban) doesn't necessarily mean she's open-minded. One could argue she was fond of him as a professor after her first two Defense Against the Dark Arts professors were complete rubbish.

You're confused. Even in my original comment I said Hermione "barely has any flaws". This implies that she DOES have some flaws but they're minor and insignificant. It doesn't imply that she "doesn't have any flaws".

Hermione might have flaws, but it doesn't matter because she never faces any real consequences for them, unlike Harry and Ron who both pay for their mistakes and have to apologize. When did Hermione ever apologize for anything? Even when someone criticized her in the series, that person was usually portrayed as the bad guy, while Hermione was portrayed as the victim. Whenever something bad happens to Hermione, it's always someone else's fault and of course never her fault.

Then there's spew! As far as we know Hermione knows nothing more about houselfs than what Harry told her and she decides that the wiz-world are all slavers and that freeing the slaves is something that she - a schoolgirl - needs to attempt ASAP!

She broke his trust, which is IMHO one of the worst things you can do to a friends! If you believe (note: RL example here!) that someone sent that friend a bomb? You open the freaking parcel yourself, especially if said friend doesn't want the police (teachers!) involved!)

​

So yes, she certainly is a bit narrow minded when she doesn't do her research! Over all you might be right, but that doesn't make Hermione super open minded (hell, another example: It took her AGES to accept that Lockheart was a FRAUD and a liar who shouldn't teach!) either! Hell, her correcting peoples swearing makes her a posh little nerd (Ron was right to call her a nightmare! Seriously, I hate Ron but he was right here (it's not diplomatic to say that when the person you are talking about can hear, but that doesn't make it wrong!)). Hell, with her parents she probably is a trust-fund kid (not as rich as Draco, but certainly well off!)

​

Still, she can be narrow minded, which happens when either something offends her sensibilities (enslaved houselfs, because muggles don't have any slavery anymore!) or when she thinks she is better than other people ("Harry is a dumbass, he will not get the teachers involved - so I guess it is up to me!" - that could easily have been her thought process, without taking into account why Harry might not trust authority figures (who have only hurt him up to that point and were at best indifferent (McGonagall during 'Sorcerer's Stone') towards him and hostile at worst (Dursleys and Snape)))

​

She certainly is not dumb, but sometimes teenagers don't have all the info (goes for adults too sometimes!) but they judge or act anyway!

​

ps: Harry's perceptions about Snape were spot on! Yes, he wasn't a traitor (Harry was 99% right, he just wasn't right about the side Snape was on!) but an awful human being and a murderer (no matter what Dumbledore wanted, what Snape does is still murder! Sure you can claim it to be a mercy killing which also gave Dumbledore's life some final purpose, but that doesn't change the fact that they planned this (so Dumbledore planned his own murder, but the one to do it was Snape! Good people probably would have refused, at least until Dumbledore was in unbearable pain and would die in minutes anyway!))

Kreacher was an awful elf and deserves a horrible death!

Most Slytherins (Draco, Parkinson, Snape, Crabbe, Goyle, Lucius Malfoy etc. etc. etc.) were awful people, so again: Harry was pretty spot on (yes, there are Slytherins who are like that, but if it is life and death? Sorry, I wouldn't risk life and limb trusting any Slytherins (note: I am one myself - well either that or a Raveclaw nerd! - but I wouldn't allow bullying around me, so the trio would know I am not a bad guy! While most Slytherins we know about either are bullies or thugs who support bullies or at least they do not step in (which is almost as bad!))

Yes, open the package you believe could be a bomb. Probably in the middle of the Gryffindor, full of potential victims. Or the great hall, full of even more potential victims. Sound idea. Don't let the actual bomb detection experts deal with the bomb.

  If you believe (note: RL example here!) that someone sent that friend a bomb? You open the freaking parcel yourself, especially if said friend doesn't want the police (teachers!) involved!)

What? Are you serious? Hermione should have got herself killed because Harry was an immature idiot? Besides what does this have to do with being narrow-minded?

**** Because she always thinks she knows best, which IMHO is the very deffinition of narrow minded (when you can't conceive that others might be right, instead of you!)! It's always her way or the highway (unless people ignore her and go ahead with what they want to do anyway! Not that she is always wrong, but she isn't always right either!)

And yes, if a friend tells you: "Leve it alone! I don't want the police involved!" Then you either leave it alone (good friend!) or look into the parcel yourself (best friend!) - you don't snitch to the police yourself, you don't send them text-messages or e-mails (or mail an anonymous letter) etc.!

In this case, she did, didn't she? The parcel /was/ sent by Sirius and none of them knew at the time that Sirius was innocent.\\
If my friends thought I was in danger, I would want them to help me no matter what, even if it meant contacting authorities against my will (unless of course, it meant I would be implicated for some other crime - which Harry obviously was not going to be).. Most importantly, if it was my best friend, I would definitely /not/ /want them to die for me/ because I was too stupid to listen to them and be careful - it would be too hard to live with that on my conscience.

***** Yes, if you think there's a bomb, you inform the police. Otherwise, any deaths are on your head. (It's not as if your stupid moron of a friend is the only one endangered by a bomb or dark curse.)

Harry was an utter moron and Hermione was right to inform the teachers.
