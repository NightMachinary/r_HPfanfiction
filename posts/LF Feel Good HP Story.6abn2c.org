I've been feeling down lately and I'd like a light hearted fanfiction with compelling story, fluffy moments and funny banter between main characters. I'd prefer no slash, and Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna if possible. Thanks to anyone who can send suggestions

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** linkffn(Oh god not again) isn't necessary fluffy, but I felt happy and laughed a lot when reading it.

linkffn(Where in the world is Harry potter by nonjon) is similar, even though I prefer linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon).

These are all crackfics and not really "fluff", but there is no angst and no darkness.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkffn(9526039) is canon pairings, but still fluffy and one of my favorites.

Also maybe see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/53x0o5/i_received_some_pretty_rough_news_today_so_im/][this post?]]
