Any fics where Harry is able to alter his appearance without spells, glamours, etc., preferably without Harry/Ginny. Preferably also a long fic that goes through at least a year of Hogwarts, whether it's first year only, seventh year only, or a year somewhere in the middle. Could be all years and some post-war stuff. Not looking for smut, just story.


** The only one I actually know of this is Harry Potter and the Metamorph - he gets tired of the war and runs off to America, then they recruit Tonks to train him. It's a Honks fic. Can't remember if I liked it, but it's there.

*** It's good, uses a number of the tropes I'm not a fan of, but overall I actually bought the romance, at least to some extent.

**** Good to know. I do vaguely remember that the romance was paced - not just the "Wham bam thank you ma'am" whirlwinds that some fics go for. There was actually some preamble to them getting together.
