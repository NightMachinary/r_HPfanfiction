As a fully fledged fanfiction or as short blurbs like above? Either would be lovely, but I certainly would enjoy your interpretation of the books in a more expanded form.

I am in concurrence with SC33, however, and would like a bit more deviation from canon.

** This story sounds good, and I like the twists (such as Lockhart's brutal demise) but I do think you should stray further from canon.

Create some new scenes, add some new characters or give backstory to existing ones (like Terrence Higgs, or Terry Boot) who aren't fully developed in canon.

Also, while the Harry in your story is more intelligent, a lot of action is cut, for example Harry's confrontations with Voldemort in the Forest, the Chamber of Secrets, and the fight for the Philosopher's Stone.

If you just twist canon around, the readers will know what to expect; if you keep them on their toes with new scenes that weren't depicted in the books, it's a lot more interesting.

** I love the idea behind this. I'd never thought about what would happen had Harry been a Slytherin.

The only issue I see with this is Lockhart. Lockhart was a dunce whose only real skill was with memory charms. He wouldn't have had the skill to brew up felix felicis, nor do I think that Snape would do that for him as a nicety.

If you develop this into a full-fledged fan fiction (which I would love to see you do, by the way), this could be explained by him getting it as a gift from Slughorn, as, presumably, Slughorn would have attempted to get Lockhart into the Slug Club during Lockhart's time as a student.

Now, with the basilisk, the only reason Lockhart would have gone down there is if he had been forced, like Harry and Ron forced him in CoS. He was running away up until then, having been charged to go and hunt down the basilisk, but not having enough balls to do it.

Another thing to think about and that could be a lot of fun to play around with is the effect of destroying the diary before the basilisk is killed. For example, what would happen if the basilisk were free when the diary were destroyed, and thus Tom Riddle's control over it? Would it roam the school freely, killing anything and everything in its wake? Or would it go and hide in the Chamber, not knowing what to do, a loyal soldier without orders?

My God, I'm getting excited just thinking of the possibilities here...if you ever do write a full-fledged fan fiction and need a beta, hit me up.

** Not too bad. If I say so myself, one of the best I've ever read.
