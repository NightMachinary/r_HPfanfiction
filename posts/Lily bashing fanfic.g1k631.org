I do love James and Lily but there are times whenever I read a Marauder-era fic, I tend to hate Lily because she's worst than Hermione's Know-It-All attitude. Granted, yes, we don't really know the exact stories during their time and its all what the fanfic author has made it so.

However, this begs the question, are there any good fics during Marauder-era with Lily Evans bashing in it? I found one which is Black Fortunes by Herald-MageAnduli but its mostly on the background as the main pairing is Harry Potter and Orion Black.


** Oh thank Merlin, I thought I was crazy for hating Lily not only because of her attitude but also how she treated both James and Severus though part of me also does not like James either but she was worst which is ironic since James was portrayed as a bully! Lily is known as a hero but she only did what a mother would do and tried to protect her son but she was a bad friend to her "life long friend" . I do not like Hermione in canon either though because she is bullying others as she'd been bullied. She hits people for annoying her, shoves her opinions in others faces and abandoned her muggle heritage instead of trying to manage both parts of her and spending time with her parents. She seems to care more about being "special" and "accepted" in the magical world than bonding and catching up with her parents. I always felt bad for them for having an unappreciative daughter who would abandon them, wiping their memory and essentially steal everything they worked for to "keep them safe". Just talk to them for Merlins sake! Tell them the truth and talk to them like the grown ups they are and not the grown up you think you are! #rantover

*** ... Severus? Dude, all we see is her trying to protect him from Potter, and the little retard snaps at her with his death eater vocabulary. She never treated anyone badly, she seems rather patient as the scene occurs in 5th year, yet she was still friends with a fucking muggle hater biggot. And Potter? She treated him badly.. how? By not submitting to his caveman ways? She had a lot of patience with that one...

As for Hermione.. what a bunch of bullshit, none of that is canon, she spent almost every vacation (Christmas, Easter, Summer) with her parents, with the exception of the last few weeks of summer, and the duration of that one varied. It only increased when the war started, as taking care of her would put them all at risk. We don't know what other measures they took, but the order could have relocated them to another home. As for the escapade.. Stealing everything they worked for..? Says who? We literally know nothing about what she actually did, and we can't even trust what little she said she did as she's smart enough to understand they don't need to know and everyone is safer that way. I can say she ensured they would be safe and their business managed while they took a sabatical in a cruise, and you can say she obliviated them and stole their money, but neither is a /fact/.

**** She gives me opportunist and user vibes. She has a black and white views.

The ending of her friendship with Snape was well done but why she was so blind all this time? He was a racist

Why she married a guy that was a bully? He lied behind her back but contined his bully acts with his friends

Jk said that Lily was always attracted to James. Why she played so hard to get? Why she was attracted to the idiot jock? Come on...

She wasnt perfect

** I never thought Lily was a know it ali and hate when they make her Hermione 2.0. Or the fics make her a perfect rose

But I also dont like Lily because she always seemed like an annoying popular girl that plays coy and hard to get and a bit of a gold digger and user of people.
