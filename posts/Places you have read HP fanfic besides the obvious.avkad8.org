The obvious:

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/]]

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/]]


** the new [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]] has a nice interface but it isn't very populated with fics, since they lost most of them, I think, when the archive went down.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]] for SS/HG

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/]] for Severus Snape fics

[[http://erosnsappho.sycophanthex.com/]] for slash and femmeslash

[[http://lumos.sycophanthex.com/]] other HP stories

[[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/]] (which is being migrated to AO3, now, but check the links at that main link to see if there's anything you haven't seen before? It had stupidly strict restrictions and required beta reading (by THEIR beta readers) before you were allowed to post, back in the day)

There used to be 'The Restricted Section' which had a login like the sycophanthex sites (and I'm not sure the logins there work right now), but it appears to be completely gone. Fanlore shows the wayback machine has a few grabs.

** [[http://potionsandsnitches.org]] is a Harry and Snape Gen only archive (there can be het or slash in the story, but no HP/SS ). It doesn't update very often anymore, but has a lot of good old fics.

** There is [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/]], which is mostly Harry/Hermione stories. Browsing it is horrible though because there is no rating or feedback system since it is just a backup of the original site. It has an elaborate search mask though.

** If you're a Harry/Ginny fan SIYE is a great site, I can't think of any other sites besides the ones already mentioned.

** There are also some yahoo groups that have fanfiction stored in there file section or posted in chat. Off the top of my head there is The Great Hall, Three Part Harmony, and one devoted to lost fanfics that I can't recall the name of. They're not active but have stories you can download. One that is active is Caer Azkaban, started by Rorschach's Blot and has stories from him, Dogbert Carrol, Doghead Thirteen many others. This includes stuff that to my knowledge isn't posted anywhere else. If you do go there however do note that they will not hesitate to ban anyone causing problems and that certain opinions will see you facing major criticism.

** Darklordpotter forum's Work By Author section. Registered users only.

The Santi used to post chapters of "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" there before the story was abandoned. There are more "unofficial" chapters floating around from being copied from DLP, than there are in the FFN version. linkffn(5353809)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Livejournal actually has a lot of old fanfiction that was really great. If you google fanfic awards a lot of the old award winning fanfic is on there. Sometimes you can find unofficial updates that never made it to the main archive sites. Livejournal also did some of the best exchanges. Like dmhgexchange was huge for years and there is this great backlog of really good fic that isn't posted anywhere else.
