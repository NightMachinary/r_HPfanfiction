Their relationship begins early on at Hogwarts. Daphne's family is very shrewd, particularly the father who sees benefit in Daphne befriending Harry. At some point a friendship contract is signed. At some point Harry fights in a dueling tournament in France where Fleur shows up. There are problems between Daphne's family and Veela.

That's all I've got to go on. I hope someone can help, thanks!
