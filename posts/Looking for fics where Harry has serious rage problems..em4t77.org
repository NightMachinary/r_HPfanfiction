Hey guys.\\
I just love those fics where when Harry gets pissed something scary happens.\\
So what im looking is some fics where he has serius rage problems that causes things to happens.\\
Harry has to get very pissed frequently.\\
Every time he becomes enraged something needs to happen, accidental magic, thigs got on fire, things brake, or even his appearence can change, something like when yougVoldemort got too emotional his eyes became red.

No slash.\\
If there's pairings i would like someone different than Ginny, i also don't like Harry with Hermione, but it's okay.\\
The fic must be a little long so i can distract myself for some time.\\
And has to have a focus on harry's rage problems.\\
BONUS: I would like very much to find some fics where the power from the proffecy it's not love but Rage and/or Hate.

That's it!

cya.


** linkffn(Three to Backstep by Sinyk)

Harry has major rage problems in this fic but I think it's more due to bad writing and the author not really understanding how to make Harry properly angry.

Seriously, I wouldn't read it unless you really want to. It's long. Has Hermione. A lot of it can be boring. A lot of bashing. The worst type of Indie;Harry. Love bonds. Political Harry. Lord Harry. Harry flying off the handle for no reason at times.

If you don't mind any of that go right ahead. There was a time I enjoyed it on my first read but that was long ago.

*** On that note how about angry Harry and the seven by sinyk which is everything you said and more. The opening 2 chapters are perhaps the most hard to get through, but Harry is really angry throughout the fic. .linkffn(9750991)

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** linkffn(5866937), sort of. Harry definitely gets pissed off a lot. It doesn't often end in explosions though.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
