Do you prefer when the fic keeps things more-or-less the way they happened in the books, but with the twist worked in, so it's sort of a new way of reading the books, or when the fic goes in a completely different direction? I'm interested in what kind of fics you all like, in general, but I'm also asking in particular about a fix I'm working on. The main point of it is that Harry and Draco become friends when they first meet at Madam Malkins, and I can't decide if I want to stick close to the original storyline and explore the position this puts Draco in when Voldemort returns, or if I want things to go totally haywire and make it so different from the books that there's no overlap at all.


** I would prefer reading something more original (as in, a story that diverges from canon). That probably makes me a hypocrite, because I went with a canon rehash when writing my own fic. Coming up with a good storyline is hard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*** Coming up with an outline is easy, but writing it into a fic without plotholes with believable dialogue is difficult.

** There is a simple rule for "What if..." stories and it is as follows:

*Everything that follows the divergence must involve the logical conclusions of that divergence.*

For example, if your Harry and Draco become friends, Ron and Harry probably won't. If Draco and Harry are friends, chances are he becomes a Slytherin due to Draco being there. If he is a Slytherin, chances are he won't become friends with Hermione. You get the idea.

Logical conclusions. The great conflict of Draco - deciding between Harry and Voldemort - can still happen. It all depends on your creativity and writing skills.

** Depends on the manner in which you are staying close to the canon stations or the way you are moving away from them.

I don't mind some canon rehash as long as it's not complete rehash. The main stations can be visited but should be treated differently. Don't write canon with characters swapped. Ex: Don't have Malfoy steal Scabbers and then get dragged to the Shack. Think of a new way around the plot.

If you are spinning off in a completely new direction, think for a bit what canon events might still happen without the changes you made. Decide if they are important to the story you are trying to write, if they are, approach them from the new setting you have created, if not, write them out somehow. You are already writing AU, it doesn't just have to be single point of departure, you can say that Barty Crouch Jr never escaped and that's okay.

Also consider where you really want your story to start. Is the main point of your story the friendship between Harry and Malfoy from Madame Malkins? Or is it how a friendship with Harry changes the role of the Malfoys during the war. You can start during fourth year of your AU and fill in the readers with flashbacks and conversation driven exposition, or you can lay the base ground and then skip forward, highlighting key events until you get to the main point of your fic.

Either way is good, many people have read a lot of canon rehashes already, so there is often more call for something completely new. But write the rehash if that is the story you want to tell, because the story you want to tell will be better than the one you feel obligated to write for other people.

** Harry being friends with Draco is a major change. A lot of events wouldn't happen in such a case.

** I prefer a bunch of smaller changes as to one larger change. But, it actually has to be a change. It's pointless if all the same stuff happens and the only difference is that Harry is friends with Draco.

** The overwhelming sentiment on this sub favors original plots.

I personally hate canon rehashes with a passion, especially in time travels.

I mean if I want to reread the canon plot, I'm going to read JKR's original work. I don't want to read that again in a fanfic that usually lacks quality controls.

As for making Harry and Draco friends in first year, this topic has been beaten to deaths in HP fanfics, and there are literally thousands of them. But should they become friends, it would be a MAJOR divergence and would completely blow out the canon plot. For example: Harry would end up in Slytherin, Snape might be more receptive to him, nobody was going to save Hermione from the Troll, Hagrid would not tell a Slytherin!Harry anything about the Stone, and so forth. Voldemort then got stuck in front of the Mirror and was neutralized by Dumbledore.

In Year 2, now relieved that Voldemort was gone for the time being, Dumbledore went after Lucius Malfoy, who retaliated by planting the Diary on Ginny. But instead of carrying out a bunch of attacks, Diary Riddle went straight for getting a body back, the resulting merger with Ginny's soul created the next threat, the dark lady Ginnymort.

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) is my story. It follows the canon of 1,2, and 4 but diverges away quickly though not a lot at first. Harry's too busy with family stuff to worry about the stone. He only becomes involved by accident. In book two i'm still debating how it all goes down. Book four is where serious divergence happens.

** Different direction all the way. Much more interesting, long as the different direction doesn't just boil down to "Harry becomes stronger and cooler and has better friends and better everything than in canon."

** Thanks all for your comments, you've given me a lot to think about. This started because I was thinking about how really, really small things can drastically change everything. So I started writing the Madam Malkins scene from Madam Malkins' point of view. And I always sort of felt like part of Draco's asshole-ishness was him putting on a show for an audience. So I had the assistant spill her coffee on Draco's new robes, and the tow women go off to fix the problem, leaving Draco and Harry alone. And Draco is still a total asshole, but their conversation makes Harry realize that its mostly because Draco doesn't actually know /how/ to be nice. So they don't really become friends right away, but Harry kind of decides he's going to teach Draco to be a good friend. Of course, Harry has never really had friends, either, so he's kind of shit at it too, and most of the start of first year is the two of them misunderstanding one another and getting progressively more antagonistic towards each other, at which point Draco rats them out about Norbert and they end up in detention, like in the books. I picture that as the moment when they clear the air and actually become "friends," and I think things will diverge from the main plot a lot more from there. But since they are still at odds for most of the first book, a lot of those major aspects, like Harry and Ron becoming friends, the two of them becoming friends with Hermione, and Harry becoming a Gryffindor, all still happen. So, yeah, that's kind of where I saw it going. Again, this all just sort of happened because I wanted to write a scene where spilled coffee changed the entire world. And I wanted to write a scene from Madam Malkins' point of view. And then it ran away with me, and then I made the mistake of posting what I had, so now I feel obligated to finish, haha.

*** My general advice on writing a believable Draco "redemption" is to start the process by Second year. Draco grew up believing that the Mudbloods were just worthless but then he spends a year at Hogwarts where Hermione trashed the pureblood elite's next generation in classes. The summer holidays would be a perfect time for some self-reflection. So Malfoy decides to get to the bottom of it and tries to be nicer to Hermione to find out how she did "the impossible".
