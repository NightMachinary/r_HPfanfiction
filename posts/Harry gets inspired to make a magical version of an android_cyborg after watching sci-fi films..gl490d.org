Harry gets inspired to make a magical version of an android/cyborg after watching sci-fi films. His primary inspirations would be Star Trek's Data and the Terminator Film/TV franchise.

I got the idea after reading the "Through the Wormhole" crossover fanfiction series by dunuelos and I kept wondering if Harry could have tried to create Android/Cybernetic Organism (with inspiration taken from Data and the Terminator film/tv franchise and other sci-fi) equivalent using his Magic instead of science or a combination of magic and science like what is seen in the fic.

I figured it would be an interesting concept but it seems to have never come up for some reason.
