As the title says what was first fanfiction you read or the first you can remember reading?

I can't remember the title of my first fanfiction but it was about James and Lily being alive so Harry would have been raised in a loving family and all that.

But the first fanfiction that I have the most vivid memory of is recnac transfero by Celebony so I sometimes count it as my first.


** Can't remember the name.

**** "Harry" appears only in the first chapter. He's depressed and suicidal as fuck. Hermione does take his de-aging as a suicide and she raises "him" as a whole different person.

It was oddly heartwarming, in a way.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. It seems to have been taken down from free sites so no link.

I discovered it through [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DumbledoresArmyAndTheYearOfDarkness][TV Tropes]] and was hooked from the start. Later on I discovered much better stories and now regard it as a bit embarrassing but still with a small element of fondness.

It was probably taken down as a part of the whole general scandal around the author, if you're interested in a fascinating read: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/]]

**** Honestly it's main issues was that it was a trope seed. So many HP trends were set by Nightmares that it just seems like a poorly done tropefest if you read it now. But at the time? Glorious.

(half-life has the exact same problem. People going back to play it (and HL2) for the first time now find a mediocre shooter with a somewhat clunky interface and barebones story. But literally the only reason why they think that is because half-life literally changed the face of shooters forever and everything that's typical and expected now was amazing and new then)

The one I remember reading even before that trilogy (which I don't know if I actually finished because it was a WIP when I was reading it and I remember there being a big break in chapter posting at some point?) was called The Flower and the Stag by tropicalfishy.

One of the authors also had a series of Hermione-POV versions of the books, in the form of her enchanted, sentient diary (not a horcrux!) called Hermione, Queen of Witches, which are great fun as well.

** linkffn(7055185)

I remember searching for AU ideas of when Harry and Ginny could have gotten together earlier in canon and stumbled across this fic which is a series of one shots that is basically that. It was the first fanfic I'd ever read many years ago.

** In the early 90s I had a fellow nerd friend who like me was big into Star Trek. Said nerd was also into computers with wealthy parents, so my friend got a really good pc and an internet connection before this became a common thing. During this time there was a part of the web called Usenet with a newsgroup for star trek fanfic. So my friend downloaded Star Trek Fanfics on floppy disks for me and I ate that shit up.

Said friend later also introduced me to the first 3 Harry Potter books, but at the time I was in my twenties already and I wasn't really interested in a kids series where the end hadn't been published yet.

It wasn't until I got bored one day and saw that one of my favourite Star Trek writers had also started writing Harry Potter and was doing beta-work on another Harry Potter story that I got interested in the HP fandom. This was before Fictionalley became a thing btw.

** [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=83718&warning=5][I'll Pick You Up, by MagEd]] was my first fic, at least that I remember. Whether that was because it really was my first one, or if it was the first thing that I actually found good enough to read I have no idea.

I haven't read it in years, but from what I remember it was really good. I still remember a few scenes really well. James and his mom talking over a late night cigarette, one J&L scene in the Shrieking Shack. I should give it another read sometime.

I started off with exclusively marauder era stuff- it was weird to me still to rewrite the books, but this was just elaborating on a part of canon that Rowling hadn't explored too deeply. I liked that idea. I moved pretty quick from Mugglenet to FFN, though I still kept reading almost exclusively James/Lily fics.

** Oh shit. it feels like ages ago so i can't remember clearly. my first knowledge of FanFics came from my sister sometime between books 5 and 6. I then went on Mugglenet, IIRC, and found a fic that I really enjoyed and i've been hooked ever since.

I'd actually like to reread the story to see if it holds up so i'll be a bit more descriptive on the off chance somebody recognises it and knows it's name.

Remember pre-HBP so horcruxes weren't a thing and voldy was just a super powerful wizard that Harry was prophesied to defeat. Not sure how it starts exactly but Harry and Ginny get together, as does Ron and Hermione. they end up living in tents in the Great Hall over the summer, and people come by to train them including Flitwick, McG, Moody, Lupin i think, etc. They had the whole all 4 get animagi forms, i think Ron was a bear. Luckily i think this was before the rise of harry getting like 10 different magical creature forms so it was just a each person gets 1 and they're normal animals. Honestly cant remember how it ended, i might not have reached the end, but it definitely had something to do with Love being the power and Harry loving others and others loving Harry enough to risk their lives helping him.

I'm pretty sure there was a scene where harry and ginny were snogging or fucking or something and an alarm goes off in the great hall because moody came in and all he sees is harry's wand stick out of the tent to turn off the alarm spell. IDK why that sticks out in my head but its like the one scene that I can picture in my head that i'm 110% positive was from this story and not from a different one that kinda squished itself into my recollection.

** The first fic? Hmmm. Like most people, I followed the pattern of looking for more from canon without changing much (ex. rehash of canon, different PoV, possible future post-GoF/OotP/HBP). The oldest canon-compliant fic I recall reading was linkffn(Ginny Weasley and Half-Blood Prince), which even after all this time I still feel nostalgic for.

Possibly the oldest fics I recall fully reading that predated the series end (2003-2007 era) with divergent storylines were linkffn(The Awakening Power by sib-ff; The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo; The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction). As in these are the fics I recall finishing because they were worth reading. I am sure there were others I started that, like ~90% of fanfics out there, were not worth continuing past 2-3 chapters.

It might actually be more interesting to ask: what were the first fanfics in each trope/category/type you read?

** Technically, I think the first was on the Amazon product forums for HP 7 right when it came out - it was a short thing where Fred and George had invented something that let them project the image of themselves a bit away? So when it seemed he'd died, he came out from behind a rock where he'd been hiding. I think. It's been a very long time.

But I never really considered it as fanfiction, nor fanfiction as a whole a thing to exist, until I read HPMoR much much more recently. That's when I got into fandom, started reading (and writing) fanfiction all the time.

Some things change, but fanfic still welcomes me like an old friend.

HP fanfic wasn't much of a thing then. It either wasn't out yet, or was still so freshly minted that a community hadn't quite popped up yet. I didn't get into HP until Goblet came out, and by that point fanfic was so deeply embedded into my life that reading something from a new fandom was basically a non-event.

** My first was actually when the series was still unfinished - I think maybe we still hadn't gotten to OotP yet. But as the films came out, my sister found a hilarious website devoted to HarryxHermione shipping. Among other things, it had a series of comics which retold the whole series comprised of screencaps from the movies. I vaguely remember a plot point being that Voldemort was trying to ship Ron and Hermione to ostensibly end the world, but not much else. Very much absurdist, fun humor. And oddly prophetic of all the endgame pairings. We were both in middle school at the time so we thought it was the best thing ever; although nobody was even making memes yet so I suppose it was comedy way ahead of its time...

As for actual reading, MoR was my first, I believe, followed by Lamora's Game of Champions years afterwards and then I started reading everything else under the sun

** I'm pretty sure the first one I ever read in the HP fandom was Here's to the Night on thislovestory, a really old Draco/Hermione site that unfortunately no longer exists. Not sure if it still exists elsewhere but my friend and I were obsessed with it and would call each other on the phone all the time just to read it together. I have it printed out and still go back to it sometimes; the author wrote it pre Deathly Hallows and guessed a couple things right which is fun.

I'd tried a couple others vefore it but couldn't get into it, then I read this one start to finish and suddenly I was hooked! Tried reading it again a couple years ago but couldn't get through it again. linkffn(2009130)

  PostOOTP, Snape blows his cover as a spy to save Harry from Voldemort. To win the war, even those who loathe each other must unite, and many lessons are learned in the process. COMPLETE!

** Mine was Knowing you by dulcedelecego. Sadly, she has removed all of her MA fics from every HP fanfic site known to me, but I'd love to reread it for the 6th time some day.

It's a marriage law Dramione, with a twist that is oddly horrifying.

Since o one will probably read the story again or discover it in the case of those who haven't read it, I'll have myself the honor of spoiling it; the twist is that Cormac McLaggen, who is now a fellow Ministry employee of Hermione and Draco, has been sending cursed diamonds to people, mostly ex-death eaters, and after Hermione and Draco fall for each other he curses Draco the same way. You can surely imagine the utter fucking vengeful wrath that ensues.

** First HP fic was either "Draco, the Amazing Bouncing... Rat?" or "Underwater Light" by Maya (Mistful on Livejournal?). The first was a hilarious story about Draco being stuck as a rat (a la Moody's human transfiguration?) and takes up residence in Gryffindor tower, the second was a very slowburn romance between Harry and Draco, who are both rather depressed? It's been ages, like 15-20 years since I read either, and Maya took all her fanfic offline before her first original published book was released.
