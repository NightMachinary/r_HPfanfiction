Setting: smart!Death Eaters, Dumbledore is exiled before the Marauders' time by Riddle's machinations (fake escape of Grindelwald maybe), no prophecy, no horcruxes, Voldemort is a puppetmaster of both the muggle and magical government

Pre-story - Voldemort hears rumors from our favorite rat that the Flamels have chosen to die and left the Philosopher's Stone behind in the hands of Albus Dumbledore who has hidden it under an invisibility cloak in the Potter vault; wormy also informs him that only a Potter can sense a cloak - James and Lily killed; Dumbledore saves Harry and places him under blood ward at the Dursleys after a fantabulous duel with Tommy - Harry cannot leave Little Whinging

Story starts around 1990 - Sirius Black inherits the Black Lordship as his grandpapa dies much to the disappointment of his brother - Bellatrix Lestrange fires Remus Lupin from the Lycanthropic and sends him to spy on Sirius as Lord Black's newest secretary (Remus never attended Hogwarts and there were no Marauders) - Narcissa persuades Andromeda to become the muggle Prime Minister in exchange for her daughter being accepted as an Auror and not having a Death-Eater-imperiused prime minister - Narcissa and Regulus commiserate over having terrible siblings (Andromeda and Sirius respectively) and they stumble upon a runaway Harry Potter and begin to plot (what should they bargain for a baby Undesirable No.1?) but they are both reluctant since Harry is their second cousin

Possible Character Arcs - Sirius becoming more responsible and less reckless as Lord Black - Regulus gaining more self-esteem (other people's approval isn't everything) - Remus stops becoming disgusted with himself - Harry learning to accept love from other people and trust adults sometimes - Andromeda forgiving her family(?) and becoming a competent PM(?) - Narcissa becoming less anxious and letting go of control (of Draco and other things?)

I think I may write in alternate POVs.


** Sounds fascinating. I'm always a sucker for a good Black family story. Looking forward to see how the world-building develops.
