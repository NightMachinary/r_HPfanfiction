I'm not in the mood to write on my plotted stuff tonight, but my word processor is taunting me, so...

If anyone has any smutfic requests, please feel free to throw them my way! I write het stuff, and I'm cool with slash; I'm pretty much kink friendly all the way, so, you know, I'm cool with that.

I mostly don't write canon ships, mind, so, yeah.

Hit me, guys.

  "Well, I do hear Filch yearn for the days of old, now and then, when a student would clean out a cauldron with their tongue. Without a cauldron to hand, of course, I suppose I'd have to put my tongue to work somewhere else entirely." Evans is smirking, and Sirius knows he has won, that he will win. She wants him, of course she wants him - who doesn't want him in this school? Sirius' desirability is made of course more potent by the fact that he never deigns to enjoy the charms of the girls at Hogwarts, but Evans will be just one, secret exception.

  "Alright," she says.

  "Really?" Lily leans back against the wall, slipping her wand away and spreading her legs, and the look she gives him is a challenge. Oh, a girl ought know better than to challenge Sirius Black. She really, really ought.

I loved it, and it had just the right amount of plot where everything makes sense and I'm actually invested in the characters. That is some well written smut, is there a sequel or anything?

Additionally, any combination of James, Remus, Sirius, Harry would be awesome.

**** If someone wrote it, is read it, but my first reaction is that fem!Neville wouldn't work as well as fem!harry (in so far as fem!harry usually closely matches her cannon counterpart). Why? Because Neville's . . . everything stems from his grandmother's inability to see him as his own man, and not as a replica of his father. Fem!Neville wouldn't have this problem and would thus be a very different character. Just my gut reaction after two days no sleep, so you're welcome to try and CMV.

***** It was just an idle thought on my part, set as a reply to yours so I wouldn't create an extraneous comment -- but if I'm addressing it seriously, I /don't/ see Augusta Longbottom being any less hard on a granddaughter than a grandson. She is, by all accounts, a strong-willed, intimidating woman with certain ideas of who a child of two war heroes should be. She is demanding, she is steel-spined, and she is unsentimental. This is a witch who unflinchingly tells her grandson to be proud of his damaged parents and is angry when she thinks he's hidden their condition from his schoolmates. She doesn't think twice about sending him Howlers berating him and about the only time she tells him that she's proud of him is when he starts risking his neck.

As the youngest member of a prominent pure-blood line, all the pressure would be on Neville to carry the legacy forward. Gender would hardly factor into a family dynamic like that.

And gender hardly factors into the wizarding world either. Witches are no less powerful than wizards, and I don't even have to draw examples from main characters to prove that. Alice Longbottom -- whom Neville physically resembles -- along with her husband, defied Voldemort, was in the Order, and was an Auror. Augusta Longbottom, an elderly witch, hospitalized an Auror and went on the run in /Deathly Hallows/ before fighting in the final battle. Amelia Bones is speculated to have fought and been killed by Voldemort himself. Bellatrix Lestrange was the Dark Lord's right hand. Hogwarts was founded by two witches and two wizards in a time that such equal standing would've been unheard of in the Muggle world.

I could go on, but that'd be writing a book.
