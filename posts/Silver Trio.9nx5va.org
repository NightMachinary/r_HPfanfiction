Honesty, the title is cringy as hell, but I can't come up with anything else. Anyways, are there any fics that look into Neville, Ginny and Luna? The only thing I can think of is there year in Deathly Hallows. Or maybe look into their individual relationships to Harry, Ron and Hermione.

** Not relevant at all, but in my head, the Silver Trio is always Draco, Pansy/Daphne/Theo/Blaise, and Harry in Slytherin! Harry fanfictions

*** What about Draco, Crabbe and Goyle!? jk

But yeah, the first thing that came to mind when I thought of the title was Slytherin but calling it bronze trio felt insulting somehow. Although... Ravenclaw's colour is bronze iirc.

  Complete! Neville Longbottom always seems to blend in with the crowd. Set during his sixth year, will he finally be able to stand out? This was written before the release of HBP.

*** That is also what I think of. Hearing Silver Trio, I assume it's Slytherin!Harry and co. I've never heard it refer to Neville-Ginny-Luna before.
