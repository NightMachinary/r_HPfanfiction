So every now and then, I see a fic along the lines of 'Harry Destroys Wizarding Britain', and they tend to have the goblins of Gringotts using some broken law or rule or whatnot as an excuse to shut Gringotts up tight and seize everyone's money, which causes the collapse of the Ministry and whatnot.

And when this happens, the Ministry's forces are consistently incapable of breaking into Gringotts and retrieving their gold, either not even trying or being slaughtered by muggle guns or, in one spectacular case where the goblins were antagonists, being caught in the blast of a high-yield thermonuclear weapon.

--------------

Does anyone want to share chapters of stories where this happens? The goblins seize the gold and don't give it back and the Ministry are totally incompetent in reclaiming it?

And, I'm also looking for the subversion; any stories where the goblins seize the gold, but Hit Wizards or Aurors or ordinary Hogwarts students break in by portkey or big effing drill or just hexing and transfiguring their way through to arrest or slaughter the goblins?

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
