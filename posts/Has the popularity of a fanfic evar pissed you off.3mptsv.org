That happened to me back in the days where I didn't understand all the tropes that every big fic has to have. This was in a time where I thought trying to understand something from an entirely logical point of view was a good idea. Now it doesn't really bother me, although the reviews are always questionable.

How bout you, though? I have a feeling that a certain word that starts with R and ends in obst may crop up here.


** Yes, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

Not only is it not bashed enough, it is frequently recommended. I just find it awful: completely out-of-character developments just for the sake of suspense, and implausible plot developments (Krum saving Neville from the execution chamber, WTF?).

** It annoys me sometimes. Other times it makes me sad for the writers I love, who don't get the appreciation they deserve - or would deserve if quality were the measure of popularity. I just hate to see talented writers discouraged by the lack of response, to the point that their desire to write for the fandom fades and dies. (Or, speaking selfishly, if it compels them to switch to another fandom I don't follow, which means I still lose the excitement of seeing them post another piece.)

There are several fics I loathe, and quite a number whose popularity baffles me - although the latter would probably number in the thousands if I didn't skim tags and first paragraphs for hints of the writer's skill. The truth is, I skip almost everything, even in my OTP. But I have a hard time justifying bashing other people's work in public - with the exception of DAYD and HPMOR. Most writers don't actively offend me; they're just bad, often beginners who play to the latest tropes and whose fics appeal to their age groups.

Femslash writers, writers interested in unconventional pairings or who deal with tropes complexly or not at all - they're usually not escapist enough for the majority of fandom, and their work is snubbed. I wish it were otherwise, but reading for pleasure is rarely about good taste, and when it comes to fanfic, you can multiply "not about good taste" by a power of ten.

The one I'm thinking of is a WIP fic that's frequently recommended on here, even by people whose tastes are usually in line with mine!

*** This is true, and those of us who don't agree can only roll our eyes, mutter "no accounting for tastes," and move on. But some of the most popular fanfics truly are dreadful - embarrassingly bad SPaG, crimes against characterization, emotional idiocy all over the map, utter lack of coherence, and a weird naivete about the way the world works. Not to mention some flinchworthy ideas about what exactly happens during various sex acts.

I don't like every popular book or movie, but most professionally published books and most films have at least /some/ baseline of good carpentry, pretty pictures, decent sentence structure, competent actors, and so on. A lot of popular fanfics can't even claim that much.

** I don't get pissed off exactly, but I don't understand the hype about Oh God Not Again! and I often see it recommended here.

It's basically a retelling of canon. It does some things differently and then has to jump through hoops to make sure canon happens anyway. +Sometimes+ So often it has to retcon things to fix the plot holes it makes.

Harry is this weird pseudo-soapbox for the author sometimes and he has these random thoughts (usually to try and fix a plot hole and explain why it makes sense that everything is still following canon) that feel completely shoe horned in. Sometimes it's just the author replying to reviews by having Harry have some random thought.

None of the characters were likeable, except weirdly Lockhart. They all have the "speak like grown ups" problem and they often don't even seem like friends. Harry is completely obnoxious, the worst of a bad bunch.

** There are people pissed off at how popular the Harry Potter series is and don't think it deserves the praise it gets compared to <insert book/series here>. The thing I've found I enjoy about fanfiction is there's generally something for everyone, what anyone else thinks of a work of fiction is irrelevant. I'm sure there are plenty of FF writers that deserve more praise or readers just as I'm sure there are books and series that will never make it to HP heights that deserve more praise as well. Best way around that is to recommend what you enjoy and usually people looking for that certain story will stumble upon it.

** Those with more cultured and refined tastes have long realized that popularity and how good a story is are not the same thing. Like, just look at Twilight as a prime example. But, for fanfics, you got stuff like Poison Pen and Isolation with over 10k favorites, and they're just not good stories.

Heck, sorting FFN by favorites, only 2 of the stories in the top 25 are what I would consider good (Make A Wish and A Black Comedy), with another being a guilty pleasure (Deprived). And I say this knowing that I'll be downvoted for not being on the MoR or TLIL bandwagon.
