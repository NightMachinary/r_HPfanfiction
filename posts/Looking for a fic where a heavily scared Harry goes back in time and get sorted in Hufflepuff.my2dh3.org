** What was the rating, overall word count, any other notable characters, and keywords (for summary) you might remember?

Where did you read it? If it was AO3, can you recall any tags that might've been used?

*** To be honest I really don't remember. I just remember everyone having scars and Harry being very powerful but hiding it from Dumbledore until a fight breaks out.

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.
