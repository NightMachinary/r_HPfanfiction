I'm particularly interested in a Harry that was socialized in a school out of the reach of Dudley and how that may affect his personality and sociability. Bonus points if there's some chapters dedicated to his Dudley-free muggle school experience before he starts Hogwarts.

Thanks in advance!

edit: if it's not Harry-centric, that's fine too as I doubt there are that many fics where the start Hogwarts past age 11 applies. Famous last words, eh?

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

*** Awesome recommendation! I actually read this story last year but forgot all about it until I saw your post. I really wish there was a sequel.

  What if Hogwarts had to wait to start till student's were 18 when their magical cores matured? With magicals going to the Saint Schools for primary/secondary, they have a big lead on the Muggleborn in everything but magic. Follow Harry as he leaves Stonewall behind to enter into Magic where the rules seems stacked against the Muggleborn/raised. AU with alternative sortings. Harry/?

*** Thanks! Interesting premise. I didn't even think about education for witches and wizards. That could easily reinforce the whole pure-blood supremacy thought process that muggle-born are inferior. I'll check it out!

** linkffn(Black Luminary)

Hogwarts starts at 15 and this is a massive AU that doesn't involve Voldemort.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
