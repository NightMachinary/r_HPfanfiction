Im in the mood for some "good" smut where the characters are being...teenages and explore themselve's. I mean...yeah, away from their parents for the good portion of a year.... theres bound to happen much :P

Bonus points for H/Hr. Doesnt have to be.

If you just have to recommend slash, please say so in your post. I probably wont read it, but that shouldnt prohibit interested parties finding something for their own here per chance ;3


** /Whatever Happened to Bromance/ features Harry awkwardly losing his virginity, wingman Dobby and exquisitely colorful vernacular from frat bro Cormac. Highly recommend.

** Sword of Gryfindor is actually pretty good for that. It's smut, but harry/hermionie don't run right into it, and kinda play around it a little

** I don't know how many times I can recommend Australia by MsBinns, but it has a well written, serious and realistic take on two young people first developing their sexual relationship, when they have already committed to each other in every other practical way. It doesn't happen till later on in the fic, its awkward, not perfect and takes them time to get it right. Just another thing that this fic does awesomely and realistically.

Actually, invisibility is not part of the title.
