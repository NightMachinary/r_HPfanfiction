For some time now I've been coming here for fic recs (my reading habits have changed over the many years I've been enjoying fanfiction, and at first I was finding new stories I never would have read before) but lately it seems as though (with a few exceptions) the same dozen stories/authors get rec'd over and over and over, no matter what someone is asking for.

That said, I really love long fics. I want to read something that takes me more than half an hour. And I'm a fast reader...

SO! ...here is my challenge to you: Recommend a fic that is 1) >=100K, and 2) has (hopefully!) not been recommended here before. For bonus points, please don't let it be Harry/Ginny...but any other pairing is fine (or even no pairing, I am past the point of having a "favorite"). 3) Takes place during the books/movies.

Where oh where are the underrated gems I know to be out there???


** A challenge. I like it. Let's see if I can find something you haven't read. I'm gonna skip Wastelands and The Lie I've Lived. those are pretty common.

*Takes place during the school years:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and The Forests of Valbone]]

Harry is shaken by events in the Chamber of Secrets, makes a few hasty decisions and winds up in a magical forest with the Sorting Hat as his only companion. The entire story takes place the summer of second year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging The Sword]]

One of the best stories I've read. Harry's too late to save Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. This story follows how that changes events and the characters themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] Things get weird the summer after Sirius dies. I don't remember much about this except that I thought it was really good.

*Stuff that doesn't take place during the books but are worth reading anyways:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/18/Ambient][Ambient]]

Takes place in a bleak future. Harry with an insane Romilda Vane as a companion. Long and full of action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]]

Neville is The Boy Who Lived. It does a decent job with the premise and I enjoyed it.

*Ones that might have already been recced to you:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived]] Basically, it's a Harry grew up with a family story done right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] Time travel with a side of horror thrown in. Dark, but a good story so far.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I'll update if I find anything else. Let me know if this was helpful.

** I have yet to see [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105][Harry Potter and the Other Path]] recommended here. About 400k words, covers 7 years, some very original ideas. Starts off as a rather light-hearted, fun-to-read fic with some strangely unexplained deviations from canon, but explanations are made as it gets darker. Book 7, and, to a lesser degree, the 2nd half of book 6 feel a little rushed, but it's *definitely* worth reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/19/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] is a very well-written Harry-in-Slytherin fic. Incomplete, but updating regularly with no signs of stopping. At 200k words, it's long enough to be worth getting into. It uses a 1 chapter for year one, 2 chapters for year 2, 3 chapters for year 3 and so on format (with very long chapters), so it ends up spending a lot more time on the later years, despite covering 6.5 so far. Definitely recommend.

**** Pros: It has some great scenes, a few hilarious bits, comes to a logical and satisfying conclusion. I've read it more than once all the way through, though it's been a while.

Cons: Harry/Hermione, so there may be some anti-Weasley sentiment (I can't remember); the little girl is a bit disturbing and eventually powerful, so there's hints of Sue-ishness and as a kind of Oni, she comes packaged with Japanese cultural references which annoy some people.

****** I don't mind Harry with +Emma Watson+ Hermione, in fact that was all I read for my first year reading fanfiction. The unfortunate truth is that so many HP/HG authors feel such a personal insult at the canon pairings that their Weasley-bashing is nearly reflexive.

I don't recall its being recommended here. 260k words, complete, solid writing by the /original/ "Indy!Harry" writer (though this story doesn't really fall into that category). Harry/Hermione.
