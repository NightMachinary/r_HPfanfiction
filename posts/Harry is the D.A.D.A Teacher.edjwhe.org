I've been looking for some good Harry teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts for a while and I really haven't been able to find much. Long fics are especially welcome.


** Harry takes the DADA job after his divorce from Ginny and gets closer to Neville in the process. It has the canon next generation kids in it, if that's something you're not into. - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16105928/chapters/37620485]])
