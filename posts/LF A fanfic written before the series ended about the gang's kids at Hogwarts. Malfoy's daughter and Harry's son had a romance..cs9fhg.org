:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Details I remember: all the gang's kids are now attending Hogwarts. Malfoy's daughter had a romance with (I believe) Harry's son. I think Harry had at least 2 sons, named Sirius and Remus, and I think they were twins and one of them (Remus) was the one in the romance. It was several chapters long and I remember a big dramatic part about Malfoy's daughter being disowned and staying with the Potter family where Ginny (I believe) did her hair for her and the daughter was overwhelmed at being shown kindness. There was more to it than just the romance but that is the part I remember the most.

The fic was written before the series ended, I think after Order of the Phoenix but my timing could be off.

It's driving me crazy that I can't remember more details, but I remember loving this one and reading it over and over to tide me until the next book came out! Any help is appreciated!


** That sounds brilliant :o. Hoping someone can find this
