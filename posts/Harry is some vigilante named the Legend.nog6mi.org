:END:
I read a fic a while back and can't find it to know whether it's been dropped or not. It was a fic on Fanfiction.net and the premise was that Harry had joined Hogwarts in his 4th year. After staying somewhere else since childhood apparently with Sirius in the USA. He is also secretly a vigilante against death eaters and had been nick named the Legend after the tatoo they spotted on his exposed arms during the fight by the ministry and a bounty of sorts because of his attacks on upstanding citizens. He messes with Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis by doing a James Bond intro as a temporary cover in the train and also does something to Draco who came around to harass Daphne for her hand in marriage. He shocks all of them by introducing himself as Harry Potter during the sorting and joins gryffindor for 4th year and later he reveals in a private meeting to Daphne that he and her were in some sort of unbelievable marriage contract after he picked up his family responsibilities and that she should speak to her father leaving her to stew on the subject and I believe the end of the chapter I read he had introduced himself to Neville as his godbrother and then sets off a wide scale prank on all houses by interchanging uniform color while keeping only the two of them free of the prank. Yeah sorry for the bad delivery of English there.
