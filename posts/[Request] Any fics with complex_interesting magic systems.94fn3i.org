I would imagine the majority of these would be AU, but any that build on canon would also be appreciated :).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope][The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]] by OnTheImportanceOfLungs shows its age but is certainly readable and has a cool take on the way Harry's magic works. His eyes are the way he channels his magic and has different limitations than a wand. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] by Wu Gang is somewhat close to canon in terms of magic, but the author does explore (you guessed it) The Mind Arts rather in depth making them far more complex than "clear your mind". I'm really excited to see what Grindelwald's game is.One of the most promising currently updating stories.

**** It certainly gets over recommended around here, there is no doubt about that. I've noticed that if the author is active on the sub their fics show up a lot more.

I've got no issue with seeing it so often, I feel like the quality warrants it, unlike many other fics I see far too often.

*** wrt Kaleidoscope, I was an edgy 15 year old when I wrote that. Should read the rewrite (fractal) if you're going to read any of that stuff. OC-and-non-HP-character-tastic though, so your mileage may vary, and to be entirely honest probably never updating that again.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828][Victoria Potter]] The three first years of the Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and magic system. The first year is nearing completion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. On a very long hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Pretty AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and dark magic. Sadly dead.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

#+begin_quote
  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
