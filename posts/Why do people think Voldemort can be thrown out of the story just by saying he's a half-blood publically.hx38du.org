I haven't given this much thought, so it might not make as much sense as I think, but here's my idea. Harry (or whoever) announces publically that Voldemort was a Half-Blood. We know that Lucius Malfoy is always whispering in Fudge's ear, like a little personal Satan, and we know that Riddle's heritage being revealed will (probably) push people who support him for the Pureblood agenda away from him, so it makes sense that Malfoy wouldn't want the public to know about it. The Ministry controls the Daily Prophet, which most of Wizarding Britain trusts as a news source, so they could make sure no article was published even once it was revealed and the Witches and Wizards wouldn't believe anything posted elsewhere (especially not the Quibbler). And let's say this is one of the stories where Malfoy stops following Voldemort after he finds out he's not pureblood, the Wizengamot is often depicted as being full of 'Blood Purists', so at least some of those Purists could be DE's and support Voldemort anyway. And even if the DE's spurn Riddle, the 'Imperius victims' now have more 'evidence', because they can say they were tricked into believing they were saving the Wizarding World from 'dangerous' ideas brought by Muggleborns, and they were Imperiused when they tried to back out. Plus, can you see DE's being keen on backing out when Voldemort is one of the most powerful wizards of the time? At least some of them would stay just out of fear.

​

And of course, even if all this is wrong, and all the DE's abandon Voldemort, Bellatrix will still be there. Never underestimate the fury of a woman as mad as her love for a mass murderer.


** Because most fanfic writers/readers are completely disconnected from canon, where Voldemort refers to his Muggle father in front of a large gathering of Death Eaters on his return in GOF and none of them blink.

Not to mention the fact that Lucius knew that Tom Riddle was Voldemort, as did the Death Eaters who went to school with him, and Barty Crouch Jr specifically references a shared disappointment in their fathers as one of the similarities between him and Voldemort.

Most fanfic readers are completely oblivious of the way that, in canon, "pure-blood" is very much a political/social construct, where the acid-test of membership of the "pure" is not the factual status of your heritage but rather your willingness to commit to the ideology.

If you are willing to walk the pure-blood walk and talk the pure-blood talk, the other pure-bloods will quite happy engage in a collective delusion where they believe whatever bullshit you come up with to justify why you belong with them - a long lost relative (Umbridge and her imaginary Selwyn connection), a connection to a distinguished bloodline (Voldemort and Slytherin), etc.

None of them are "factually" pure. They just all pretend that each other are pure through deliberate acts of post-truth manipulation - e.g. the Blacks just blast off any connection to Muggles off their family tree.

We know that Voldemort tried to recruit Lily Potter to the Death Eaters (and her refusing was one of her 3 defiances of him), so that just shows how flexible the ideology is - even Muggleborns can be allowed in, if they're useful enough. No doubt if Lily had said yes, the Death Eaters would have "discovered" some connection to a long lost wizarding bloodline for her.

And no, it is not lost on me that this idea of "discovery" of long-lost bloodlines is exactly a trope that is very commonly deployed in fanfic in a completely unironic fashion.

  “The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”

  “There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly....”My whole family are blood traitors! That's as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!”

Those Death Eaters knew Voldemort had a Muggle father, but since then he was so powerful, they completely overlooked it.

****** That's why I think he's much more dangerous than Voldemort despite Riddle supposed combat superiority.

Voldemort is the supremacist that appeals to a smaller part of society, a rich part, but small nonetheless. His ideology is niche and can only win by destroying the other side.

Grindelwald is the populist whose ideals can be shared by most of wizardkind, even his speeches are 200% better, he knows how to turn his words to present his ideas as a solution to everyone, even the muggles.

Grindelwald could convince purebloods, half-bloods, and muggle-borns.

Think of Harry, whose experience with muggles is less than stellar, and who sees the magical world as an escape, hearing that speech, talking about how the muggles are different, how they don't understand magic, how those who have magic are meant for greater things. All the while sounding benevolent, very different from Voldemort who (apart from the fact he killed Harry's parents) also was a total villain and a bully.

If Grindelwald had stayed political I could see canon Harry and Ron at least hearing him out, Hermione would be different because her perspective of Muggles is extremely different from Harry's.

More precisely, he tried to recruit James and Lily as a unit. Would he have tried to recruit Lily had she been unattached or tried to make an example of her?

"James Potter... Your courage and skill is a powerful testament to your blood. Join me, take your rightful place among my captains, and I shall not only guarantee the safety of your mudblood wife, I shall permit her to keep her wand and recognise any offspring you sire with her as legitimate," would be something Voldemort might be thinking---though he would probably put it more diplomatically.

On the other hand, it could be, to steal a line from another fandom, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/gg5uzq/i_am_a_dragon_you_are_now_asian/]["I am Lord Voldemort. You are now a Pureblood."]]

**** Lily was given the chance to live because of Snape on Halloween 1981; prior to that she had defied Voldemort 3 times, one of which was her refusing to be recruited:

#+begin_quote
  MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

  JKR: Of James and Lily?

  MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

  JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html]]

JKR may be misremembering PS here, as what she is saying was not exactly what Hagrid said:

#+begin_quote
  Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side.

  “Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em... maybe he just wanted ‘em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' --- an' ---”

#+end_quote

This is what Dumbledore has to say in regards to thrice defied. So either Voldemort did try to recruit her and James but didn't take it as a defiance, or it simply didn't happen, like Hagrid says in Philosopher's Stone. The way he uses escaped also seems to be in the physical sense of the word.

What is to say that the offer to James and Lily wasn't just an offhand hand remark when they were caught on one of his raids?

For all we know Voldemort was about to kill both of them but was prevented due to the arrival of The Order. This also sets up a nice scenario where Both of them filled with righteous anger and fear join The Order after all The Order was a secret organisation so they couldn't really go around distributing pamphlets.

I can imagine a scenario like the one you're painting, but I just can't reconcile it being an offhand offer because he simply wouldn't remember it, or it's too insignificant for him to consider defying.

I can't see why Voldemort would seek them out specifically before they join the Order, and why he'd want to kill them himself. But I can imagine wanting to kill them and the Order rescuing them after a botched espionage mission. For example, here is something that Rowling said in the same interview I can see working. They arrest his henchman, like Malfoy, and they infiltrate a meeting, the hour runs out and their covers are blown, but since Dumbledore had a 'number of spies' they're rescued in the nick of time. I mean the only people he personally sought out are Amelia Bones and Rufus Scrimgeour, both people with incredible power. Why would he seek out young graduates?

True, but Frank and Alice didn't do too well against four death eaters. Granted, they were attacked in their home and probably taken by surprise (plus distracted with protecting a one year old).

I like to think that F+A and J+L fought Voldemort together in a 4 on 1 kind of scenario (such a scenario repeating three times is really stretching it though). Voldemort, no matter how powerful he is, is only able to match 2.5 spellcasters (Slughorn really doesn't count for all that much).

After all, Harry isn't a very capable wizard, not by a long shot. He's got the potential, but it's mostly wasted. James, Lily and Frank are all described as more talented. Since JKR didn't write first gen (thankfully), we can hope that there was less deus ex machina involved for those who fought the death eaters.

Yeah, maybe it was one of the situations of thrice defied, but like you said it's stretching it a bit if if it happens three times. I also think he would defeat them because subjectively he's the most powerful wizard in the world. The matter lies between him and Dumbledore, and I don't think four talented people are a match for him. Maybe I'm just really overpowering Voldemort and Dumbledore though but I've always thought of them god-like in terms of power.

It's unfair to Harry to say he's untalented. I just think he's lazy, and doesn't study much but if he puts his mind to it, he can become as good as his parents. See, the only reason I /don't/ think it wasn't a Deux ex machina for the four of them (excluding FA in maybe two situations) is the nature of the First War, which Sirius describes in GOF, Voldemort simply didn't waltz in and start duelling people, he sought out the politically (and magically) powerful, it was like a collective mental war (imperius, blackmail). I just cannot envision a scenario where they'll get face to face with him on equal terms three times, /each/. No matter how talented they are, it's difficult to picture them as people so important that Voldemort makes a public appearance to kill them/confront. Or even Dumbledore to send them on missions where Voldemort was, I think such jobs go to the Amelia Boneses or Alastor Moody's.

** Voldemort's first Death Eaters would have to be aware of the possibility that he isn't pureblood. Especially if they were his classmates and saw him as an orphan with a non-magical last name.

I actually read a fic that covered this topic. Revealing that Voldemort is half-blood doesn't necessarily remove his status once he already has gained power. This excerpt is from chapter 10 of linkffn(The Futile Facade):

#+begin_quote
  "I've been looking into Riddle's background," she said, grimacing. "I know it's a bit gauche, but I'm so tired of my friends calling him 'Lord Riddle' and acting as though he's the next coming of Salazar Slytherin."

  Dumbledore's eyebrows rose as he rapidly scanned the paper's contents, but when he leveled his piercingly blue gaze at her, he showed no real surprise. "So you have discovered Tom's somewhat ignoble roots. I'm certain you're aware that he would prefer this knowledge never see the light of modern day."

  "You knew?" Rigel frowned. "Sir, forgive me, but I don't understand why no one else does. This undermines everything he's been trying to do for the last fifty years. If it was leaked, it could change everything." As Dumbledore continued to look impassively grave, she added, "Couldn't it?"

  Dumbledore sighed. "I am aware of Tom's heritage, in part because I was the professor sent to introduce him to the Wizarding World. While at Wool's Orphanage, I spoke with the proprietress about the circumstances of young Tom's arrival there. His mother only lived long enough to name him for his father and grandfather, but this information was sufficient to trace his origins the very same way you have now done."

  "Why isn't it commonly known?" Rigel asked, still confused. "I mean, wouldn't people have asked while he was in school?"

  "Tom himself was unaware of his lineage until very late in his school years, I believe," Dumbledore said slowly. "He was thought to be a muggleborn, at first, but when rumors of his Parseltongue ability began to circulate the school, that belief changed. After all, who ever heard of a Parselmouth who wasn't a pureblood?" The question, eerily reminiscent of something Draco had said, sent a thrum of unease through Rigel. Sometimes, it seemed Dumbledore's gaze was too perceptive. If she didn't have faith in Dom's ability to warn her of even the subtlest attempt at Legilimency, she might worry for her secrets.

  Rigel considered the old man's words, but had to ask, "If you knew, why haven't you said anything? This could drastically affect his support base."

  Dumbledore regarded her almost pityingly. "Tom will only deny it. All evidence aside, he will claim the Riddle name comes from the mystery of his origins, and that the muggles you traced until their disappearance were a mere coincidence."

  "But if the speculation is made, he'd have to give some explanation, wouldn't he?" she asked. Even though part of her balked at essentially treating the halfblood label as an accusation, she knew that his supports would see it that way. Why not use it, then? "His mother is certainly Merope Gaunt. The Parseltongue gift, as well as the orphanage's records, would be proof of that. He'd have to give some account of his father. Who else could he claim?"

  "I believe he would probably name Morfin Gaunt, if pressed." The Headmaster said quietly.

  Rigel gaped at him. "His uncle?"

  "Incest is more palatable than the truth, to those who would care in the first place," Dumbledore reminded her gently.

  She grimaced in distaste. "But even still, Morfin was in prison for three years." She shook her head. "It just isn't possible. Riddle's birth date is listed as a year and a half after his uncle's imprisonment. Unless you're suggesting Merope went to Azkaban for conjugal visits with her brother..." She attempted to say it sarcastically, but as the words came out of her mouth she realized with horror that it was exactly what some might suggest.

  "There are those for whom even that explanation would be preferable." Dumbledore didn't seem disgusted or disappointed by that fact, merely resigned.

  Rigel let out a huff of revulsion. "That's just...ugh. What is wrong with the world?" No matter which way she looked at it, Dumbledore was absolutely right. If she came forward with the information, not only would she paint a giant target on her back, but Riddle wouldn't even flinch. He'd probably play the embarrassed pureblood card and cagily admit that his parents had been siblings in unsanctioned lust. Better than that allow the whisper of a possibility that he, Lord Riddle, head of the S.O.W. Party and preeminent bigot in all of Britain, could be a halfblood.

  All her research, for nothing. She bit through the biscuit in her hand with an annoyed growl. After chewing it over both literally and figuratively for a moment, she said, "I don't suppose we could force him to do a blood test." She didn't need Dumbledore's regretful look to tell her it was impossible. Riddle was simply too powerful to make him do anything he didn't want to do. Back to square one, then. Unless...she shot the Headmaster a considering look. "Maybe we could trick him, somehow. Is there any magic that only a pureblood can perform?"

I can totally see blood purists buying the incest explanation, no matter how gross it is

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

** I forgot which fic it was but I do remember a scene where Harry asked a lot of the professors why they didn't reveal this. I don't remember the whole explanation but I remember it being brilliant and very reflective of the attitudes of the Magical society that both fit canon and fit the story very well.

It wasn't until I read that along with your points (that I realized later) just why it doesn't work.

** I've always felt that Voldemort was meant to be a wizard analog of Hitler, in the fact that he doesn't really fit the views that he espouses, but people follow along anyways, because power. (AN: For those not aware, Hitler had none of the traits of his 'Aryan' race, if my memory still works, he was a brunette with hazel eyes. But still propped them up as his 'super Germans' destined to rule the world, and people were fine and dandy with it) Oh, and the whole concentration camp thing in book 7, kinda of a clue. I'd almost think that he got a hold of Hitler's diary, and mistook it for the 'Evil Overlord's Rule Book and Guide'.

You have to admit, it doesn't get much more stereo typically evil than a Nazi analog. Easier to write than giving your villain a real motive, just have them hate a group for no defined reason!

Sort of off topic rant/discourse incoming;\\
I never really understood the endgame of this type of plan. Say they win, kill off all the people they hate. Well, now their leader, and some of their allies, do not fit their ideal still. Some fanatic is going to get it in his head to off them sooner or later, to prevent damaging their group's 'purity'. And once that starts, it won't ever go away, so civil war. Voldemort doesn't necessarily need to be 'as' worried, being he has personal power too. But, he was never shown as an unbeatable juggernaut, really. If he is outnumbered, he seems plenty ready to run, IE end of Book 5. he only ever seems ready to commit to a battle with an army to hide behind, like in the battle of Hogwarts. This does also fit his fear of death, but makes it a dangerous precedent for a leader, as one time that shatters that illusion of strength is enough.\\
Real world, they don't even have magic. Authority in our world is only that which is allowed by a people who are willing to accept it, or at least are not willing to argue/fight against it. No single human has real power over the other, we built our power using tools, and again, the authority of those tools is given by those willing to follow. I honestly don't believe, in this era especially, that a Nezi-esque group could gain more than what they have now, which is some scattered groups of protesters and terrorists. The Internet allows for groups like these to more easily recruit, sure, but the same is true for their opponents (IE everyone else), and also allows for easier tracking of their movements.

Ok, done for now, going to bed.

*** That makes sense, actually, and I have seen some stories touch on that as a reason for his almost-success. I would have thought that he'd have killed off anyone who he thought was a threat, including his own followers. So, even if the Purebloods turned on him after he conquers Britain, he'd just kill them. Your point still stands though. I doubt he'd last very long without followers.

** I actually recently read a fic where Harry did this against Dumbledore's wishes, and boy was he surprised. Power was still power, and the Purebloods had a way to attack the muggleborns, and half bloods(not literally, but politically). I'll link it when I find it again.

Edit2: Ok, why the downvotes. I know that OP didn't request a story, but it is related to the discussion, and I thought it'd be nice to show that there are some stories that actually cover his problems. IDK, whatever.

** I'll give you the real reason - because they're writing FANFICTION, and people can do whatever the fuck they like in it. Why does it matter? They're not writing canon. It's just like with calling things wards, which isn't used in cannon.

Jesus, why does this sub make such a huge fucking deal about what's canon or not in FANFICTION?

Cry some more, please. I've never seen anyone complain about how FANFICTION isn't following canon outside of this fandom. Get over yourselves.
