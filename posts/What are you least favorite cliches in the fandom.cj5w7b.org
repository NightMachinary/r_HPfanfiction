We all know the classics. Super!Harry. Manipulative!Dumbledore. Heir to [Insert Ancient Houses here]. But are there others? Dialogue choices that show up in every fanfiction? Character traits that fanon has grafted onto characters. Or maybe a background canon character brought to the forefront of fanfiction? What really grinds your gears?


** Time travel that exists basically just so Hermione can go romance the Marauders back when they were young and cute, or whichever other characters can get together at their ages of optimum sexiness. If there's going to be time travel in a story, it had better be for a more interesting purpose than just getting the characters laid. And not just a horcrux-collecting speed run.

** Chaanging a backstory so it completely destroys the character. I read fanfiction because I like the original HP characters, their personalities and struggles. When fanfic takes everything away that defines the character, to the point where they would be unrecognizable except for the name, then thanks, I hate it.

This includes:

- Pureblood Hermione, who is a long lost heir of an Ancient and Noble house. Her whole schtick of seeking justice for the oppressed falls flat when she gleefully joins the ranks of the oppressors without looking back.

- Dark Harry, who calls his mother a mudblood. I'm okay with some Dark!Harry fics, it just crosses the line when Harry goes full-on OOC evil and shits on his parents. Harry's love of family is a defining trait to his character.

- Evil Ron, a domestic abuser to his poor battered wife, Hermione. Ron never raised a hand against Hermione, it was Hermione who sent the birds at him, and slapped Malfoy in PoA. In fics where Hermione tries to justify starting an affair with Draco/Harry/other guys, I don't know why they have to make Ron an abusive husband.

*** Generally, I'm strongly opposed to change Hermione's muggleborn heritage because it's a central theme for me. However, I do like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3mw3b4/hermione_and_bellatrix_as_a_teenager/][this premise]] too:

The Order raided Bellatrix‘s home a few weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, whom she treasured above everything else. She and her husband weren't at home that night however, and the Order didn't have the heart to kill an innocent child. So they burnt down the house, took away the child, and eventually found a muggle woman looking somewhat similar to the young Bellatrix. With some magic, the Grangers were happy to become a family of three.

Bellatrix on the other hand completely lost it, and began her descent into bloodlust, madness, and sadism. Whereas she was a tough and lethal, but a disciplined warrior who abstained from torture before, she now completely gave herself into the dark arts and Voldemort's cause. Later, she learnt that the leader of the Order during that raid was one Frank Longbottom.

Much of the story went as in canon, until the Battle of DoM. Here, Bellatrix chased down and subdued Hermione, but she recognized something she had placed on her daughter all these years ago. She recovered much of her sanity immediately and had a emotional talk with Hermione. Bellatrix would take no further actions in the battle, and Sirius survived as a result.

Bellatrix's good mood and changed behaviors were soon noticed by Voldemort, and she explained that Potter's best friend was her daughter and their cause would be greatly helped if she could bring her over. Voldemort then asked Draco what he thought of Hermione. Draco answered that Hermione significantly bested him throughout the years and he didn't think a Mudblood could have done it. Now he was actually happy and relieved that he was beaten by his very own cousin. Voldemort then gave Bellatrix and Draco the task of turning Hermione.

Hermione struggled a long time with this revelation. She was deeply worried that Bellatrix might attack her adoptive parents at any time, so she persuaded them to take a vacation to outside of the country. There, she modified their memories and sent them off to Australia. Soon after returning home, Bellatrix indeed showed up to kill the Grangers. Although she didn't accomplish that, she was nevertheless impressed by Hermione's ruthlessness and ability to cast complex charms at such young age. A longer talk ensued...

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

** In no particular order:

- Overused Room of Requirement or magical trunks (yes, they are canon, but using them to game the system is like reading a fic about muggleborns using adderall to outscore the purebloods - its BORING).
- Super wands (basilisk core wands are such a particularly grating thing). I don't mind Harry having a different wand, but why can't you just give him say unicorn hair or dragon heartstring like literally everybody else?
- Evil!/Manipulative Ron and Hermione. Honestly, I respect these two more than Harry or the majority of other characters in the book. And denigrating them to make Harry super or setup your preferred romance in the story does nothing but make me think I am reading teenage angst.
- Abusive Dursleys. Not that they aren't neglectful, spiteful individuals with short tempers (they are). But more often than not the abuse is taken to such ridiculous levels, with Harry suffering massive injuries that would have killed him had it not been for magic. They were originally written as fairy tale step-family characters (see Cinderella), not as backwater chronic abusers. They shouldn't be excused, but that is more believable than the kind that is usually just there to make us feel sympathetic to Harry or explain his more reserved persona.
- Basing a story around a romance. Not that romance is in-and-of-itself bad, but how many fics can you name where a relationship (often not even romantic in many cases too) suddenly causes the entirety of canon to change for ridiculous reasons?
- Ranting on cliches like an internet troll. Seriously, what kind of loser does that? Cliches and tropes exist because people /like them/.

  Abusive Dursleys
#+end_quote

It really depends for me on this one. Vernon making a sound-proof room in the basement so he can strap Harry down and use a belt-sander on him? Yeah, at that point it's just pointless violence for violence's sake.

However, canon Dursleys were neglectful at best and abusive at worst. From what I can remember off the top of my head:

-Locking Harry in a cupboard

-Not feeding him for possibly days at a time (he has to sneak out to get food)

-"Harry Hunting"- Petunia and Vernon might not have laid a hand on him but they didn't stop their son and his friends from beating him up

-Petunia trying to hit him with a frying pan in OotP- suggests that they might have hit him previously, or at least were open to the idea

-Locking him in his room in CoS and only letting him out to use the bathroom; feeding him minimal amounts of food through a cat flap

-The emotional abuse, calling him worthless/freak, telling him the same about his parents, etc.

Canon-Dursleys were not good people, and even if authors make the abuse worse than what is shown in canon, it's not much of a stretch based on what we've seen. If someone decides to expand on that part of his life/go into more detail on it, whether it's closer to canon or worse than it, as long as it plays into the story and Harry's character I'm fine with it.

TL;DR: I don't like reading about child abuse for the sake of it or going to those extremes for little payoff in Harry's character. If it's done well and has an impact I'm fine with it. Canon-Dursleys are horrible people and there's neglect of emotion abuse in canon, with hints towards physical abuse.

** When the characters behave like idiots just to keep the plot together. Let's see. I have just deleted linkffn(12310861) from my computer.

First of all, just let me state, I have nothing serious against Harmony. I probably prefer Hinny, just because I don't feel like going against canon when not necessary, and because Northumbrian and linkao3(601124) have shown me it can be done well, but otherwise it doesn't bother me. For example, linkffn(11916243) is a rather decent story. So, it is not that.

SPOILERS AHEAD, so please skip if it bothers you (and it doesn't make sense to mark everything as a spoiler, not much will make sense without them).

It is not even the original premise of the story. The Trio while still hiding in the Grimmauld Place find out through the Family Black Tree wallpaper (finally somebody found some good use for it!) that Delphini happened (after all, Bellatrix was Black originally). Harry, having a soft heart for orphans, finds her after the war (completely neglected and abused), saves her and brings her as his own. I have never heard about it before, and it could lead to a nice story. So, it is not the basic plot either.

What bothers me, is *how* it is done. Harry for reasons nobody ever explained (and which don't make sense either) decides to hide his wish to look for Delphini from everybody (including and especially from Ginny; it looks like the only reason is to make a tension between them, which could lead to their break up). Then he asks (only!) Hermione for help, and finally he breaks in in the middle of night to the house where Delphini lives hidden, takes her away, and presumably kills her neglectful foster mother (he “takes care of her” in rage after finding out how horribly Delphini was neglected). Then he brings her to the Grimmauld Place, where Hermione finds a book on the paediatric care and cures her. So, to summarize, Harry (who still planned to be an officer of the law at that point) just committed completely useless breaking and entering, abduction of a baby, murder, and non-reporting of crime, and I wonder whether not-bringing her to St. Mungo for professional help does not constitute a criminal neglect as well. What's Hermione's reaction? She doesn't report him to the law officers, but she gushes about his big heart and how great a man he is. Sorry, I thrown the story away in that moment, so I don't know how it continued.

There are zillion other things he can do (even if the existence of Delphini should stay hidden from the wizarding world), just to mention the first idea which came to my mind, he can ask for help his buddy The Minister for Magic, there is zero reasons to keep this whole thing hidden from Ginny and other Weasleys.

There are many decent ways how to break up with your girlfriend decently, and there are many possible reasons which could be found. I can happily imagine that after Ginny haven't heard about him for a year fallen apart for the biggest hero of them all, Neville. I can imagine Hermioine deciding that after all her affection towards Ron was more curiosity or wish to have her first crush completed than true love (no, Hermione not forgetting Ron his leave after being cursed by the locket makes as much sense as anybody accusing Ginny of bringing the basilisk to the castle, i.e. none at all). So, I believe even post-War Harmony can be written in a reasonable manner. However, the author was lazy and he just wanted to to get to the Harmony cooing over small baby as easily as possible, so he went straight ahead. Grrr.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

Another is in Harry is a Slytherin Fics where everyone instantly is against him including the ministry. For example with Harry in Gryffindor the Slytherins are still viewed by outsiders as upstanding members of Society, but with Harry in Slytherin the paper comes out and says he is the next Dark lord, that he is evil and the house is while still raising up those same purebloods as upstanding members of society when they were are/were in the same house as dark Harry.

** Super!Hermione Its not so much I hate it i actually like it but its getting kinda stale. Especially since in non bashing fic Hermione's flaws are almost never explored and shes generally pretty competent and useful and strong. While for most other characters including Harry there is more diversity.

The other is Dumbass Ron or Average Ron. Similarly to Hermione Ron lacks a diversity but on the other end of the spectrum where his usefullness and competence and importance is usually overlooked or not that celebrated while his flaws are usually explored. Which again isnt bad and isnt something i hate by default but again is getting stale.

It should, of course, be made clear that this behavior is supposed to be ridiculous. Draco smirks because he doesn't quite get sarcasm but hopes to fake it till he makes it, not because he actually has any smirkworthy illuminations.

***** On the contrary, I think it's best that he do it a /lot/, so that there's no doubt that you're not supposed to take it seriously. If he only smirks once in a while, it might accidentally make the reader think that the writer is under the impression that smirking is a thing people actually do in regular conversation.

My take on Slytherins (in general, with Draco as a prime example) is thus that they think no one will take them seriously if they're caught looking /sincere/. So they plaster an overly wry expression on their face whenever they're in public, or just keep their faces blank. The also-11-year-old Gryffindors take it seriously and retaliate by always looking superior and judgemental when looking at those Slytherins meanies.

The Professors, meanwhile, think all these children playing vaudeville heroes and villains are utterly adorable.
