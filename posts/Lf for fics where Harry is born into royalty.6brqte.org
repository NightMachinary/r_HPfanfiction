Personal hairdresser, servants, bodyguards, royal court politics, all that good stuff. A Harry that is used to getting and having everything he wants and still ends up going to Hogwarts for whatever reason.


** Actual muggle royalty? Because otherwise what you've described sounds like a number of Lord Hadrian Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Black fics, what with house elves and all.

*** Royalty in general, where he is born (Or adopted I guess either or) and raised in the lifestyle of secluded lavish with actual human servants that do everything for him and personal tutors that teach him things from a young age. Something similar to Outcast's Alley for example where he is the Unseelie prince and heir only instead of being thrust into that situation as a teenager he's born & raised into it, already used to it. Not that nonsense where he randomly gets a bazillion names and titles and proceeds to fuck everyone over and do whatever he wants "because he's batman" just normal royalty and a kid dealing with the problems that comes with it, like not having many friends or getting to see what the outside world is like.

I thought a Harry used to the lifestyle of royalty going to Hogwarts where there's a bunch of normal kids would be an interesting concept. I also thought it would be popular one maybe not though lol

**** Take a list of typical fanfics, and start throwing darts. If it isn't slash, it is Uber rich royal Harry.
