Anyone else having problems with fanfiction. Currently for me the urls are not linking to the story itself and don't have a designated story to link to, leaving it to say story not found. Multiple profiles say empty as well.


** Everything is working fine for me, so either it got fixed in the last 10 minutes or the problem's on your end.

** I've occasionally had trouble loading certain pages and my favs/alerts lists are very slow, but it comes and goes.
