Hi guys

Looking to re-read a fic I can't find. How bout that.

Plot:

Voldemort ends up doing well for himself in the war.... we lose hogwarts

Harry and a female ship (maybe hermione?) build/buy/inherit a large community/land/village and help run the resistance from outside voldies reach

At some point I think Luna creates an anti-dementor... one of her "creatures" she brings to life

I am pretty sure a voodo-ish ward of a country/plot of land is used to help bring voldie down....

It's anti dumbles too.... he gets caught up in those wards at some point....

Aaaannd pretty sure it's a two part fiction... could be three.... kinda like the "chasing the sun" "awaken the dawn" names but not them.... or maybe I thought they were like those names but it's nothing like it.

I found the story once before and lost my phone. Go figure

Thanks in advanced lovely people
