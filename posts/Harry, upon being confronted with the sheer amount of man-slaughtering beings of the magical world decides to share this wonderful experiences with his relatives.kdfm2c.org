I think the first dangerous thing Harry is confronted with that he would have a chance of smuggling above zero would be Norbert, so upon finding out Hagrid managed to get a dragon little Harry decides to be a good friend and offers to house the little guy on his house for the summer arguing that it would prevent the faculty from finding out (into his very muggle house surrounding by people he wouldn't be sorry to see dead and little access to food, which may or may not push the dragon into a hunger-motivated killing-spree... depending on how lucky he is).

Then after the whole PS incident he enquirers to Dumbledore if Fluffy or Quirrell's troll could stay with him for the summer... Dumbledore is /really/ weirded out by this and refuses, Harry learns his lesson: don't ask, just do.

So second year rolls around and Harry is not sure if Mandrakes should be classified as plants or animals, so he decides to take an adult with him just in case, if he times it right he may even get to repot it while his entire family is in the room (but as they don't like magic he sees no reason to bother them with things such as a warning about their scream, see how thoughtful he is).

Then upon discovering his ability to talk with snakes he digs up research about magical snakes with a zeal that creeps Hermione a bit, even more so when he starts spewing random tales about how certain snakes caused particularly gruesome deaths. Needless to say he figures out the Basilisk in record time and proceeds to walk around seeking it to bring it home and... â€˜redeem' it, yep, he is going to redeem it, this is his story and he will stick with it, and if the price is a bit of death he is sure the Dursley's won't be so angry after the fact, they certainly won't scream to him about the issue.

Then he finds out about the Acromantule colony, now Aragog is forever dammed to fend of his increasingly ludicrous kidnapping attempts, thanks a lot Hagrid.

Finally third year comes around, this Harry isn't so focused on fending off dementors as he is in getting them to enter his trunk.

Fourth year arrives and Harry becomes Hagrid's best student with his steadfast determination to keep the Screwts alive and offering to take them home for the summer as extra credit. Later he is so spoiled for choices in the maze that he just faints, but thats okay, at least he still has the dragon eggs he managed to sneak earlier in the year, plus the Grindwillows... shame, he probably would love to bring babymort and Nagini home with him.

Fifth years arrives and he finally found a beast he wants nothing to do with, that toad-thingie is just nasty. Nuh-huh, he is just mailing it to his cousin and be done with it...

** Meanwhile, the Durselys all become tremendously physically fit, with the DODGE or die environment their now magically expanded house/yard has turned into. (Who knew a simple expansion charm Harry tricked Remus/Arthur/whoever into casting at his house would get tangled up with the blood wards and get dialed up to 11?)

Harry's collection of animals is usually more playful than anything else, as they're well fed from the miles of yard/interior space now stocked with half the deer/goats in England. In a fit of self-preservation, Vernon and Petunia have become Britain's most notorious cattle/livestock rustlers.
