Just finished reading Turning of the Times by noacat on ao3. It's huuuge and the author looked like they had very definitive plans for finishing. I absolutely loved reading it and was wondering if anyone knew if it is officially dropped or not?


** It has been 9 months since they mentioned that they will definitely finish the story, so I would not give up hope. I had a look, and the story had a 6 month gap between chapters 6 and 7 too.

*** Appreciate the hope :) I didn't know that they previously had a gap that long

** This may have been my fault.

I left a huge review stating the good and bad and how to make it better (aka the author was moving at a snails pace often repeating themselves). I suggested that they get a few beta readers.

Which they did. I was one of them.

I majorly suggested changes in a few of the newer chapters. It worked for awhile and then the author just vanished.

I wonder if they are rewriting large bits of the story, or just got super busy.

When I get some time I'll email the author and see what I can discover.

*** Thanks! I was seriously hooked and things were really picking up where it left off at last. Almost to the point where I'd volunteer to beta for it myself. I'm leaving a review but if you could pass along my thanks and enthusiasm I'd be grateful too :)
