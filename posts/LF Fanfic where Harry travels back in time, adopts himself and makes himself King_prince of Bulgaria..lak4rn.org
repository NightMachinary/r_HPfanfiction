:END:
I remember a fanfic where Harry travels back in time and adopts his younger self (without letting anyone including himself know he is Harry from the future). He also takes the identity of a powerful lord (Slytherin, i think) and somehow becomes King/Prince of Bulgaria. If i remember right he also trains an army in Bulgaria.

  Harry Potter becomes a dark lord and goes back in time because he is no longer interested in his boring world anymore and has a slight bone to pick with a few people. Lots of Bashing, Dumbledore believes in 7th chances, Weasley's (most), Hermione and Dolores. ALTERNATE TIMELINE. NO PARADOXES.
