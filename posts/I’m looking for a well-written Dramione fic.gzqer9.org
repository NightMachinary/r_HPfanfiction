I like a slow-burn romance so it's more plausible and in-line with cannon. Thank you!


** I haven't read this myself but it's very popular and I've enjoyed other works by the writer:

** Linkffn( Manacled by SenLinYu)

The most well written fanfic I've ever read! It's so realistic too!! I almost forgot this didn't happen in canon!! Keep reading despite your urge in the earlier chapters and wait til you get to flashbacks. But don't skip aheadðŸ˜Š!!

** I've seen this rec'd quite a bit. I don't read Dramione so I'm not sure how good it really is.

*** But unlike all the stories I read about Malfoy not badly he is forced to fight for valdemort because narcissa or Hermione is threatened or he joins the order, Or in a story like the saga of children of The dark or the trilogy The dark Lad where Hermione and the villain in these two stories she is the daughter of valdemort and Malfoy Join her, it is difficult to find stories where the Malfoy or Hermione stay together being enemies ,90% They are either the good ones or the bad ones, the only ones I found in the Hermione style of hermione good and Malfoy of evil was in adulfanfiction but these Stories are heavier with explicit abuse but most that I read they were not mortal enemies they were always on the same side sometimes Malfoy fought for valdemort but it was for threats
