The circumstances of why the couple gave birth in NYC aren't necessarily important. Perhaps they thought they were good to travel a month before the due date, and then had a medical emergency, and found themselves waiting for their kid to get better in the NICU before they could go home. Perhaps they were studying or working abroad and found themselves welcoming a baby while finishing up their study or work program. Whatever the reason, the family may have technically had it's beginnings in NYC, but their home is here now.


** funfact: the kid will also have to pay american taxes irl, as far as I know the usa is the only country who does that

****** At the hospital your parents have the option of declaring whether to claim citizenship or not. They don't just force it on you.

There are two factors that determine what nationality you are born into : /jus sanguinis/ is the right of a person to be a citizen based on their heritage (in this case British), and /jus soli/ is the right to claim depending on where you're born. The US is fairly strange in that we honor both - if two Americans had a child in England for example, they wouldn't be able to obtain a passport from the UK because it doesn't honor strict /jus soli./ To an extent, many European countries will take birthplace into account, but only with other factors at play (such as how long you've lived there, language proficiency, education, etc), but being born there doesn't guarantee you any rights (this gets more complicated with refugee/asylum statuses).

***** Ehhh, NYC was founded less then 20 years after the first colony in America at Jamestown. I don't really think Wizards would've been too involved with something so risky and muggle that early on. I wonder if there are any fics that are based in that time period actually.

** Under muggle law, the child would be a dual US and UK citizen, barring exceptional circumstances. For this to happen, either MACUSA and/or the British Ministry of Magic would have to not recognize the British citizenship, which seems unlikely.

It's certainly possible for a representative from Ilvermorny to show up before McGonagall and tell them the kid has the right to go to school in America. If there's some kind of miscommunication, they might even tell the family that the kid is /required/ to go to Ilvermorny, since magical education is compulsory. But again, that seems unlikely.

** This wouldn't realistically make sense to me because there'd probably be a treaty between the 2 nations that would deal with this issue, especially because of when the American school was founded. I think the conversation would go like this:

Rep: Hello, I'm here from a prestigious school in the United States, here to offer your child a place in our school because he's a US citizen. Why were you in the United States?\\
Parents: We were there just to spend time in New York.\\
Rep: OK, have a nice day!

No need to explain magic to them at that point, Hogwarts can take care of that when they get there. 7 years later, a letter arrives in the mail confirming renouncement of US citizenship for the child and a clear payment account. Now, if the parents were there on student or work visas, the child would have to be told about magic because they have a choice of attending one or the other. If Hogwarts is chosen, the same applies. The reason is that in my head, magical countries have to accept the citizenship laws of their non-magical counterparts, and assuming compulsory attendance at school is required by US law, US citizenship would necessarily have to be renounced at the earliest opportunity (which is 18), and MACUSA or Ilvermorny pays the fees for that to USCIS. If Ilvermorny in this case is chosen, nothing changes wrt the child's citizenship.

** I'm not sure the MACUSA would even bother. Even if the MACUSA is better integrated in its country that Magical Brittain is, in both case they are, in the end, different country.

Even if the baby is "born" in the US, I'm pretty sure Magical Brittain determine its citizen (or at least the Muggle born ones) thanks to accidental magic. So unless the couple left the US pretty late (with their child being like 7), he would probably have his first accidental magic in the UK, making him a British citizen.

*** Though I would totally see one of the minister trying to bring a Muggle Birth Certificate to "prove" the a VIP is from their country and so should attend their school.

Ex : Voldemort kills the Potters, Lily sacrifice destroy him. Sirius refuse to let Harry to Hagrid, and seing the madness about the "Boy Who Lived", decide to leave the country with him. Monthes later, Harry has his first bout of accidental magic in the US. When he turns 11, the Ilvermorny sends him a letter (or whatever they use there), but Fudge come to their house with some ministry officials and Dumbledore (perfect situation for a good old manipulative one), and claim Harry is British and so has to attend Hogwarts.

**** 11 years is way more than enough for them to be American though. Especially coming from the UK, they'd be able to go through the system rather quickly. Then you get to factor in Harry is a pretty big name, a VIP, and I'm sure MACUSA would think it was quite the coup for them to speed them along.

*** As I understand it, Hogwarts is in possession of a Quill of Acceptance and a Book of Admittance, said items being enchanted in such a way that, on the moment of a magical birth, the name of the magical child is recorded. The quill detects a witch giving birth, and tries to write in the book. The book refuses to open for the quill, until the book detects that the childs' magic levels aren't dropping, which would indicate that the witch had given birth to a squib. I'm not sure if places like Northern Ireland are covered, or any former colonies, like the first thirteen States. I read a thread on this subreddit a while back, discussing the range of the book and quill. Iirc, there isn't any word of Rowling on the range of the book and quill, but it's not impossible that the names of children born in former colonies could be recorded in this book. So as far as the wizarding world goes, it seems that you become a citizen at birth.

I'm on mobile and I can't link, but there's articles on Pottermore and the Harry Potter Wiki about this book and quill.
