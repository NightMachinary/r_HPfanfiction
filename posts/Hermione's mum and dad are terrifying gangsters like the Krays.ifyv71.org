Maybe the Grangers even worked as dentists at one point, but things went South for them and they turned to a life of crime (a la Heisenberg).

Together, Dan and Jean Granger are known by their street name, “The Dentists”, because their preferred method for getting their point across without killing the victim is to pull their teeth without anesthesia.

In this iteration, the Grangers and their daughter Hermione are Cockney East Enders and they are part of the criminal underground of London. The Grangers control gang territory and the racket might even be prescription drugs if they had previously been doctors.

Hermione still has her love for books and knowledge, but she also has cunning and street smarts. Hermione keeps busy by running a gambling racket at her muggle school before her Hogwarts letter arrives.

Hermione's parents encourage her to pursue her magical education. She sees the Magical World as a way to strike out on her own and get a piece of territory for herself, rather than taking over the family business when her mom and dad retire (or go to prison).

Hilarity ensues at Hermione's sorting when the Sorting Hat tries to put her in Slytherin and she insists she wants to go to the house with the most marks for her to exploit.

Throughout their adventures in the books, Hermione is always running some kind of side hustle, whether it's smuggling Contraband with the twins or points shaving on the Quidditch games.

Hermione's street smarts and complete mistrust of authority would give her character a very different feel over the years. She wouldn't be afraid to use violence to achieve her goals as long as she didn't get caught (bullies beware). She wouldn't have ratted out the broomstick that Sirius sent to Harry. She would have totally disregarded Dumbledore's no-contact order during the summer before Order of the Phoenix. When they were on the run in book Seven, they wouldn't have starved because Hermione would have knocked over a convenience store or otherwise nicked food from a grocery. Stuff like that as an example.


** Here's a snippet series I wrote about a month ago for a different thread.

--------------

"House of Minions, here I come," Hermione thought to herself as she sat down on the small chair. All that was left was to think the right thoughts at the right time.

/Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they are. Visualise: sunny meadows, smiling faces, friends, birthday party, doing homework in a group. Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they.../

The hat came down on her bushy-haired head.

"Nice try, young lady, but you are a thousand years too young to deceive me. You may want to look up 'Occlumency', by the way. It'll help you where you're going..."

"Wait!"

"Why wait? It's the easiest Sorting in years."

"You want to send me to Slytherin, don't you?"

"You don't agree?"

Hermione thought quickly. "Look, both you and I know where I come from. You also know I'm a Muggleborn. For me to go to Slytherin is the /bravest/ thing I could possibly do!"

There was a long silence. Hermione wondered if the Sorting Hat couldn't handle contradictions, like a robot from an old sci-fi movie.

"Just put me in Ravenclaw and be done with it. You know I'm smart enough," she offered.

"Very well. I don't only sort you based on what you want, however. I also sort you based on what you need. Maybe you'll pick up some courage and decency after seven years in GRYFFINDOR!"

--------------

"Honestly, Harry, if you want to rise through the ranks, you've got to understand that rules are there for a reason. People who violate rules and procedures end up in imprisoned or killed---or, worse, tortured to death."

--------------

"Draco, Draco, haven't you heard that snitches get stitches?" She nodded to Ron, who delivered another kick to the tied-up Slytherin's stomach. "Was it worth the hundred and fifty House Points, Draco?"

Draco somehow found the strength to look up at her. "Granger, when my father... Ah!" He reeled as Hermione shot a carefully measured stinging hex at his eye.

"Still planning to tattle, Draco? Sounds like someone didn't learn his lesson." She crouched next to him to grasp his chin with her free hand. "Did you know that with the dose of the Forgetfulness Potion that you have in you right now, you won't remember our faces or this conversation (It'll all be a blur.) but you'll remember the pain and the fear? Oh yes, you will... Magic really is amazing, isn't it, Draco? Sometimes, I wonder if it's wasted on Purebloods."

Draco whimpered.

--------------

"Um... Hermione..." Ron was visibly nervous, shuffling. Asking to speak with her alone suddenly felt like a very bad idea.

"Yes?" Hermione raised an eyebrow.

"I don't want to... But... I mean..."

Hermione nodded and gestured for him to keep going, looking increasingly impatient.

"Dracowouldntknowwhatastitchis."

"Ronald, please enunciate. And don't slouch."

Ron composed himself.

"Draco wouldn't know what a stitch is. The kind for wounds." He paused.

"Is that all?"

"Um... Also, wizards say 'sneak', not 'snitch'. 'Snitch' is for Quiddich."

Hermione looked him up and down, then surprised him by drawing him into a hug.

"Ron, did you think that I would hurt you for correcting me?"

"Um..."

"You did, didn't you? Do you really think me a monster?"

Ron shook his head quickly.

"You do..." Hermione let him go. "Look, Ron, I only hurt people who deserve it, when they deserve it. Malfoy deserved it, right?"

Ron nodded.

"Now, Ronald, you brought me useful information that will prevent me from making a mistake in the future. Better yet, you waited until we were alone, so you didn't correct or contradict me in front of others. You did precisely the right thing."

** linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina) is a "Harry raised by James Bond" story that has them going up against The Dentist, "a world-renowned mercenary notorious for his creative uses of common dental tools." The story was only three chapters when it was abandoned, but it's fun.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.

** I love the premise---and had it as a plot bunny for years---but you can't change important aspects of a character while making only tiny changes to the storyline. (Or, you can, but it makes for a crappy story.) There isn't even a particular reason for her to have Harry and Ron as friends. The only reason she would have for aligning against the canon bad guys is that she is Muggleborn.

#+begin_quote
  She wouldn't be afraid to use violence to achieve her goals as long as she didn't get caught (bullies beware).
#+end_quote

Why would she fight against bullies? Sure, she might help you with a bullying problem, but some day, and that day may never come, she will call upon you to do a service for her. Or, she would charge a recurring fee. Luna might be able to get a good deal: Hermione might like the idea of "owning" a newspaper.

For that matter, she'd be just as likely to organise the bullies to run extortion and protection rackets.

#+begin_quote
  She wouldn't have ratted out the broomstick that Sirius sent to Harry.
#+end_quote

How much is it worth to Harry to keep the broomstick?

That said, you are part right. If Harry were in her gang, she wouldn't go behind his back: she'd confiscate the broom and hand it over for testing.

#+begin_quote
  She would have totally disregarded Dumbledore's no-contact order during the summer before Order of the Phoenix.
#+end_quote

Firstly, that never happened in canon either: they wrote to Harry, and Harry wrote back. They didn't put anything confidential in there, and that was a /good/ thing, even if it annoyed Harry.

Now, if you think that a Hermione raised by competent gangsters would put incriminating information into something that a house-elf can intercept without anyone noticing, then you have another think coming. (That's even assuming a canon rehash.)

#+begin_quote
  When they were on the run in book Seven, they wouldn't have starved because Hermione would have knocked over a convenience store or otherwise nicked food from a grocery. Stuff like that as an example.
#+end_quote

If it got that far, she'd either flee the country or [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go_to_the_mattresses][go to the mattresses]]. There would probably be many more casualties on both sides.
