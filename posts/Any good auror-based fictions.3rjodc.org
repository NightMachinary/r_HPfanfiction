  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

** There's a good Harry/Tonks fic (that's apparently unfinished, though I'm still in the middle of it), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror) that's really quite good, and focuses a lot on the Auror stuff.

  Deep within the Department of Mysteries, a clandestine unit dedicates itself to the destruction of Voldemort's surviving forces in the aftermath of the Wizarding War. This group, lead by Harry Potter, does not officially exist. But for those who fight the darkness that threatens to engulf their world, it has a name, heard only in the shadows: Operation Wrath of Merlin.

  In the aftermath of Operation Wrath of Merlin, Harry leaves the Department of Mysteries and joins the Auror Office, as Ginny begins her rookie season with the Holyhead Harpies. Both have their own paths to take, and new challenges to overcome. But paths have a way of crossing, and Harry and Ginny may find that their greatest challenge is each other.

** Snape has a daughter named Lilith, who's in danger and who also represents a danger no one but Snape fully comprehends. Or so he hopes. A widowed, cynical Harry, member of a Coterie and part of the College of Aurors, falls in love with Lilith after protecting her from an attack.

Lots of scheming, Auror shenanigans, Dark wizardry, and good characterization.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
