:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a Jily fic where James makes the Quidditch team run laps around the pitch and trains them for hours to make sure everyone is in really good shape. Sirius was also on the team and he complains about having to work out so much, James wakes him up early at one point and Sirius says that he needs his beauty sleep. At one point, Lily's friend, who's on the team, starts to date another team member but James finds out and tells her to either break up or leave the team. One of his rules was that players can't date each other. The plot didn't really focus on Quidditch but these moments stood out to me. (I might be combining two fics idk, please help if this sounds familiar to you) Thanks a ton!


** Don't have it, but why does the girl have to leave the team? Why not the guy (assuming it's a straight couple)?

*** I don't think it was just the girl, both of them were told to leave if I'm not wrong.

  As Quidditch captain, James Potter has just a few simple rules for his teammates to follow. Here are the stories behind the creation of these rules.
