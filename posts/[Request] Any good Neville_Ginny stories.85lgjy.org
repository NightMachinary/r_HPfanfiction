Doesn't have to be the main pairing, can just be in the background. Preferably not Harry/Hermione as the other pairing.


** linkao3(565572) is the best one I've read. Fabulous friends-to-lovers, with a tetchy, temperamental Ginny just wanting her first time done and over with.

[[https://hp-rarities.livejournal.com/54096.html][Hands]] and [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/daily_deviant/360089.html][Lust in the Time of Sprouting]] are two good, short stories. The latter is a PWP, making full use of herbology in kinky sex.

  Despite his misgivings, Neville can't pass up the chance when Ginny asks him to help her out with her little virginity problem. But both of them may have ulterior motives they're not quite prepared to risk owning up to, and things get messy very fast.

** The romance is understated, but still, this is the first one that came to mind.
