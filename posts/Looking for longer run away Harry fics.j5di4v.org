Any good run away Harry fics that have a longer word count? Most of the run away fics I've read have been abandoned early on or short complete ones.

*** Hi Darius!

I am the author of Run, an old reader sent me the link to this post I just wanted to tell you how very happy and grateful I am that you've uploaded this file! I lost all three of my stories (Far Away, Run and Happiness) when I deleted them from Ao3 and although they emailed me the files, they were totally illegible. I'm hoping now I've got a copy of Run, to reupload it. This is a long shot but I don't suppose you have copies of Happiness and Far Away also, do you? Once again, I cannot thank you enough for this!

P.S. I've started a new fic this week that's very similar to my old stuff in terms of theme and characters involved. I'd love for you to check it out! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27252607/chapters/66577306]]

***** Hi Darius,

Thank you so much. That's a shame, but I will take your advice. ðŸ˜Š I'm just so grateful I have a copy of "Run" thanks to you!

I look forward to hearing your comments about my latest story on ao3. Many, many thanks once again!

Best wishes,

Castingblossom x

** Just finished reading Endrina's Life Skills Outside the Curriculum. My only complaint is that it ended several chapters earlier than where it should have (with the end summarized in an epilogue) linkao3(7693897)

** Linkffn(Runaway Wizard) is one of my favourites, completed, something I inevitably come back to as a reread

  Harry finally gets tired of being mistreated by the Dursley's and his complaints ignored or dismissed by the faculty of Hogwarts so he runs away. He learns a lot on the streets and in the world he falls into.
