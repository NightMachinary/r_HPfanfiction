You know, getting in, grabbing the money/treasure and getting out, without being detected or having their identities compromised. Possibly without already having an inside man at the start. Something like Ocean's 11 (though that was a casino)?


** It's almost a shame that we got a Gringotts heist in canon, because we'd probably see a lot more of them in fanfic if we hadn't.

The best heist I've seen in fanfiction was in the second part of Slide's Stygian trilogy, but it was only one arc in a big fic.

*** That would actually be great fun to read. Especially if the vault they're going after is the Malfoy vault.

** Not a perfect fit, but my oneshot [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14699145][Stay]] involves stealing from Gringotts.

I'd love to read a proper heist fic though.
