** Pretty sure they'd count as pureblood, because they have four magical grandparents. They'd definitely get looked down on though. And it's possible if one got disowned, like Marcus Black, they wouldn't count.

** Hmm, good question...would it be a cultural thing or a magical-power thing?

Their blood status, if it had to be codified...I'd probably determine it based on where they were raised. If they were born and raised in the muggle world, they'd probably be considered muggleborn-equivalent. If raised in the magical world...they probably wouldn't have a very 'pure' blood status anyway, considering how Filch is looked down upon. Although that might just be because the latter's cranky all the time.

...Speaking of Filch, however, I'd like to point out, the only two Squibs who get any real screentime in the books or movies are Argus Filch and Arabella Figg.

And, I don't care that their names alliterate with each other, nobody wants to see that pairing.^{^{+}}

*** The whole 'grandparents' thing is fanon, made by people who are being overly literal about why Harry is a half-blood.

#+begin_quote
  The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents.

***** No, it's called recursion. Suppose Lily's parents were both muggleborn. Then under 'grandparent rules', Harry is a pureblood. But muggleborns are 'as bad as muggles' when it comes to blood, so Lily is also muggleborn and as bad as a muggle. Hence, Harry is a half-blood.

  Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents. If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.
#+end_quote

If it's the same, then 1 muggle grandparent = half-blood. Of course, that's all iffy and imprecise, and blood purists would alter the definition to suit their needs.

**** This. When you get outside of muggleborns, blood purism becomes a primarily political distinction. You're a pureblood if the other purebloods want to call you one. Otherwise you're a half blood or a blood traitor or a jumped up muggle or whatever. The whole magical grandparent thing is people taking a Nazi comparison too literally or, at best, a in universe lie that is ignored were useful.

As Dumbledore writes in his annotations to the The Tales of Beedle the Bard

#+begin_quote
  So-called pure-blood families maintain their alleged purity by disowning, banishing or lying about Muggles or Muggle-borns on their family trees. They then attempt to foist their hypocrisy upon the rest of us by asking us to ban works dealing with the truths they deny. There is not a witch or wizard in existence whose blood has not mingled with that of Muggles, and I should therefore consider it both illogical and immoral to remove works dealing with the subject from our students' store of knowledge

****** I think it's pretty clear that halfbreed is considered a slur. On the other hand I agree with you that "half-blood" doesn't quite cover it. I'd say that any half-something ought to be referred to as a "half-" or "part-" followed by the name of the species they're related to. I don't believe, say, half-hags, part-goblins and quarter-elves would want to be lumped together in the same category.

*** It's not nearly that complicated.

- If a wizard has no muggles anywhere in their ancestry, the are pureblood

- If a wizard has no magic anywhere in their ancestry, they are mudblood

- If it's a mix, they're halfblood

- If they have non-human in their ancestry, they'd be halfbreed.

So it comes down to whether a squib is a type of muggle or not. I like the definition of a muggle being someone outside the wizarding world (that makes it cultural not biological). So I'd say yes, squibs can be pureblood, if both their parents are -- and the child of two pureblood squibs would technically be pureblood.

**** *Casta*

A casta (Spanish: [ˈkasta], Portuguese: [ˈkastɐ, ˈkaʃtɐ]) was a hierarchical system of race classification created by Spanish elites (españoles) in Hispanic America during the eighteenth century. The sistema de castas or the sociedad de castas was used in 17th and 18th centuries in Spanish America and Spanish Philippines to describe as a whole and socially rank the mixed-race people who were born during the post-Conquest period. The process of mixing ancestries in the union of people of different races was known as mestizaje. A parallel system of categorization based on the degree of acculturation to Hispanic culture, which distinguished between gente de razón (Hispanics, literally, "people of reason") and gente sin razón (non-acculturated natives), concurrently existed and supported the idea of the racial classification system.
