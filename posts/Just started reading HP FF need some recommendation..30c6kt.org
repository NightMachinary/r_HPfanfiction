I used to be pretty big into HPFF back a decade or so ago. Mostly it was a way to get through the waits between books. I read Methods of Rationality as it was released, but it never really occurred to me to seek out more FF. However this weekend I read The Merging. I was been books and got linked to it, so I gave it a shot. It was an incredible read for me. The content wasn't necessarily great, but I thought the writing was solid and it was very easy to read. I was disappointed when I got to the end to find out it wasn't finished.

Immediately I jumped into another. Sixth Year Steps Toward the End. I have two chapters to go, and I've enjoyed it despite the writing quality being quite noticeably worse than The Merging.

I only read 'Steps' next because I saw that it was long and complete. Though reading the authors notes it clear that it 'complete' just the first book. I did a quick search and it seems the sequel was never written. It wasn't been updated since 'Updated: Sep 12, 2013' which I think means the date it was finished. Since the 7th year book doesn't seem to exist yet in any capacity I assume it never will. Does anyone know for sure?

--------------

Anyway I'd love some recommendations, as spoiler free as you can make them, however I would like to know length of the stories and only stick to completed ones. Good writing quality is more important than originality. Meaning I'm not necessarily put off by cliche.

I'd really appreciate any guidance people can give me.


** A Black Comedy- Its a double Alt Universe fic. youll understand.

Growing Up Black- Harry is raised by the remains of the Black Family, unfinished and possibly abandoned. a good read though.

7th Horcrux- Harrymort fic. Amazingly entertaining. complete opposite of hpmor as far as logic goes.

Applied Cultural Anthropology- Unfinished, but updating. Hermione is a slytherin.

If You've a Ready Mind- Draco as a ravenclaw.

Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, or DAYD for short- Follows Neville's 7th year leading the DA. Kind of dark but very canon compliant, with a few exceptions.

Sluagh- 5 years after DAYD, during neville's time as an auror. Its a bit of a departure from the normal Harry Potter Universe, but a fascinating read. Pretty dark.

A Peccatis- 5 Years after Sluagh. Havent finished reading it, may be unfinished, may even be abbandoned.

These are all pretty long, all being a minimum of Philosopher's Stone length, at least for the finished ones (I have high hopes for Applied Cultural Anthropology). I know it doesnt exactly match your guidelines. If anything i recommend Black Comedy, 7th Horcrux, and the DAYD Trilogy.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724097/1/][/Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World/ by Alrissa]] : Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/1/][/The random craziness file/ by Darklooshkin]] : Here's where I put all the great ideas I get. I hope you like them. Monologuing is such a cool thing to do sometimes.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by DianeCastle]] : In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9098588/1/][/Eccentric Order/ by itsraa]] : When Hermione stumbles upon Draco Malfoy's work in the Room of Requirement sixth year, she confronts Dumbledore about it. They work out a solution that may just change the future of the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]] : ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/][/Error of Soul/ by Materia-Blade]] : OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][/Harry Potter Without Harry Potter/ by Nim-the-Lesser]] : "Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/][/Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone/ by NothingPretentious]] : Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin.Drew]] : In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

It does result in a bias against one-shots, since I read them in a browser, rather than download into Calibre.

**** Its apples and oranges. Both books have their strengths. /Backwards with a Purpose/ is the pretty much /the/ canon redo fic that everyone should read (NoFP is more popular, but its less well written and incomplete besides). It is slightly rehash-y -- especially in the beginning -- but all the build up and characterizations really pay off in the later half of the fic, which I maintain to be some of the best stuff I've ever read in fanfiction.

/The Book of Albus/ (which is the second book, not the third) is less sappy, faster paced, more action-y and has unique time travel mechanics (though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined][Destiny Redefined]] is somewhat similar to the Book of Albus, and has many of the same themes), but is sometimes bewildering in its pace and plot (which is probably the reason its less popular than BWP). Also, despite the deaths it cannot invoke emotions the same way BWP does, which has a slower and more comfortable build.

*** Its /On the Way to Greatness/, not /His/. Not a big deal by any means, but I wince whenever someone gets the title of my favorite fanfic wrong. I was also under the impression that you didn't like it all that much, but you do mention it as the third favorite fic in the fandom here.

As for "missing" stories, no love for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]]? Its perhaps the only fanfic that gives that epic feel, without going overboard with it like /Wastelands/ does. Sort of like LOTR actually. You should probably give it a chance if you haven't before -- its one of the best out there.

The list is pretty comprehensive otherwise. /Prince of the Dark kingdom/ has some really amazing worldbuilding and some truly epic moments, but it has a long list of flaws as well. I think its still quite good, but that's a matter of opinion. /Equal and Opposite/ is awesome and should be considered, even if the Ginny bashing and Snape fucking Draco both blatantly contradict canon. /Song and the Trees/ is also very nice, despite -- well, what is with DLP writers and their love for Ginny bashing?

/What you Leave behind/ should also make the list, although it may be too early to put in on there. /Hogwarts Battle School/ might make it though -- the recent developments have been quite interesting.

** Make a Wish- Pretty good humor, a lot of running gags. Harry runs away from the Dursleys to go on a long vacation, since he thinks he's going to die against Voldemort. It gets funny from there.

To Shape and Change- Snape goes back in time to stop Voldemort from doing crazy shit. Not really the smoothest narrative, but each chapter has the feel of something happening, so you're never bored.

If you're interested in crossovers, like Harry/Naruto fics or something else, just reply to me and I'll recommend a few.

[[http://lira-snape.livejournal.com/5672.html]]

She doesn't do it anymore, hasn't for quite a while, but it was my one stop shop when I was first into fanfiction years ago. You can find a lot of great stories there and it is all sorted by category and genre.

Also check out some of the "old masters" on fanficauthors.net Jeconais, Kinsfire, Bobmin and several others sorted into categories and ships. This site is invite only so it was kindof the pick-of-the-litter at the time. Some of these stories are on Lira Snape but there are a lot that have been posted or updated since she stopped adding.

And there is my stuff on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1593459/GinnyMyLove]] which is mostly Powerful Harry / Harem and a bit of crossover. I really need to go back and fix the early chapters of Searching for the Power since I got so much better as I went along.
