Harry is depressed after loosing Sirius, and goes back to the Death Chamber at the Ministry of Magic. There, Voldemort opens the Veil and pushes Harry through. Once on the other side, he finds a universe where his Sirius is alive, and so are his parents, and that world's Harry is an utter ponce. The rest of the fic is him going to various universes to train, eliminating various incarnations of Voldemort as he went.

** This fic sounds familiar. Was the Harry in one of the universes (maybe the ponce one) named Harold? And in another universe, something related to Azkaban, he was HJ?

I was thinking of this fic the other day but I can't remember its title or more details about it

*** That's the one! If memory serves, Lily, James, and Harry Prime (the original Harry) decided to call their Harry Harold as to avoid confusion.

I know it as well.

Its abandoned, one dimensions has Harry murdered by Dumbledore so 4 different Harry's spoke him.

Another has Harry go crazy after Sirius death and become enriched with Japanese culture.

One where Gin y is a fanboy of Voldemort and fakes her death to get Harry in prison.
