So many fics refer to Hermione as a "Bushy Haired Missile" so why not be literal. Hermione during the Animagus transformation finds out she's not an animal, but is literally a Bushy Haired Missile.

Bonus Points if she's actually a Bonzai Bill (The Giant Bullet Bills from Mario)

***** I had a fic outlined that I ultimately decided not to write in which Hermione goes very Dark, and figures out how to conjure and contain antimatter. Unfortunately, its limitations mean that it's only usable as a suicide attack weapon. Fortunately, she has a horcrux...
