So yeah, crime, mystery, PIs, all that jazz. The only one that comes to my head is the lovely one-shot linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/Red-Amber]]) but I'm sure there's more like it. So show me! :)

Thanks in advance!

PS: While I'm generally looking for serious stuff, in the unlikely event somebody happens to come across a parody of the hardboiled genre in the form of a HP fanfic, feel free to rec that too.


** There is linkffn(Remus Lupin, Pi)

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

** One of my favorites might qualify, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

The first half is mostly training and set-up for the main plot, but in the second half it gets really interesting.

Harry and Ron are aurors after defeating Voldemort in the first half. They really wanted to arrest the corrupt purebloods like Malfoy, but with their political influence that's more difficult than expected, so they have to focus on hunting down some escaped Death Eaters and catching the mysterious thieves that are breaking into well protected manors, leaving nothing behind.

Meanwhile Hermione and Sirius figured out a method to reduce the power of corrupt rich purebloods: Break into their manors and steal and vanish everything, thus making them less rich and more arrestable for Harry.

It's not quite as big of a mystery as it could be since half of it is from the thief's perspective, but I absolutely love the action scenes told from both perspectives. The broom chase and the Greengrass Manor heist are two of my favorite scenes ever.

Eventual very strained Harry/Hermione romance. She can't really figure out how to tell him that she's the one he's hunting.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** On the off-chance you're fine with slash and HP/SS pairing, I'm writing a series of PI Harry mysteries. In the first one, Harry's investigating the disappearance of a Hogwarts student posing as a Divination teacher linkao3(17157173). In the sequel I'm currently writing, he's investigating the death of Daphne Greengrass and searching for a missing Dark Arts book.
