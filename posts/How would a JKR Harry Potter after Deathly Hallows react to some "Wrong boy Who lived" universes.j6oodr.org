I myself enjoy "Wbwl" stories, but what I wonder is how would Harry Potter lets say 1 month after he defeated Voldemort react if he was transported to a "Wrong boy who lived" universe?

For example:

The Price of Slytherin: (S-"Name" = Prince character) (I'm going to set The Prince of Slytherin universe just past the 3rd year and he does not know of the Potter Prophesy)

S-Harry Potter Harry Potter in my opinion would first be confused as to why his counterpart is in Slytherin, but he would accept it because the Sorting Hat almost put himself into that house.

S-Parents I think that he would be disappointed in the elder S-Potters since he doesn't know about the Potter prophecy he could see no reason to give away a child especially to the Dursleys. But even if he knew about the Prophecy he would still be unhappy with then because in his universe ( correct me if I'm wrong about this) Prophecies are less direct in their nature.

S-Black & Pettigrew Harry would be surprised about the cunning of S-Pettigrew and dear I say a little impressed JKR Pettigrew was a coward who lived only by the mercy of Voldemort but in this universe, he tricked them all and got away with it for 12 years and is a decent Wizzard that can create a Rat-flood. S-Black on the other hand would be a bit of a disappointment yet again. He went after S-Pettigrew instead of securing the S-Potters and got himself thrown into Azkaban and after he got out he immediately fucks up his relationship with the S-Potters.

Jim Potter The Wrong boy who lived would be a mystery to our Potter but he would know that he is not the real prophesized one because of the different Scars. He would see him as a bit of an emotional wreck and would sympathize with him and feel pity for him because he has to deal with all of the emotional baggage that the Chosen one has to deal with without actually being the chosen one. (if I remember the plotline completely).

I'm gonna stop here because I can't remember the rest of the characters good enough to make a prediction( and I'm too lazy).

What are your thoughts on this? How would Harry react to a universe where he is Over Powerd and downright cruel to the other prophesized ones and do you think he would be ok with it? ( I don't think he would)

One last question: Are there any fanfictions where this is the plotline because I can't find any?


** I don't honestly get why Sirius gets so much hate for not securing Harry. He gave him to Hagrid didn't he? And Hagrid even without a wand can defend himself. Plus he knew more people were right on the way. In those circumstances how can anyone dislike a man who is chasing his best friend and his wife's betrayer?

*** And canon Harry never held this against Sirius, ithink he would be overjoyed to meet any Sirius in any universe. I can't imagine a Harry who would be disappointed in Sirius.

**** You're exactly right; it's just in all the "grey powerful blah blah" fics he's so angry and even Sirius just treats it like it's completely justified and it always gets to me

*** Hagrid also clearly told him that he was to brought Harry to Dumbledore. From Sirius point of view, Harry could hardly be safer than with one of the strongest wizards alive.

** I think people like to play fast and loose and manufacture reasons for canon Harry to be different from what he really was. Canon Harry was on decent terms with */Malfoy/* of all people at the 19 year epilogue, giving each other nods of respect and all that.

If canon Harry can be so forgiving to someone who was as much of an ass to him as Draco Malfoy was through all their school years, then what makes people think that canon Harry is going to suddenly hate all his loved ones who are back from the dead just because they are a bit different from his original universe? He's going to at least try to reconnect with them.

I see that kind of thing a lot with authors that don't like certain characters who they want to bash, like for example Hermione. Yes, she's bossy and not exactly a smooth social person when she's younger, but if you think that canon Harry is going to go back to a time when they were kids and suddenly loose all patience with her and hate her because she's not perfect, then you have forgotten what canon Harry is like, or just don't care because it's fun to bash.

And oh is it so fun to bash! lol

But I like the one story from Dogbertcarroll "A MODern man" where Harry ends up in a nice universe over in his younger analog's body. He's got a family and he's loving it!

** For that second prompt with canon Harry reacting to OP Harry I have one. It's not the entire plot but it is a decently long arc.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the elementals power) starts at chapter 21
