There's another thread asking what fics people think are overrated, however I'd like to ask a different question. What fic do you think is worth the hype?

For me I think Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus fits the bill. I think that fic is really good and deserves to be recommended often.

*** This fic is not perfect, and yet I absolutely love it. It is the only one that I can think of that portrays Voldemort in the way that it does. He still a psychopath and a sort of villain, but also sympathetic and a good leader. The society that he built is not just built on fear, torture, slavery and random pointless crucio's, but something that actually seems to work for its people in a way. I like how Harry is still entirely light/good at heart and how their friendship still seems quite natural despite their differences. The characterizations are great for others as well.

Plus it has some great quotes ranging from awesome to hilarious:

#+begin_quote
  Help you? Help you what? Turn him into another one of you?"

  "Of course not. There can only be one of me, but I see so much potential for him. He can fulfill the roles I can't... do as easily. I am a conqueror, he is a defender. I lead by the lash, he leads by example. He might yet become my equal, but we shall never be the same."
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Lucius considered that. Was that the secret to his Master's relationship with Potter? Friendship? If it was a friendship, then it wasn't like any Lucius had ever known before. They seemed quite near killing each other on several occasions and close as brothers on others; fighting and laughing and manipulating each other in equal measure. It was borderline deranged, and yet made a strange sort of sense.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  From the window he was guarding, Johan made a derisive sound. "Another scheme? What will you use now? Cripples and vampires? Animangi and centaurs?"

  "School children, actually," Dumbledore said. "Among others, but mostly school children."

  Everyone looked suitably horrified except for Krum, who, being a school child himself and actively participating in an underground war, didn't see the problem.

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) is one that deserves all the praise it gets. It's a canon rehash done right, and it's actually got a Slytherin!Harry whose characterization is just a few steps away from canon. Bonus points for realistic Snape and Malfoy.

linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair) is another amazing, highly-regarded fic. This author has some of the best prose I've seen in fanfiction. There's just so much emotion in only 1600 words.

***** Canon Snape abused his power to bully children, made a boy's school life hell because the boy's father, who died a decade ago, hung out with terrorists in his schooldays (Lily is creeped out by the lot) and joined a magical SS ripoff with very similar, genocidal goals.

Malfoy was a bigot who chose the easy way (going along Voldemort's plan) instead of trying to take his mother and run to Patagonia. He called for racial purges at 12 (You are next Mudbloods), had sadistic tendencies (Buckbeak incident where he wanted to see someone/thing suffer) and was an overall bully.

But you've answered my question and I'll give the story a shot. Thanks for that.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

Quote from the story:

#+begin_quote
  Getting around the screaming feature of the restricted section books when they were opened was easy once I taught myself a powerful silencing spell that was in the regular library. I'd learned to become self sufficient after my time at the Dursleys. I discovered books on occlumency and legilimency and quickly taught myself these disciplines when I found out that some wizards can read minds. I already suspected Snape and Dumbledore of it.

  By day I read in the regular library and night in the restricted section. There were small rituals in the restricted section which didn't really require much in the form of payment, an animal sacrifice here and there, which made it so I only required two hours of sleep a night. A boy named Ronald Weasley kept on following me around school and annoying me so I used his pet rat first as a sacrifice.

- Sneaking into the restricted section
- Harry is extra independent because of the Dursley's
- Harry teaches himself difficult magic super easily
- Harry becomes and expert at occlumency and legilimency
- Snape and Dumbledore use legilimency on everyone
- Dumbledore Bashing
- Using rituals to make oneself more powerful

** Definitely HPMOR.

People get too hung up over the author's rationalist writing. The actual story is masterfully told, with the best humor, exploration of the magic system, and deeper worldbuilding that I've seen in fanfiction. There's so much foreshadowing! You pick up so much more from second, third, and fourth re-reads! I absolutely loved the entire concept of Battle School and I wished the story had spent more time in that arc. The villain is absolutely terrifyingly fantastic. The ending is basically perfect.

If HPMOR were a published novel and the world didn't hate fanfiction it would be regularly in all the top-twenty-fantasy-novels-of-the-decade lists.

**** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's rational outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Bayesian epistemology, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Harry's existential catchphrase “I notice that I am confused”, which itself is a cryptic allusion to humanity's instinctual yearning for enlightenment. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius wit unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

**** I mean, I've actually read most of the top 20 fantasy novels of the decade, judging from various polls. And HPMOR is straight up better written than the large majority of them. I'm not sure what else to say on that matter. Yeah, I like the story a lot, but I also have the perspective to see outside it - and what's outside isn't any better. Just different.

So what are the "top 20" novels of the decade that HPMOR is better written than?

Somehow I seriously doubt that. HPMOR has one of the worst openings of competently-written (as in, the author has a decent handle on the syntax of the language they're using) fiction I've ever read. And the response to this is always "Yes, but it gets better after chapter X!" (where X can be as high as 15). Well guess what - almost no original published literature, especially one by a new author, is given the leeway of sucking for up to an eighth of its chapter length.

****** The opening was absolutely hilarious. Just because you're looking for serious openings doesn't mean that ones that don't live up to your standards are bad.

For 'top 20', let's look at this.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/30h21n/the_2015_top_rfantasy_novels_of_all_time_poll/]]

I'm not sure exactly where I'd put HPMOR in that list, but it's definitely better than some of the things in the top 20. Better than as much as a quarter to a third of them, by my guess. And, yes, I've read everything in the top 20 of that poll.

******* It's pretty telling that you think the only criticism of HPMOR's opening is that it's not "serious". If you want actually good, actually humorous fantasy openings, try Terry Pratchett sometime (incidentally my favourite author).

And when I say opening I'm referring to the first few chapters. Maybe fanfiction has lowered your standards of what good writing looks like but while a teacher standing slack-jawed at the completely told not shown "brilliance" of an eleven year old does play into certain fantasies, it's really not the pinnacle of literature. Neither is an eleven-year-old casually talking of raping a peer.

Besides the hilarity of using Reddit of all things as a measure of top anything in any genre, /which/ of the books in that list is HPMOR better than?

******** It's also pretty telling that you're confusing actions on paper with the actual reality of the underlying story. HPMOR is subversion. You go in reading of some cocky, apparently excessively brilliant child, but the more and more you go in the more apparent it becomes that the main character is thoroughly out of his depth. He still wins in the end, yes, but; journey over destination.

I /admit/ that HPMOR would probably benefit if everyone in the child cast was aged up by 4-5 years, but, eh, it's a fanfiction for a reason.

Repeating myself, because apparently you didn't notice the first time. HPMOR's first few chapters do a piss-poor job of being either subversive or a sufficiently entertaining account of a cocky, excessively brilliant child (for an example of a decent execution that's not just eyeroll-worthy, see the first couple of /Artemis Fowl/ books). Sure in the fanfiction world people regularly stick out thousands of words of crap because it's primarily a hobby and our standards have gotten so low we need shovels to reach their level, but [mainstream] original fiction really doesn't work like that (to begin with, literally nobody is going to publish 660,000 words from a hitherto unknown author).

Also, which of:

- A Song of Ice And Fire
- The Kingkiller Chronicles
- The Stormlight Archive
- The Lord of The Rings
- Gentleman Bastards
- The Wheel of Time
- The Malazan Book of The Fallen
- Discworld
- The First Law
- Harry Potter
- The Broken Empire
- The Dresden Files
- Farseer Trilogy
- The Riyria Revelations
- Mistborn
- Raven's Shadow
- Earthsea Cycle
- The Second Apocalypse
- The Lions of Al-Rassan
- The Sandman

is HPMOR written better than? (Although technically I probably should drop HP itself from that list, since that just becomes the 64547587th canon vs fanfiction debate)

********** Excluding the actual Harry Potter,

I'd put HPMOR higher than Earthsea (good at the time, but archaic now), Mistborn (only a little higher, this one was close), Riyria, Dresden (first 4-5 books specifically, Dresden picks up later), Farseer (how the hell is this even in the top 20?), Broken Empire, and I'd put it at a vague level of parity with Gentlemen Bastards (looser plot than GB, but much, much better characters). Also, I consider the KKC to basically be a better written HPMOR - a lot of the fundamental things that made HPMOR work, KKC also does, just better. In other words, in a ranked list, I'd put it somewhere from 11-13 on this list.

Yeah that's not true for these more successful web serials. Unsong's author got offers despite what I consider to be piss-poor editing and pacing, which was admittedly carried by brilliant writing and worldbuilding. Worm's gotten offers. Mother of Learning. Heck, look at the Fifty Shades of Grey crap. If you think that the author of the most popular story in the history of fanfiction.net couldn't get a decent publishing deal, you're honestly kidding yourself. He's probably /already/ gotten publishing offers but rejected them because it would be too hard to edit HPMOR into an "original" story.

************ I'm only considering the original Farseer trilogy, which is all I've read, and which I consider to be kinda awful, honestly.

Honestly, I don't really think HPMOR should be compared to GB. they're just so different. What I do know is that HPMOR sucked me in and kept me in, while Gentlemen Bastards intensely suffered from excessive flashback interludes that ruined the pacing and still failed to make me care about Locke as a character. I actually dropped the story once at around the 60% arc and only finished much, much later because of all the recommendations. Dropping it was almost entirely due to simply not giving a damn about the main character.

The second and third GB books are both goddamm messes, honestly.

************* Farseer is emotionally awful on you, which, I consider to be quite a trick and a sign of a good writer. Plus the worldbuilding is crazy good. Robin Hobb trilogy are kinda like that, the first book is fun, the second book you consider that you would kill yourself if you were the character all this shit happens to, and the third book has a happy, but bittersweet ending.

And GB, I have the opposite problem, I can't care too much about any fanfiction character because I've seen them all, in so many different situations, that usually none of them seem real to me. But if Locke or Jean die, they're really really dead.

************ Earthsea was boring, at least for me. I realize that Earthsea was written in 1968, and basically created a lot of the tropes that I've seen executed elsewhere in books that were /inspired/ by Earthsea - but the fact is I was born long after 1968 and just thought the book was boring. I'm sorry.
