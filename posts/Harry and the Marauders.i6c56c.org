:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im looking for a fic that just suddenly popped into my head. So I was thinking it would be cool if Harry went back in time to the Marauders 1st year as an 11 year old, and was in class with them, in the same house, and friends with them. So he would be part of the group. So if anyone knows anything like what my mind just came up with, pls tell me!


** Maybe label this as a Request instead of a What's That Fic.

** You might like this one. Harry is 11, but the marauders are in their 7th year. He goes to classes with them and everything.

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised fulfills an eleven-year-old Harry Potter's desire in the strangest of ways. Suddenly thrust into the past, Harry copes with getting to know a newly dating James Potter and Lily Evans while Dumbledore figures out how to send him back to his own time. There's only one problem; time travel has many repercussions and Harry finds himself getting...younger.
