** Nothing immediately comes to mind, but I largely find it's an age thing. Good fics with believable 11-13 year olds are better at drama queen malfoy than serious malfoy because he's less serious before Voldemort is back in canon

** Okay well.... That depends. I have one going that's a dramione. It's only on 56k but I have another 68k written and awaiting edits. So it'll be a while until it's finished. It's updated on the weekend and mid week. I have been told they both act true to their character in reviews by a couple of people so you can give it a shot.

Takes place after the battle of Hogwarts. Hermione tricks Draco into a deal as her potions apprentice. It focuses mainly on world building and their new lives. No grand evil so not overly exciting. More slice of life feeling.

linkffn(The Potioneers by Omnenomnom)

The other one I can think of is linkffn(isolation by Bex-Chan) but most people have read it.

My dark horse is linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina)

Edit: I hope it's kosher to suggest my own.

  They need each other unfortunately. Hermione has tricked Draco under her tutelage, arrogant attitude and all. But she would be simple to think he would accept it quietly. They have both have secrets to hide, old wounds better left to fester, and a world full of mermaids, dragons, and magic to explore.

** For Drama Draco, I have to recommend /The Secret Language of Plants/. Linkao3(9323225)

From the author's notes:

#+begin_quote
  The file for this fic is called “Depressed Harry and socialist Draco.docx” because all I wanted at first was to write an angry blonde anarchist Draco. I have no idea how it took me so long to reach this point.
#+end_quote

From part 3 of the series:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, Draco” Sirius said [...] “It has been said, and I believe it is a gross exaggeration, but nevertheless it has been said that we the Blacks have a certain tendency towards uncontrolled emotionality.”

  Who said that? What kind of vermin would say that? Draco was the Master of Temperance! He was Restrain and Control. He knew just how to keep a cool head at all times! He would show them! Aaargahffg.
#+end_quote

This is the quintessential Drama Draco, as far as I'm concerned.

*** The writing in this series (as in certain specific turns of phrase) is so so good that I almost couldn't stand it - Im reading it for the second time and I'm a quarter way through the final one and I've actually stepped away from it for a bit because I don't want it to end. It also has quite possibly my all time favorite depiction of Pansy Parkinson.

**** It has my all time favorite Percy Weasley. Not because of his gift, but because of his characterization. He schedules his emotional breakdowns and then gets back to work. And it doesn't matter what people, even his own family, think and say about him because there is work that needs doing.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
