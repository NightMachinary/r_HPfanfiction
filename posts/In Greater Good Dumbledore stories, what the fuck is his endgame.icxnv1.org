I've read a bunch of them, and most of the time, Harry reveals his evildoings to the world and gets rid of him. I never know exactly what Dumbledore wanted to begin with. Some stories show him wanting to be seem as a savior of the wizarding world once again, but then what?

What is the Greater Good?


** "Greater Good" Dumbledore is because the Author is following the Trope. It's just Evil Dumbledore ruling the world politically with a Smile using his fame/influence to control everything, and the Author generally refuses to acknowledge that, by saying "Not Evil but Greater Good Dumbledore" and having Fawkes "A CREATURE OF LIGHT" stay with Dumbledore.

Actual Greater Good Dumbledore would have burned down Azkaban "Oh no, Fiendfyre broke out at Azkaban, Oh well, it's for the Greater Good" whilst setting some way up to trap the Dementors and starve them. Voldemort would have either been stuck as a Wraith until Harry died a natural death, because all of his followers would have been killed, or come back to very little support with just Pettigrew left.

I don't think it's that clear cut, especially since "the greater good" is rather nebulous. By our morales he may have acted the way you described, but that phrase can mean anything from eugenics to a "we need a war a decade to keep our people sharp". Or that the weak have to serve the strong for the greater good. I'm even pretty sure that Hitler thought that he was acting towards the greater good, despite his atrocities.

** Depending of how you look at it, Canon "Greater Good" is either Grinderwald excuse for his massacres, or Dumbledore life (the man who used his own death to make his spy gain the trust of the enemy).

Fanon "Greater Good Dumbledore" is this guy who does very bad things, but who is somehow not Evil, a bit like "Grey Harry". Both are like this D&D player who has been forced to make a "True Neutral" character even though he really wanted to be "Chaotic Evil". A murder hobo with excuses ready.

  Many have criticized Albus Dumbledore for not taking adequate steps to undermine Tom Riddle's plays for power, rein in Severus Snape's behavior toward Gryffindors, and see to Harry Potter's welfare... but what if that was the point? 'It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor...' (Manipulative!Dumbledore. Oneshot. Crackfic.)

** IMO, "Greater Good" Dumbledore has two issues that concern him. 1)He wants the Light to win in the fight with the Dark, and 2) He wants to be the one that takes all the credit - and rewards.

Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, and was made Grand Sorcerer, Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump for it. He has held the titles (and their power) for decades. Power changes a person. By the time Voldemort showed up, he has become accustomed to it.

Then he realises that if Harry defeats Voldemort, the wizarding community will take his power and titles and give them to Harry. Dumbledore does not want that to happen, hence manipulation and talk of the "Greater Good" ie it is for the Greater Good that Harry went to the Dursleys, as they would make him meek and submissive, therefore easy to control.

** I think the original idea of Greater Good was to justify killing/harming people in order to achieve the betterment of society. Grindelwald used it to justify starting his war to create a society where everyone lived in peace, with the wizards leading at the Muggles obeying. In fics, it's just Dumbledore being evil for the sake of being evil.

** In canon iirc, their less than stellar treatment of muggles was what was meant to be for the “Greater Good”. A little bit of subjugation but the world would b a better place in spite of it

** i suppose the proper conclusion is that the magical governments would rule over the muggle ones. like a caste system or similar to how the bartimaeus books work. probably not a bad thing.

** My thoughts of the "Greater Good" Dumbledore's endgame is for the society of Wizarding Britain to survive with as few loses as possible.

After the first war /a lot/ of wizarding familes got exterminated or almost exterminated (Potter and Bones being the two noticeable ones, Prewett if you are a little bit of a researcher). The death toll was enormous for the overall population.

JK had 40 people a year at Hogwarts (At least initially) during Harry's years which would be end of war time. That is not a lot of people in a school when you have Britain and Ireland to pick from.

Dumbledore in my mind is also an academic and not a fighter, a "General" sort of fellow rather than a soldier. He chose to send Newt Scamander against Grindelwald. He had his Order of the Phoenix against Dumbledore, not once but twice.

If Dumbledore could use Harry as a sacrifice to save the overall wizarding population (This includes Death Eaters and their kids) then it would be "For the Greater Good".

The problems as a writer in this scenario is that if you want a somewhat (1st Person)3rd person perspective from Harry's POV then Dumbledore will be seen as "Evil" because the man who wants to sacrifice you will automatically be just that "a threat to your life".

Now, that doesn't mean that people sometimes (Myself included) don't go too far with it... (Still embarrassed about my first depiction of the man) but that is the preface of it.

To Dumbledore and every other politician it becomes a numbers game. How can we end the conflict with as few people dead as possible.

The whole cloak and dagger part of the situation (Ministry take over, Both Dumbles and Voldes had spies don't even lie to me) lead to a few high profile assassinations, Bones, Scrimgeour, Bode, Burbages (Or whatever that Muggle studies professor was called).

The highest number of deaths was in book seven and there was only ONE large scale battle in the entire canon series. For a civil war that is rare if not impossible (And this is all after Dumbles fucks up and dies to the horcrux-curse).

​

"Greater good" is an oxymoron. It justifies doing bad/evil actions for good results. Sacrificing Sirius to get Voldemort into the open when Fudge is being an ostrich is a "Greater Good" result. Was it on purpose? Speculation at best. Making Harry die so Voldemort dies as well? Speculation at best. Sacrificing a small number of people instead of launching open warfare? That's also a "Greater Good" decision.

Canon Dumbles is just suspicious. (And JK is not at fault for this as much as just the limitation of world building).

1) Why is Remus Lupin the only werewolf to ever attend Hogwarts?

2) Why does Snape get to stay to teach when he clearly isn't good at teaching and therefore screws an entire generation of potion brewers?

3) Instead of sending the philosopher's stone back to flamel in the beginning of book one he builds an obstacle course three eleven year olds can get through to lure out Voldemort? Endangering an entire seven years worth of magical people. If voldemort did a massacre EVERY magical in seven years would have died.

4) He knows that Tom Riddle opened the chamber. He has had fifty years to find out that Myrtle (Same last/first name) is the dead girl from the first time. It isn't rocket science to find out it is a basilisk. Talk to the spider, talk to the ghost and hide that specific bathroom. Buy Mandrakes from outside of the castle or something. Like there are so many things where something or someone gets sacrificed to teach Harry something or test him.

5) The Portraits would have spotted Sirius in his dog form. Dumbledore knows about the entrance from the shrieking shack. He made it for Remus. After Halloween where Sirius gets into the castle it isn't that hard to check if Sirius or someone else has been in the shack.

6) The portraits again. Unless Crouch froze them all or blind folded them when he put in Harry's name in the goblet then Dumbledore should have found out. He does nothing to stop it. He needs "Hard Proof" of Voldemort's return. Fudge fudges that up but the idea is there.

7) Umbridge. I don't care what people say if enough evidence was found against her then people could and probably would do something against her. That or Dumbledore just doesn't have time anymore to be a proper teacher.

8) The Horcrux Curse was a fuck up. He wanted to see Arianna. He planned to live and now his grand Horcrux hunt has to be performed by Harry instead of himself. I don't think he actually minds dying all that much. Snape killing him is a two fold thing. One he doesn't know how the alligience of the Elder Wand works when it comes to a cursed artifact (The ring) and second he wants to make Snape an unquestionable person in Riddle's eyes.

9) Book 7. fuck it.

​

That's the basis of the whole Greater Good Dumbledore. IMO it's just cynical writing of an already suspect character. We get the fairy tale grandfather in canon (Except Skeeter's book and because it is Skeeter we don't trust it) and in fanfiction people write the other side of the coin with cynicism and skepticism. People don't lie until they are caught in a lie.

Dumbledore's endgoal is the survival of magic. (Death Eaters and non-death eaters alike).

** In most of the fics, I've read? he is just evil. No real end game or anything except stealing all of Harry's money to probably buy lemon drops or something. Most of the fics with the Greater Good Dumbledore I've seen just end up making him a senile old coot who does stuff because the plot demands him to.

** Greater Good Dumbledore makes sense in the context of him using people as chess pieces and being willing to sacrifice individuals for the "greater good" (i.e. how he thought things would go with Harry until Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself). It can even be used to explain some of the more irrational decisions he makes in canon, as well as him keeping information from literally anybody who could use it well

Unfortunately, most fanfic authors take it well beyond that. I would love to see an indy!Harry who has Dumbledore as an antagonist to himself, but have Dumbledore actually want good things for the Wizarding World, and not the nonsense currently out there.

** Greater Good Dumbledore is a power-hungry pseudo-narcissistic sociopath that also happens to have no actual desire for power (as he for some reason still doesn't accept the position of Minister in this universe) along with the fact that he is very stupid but also a master manipulator that just so happens to get caught by a fifteen year old that decided to read a few spellbooks for the first time in his life.

Dumbledore in canon /is/ a greater good Dumbledore, he orchestrates many canon events in the way we see them so Harry/Voldemort get in place and eventually Harry has to die. He says as much at Kings Cross. But Dumbledore is not unrepentantly so, he genuinely feels remorse for doing so but recognized it as the only way.

** there is one fic that I can't remember the name of and haven't been able to finish as it's super dense and slow moving, but has some ducking amazing OCs and world building and they made the ultimate Dumbledore in my opinion. On the face of it he's this righteous and shining dude, but in reality he's blocking opportunities for the underprivileged peeps and making life harder for literally everyone. You know those politicians who say shit like ‘if disabled people don't work they'll have no dignity' at the same time as making life impossible with cut wages and little to no aid.

I wish I could remember what it's called, because I'm not explaining it right at all

** It's mostly a failed attempt at making Dumbledore seem like a good villain, so the author have to make him do horrible things while maintaining his public image for the general population, but since he honestly wouldn't actually have any reason for being a villain it just comes out as him being a fanatic idiot who doesn't really have any idea of what he is doing.
