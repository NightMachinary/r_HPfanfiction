Looking for Hogwarts era fics- can be chaptered stories or one shots, about the golden trio, the twins and friends, weasleys, Ginny/Neville/Luna, the DA, really anyone. Similar to missing moments style fics. Cannon compliant.

I just want to read fun things about friends hanging out in the common room or eating together or going to quidditch games or hogsmeade, etc... a little angst is fine but mostly just want happy moments.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** I have a couple of oneshots you might enjoy. Romance, but humor too.

linkao3(29455) is a Cedric/Hermione set in GoF when they go on a sweet little date.

linkao3(20489) is a kind of humorous Luna/Draco where he's irritated that he's taken with her

linkao3(20492) is a Harry/Hermione set in book 5
