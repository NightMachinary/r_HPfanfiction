With the popularity of Dark!Harry and Gray!Harry stories almost any story seems to contain a moderately cynical and somewhat jaded Harry.

Exemplary symptoms of this include:

/"Using Stupify isn't effective, because Death Eaters will just revive each other [true!]. Therefore we should always use lethal spells and turn every fight into a bloodbath."/ - instead of coming up with a better way. How about inventing a gun that shoots portkeys? Or finding another non-lethal spell that isn't easily reversible?

"/The magical population are all sheep and they deserve to be tortured and killed if they won't fight back"/ - instead of trying to help them be more vigilant and somehow trying to make them understand that they have to fight.

/"If you give someone a second chance you might be betrayed, therefore we should be entirely ruthless"/ - instead of trust but verify... maybe there's a middle ground somewhere? Veritaserum? Unbreakable vows!?

I've always been convinced that you can have ideals without being a gullible idiot and a wimp, but most authors seem to disagree. IMHO you can't really be an idealist and a push-over (see canon Hermione).

What's your favourite fanfic with an idealistic Harry who doesn't believe in no win scenarios, who doesn't think everything is just a zero-sum game?


** It feels like there's a dichotomy in fanfiction between two kinds of authors and your issue with stories is a symptom of it. This doesn't mean all stories are like this, but I would say a large number of them fit one of the two categories.

The first kind of author is one that writes badass!Harry and tends to show that by having him be ruthless and in a lot of cases an asshole. Writing more thoughtful, more compromising characters that still come off as large and in charge is difficult so it's fair that you see less stories that contain them.

The other kind of author is writing character driven stories that are about interpersonal relationships and emotional connections. These stories have more diverse characters and are where you can find more idealism and people actually working things out as opposed to killing each other. Unfortunately, they also tend to get distracted and spend an unnecessary amount of time on contrived drama and forget that any good story involves change.

The problem comes from combining the two and creating a story that has both characters that are willing to work out their differences in a positive, healthy fashion while also having a plot that involves an external antagonist, be it a villain or a situation that can't remain unresolved.

To provide an example of a story that does both (doesn't fit in my dichotomy), I present [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][/Contractual Invalidation/]]. One of the reasons I love the story is it legitimizes both sides of the blood purity argument and presents a Harry that at once doesn't let himself be run over, tries to work with people, and is also very competent and is willing to shoulder responsibility to create a better future. And it does this in a get in, get out fashion that doesn't bumble around for 400k words.

  Contractual Invalidation by R-dude
#+end_quote

This was interesting. Certainly not good, but interesting. I'm not a fan of twist endings and in particular "gotcha" endings that are so contrived as this one. [to explain: IMHO it's really bad style when you hide the most important thoughts of your PoV character and only include misleading ones; it's incredibly implausible that he wouldn't once think about his great big plan during all those times where we witness his thoughts]

Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if there were any characters that I liked or Harry being less OOC. Daphne is particularly horrible. A very unpleasant and bigoted woman, who has nothing going for her except her hotness. She isn't even intelligent, in fact she appears rather dim and ignorant.

Harry seems more like an opportunist and not particularly idealistic: "I have to do these shitty things in order to advance my goals for the greater good" is exactly not what idealism looks like.

Don't take this as an attack. I wanted to read the fic anyway since I've seen it recced plenty of times before. I see how this Harry is extremely competent and proactive, but it's not really what I was thinking off. Rather the opposite. At the least it was well written and didn't feel like a chore to read.

I have to address one thing though

#+begin_quote
  it legitimizes both sides of the blood purity argument
#+end_quote

EXCUSE ME?! How? Daphne didn't raise a single good point that wasn't just racist and bigoted bullshit. Maybe I've missed something. Please enlighten me. Even Harry (who's really afraid to challenge her) admitted to himself that she is wrong about everything after their "big fight", in which he basically cowed to her in order to not mess up his big plans.

The blood purists are proud to sell their daughters in marriage and there's not a single good point made why this should be acceptable ("it's a good business arrangement" doesn't count). I'm supremely disappointed that the whole Marriage Contract thing was swept under the rug. Since this was a thread about "idealistic Harry" I expected him to try to do something about the legality of these things.

I also didn't really understand why Astoria is happy to keep up their obligation to the Malfoys (even though they have been exposed as Death Eaters and should be at their lowest point in terms of influence and importance) yet Daphne is super mad that she has to marry Harry Potter who is one of the most influential and respected people in their society. Who cares about the stupid defunct Potter Mines at this point?! Me no get it.

**** With FFnet being spotty while I'm writing this comment, I apologize for anything I misremember because I can't go find quotes. It's been a while since I read the story. However, from what I do remember:

#+begin_quote
  "gotcha"
#+end_quote

I didn't feel that the story was a "gotcha" because it's foreshadowed the whole way that he's up to something. Harry's thoughts are intentionally hidden sure, but plenty of the people around him remarked on his strange behavior and telegraphed (in my opinion) that the situation was way more than it seemed.

Daphne being unlikable also points toward this, more on that lower in the comment.

#+begin_quote
  not particularly idealistic
#+end_quote

I marked Harry as idealistic because he still thinks he can make a difference from the inside. That's a heck of a lot of hope given everything the Ministry has done to him and didn't do during the wars. Nearly all stories where he attempts to change the Ministry he decides it's easier just to burn it to the ground. See /The Sum of Their Parts/. If the story was about Harry at the Ministry as opposed to Harry manipulating Daphne, I think you'd see more of him being a social warrior.

Also, he's willing to listen to Daphne at all on the topic of blood purity given his history.

#+begin_quote
  blood purity
#+end_quote

I absolutely think being afraid of muggles taking the magic out of magic is legitimate. She and other pure-bloods are allowed to dislike the impact an outside culture is having on her own and it's actually a sensible reason to prefer wizard ancestry, rather than the usual "blood must be pure because purity" argument. Recognizing legitimacy isn't the same thing as agreement.

#+begin_quote
  Astoria
#+end_quote

Astoria is included to show a normal pureblood daughter's reaction to their culture and to foil Daphne. If Daphne wasn't an aberration, presented her arguments in reasonable fashion, and wasn't shallow as a kiddie pool, the story is much different. Instead, the story is about Harry holding her strings and, because she's unlikable, this is fine with the reader.

And so we get to reason I think the story is good: Harry's use of Daphne is a microcosm of how Harry is changing the Ministry. The story is not about Harry and Daphne, it's a character piece about Harry and how he's gaining power in the face of pure-blood control. And I think it accomplishes that goal extremely well.

Sure, there was some foreshadowing, but the kind of artificial contrivance to make the 'surprise' possible really pisses me off. Why did Harry lie to Hermione about the contract? He only lies to her so that the author can pull the wool over the readers eyes, making them think that Harry just wants to bone Daphne and of course Hermione wouldn't approve of such a blackmailing scheme. In reality though, there's no reason to lie to her, she can keep a secret and having her in the known could actually help him with the press. She would probably approve of his plans, but he has to lie to her so that the reader is mislead. Completely pointless and insulting drama! (Apropos pointless, why was the one-shot story "The Flickering Man" included in this fic?)

Sorry for being crass, but it's completely ridiculous:

a) There's plenty of new-age woo in the muggle world. Plenty of desperate people who want to believe all kind of mystical/magical/supernatural bullshit. And magic doesn't even exist as opposed to the HP world!

On the other side of the divide Daphne can't even recognize a car, she's completely ignorant of Muggle society and their relationship to "magic", yet has the gall to make some kind of judgment. Maybe she should read a book about the Arthurian legend or LOTR or any book at all instead of just making stuff up that fits her bigoted ideology.

b) You do know that Wizards obliviate the fuck out of all muggles who discover magic no? I mean, this isn't even a "what if" scenario: Before the statute of secrecy and the invention of the obliviation spell Muggles were perfectly fine with magic and everyone believed in it. The "outside culture" is of the Wizards' own making (whether or not there's a good reason for it) and it's absolutely retarded to blame the Muggles for something that you did to them. Holy shit this makes me mad!

It's also the height of bigotry to look down on what amounts to disabled people, just because you have an ability that they lack and have zero access to. Just replace "muggles" with "deaf people" ("they just have no appreciation for sound!111") under the added proviso that there's also a squad of hearing people running around cutting off deaf people's ears whenever some of them spontaneously start to hear something. "Man look at those stupid deaf people, they are just too different from us. They can't even listen to music. They are practically worthless!"

This actually made me furious when reading. Absolutely abhorrent and I'm a bit shocked that you fell for such an obvious rhetorical ploy with no merit.

Which is completely lead ad absurdum by the fact that he continues to date her. The story would be much better if he actually dropped her at the end, because she's terrible and doesn't even have the decency to respect War Heroes, calling them 'blood traitors' instead. She also sees nothing wrong with basically yelling "Heil Hitler!" in front of a half-Jew and dissident, whose parents have been gassed. My contempt for this character knows truly no bounds and I can't respect Harry at all if he continues to associate with her. Your argument and the fic makes the false assumption that he couldn't achieve his goals without her (he seems to have done fine so far, so why?) and also implies that there's no downsides to his actions: In a country that has a history of bigotry and planned genocide it can't be a good message to the public that being a racist and a bigot is now cool again, as long as you are of some use to the Hero and don't stand in his way. Placating literal Nazis never works. Daphne can't even shake hands with Hermione and almost destroys the picture of Harry's parents because she hates them so much!!!

I'm a little bit impressed by the author, coming up with so many examples of how terrible she is and that there's zero intend to change. Usually authors of Haphne fics try to give her some kind of merit.

****** Well, I won't continue the discussion because neither of us is going to change the other's mind, but I do want to point out something factually wrong within your post:

******* Well obviously that was poorly worded by me. Please allow me to try again: Daphne's argument seemed to be about their ignorance and unwillingness to embrace magic.

Not that I would ever endorse witch burnings, but it seems quite sensible to me to be afraid of Wizards and Witches as a Muggle, considering the casual disregard and complete control Wizards like to employ. Don't you think the witch burnings would be a bit more... understandable... if magic is real?

As long as there is no strong cultural values and consensus against abusing magic (both societal and legal consequences [*]) Wizards are not yet ready to live freely among muggles, not the other way around. HP ends with Ron confunding a muggle to get his driver license and he's one of the *enlightened heroes*. They have a long way to go and I can't imagine how bad it must have been in medieval times

[*] Compare for example with teachers hitting children, which used to be fine. Now it is not only illegal, but also repugnant and "wrong". It is simply not done in civilised society.

*** That was a pretty thoughtful analysis. I haven't looked at it this way before and you may be correct: Character driven stories tend to be more optimistic and idealistic but they guide the focus of a fic in a different direction than I may be looking for.

**** We don't need to have irreversible magic to make people think harder and better. If we go the route where we neither murder all our enemies, nor talk it out with them in some Dumbledorean 'second chances' foolishness, we can go with something far more realistic, imprisonment, and not the Azkaban kind, because let's be honest, most analysis would agree that Azkaban is not nearly secure enough for wizards. Instead, let's consider prison more along the lines of encryption, puzzle locks, traps, and isolation.

If we consider the part of encryption regarding encoding information so that only allowed parties can access it, we can say that prisons are protected by magic that has been encoded so that even if you were to encounter the magic behind the prison, in order to actually deal with it, you would need to decrypt the magic first to even begin to break the prison.

Then comes the second part, where even without the decryption, a complex puzzle of magic is required to be solved. But then you might wonder about brute force, or targeting weak points. While the prison will still need some level of fortifications, if the prison is isolated, such as dimensionally, or in such locations where access is difficult, it adds another layer of protection. Cleverly designed traps can add the final level of protection.

** The idealistic!Harry fics I have tend to be of the "deals with his messed up life using humor" variety. linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has a relentlessly optimistic Harry even when everyone else seems more or less either the same or more miserable (also gets kudos for an in character mentor Snape). linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) is interesting because it uses a lot of the usual overpowered!Harry (and overpowered!everybody) tropes while still having him keep the optimism of the first few books.
