Hufflepuffs are very underused in canon, but I can't imagine a house with those traits would just take it lying down when Cedric is killed. Perhaps Umbridge makes the mistake of mentioning him. Perhaps the Daily Prophet is dismissive after the fact.


** "Harry." Susan Bones said in a grave tone as the train started rumbling out of King's Cross. "Do I have your word that it was You-Know-Who?"

"Yes." He sighed out. "It was him. Voldemort."

Susan didn't flinch. She merely stood up straighter and nodded at Harry. "I see. Thank you Harry. For bringing Cedric back." She said. Turning abruptly, she walked out of the compartment and slid the door closed behind her.

"Well, at least the 'Puffs believe us." Ron said with a cheerful voice. "That's 25 percent of the school on our side at least."

--------------

"Hannah. The lie detector didn't go off. Harry was telling the truth." Susan said as she traipsed around Badgerside, one of the train's carriages almost exclusively occupied by Hufflepuffs and their closest friends.

"So he /is/ back then." Hannah said with a grimace. "What's the plan?"

"The same one House Hufflepuff has been preparing for 15 years Hannah." Susan said flatly. "Contingency Red."

--------------

In Hufflepuff house, since 1979, an average of around 30 students graduate from Hogwarts every year. Of those 30, 5 end up going on to work in magical businesses, another 5 return to the muggle world to finish their education and carve a path outside of the strictures of a pureblood-centric society, 10 end up working for the Ministry and the remaining 10 go on to do farther education and research elsewhere.

By contrast, in 1949, that number was closer to 100.

All graduates benefit from the patronage of former Hufflepuff alumni-money, connections, referrals, lodging, training, assistance, it would all be provided to a struggling alumni as needed. In exchange, there are expectations that the beneficiaries would have to meet once they had established themselves. Those expectations are:

-To pass it forward.

-To help when Hufflepuff calls for it.

Since the mid-1980's, the main form of 'help' the Hufflepuffs were expected to provide were outlined in Case Green, a post-war recovery plan written by Edgar Bones prior to his death and farther expanded upon by the various Hufflepuffs who had made strategic planning their main career.

Case Green told the Hufflepuffs which Ministry Departments to focus on staffing with graduates, which magical and non-magical markets to gain stakes in and generally what places to staff with people so that they, as a collective, can push to implement courses of action without the possibility of outside disruption.

The goal was to eradicate the possibility of a second War from recurring. The means by which that would be possible required a coordinated soft take-over of the lower echelons to push the Ministry out of the hands of former or suspected Death Eaters and into the hands of more progressive and forward-looking minds.

The expected timeline for completing this strategy was around the 40 to 50 year mark. That left a lot of possible outcomes open.

Those outcomes came in the shape of Contingencies. There were three of them-Contingency Green, where Hufflepuffs manage to beat the deadline by a significant margin and reforms could start to be pushed, was unlikely but intensely desirable. Contingency Yellow was a set of plans meant to put Case Green back on track after a disaster.

Contingency Red was the worst case scenario-Case Green was impossible to complete because a new Dark Lord had risen... Or an older one had returned.

The only details surrounding the response protocols set up for Contingency Red were simple:

General Mobilization. Divert all available assets towards fighting enemy. Hold nothing back.

"This is the Wizarding Wireless Network, reporting to you live from Hogsmeade. I am Arthur Kimball with our top story today-Harry Potter, purported liar and Tri-Wizard Tournament Winner, was actually telling the truth. This was verified at around 10:00 hours this morning on the train to Hogwarts. Case Green is no longer in effect. I repeat, Case Green is no longer in effect. Contingency Red has been activated. And now over to the weather."

MARCH OF THE HUFFLEPUFFS-Hogwarts students and alumni side with Potter, declare War on Death Eaters everywhere.

MYSTERIOUS FIRES, EXPLOSIONS ERUPT IN KNOCKTURN ALLEY- have the crime syndicates gone too far this time?

MALFOY ESTATE VANDALISED! Pro-Black sympathiser to blame, matriarch says.

AZKABAN BURNS! Survivors yet to be found.

--------------

"This is your daily briefing from the Wizarding Wireless Network-Dolores Umbridge, former Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, was found dead underneath a Dark Mark this morning. Knockturn Alley fire now enters its fourth week as crews struggle to contain the underground blaze before it can reach muggle London's sluice gates. And Cornelius Fudge has announced that he has asked the Wizemgamot to consider holding elections for a new Minister of Magic. In other news, the Hogwarts expatriates' association and the Dark Forces Defence League have issued a joint statement of support for the DMLE, citing that they had over 600 members on standby should intervention prove necessary."

"And Today in your daily brief- Wizarding England once again in the news with a terrorist attack leaving 15 dead and a further 10 wounded overnight. In response, the Dark Forces Defence League has promised a 'strong response' over the course of the weekend.

Now onto transportation news with Badger Heavy Industries announcing that, after successfully passing its test trials in 1979, the B-52M Arclight Cargo Aircraft has finally begun being shipped to interested parties after updating the enchantments. Apologising for the 16 year delay, the CEO cited weak investor interest and a lack of paying customers for the aircraft to be worth producing for a magical clientele. However, citing a growing export and import-centric trade environment world-wide, the BHI board has gone ahead and decided to trust that their new lend-lease sales model would provide customers with a vehicle that will pay for itself as it goes.

Currently, a single B-52M Arclight Aircraft can hold 32,000 kilos' worth of goods, which equates to all the magical goods produced in Liechtenstein over the course of a week. How the operators take advantage of all that space available will be interesting to see."

** I like the quotation from “[[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter]]” by writerer:

  “Do you know what sound an angry badger makes?” I asked, my voice dripping with malice. The Slytherins quaked in their boots. They didn't respond.

  “No? That's because none who have heard it have lived to tell the tale.”
#+end_quote

Meaning, I completely agree. I have always thought what would happen if Umbridge in her arrogance tried to torture Susan Bones (who with her inherited sense of justice, could quite possibly say something). One option is that Amelia Bones and DMLE get involved, but other way is that Dolores Umbridge would suddenly disappear, and nobody (especially no Hufflepuff) would know where she is. Something like an involvement of Molly's cousin (“Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin by ZebJeb” linkffn(13502309))?
