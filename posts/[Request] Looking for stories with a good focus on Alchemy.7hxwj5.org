Basically looking for decent length fics that have either Harry or another MC using or learning Alchemy, this can be alchemy of the authors creation or taken from other sources


** linkffn(8670912) Its a series, Alchemy only enters really at the second book, though its quite entertaining when it does. The series is in Hiatus untill the author finishes his Naruto story, which he constantly updates.

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

** Snape starts learning alchemy in linkffn(the peace not promised) and the story follows his progress. It's not the focus of the story though.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** Placeholder: I'm looking for a story I read so I can recommend it to you. Harry figures out how to use runes to distill things down into their most basic form, essences... It's not exactly alchemy I guess, but it achieves what Alchemy tries to promise; to a point.

It's probably called something like RuneMaster Harry but its escaping me

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.

** Alchemy takes a main role in linkao3(1049966), but the story is also Drarry with romance as another main focus. The alchemy is all about symbolism and its use follows the arc of the story + the romance.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
