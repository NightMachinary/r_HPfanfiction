Hi, I hope I'm not being redundant but somehow I can't seem to find gen fics about the marauders. I mean stories about their youth and upbringing and their time at school and such that are in character and in universe. Has anybody for example written a fic about what happened between the inter-related pure blood families when two children of the already quite diminished Black family decided to become "blood traitors"? When I read the books I believe to have glimpsed a quantum of real affection between Bellatrix and Narcissa and Sirius didn't seem happy either on their first day to school when James badmouthed Slytherin. Did their families just turn their backs on their children/siblings like that? What made Sirius identify himself so much with his unexpected house? And where did the grandparents generation go? They couldn't have all been killed or died a natural death by the time of the HP books, could they? They must have been about 60 to 70 which is not that old (since Sirius and Remus were in their mid-thirties). The Potter grandparents seemed to have played a rather large role in the lives of James and Sirius, but were only mentioned once I think, isn't that just a little bit strange if they had died before their son was 21 (so they must have been really young?)?

I know there are some amazing Sirius/Remus stories out there but ever since it became clear that Sirius and James were much closer and it seemed more and more like Sirius/James and Remus weren't even as close as Harry and Neville, which is not terribly close, I find it difficult to read them...

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it. (Fifth year COMPLETE.)
