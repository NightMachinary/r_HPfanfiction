  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

**** Strong disagree! I hated this fic! The plot is admittedly pretty great but the writing is terrible. It's all written stream of consciousness and the author clearly had no plan for where it was going. I kept thinking it would get better due to all the good reviews and it never did. It was a huge disappointment. Also, a tiny annoyance, but it's rated M just for kissing.

***** I find that fascinating. The vast majority of people I have encountered have fully enjoyed the story. From what I remember, I loved the conflict he had between wanting to help but also being terrified of making things worse by changing the timeline. I agree that the M rating is a bit much but I did not get the "no plan" vibe from the fic. It was just honestly the only SI that I ever enjoyed.

****** Yeah the plot was good. But I made the mistake of reading the ANs and he says every chapter how he truly doesn't know where the story is going or plan anything - a good example was how he changed the name of the SI from bud to will - so I guess that made it stand out more to me. But also I hated the weird Harry/Will/Hermione love triangle, the unfulfilling and weird plot with daphne and her dad and the Ron bashing.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

  You could ask ten different people who Charles Potter is and why he does know things no one else does. You would get ten diffrent answers, one more unlikely then the other. No one of them knows the truth. He's the twin brother of Harry Potter, one of the boys-who-lived. He's a Slytherin, a genius and more often then not an insufferable asshole. And yes, he's being evil on purpose.
