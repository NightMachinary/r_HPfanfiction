Stories focused on characters as adults, not children or teenagers.

Any Era, anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Would rather not have Harry be insanely powerful or unbelievably smart. A little smarter or powerful then he was in the books is fine, but don't have it be insane levels.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine.

Again I don't want it set at Hogwarts unless the characters are adults. I don't want the main character(s) to be children/teenagers in this.

Would rather it have no character bashing.

Any rating is fine

Can be as canon or as AU as possible or anything in between


** Stuff I read:

Read Grow Young with me

As well as many of Northumbrian's stories, who writes the characters very well (in my opinion) as adults.

And read the majority of Lomonaaeren stories as well that focus on them as adults.

And a couple of other stuff that isn't coming to me right now.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** I have a whole bunch of stories at AO3 with [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione as adults.]] Some are smutty, some are not. Most are one shots, but there are some complete multi-chapters. I currently have one multi-chapter in progress.

** linkffn(3682339). It starts out with the characters right after the books, but the last few chapters are set years later. Even the early chapters deal with the problems of post-school, adult life. Most of the characters make a lot of in-character mistakes, but they are subtle enough that I wouldn't call it bashing, just a sad but realistic possibility.

** [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=330&ageconsent=ok&warning=3]]

Summary: Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in an action-packed battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world that they worked so hard to build.

For me the best Post Hogwarts story, that shows family and a realy well written story. A story that developes and starts with a bit of a angsty thing but not overdone or anything.
