** I'm kinda amazed Azkaban doesn't turn all inmates hair white. Especially if they've been in as long as most the Death Eaters had....but it's possible magic has an effect.

The idea of a grey Padfoot is amusing.

*** *Marie Antoinette syndrome*

Marie Antoinette syndrome is a sudden whitening of the hair. The event that named the syndrome was the observation that the hair of Queen Marie Antoinette of France turned stark white after her capture after the ill-fated Flight to Varennes during the French Revolution. Witnesses have alleged that Antoinette's hair suddenly turned white on three separate occasions. In the novel 'One hundred and One Dalmatians', by Dodie Smith, after the Dalmatians destroy Cruella de Vil's stock of furs, the shock renders her black hair white (and her white hair green).
