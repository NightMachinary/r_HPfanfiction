** I understand the excitement, as it's a wonderful fic, but by now it's been pretty steadily updating at 1 update per week since the start of December (Ch 23 on 12/3, with 11 chapters in 13 weeks). I don't think there's a need for a new post every time it's out ;)

*** Necromancer Harry, being used and abused by everyone. Eventually he will be strong enough to not take their shit.

**** Not... really?

You make it sound like a stereotypical 'edgelord!Harry will make them pay!' fic. On the contrary, the fic doesn't wallow in Harry being abused or feeling bad (though he does go through some dark times), nor does his slow learning process come across as the usual path-to-power plotline.

I'd describe the fic like this:

Harry is kidnapped by a necromancer at age nine and is persuaded to sign an apprenticeship contract. Harry doesn't realize what he is getting himself into, and from then on he struggles to learn more about the unfamiliar world he has been thrust into to keep himself alive.

Unfortunately, Harry's new 'master' has a tendency to only tell his apprentice the bare minimum to get him do do what he wants. Harry is often confused about the roles that are expected of him and has little choice but to rely on unreliable information from untrustworthy people. Harry usually tries to do the 'right thing', but unfortunately he doesn't often get good advice as to what 'the right thing' is.

*** Blood Crest has some moments of surreal humour mixed in, but it's far from being a crack fic.

**** Huh, the first 10 chapters and the author's notes seemed to imply a crack fic. I'll give it another read, though I must admit I did find it a little far-fetched the first time around.

***** It's a somewhat crack-y premise that's treated dead serious. It's got a very melancholy tone, I think.
