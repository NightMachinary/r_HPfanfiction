I am looking for the most cliche-d crossover, like a Harry who is basically a god/ascended to godhood/(can)kills the enemies (for example enemies of his have a -99 ie negative percentage of winning)with a thought, gets a harem, shares his life story at the start with no problems (figuratively), becomes the leader of whatever group of people he is with......so on and so forth.

Harem isn't really necessary but like I said I'm going for a festival of cliches so......why not eh? However godlike is necessary so is him being accepted in the group of people he ends up being with with no suspicions (just another guy from another dimension/universe nothing to look here for people, move on with your lives.)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/Tricksters-and-Gods][Tricksters and Gods]] by sakurademonalchemist might be your cup of tea. Considering Harry is Loki in his past life. Thus by default, a (demi-)â€˜god'. Plus the amusing cliches.

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

  For two wizards thrown out of their own world and into another Earth populated by superheroes and gods, it looks to be a treacherous ride as they attempt to return home again. But when has the impossible ever stopped Hermione Granger and Harry Potter?
