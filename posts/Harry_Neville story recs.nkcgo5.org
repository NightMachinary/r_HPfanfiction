I feel like an underrated ship is Harry/Neville so there are barley any good stories for them. I would love some good recommendations for stories!


** You're right, there don't seem to be many proper Harry/Neville ffs.

There's Hecateslover's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243985/14/Forbidden-A-Tale-of-Four-Friends][Forbidden: A Tale of Four Friends]] and its [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6633524/1/Forbidden-Four-Fates][abandoned sequel]] with a Ravenclaw Harry , but be prepared for the bdsm and the uncomfortably underaged relationship (but I liked the story overall and you can skip over the intimate parts if you want to....)

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13434645/1/The-Bloke-Harry-Definitely-Doesn-t-Fancy][this short post-Hogwarts-Battle fic]] by Lomonaaeren which I quite enjoyed, but other than that, I haven't come across anything good.

Although, I really like Neville/Hermione, Neville/Ginny and Neville/Draco (and once, Neville/Hermione/Draco) so I haven't been /too/ disappointed
