What fanon ideas are ingrained in your head, you thought it was canon?

For example, I thought it was canon that Unspeakable Croaker's name was Algernon (though fanon that he is Neville's Uncle Algie). Turns out his first name is apparently Saul.


** Wards, warming charms, and cooling charms. They're EVERYWHERE in fanfiction and I totally did not know they weren't canon until people in this sub pointed it out. They make so much sense and fit right into canon in my head.

Also James Potter's parents being named Charlus and Doreah. Totally thought that was canon.

I used to be a big fan of the warming charm, feeling like it fit into canon magic nicely. Now, however, I'm of the opposite view.

One thing I've been paying attention to recently is that HP magic often achieves something by less than direct means. So, for example, there isn't a "fire extinguishing charm". Rather if a wizard wants to put out a fire, he'll conjure water. Similarly, you can use magic to help you cook e.g. by chopping ingredients, but you can't use it to just make a finished meal appear out of raw ingredients (though hmm, that gives me a cool idea of wizarding chefs who are experts at transfiguring ingredients directly into a finished meal).

Another feature of canon magic is that it often works through a physical medium rather than something that would look like sci-fi. So, for example, we don't really see any kind of "illusion charm" in canon in the sense of a kind of hologram. Rather wizards seem to just use transfiguration to change the actual physical properties of the object.

If we apply this to the idea of a warming charm, then, wizards won't use magic to heat things directly but rather they use magic to make fire and heat things with that. We see this all through canon: they use kettles rather than using magic to make water instantly boil, and Hogwarts is lit by torches and heated by fires.

**** Both Dumbledore and Hermione use a "hot air" charm canonically. Dumbledore at the Horcrux cave to dry robes, and Hermione during fifth year to dry her robes, which is similar to what you were saying about putting out a fire with a water spell. The robes don't just become dry, they become dry as a result of hot air being applied.

Since Molly put the soup on the stove before levitating it over to pour out a bowl for Harry, I'd take it as the flames of the stove working with some enchantment to restore the soup to an earlier state.

** Wards, for a specific reason.

We see wards in canon. They're just not called that. Muggle repelling charm, it's cast over an entire area, not just on an object (see Hogwarts, QWC stadium). Making something unplottable. Fidelius charm. Caterwauling charm is applied to a perimeter and gets triggered. Anti-intruder jinx, anti-apparition jinx, making something imperturbable. These are all things that have fallen under /wards/ in fanon, and while fanon has certainly added some to the list that don't actually exist in canon, because of that I can't quite say that /wards/ aren't canon as a concept. The word referring to spells of that type/use just isn't canon, and the fandom creations to go along with it aren't.

*** The problem with "wards" is the implication that they're a unified discipline separate from other branches of magic. But we know, for example, that the spell stopping people disapparating in a jinx, whereas the spell repelling Muggles is a charm. They likely have a quite different magical basis. We also know they're cast in the same way other spells are cast. No rune stones or anything like that. Just wands and incantations.

***** They, as far as I can remember, never called him a freak. Petunia called Lily that, one time. But I agree most things we read about about the Dursleys treatment of him in HPatPS is abuse. They keep food from him as punishment and lock him in his room/cupboard(and the fact that he had to sleep in a cupboard is fucked up and I'm sure wasn't thought through very well by JKR).

I'd disagree with Harry 'being turned into a slave' though. He has chores while Dudley doesn't but that's unfairness at worst. Let's make a tally of them. First year his chores include cooking breakfast, which is a perfectly ok chore for an 11 year old IMO. I did that at 8. (And I think he had to do the laundry but I'd have to look it up.) As far as I remember, that was all. Second year there was this huge wad of chores he had to complete in a day(weeding, painting the garden bench, cleaning the house, etc) while Petunia prepared a feast for Vernon's accociates. That was too much, certainly, but it was a one time event. After which I can't remember him doing anything for the Dursleys at all. I think he was made to cook a few more times and carry Aunt Marges tunk into the house but nothing more. And please do correct me if I'm wrong because it's been a while since I read the books.

***** This is fanon (perhaps inspired by the movies?). There is never any moment where Hermione hugs Harry and he freezes, nor is there any moment where we're told Harry gets his first hug.

I invite you to go through the books and CTRL+F "Hug". You will find the following:

Philosopher's Stone:

- Hermione hugs Harry before he goes into the final chamber. No mention of freezing. No mention that it's his first hug.

Chamber of Secrets:

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry when he returns from the Chamber.

- Dobby hugs Harry when Harry frees him.

Prisoner of Azkaban:

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry at the Leaky Cauldron. Harry is mentioned as being embarrassed but pleased.

- Hagrid hugs Harry when they promise to help him with Buckbeak's hearing.

- Harry is hugged by the whole Quidditch team when they win their second game.

- Harry is hugged by the Quidditch team when they win the cup.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry at Platform 9 3/4 at the end.

Goblet of Fire:

- Hermione hugs Harry and Ron when they make up.

- Dobby hugs Harry when he visits the kitchens.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry during Tri-wizard aftermath. "He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother."

Order of the Phoenix

- Mrs Weasley greets Harry with a hug. Twice.

- Hermione greets Harry with a hug.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry before his trial.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry twice when he goes to school.

- Katie and Alicia hug Harry after Quidditch.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry in thanks for warning them about Mr Weasley.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry at the end of Christmas.

- As does Sirius.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry at the end of the year.

Half-Blood Prince

- Hagrid greets Harry with a hug.

- Team hug after Quidditch.

- Harry hugs Ginny after Quidditch.

- Mrs Weasley hugs Harry after Ron was poisoned.

- Ginny hugs Harry after Quidditch.

- Hermione hugs Harry after Dumbledore's death.

Deathly Hallows

- Hagrid greets Harry with a hug.

- Mrs Weasley greets Harry with a hug.

- Harry hugs Mrs Weasley when she gives him the watch.

- Tonks hugs Harry on his birthday.

- Lupin hugs Harry when he names Harry Teddy's godfather.

- Trio is hugged by the DA when they turn up at Hogwarts.

- Hagrid hugs Harry at the start of the Battle of Hogwarts.

- Entirety of Hogwarts tries to hug Harry after he kills Voldemort.

And that's it. Every instance of the word "hug" in the HP books used in relation to Harry. In not one of them does he freeze. The only emotion stated with regards to hugs is embarrassment in connection with motherly hugs (which surely all teenagers feel), but also that he's secretly pleased by them.

Edit: added a few after searching for "embrace" and "threw" as well.

**** Disillusionment masks the visual appearance like a chameleon, though advanced wizards can make it equal invisibility. The idea of a Notice-Me-Not was to confound the observer into thinking nothing remarkable was there. It was invented in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1328215/1/Echoes][an early fanfic]] [EDIT: from 2003, I checked my research] so that no one would notice Snape's pregnancy.

The closest canon equivalent would be the muggle-repelling charm, though it obviously has an unwanted limitation.

*** Well, actually, that one is canon. There are two ways the word "banish" is used in canon: one to refer to making things fly through the air away from you, the other to make things disappear (in a way that can be retrieved).

It's the same for summoning. People can summon things by making them fly through the air towards you, but also by making things appear instantly from somewhere else. See, for example, Dumbledore at the start of HBP making Madam Rosmerta's mead appear, like it was a conjuration (but it can't actually be a conjuration, because it's branded).

My personal theory is that they're the same spell (i.e. THE summoning charm), just cast in a more advanced way.

**** Considering that /evanesco/ makes stuff outright disappear and is a transfiguration spell whereas /depulso/ is a charm that makes stuff physically accelerate away from you, I highly doubt they ever could be the same spell.

Not to mention the fact that the English names of those spells are merely translations from the Latin names because most people don't know Latin at all, which to my best guess is also the source of the discrepancy between the Latin and the English name. “Evanesco” comes from a Latin word with the same spelling that means “vanish”, which is not a synonym of “banish” at all, so if anything this one would be a “vanishing spell”, not a banishing one.

I was not saying they are the same spell. Vanishing and banishing are distinct. Rather I was saying that banishing, given that it is the opposite of summoning (and therefore presumably a mirror image in effect) likely can make objects go away not just by flying through the air but also by making them apparate to their target location (and thus appear the same as vanishing from the perspective of a bystander). We know that you can summon objects by apparition rather than flight because Dumbledore did it in HBP - the mead surely had to be summoned rather than conjured, because Dumbledore explicitly states that it's Madam Rosmerta's. If Dumbledore had just created it at that moment, it wouldn't be Madam Rosmerta's mead, it would be his. Furthermore, in CoS McGonagall makes a load of biscuits appear out of thin air, which cannot be done by conjuration because of the exceptions to Gamp's law, so they must have been summoned by apparition.

This is not too unusual. Canonically a single spell does not have a single fixed effect but rather the caster can choose to vary the spell's effect.

Examples:

- The caster can choose to make the shield charm block physical objects, or reflect spells rather than block them, or cover large areas, or harm someone who tries to cross it (though that last one is slightly speculative, but circumstantial evidence suggests it is the effect of protego horriblis).

- The conjuration spell is a single spell (inanimatus conjuris) and yet can conjure a wide variety of objects.

- The reparo charm can either be used to return an object to its previous state, but can also be used to combine two previously separate objects.

- The locomotor spell can be used to either move objects, or to stop them from moving, or to animate objects to move under their own power (locomotor trunk vs locomotor mortis vs piertotum locomotor)

In short, spells seem to correspond to broad concepts (the shield spell corresponding to protection, for example) and their effect can vary quite significantly within the bounds of that concept. That magic is conceptual should not at all surprise us given that this is a world where you can cast spells on words (the taboo), job positions (DADA curse) and items of information (the fidelius).

Sometimes the variation in a spell happens without a change to incantation (e.g. use of the shield charm to block physical objects), sometimes it happens via a modification to the incantation (the various forms of locomotor). Sometimes it's blurred: using the shield charm to cover a large area is normally done by a change in incantation (protego totalum), but at the end of DH Harry is able to cast it over a large area simply by saying "protego". This implies that whether or not you need to change the incantation to get a variation in effect likely depends on the caster's ability. More importantly, it strengthens the case that "protego" and "protego totalum" (and other similar variations) are the same spell rather than two separate spells with very similar effect, since you can cast the latter using the incantation of the former.

Turning to summoning, it seems that there is not so great a difference between summoning something by making it fly towards you and making it apparate to your location. Both of them seem to fall nicely within the concept of summoning: they bring an object from a distant location to your present location. It's just the medium of travel which has changed. And if it's true for summoning, why not also banishing? After all, in GoF it says:
