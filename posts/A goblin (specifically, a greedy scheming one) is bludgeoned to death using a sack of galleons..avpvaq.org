I don't know why I crave such a specific scene. I just have this mental image of a wizard getting fed up with a morally-bankrupt Gringotts and their hidden fees and deceptive practices and goes 'if you're so greedy, you can HAVE the money!' and starts using a sack of galleons like a hammer.

Obviously, this won't be found in any fics where Gringotts is guaranteed 100% helpful to the protagonist.

(Also, I get the feeling that beating someone to death with a sack of money is ironic no matter the victim. Greedy goblin, rich wizard, poor wizard, philanthropist, house-elf, someone who's never heard of money...)


** Change it to a sack of knuts, not galleons, he'll have been beaten to death with a knut sack then.

** Jebin looked lazily at the goblin tied over a wooden crate. "Get the vamp" he whispered to his friend.

"The vamp's sleepin'" Gary whispered back.

Turning to his friend Jebin says "I guess you'll just have to wake him up now won't ya?"

The goblin, hearing as sharp as it ever was, began a renewed struggle against his ropes. He was pretty sure what was about to go down.

Gary walked over to the nearby coffin. Picking up the tapping stick, he knocked on the lid a few times. A short time later the lid slid over seemingly of it's own accord. From the coffin rose a pale looking man. "What is it? You know not to wake me up until it's night."

"Well uh... sir." Gary said before gesturing to the bound creature.

The vampire, Dolund, smiled. "Well now, this is worth waking up for." He said as he walked to a small chest on a shelf. Opening chest he withdrew a sack that bounced with clinking of coins.

"I believe, Mr. Killgold, that this is the payment you're owed is it not?" Dolund spoke to the bound goblin as he approached. He gripped the goblins face and jiggled the bag of coins before him. "Well, I suppose it's time that you collect."

Jebin and Gary winced when Dolund reared back and bashed the sack against the goblins face. Once, twice, three times Dolunds arm pulled back only to shoot forward, weighted bag in hand, to beat his captive with vampiric strength."

"Still alive Killgold?" Dolund asked the heavily bleeding but still counsous goblin who could only moan into a gag in reply. "Well, I think the bag has one more left in it."

With a mightly overhead swing, Dolund brought down the bag of gold on the back of Killgold's head. His head popped forward with a crack of bone as the bag exploded and coins flew all over the room.

The vampire looked over his work with a smile before turning to his men. "Clean this up, I'm going back to bed."

** /I'd be hungry if I weren't so scared/, thought Waclaw. He was still except for his head swaying this way and that as he tried to assess the threats. He had come to this room with his friend... his only friend... but that one had been led away by a mole-monkey. Why hadn't he taken Waclaw with him?

Oh, but if he lived to ask such a question, there would be time to phrase it later. Right then, there was still the matter of the bear-monkey and the two mole-monkeys.

One of the moles was casting a glance towards Waclaw every few seconds, while the bear-monkey rumbled on about something--Waclaw couldn't understand what.

The mole-monkeys perched atop false stumps and were barricaded behind a false bolder, or perhaps a false fallen tree. Such contrivances were beyond Waclaw's ken, but he was at least clever enough to know that the perched mole-monkeys were perfectly nimble and capable of coming off their perches and over the boulder to do him harm, if they wished.

The little one cast another glance.

"You are making me nervous, and you must keep your eyes to yourself!" Waclaw gave a fair warning. He may be safe from within his false hollow, but then, monkeys were ever more clever than he, and he may not be.

At his pronouncement, both mole-monkeys turned to him and spake tersely on some unknowable matter. They must have been asking the bear-monkey for the secret to the false hollow, because he immediately opened the thing and drew Waclaw from it. Well, he tried to dodge and escape, but there was no room in the hollow, and even when he thought to defend himself, the bear-monkey was rather too large and sure of himself. Waclaw was caught! For all the good his wariness had done for him.

But the bear-monkey had soothing sounds for Waclaw, and gentle hands. He was allowed to stretch, finally. Ohhhhh, but that is a nice feeling!

Then from his languor he roused all at once! The bear had brought him over to the moles who were peering very closely at him, and seemed clearly intent upon dinner.

"Stay off! Wicked mole-monkey! Bear-monkey, you must return me to my hollow!" Waclaw tried to be reasonable. But, ignoring his urging, the smaller mole prodded at him with a sharp claw!

Well, Waclaw had certainly tried to make friendly, but now he must show his teeth! In an instant he had struck the little mole monkey, and with a great deal of vehemence! The would would probably not amount to much, considering the size of the creature, but perhaps it would not be so bold going forth?

It screamed. That was unexpected. It screamed and screamed and collapsed. The other mole monkey got its nerve up, and snatched Waclaw from the friendly bear monkey. It began digging into poor Waclaw, throttling him and gouging his ribs terribly. Waclaw struck back, of course, but landed no blows and could offer little resistance.

Then a new shout rang out. The friend was back! And he carried with him a mighty weapon! A thousands stones fell over a thousand waterfalls as the hero hefted a great weighty gullet. He swung it around his head thrice, until the clatter of riverstones was muted by the force of his swings, and then he stepped forward and delivered the parcel directly into the ear of the mole monkey. At this, the gullet was rent asunder and the riverstones flew wildly and scattered across the ground. The mole person dropped from the impact, and did not seem to be rising again.

"Are you okay, Waclaw?" asked his friend.

The bear monkey spoke and so did Waclaw, "These creatures are horrible, and I never trusted them. Tell the bear monkey that he is not to bring me forth from my hollow!"

--------------

Harry snapped out of the rage that had held him. Two goblins lay in the foot of the room, and his withdrawal was all around, on the desk and floor.. even some coins had landed in Waclaw's cage.

He whispered reassurances to Waclaw, and heard some in return. His familiar was alright.

"'Arry, I don' s'pose we can keep this ter ourselves? Those two'll be needin' a nice rest after takin' a nip from yer krait 'n a swing o' yer crate."

** Well, the only problem with this is that killing a Goblin might actually be a hate crime... and even if it isn't, I imagine it would absolutely /ruin/ your credit at Gringotts. And it's not like there's anywhere else to do your banking...

*** Using any of the Unforgivables on a goblin isn't even considered a crime (as of 1998), so I doubt there'd be any legal repercussions from the Ministry for beating one to death.

And if you're beating goblins to death with sacks of currency, you're probably past caring about the repercussions from the goblins as well.

*** Eh, they're killing the goblin because he's greedy, not because he's a goblin. That's not a hate crime.

Good luck using Gringotts as a bank afterwards though, might have to transfer your funds to the First National Bank of Your Mattress.

**** The goblin isnt being killed because he's a goblin, the goblin is being killed because he's ridiculously greedy.

Just like how a LGBT or other minority person being murdered isnt because they're a minority, it isnt automatically a hate crime.

**** Oh...yeah. Sorry about that. I was assuming that everyone is familiar with the stereotype in Harry Potter fanfic that has goblins falling over themselves to help Super!Harry claim his inheritance, and the opposite stereotype where they're greedy miserly loophole abusers who make Scrooge look like Uncle Pennybags. Stuff like I remember there being in Starfox5's work, or in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6344731/1/An-Unwise-Conspiracy][An Unwise Conspiracy]], or such.

But yeah, you're right, in a normal setting beating a goblin up for being a goblin would be a hate crime.
