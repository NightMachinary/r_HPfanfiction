so i found this in the reviews at ff.net and was wondering which fanfic does this person mention. (This method seems as bad as Hermione's attempt in protecting her mother during the 6th Harry Potter book and it reminds me of one of the erotic Harry Potter fanfics that I Favorited that basically has the lustful MC of the fic tracked down Hermione's mother, turned her into a porn actress after seducing her and basically waved it at Hermione during a movie in theater and basically used her mother as emotional blackmail to her. Removing her memories didn't change the fact that it would be still pretty easy to track her down and hold her hostage especially in the supernatural world where teleportation is an actual thing and distance means little to them.)


** Sound like tainted desire

Mc is SI as Draco Malfoy.
