Preferably without pranks, stupid nicknames (eg Paddy), Snape redemption or "Dumbledore is always right" narratives.

Pretty light on action in the beginning, but it's so nice to see a logical response to the prophecy (someone's trying to kill my kid? I'm out of here) that you don't mind. A unique approach to a first-war fic. And a not-immature James.

This has well rounded characters that behave realistically. Children that act like children, something that you rarely see in fanfiction. No-one is given idiot ball. There is no overpowered geniuses creating obscure magic left, right and center when plot demands it. It

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

** linkffn(and the wolves all cry) is a one-shot, but rather long and the writing is top-notch. I cry every time I reread it.

  Completely AU. A fierce Lily protects her twins from a meddling Headmaster. This time the adults take action. A different WBWL fic. Good Potters. Powerful Harry and twin. Goes through 4th year. Very minor bashing, kind of, sort of, well read A/N in first chapter. Some romance towards the middle, when the boys are older. OC (Gary Potter)/Susan Bones.
