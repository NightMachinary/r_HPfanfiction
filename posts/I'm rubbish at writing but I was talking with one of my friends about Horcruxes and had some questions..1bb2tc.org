I had originally wanted to post this in [[/r/harrypottertheories]], but I think it's a dead sub. If there's a better place for this, let me know.

What if Dumbledore (and therefore, Harry) never realized that Harry himself was a Horcrux? Or what if Voldemort /did/ realize what had occurred in Godric's Hollow? In either case they wouldn't have been able to kill Voldemort, but does that mean that he wouldn't have died of old age? If he didn't, what would happen when Harry died of old age? Would the final Horcrux be destroyed by Harry's death even if it was by old age or would Voldemort's soul-piece have kept him alive as well?

I've also wondered a couple of times if Harry and crew would have had the nerve to kill innocent PEOPLE who were made into Voldemort's Horcruxes in order to be able to kill Voldemort himself... Does the end of killing Voldemort justify the means of killing the people that are ensuring his life? And what happens when they die? If all of the Horcrux-people had died of old age (assuming Voldemort's soul pieces wouldn't unnaturally expand their lives as well), would Voldemort have died at the same time considering there were no Horcruxes left to keep him alive or would the Horcrux be buried in their bones? Normal cremation wouldn't destroy the bones at which point someone would know something suspicious was going on, though if the bodies were buried instead it could be a LONG time before anybody figured it out. And if he were using random people rather than prominent items, it is possible that nobody would ever figure out exactly who the Horcruxes were.

I'm starting to think that all of these questions are the reasons that Voldemort hadn't used people to store his soul fragments. Too many variables, and it's unlikely that he would want to be the first to determine the answers to the questions.


** Someone else already gave a really good answer, but I'll just tell you that you can post on the [[/r/harrypotter]] as well.

** u/Bulwersator:
#+begin_quote
  would Voldemort have died at the same time considering there were no Horcruxes left to keep him alive or would the Horcrux be buried in their bones
#+end_quote

Or horcrux would be destroyed and Voldie would be again vulnerable to death.

*** I assumed that at least one of his Horcruxes would be young enough to not die naturally until after Voldemort's "time" had come and gone. Would Death have taken him immediately or let him linger even longer when there was nothing to protect him?

** I think that it is interesting to think about. In regards to how everything works Rowling is very good at just glossing over it and moving on, leaving readers to ponder on things such as what the wiki points out.

I would think, that if horcruxes were the only thing keeping him immortal he would have died of old age, but we never know if he did more than that. We know the idea behind horcruxes is very old, and some fanfics have argued that the curse breakers occasionally stumble upon such items in ancient pyramids and temples. It would make sense. However there is no mention of an ancient Pharaoh still lurking about. Does this mean there is none? No.

We know Flamel is ancient but he was never described as being the eldest known wizard, and since we know practically nothing besides the english advancements we can assume some people live longer.

However back to horcruxes. If we are to believe that horcruxes stop you from aging then Voldemort should appear to be around 20 where he made his first horcrux. We know not his age in the books because he is so horribly disfigured, with part of him being serpentlike, but the movies portray him as older. However, we all know the movies lie/tweak repeatedly.

I won't comment on the morality debate apart from this: Harry might not agree to kill an innocent in the beginning but if his friends or family or a large degree of other innocents die, then he would probably act. Also, who says killing the person is the only way to get rid of a horcrux?

That may be true for an object, but remember that living beings are very different. A living being in the potterverse has a soul, and so latching a horcrux onto it would mean that it has 2 souls, meaning a spare one is present.

Also, the enchantments on objects can not be used on a living thing. How can a cell replicate if it is affected by an unbreakable charm? It can't. So logically you can't cast it on a human being. Etc.
