:END:
Hey all! I'm looking for fics where James and/or Lily hear the prophecy and go 'nuh-uh, my kid needs a safer environment to grow up' and then leave England. I remember reading one where they leave to France, stay there until Harry turns 7-8, and return to England only to find out that Harry is the rightful King of Britain (or is it England?) and the other noble houses descend from the Knights of the Round Table. Side Note: If anyone knows which fic this is, please link!

So yeah, I'm looking for fics like this. Preferably no bashing please I'm okay with any pairings, except Harry/Ginny. I can take Harmony as long as it is well written WITHOUT BASHING. Complete fics only for recs please.

Thanks!

Edit: I found the fic! It's [[https://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/the-legacy/][The Legacy]] by Keira Marcos.


** Also, “A Father First, Damn It!” by Madrigal-in-training linkffn(11831304), but that's just a one-shot with this basic idea of Potters running away, because family is more important than any stupid war.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.
