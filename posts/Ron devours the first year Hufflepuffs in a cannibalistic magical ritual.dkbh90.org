Just an amusing thought. The natural progression of Ron the glutton and Ron the death eater taken to their extreme.

Right off the train for their first year feast?

Or in the course of abandoning him during the Horcrux Hunt to travel back in time get back at Harry for getting into the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and revenge on Hermione for siding with Harry and dating Krum.

Or if you prefer a bit of horror to crack feel free to imagine/throw in Scabbers or new pet rat, and taking on (like Voldemort) some ratlike features, mixed with some Skaven beneath Hogwarts or The Rats in the Walls, Lovecraf, where students go missing like Sally Anne Perks to be human cattle, or Dragon Age:Origins style broodmothers for RatSkavenDarkspawn.

K, gotta go get dinner, bye.


** "What are you eating, Ron?" said Hermione.

"Finch," said Ron.

"Weird choice, but okay," said Harry.

...

"What are you eating now?"

"Perks."

"Didn't think you could eat abstract concepts like that."

...

"What are you eating now?"

"MacMillan."

"I'm sorry, what?"

** Warning: I went down the horror route. Use your discretion.

/First day he comes and captures everyone.../

The red-headed boy had an easy, handsome smile that puts Mary Sue at ease. He's a seventh year Gryffindor, and Head Boy to boot, so why wouldn't she trust him to show her a shortcut through the dungeons? She's only a first year, but there was something about him that made her skin crawl.

"E-excuse me, Weasley? Are we nearly at Potions yet? I don't want to be late..." She called forward timidly. Wordlessly, he offered his hand and smiled - head tilted to the side as his eyes glittered in the dark. She hesitated. He frowned.

/Second day he beats us and eats some for meat.../

Mary Sue cringed against a wall. Her body felt as though every inch had been pummeled. It hadn't been the sadistic beating of a bully; there was something professional - clinical - about the way he systematically hit each of the 20 first years in the dungeon for the same amount of time. It was only when rows of shark-like teeth emerged from Weasley's smiling jaw that she /knew./ He wasn't beating them. He was /tenderising/ them...

/Third day the men are all gnawed on again./

She wished that she was numb to the screams. She wished that she couldn't hear Weasley's wet slurping and sucking that filled the silence after the screaming. She wished she couldn't smell the cooking flesh of her housemates on his conjured fire. She really wished that her stomach would /stop rumbling!/ But most of all? She wished she had never come to Hogwarts.

/Fourth day we wait and fear our fate.../

Weasley's skin looked sickly and pale under the bluebell torches. His eyes had sunk into the shadows of his sockets and turned black as oblivion. His limbs had elongated into lupine back legs and unnatural long arms that ended in claws that looked more like scythes than anything in nature.

Occasionally he paced the dungeon and lectured the remaining first years about how /clever/ he was. He would allow Harry and You-Know-Who to destroy each other and then /he,/ Father, would emerge with his army of darkspawn and unite all mankind under his rule. It would not matter who had magic, or money, or in what degree. Was he not kind? Was he not gracious?!

Mary Sue felt a claw gently tilt her head up to look into the abyss where Ron Weasley had once had kind brown eyes.

"Tell me, Pretty One: Would you like to be my first Broodmother?" He hissed in a mockery of seductive tones, ignoring the tears rolling down her cheeks.

She wanted her Mummy.

Notes: Aaand that's as far as I'm going folks! There are 4 more days in the poem, but I am not going there with a first year. My thanks to the writers of Dragon Age: Origins, all credit to them for the modified version of Hespith's Poem and the concept of darkspawn. Now I'm going to go and have a shower and think about what I've done.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
