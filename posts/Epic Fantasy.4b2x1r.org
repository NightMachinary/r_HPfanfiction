I am looking for Big and Epic, but not corny/cheesy, Fantasy Fanfics.

I love the Hero Trilogy, Emperor is good, Rise of the Wizards, Too Young to Die and Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise are all ones I've read and enjoyed. (Links Bellow if you have not read them and are interested.)

Wastelands of Time and the Firebird Trilogy are on my to read list, but I am looking for more large scale Fantasy flaired fics.

Alt Dimensions are fine, AU is encouraged but not a necessity. Time Travel is fine. Any rating level, Slash is okay. Would prefer if Snape is fairly close to canon i.e. an arsehole who does end up doing to the right thing.

And yeah that's about it, thanks.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
