Today would have been my grandpa's birthday, and I'm having some troubles not crying. Normally I take today off work and dig in the garden, but the weather isn't cooperating this year. Does anyone have any really deep family bonds mentor!Snape? Daddy!Snape is ok too. My dad traveled the country working so I was raised by my grandpa, and when he passed away my boss flubbed the paperwork saying my dad died instead so I could have the time off I needed instead of just one dad for the funeral.

A nice thing about whinging on the internet is being able to say stuff like thanks for listening, or thanks for letting me vent and you feel a bit of closure when in all actuality no one was listening at all. They just scrolled on by.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** I hope things start looking up for you soon. You are not alone in finding grief overwhelming. This is one of my favourite pieces of writing on the subject:\\
'After departure, only invisible things are left, perhaps the life of the world is held together by invisible chains of memory and loss and love.' (James Baldwin) And this is one of my favourite fics and always makes me feel better: linkao3(The Meaning of Mistletoe by Endrina)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
