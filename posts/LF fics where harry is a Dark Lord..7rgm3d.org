I'm looking for fics where Harry becomes a dark lord due to something tragic happening to him (without teaming up with Voldemort) and both the dark side and light side have to team up to defeat him. No slash please.


** linkao3(6334630) - after the war Harry gets fed up with politics and decides that the only way to actually change anything is to become a dark lord. He's a dark lord in name more than in deeds (although he does a lot of questionable things). It's not quite what you're looking for but it's my favourite Dark Lord Harry fic, very well written and original.

Edit: ff bot doesn't seem to be working so I meant [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247][The Sum of Their Parts]] by holdmybeer. It's rated M, mostly for violence, and has no shipping of any sort.

** linkffn(Paid in Blood) Altough, the "light" side doesn't team up with the dark side against him, he just obliterates them.

#+begin_quote
  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.
