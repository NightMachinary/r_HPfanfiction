  Harry Potter wasn't really a wizard at all. He had self-taught himself how to pick the lock of his cupboard under the stairs in his Uncle's house in Privet Drive using a couple of paperclips lying on the cupboard floor, so one day whilst the Dursleys were out he left his cupboard and went looking through Dudley's stuff and found a strip of LSD tabs and a box full of cannabis brownies. Not knowing what they were having such a sheltered life, he ate them all in one go. The books tell the adventures he had in his own mind as he tripped and hallucinated his skinny arse off.

  Eventually the drugs wore off and Harry wakes up shaking in a pool of vomit still in his cupboard under the stairs, only now he has PTSD from such a frightening LSD trip and Dudley has also beaten him up for going through his stuff. Every day after that Harry received taunting from all the Dursleys who tell him they arrived home while he was still tripping and listened to him screaming and pleading for help as he hallucinated about evil creatures and wizards trying to kill him. Harry eventually had enough and found a bridge to jump off of (and because magic doesn't actually exist, no flying car came to save him).

  The Dursley's were so miserable they wouldn't pay for a funeral for him which meant he got a state funded funeral. They went to his funeral but only so they could get a free lunch afterwards. The Dursleys' secret was they went to lots of funerals even people they didn't know so they could get free lunches. Vernon Dursley, who still had bits of his breakfast stuck in his moustache, gave a speech to the 7 or so people who attended Harry's funeral. He told them all Harry had a big sexual fetish for eating his own poop and his nickname was "the boy who ate poop", even though it wasn't actually true and everyone there believed him and the minister shook his head in disgust. Dudley Dursley had eaten a cannabis brownie just before Harry's funeral and laughed his chubby face off through the entire ceremony and ate more than his even chubbier father at the lunch afterwards.

  Afterwards, Dudley and chums destroy Harry's tombstone with a sledgehammer, used a knife to scrawl "the boy who ate poop" on the piece of the tombstone that remained and peed all over his grave and Vernon gets the cupboard under the stairs fumigated to get rid of all the "Harry germs" that were in there. The end.
