:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was likely on ffn, harry created gems or crystals for gringots. They were amazed because he could make them with more surfaces or angles than any goblin could cut. It's been a few years and I can't remember anything else. Any info would be appreciated.


** Ugh I know this fic but not the name. He was making them with runes on them I believe

** It's not runemaster because I just read it, which is what reminded me of the one I'm looking for lol. Im think it is core threads because I'm reading it now and it seems vaguely familiar.
