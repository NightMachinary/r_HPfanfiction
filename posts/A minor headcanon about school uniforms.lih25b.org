Having attended a school with uniforms, there were only two suppliers in the whole town we could purchase from. They both used the same fabric and style. This was to ensure that no student had fancier uniforms than anyone else. But I recently learned that some schools allow students to get their uniforms from anywhere they can afford- some kids could have name brand luxury uniforms, while others might have sewed them at home with an approved pattern.

Hogwarts (and the wizarding world) are not keen on regulations. I imagine that most students go to Madame Malkins because she's right there in Diagon Alley, but they have a choice in the quality of fabric used in their uniforms.

This allows the upper class students to show off their wealth. Their uniforms are better cloth and are more tailored to fit. They might have special enchantments to keep them warm or prevent stains. Or fabric that extends a little over time to keep up with their growth. Then you have kids like Ron with hand-me-down robes.

Just a thought!


** I always imagined that the uniforms are not as depicted in movies but just like a plain black robe and they'd also have a pointy hat. Underneath those people wore whatever they wanted or nothing at all considering that Snape's underpants are revealed when James turns him upside down.

*** The supplies list in the first letter specifies only 3 sets of plain robes and a pointy hat. I tried to look up the exact wording to see if there was anything about the robes having house patches added, or if the house ties are even in the books, but can't find my copy of Philosopher's Stone. (Of course, out of seven books, the one I want to reference is the one on walkabout.)

What is canon is that not everybody wears trousers under their robes. Fanon often has this as a traditional robes, with nothing underneath, versus modern robes over clothes. This is the only reason that makes sense (to me) for girls and boys to have to give each other privacy on the train to change.

**** Yep, I don't think ties or house patches are ever mentioned in the books. In CoS Harry and Ron get confused about what house a student is in. They ask for the Slytherin house password, but she was a Ravenclaw.

For fun I'm writing up a complete school dress code for students.

***** In the movies, the first-years are all wearing plain black ties. Their house ties and scarves are with their trunks when they get to their dorms the first night.

In some fanfictions, the black ties and a generic Hogwarts badge on the robes all update overnight; sometimes through a charm and sometimes by the house elves.

** I was about the disagree with this... then i remembered that i always got my School uniform from a tailor while some of my classmates had to settle for cheaper supermarket brand shirts/blazers/trousers.

In fact the only part of our uniform that had to by identical was our tie, which all local clothes stores stocked for new term.

I'm now wondering just how much money my guardians spent on that damn uniform that i hated.

** At my school we even had a few students wearing their fathers uniform. Back then it was proper wool so we were all jealous of them in the winter when it was frigid.

And yeah, we also had a few kids get their uniform tailored as well.

*** It's a good thing the uniform style was the same, then. It must have been nice quality wool, or well taken care of to last all those years. A lot of "wool" I've found is a polyester blend, and it's no good for cold weather :(

**** Uniform style hasn't changed... school still seperates the boys from the men via uniform. Third and forth form wear shorts and knee high socks and seniors wear long pants and a blazer.

Bloody victorians I guess...

** I can agree, I also wore schools uniforms between the ages of 4 - 17 years of age. My high school had 1 supplier, BUT! There was a mom & pop run business that was able to buy the same fabric and sew the same patterns.\\
Really sucked when the mom & pop shop folded because the kids didn't understand the business.

On the other hand, imagining that everything in the magic world was hand-produced, maybe Hogwarts had more regulations about robes than not.

As for tailoring, yeah, maybe the richer families would have pre-installed tailoring spells, but assuming the kids grow, I could see it being a mandatory thing and maybe overlong usage, it wears out.

I can compare this to my own classmate ("N") and I, who was a single child. N stole my brand new uniform skirt in 7th grade.\\
I knew right away that the one remaining skirt in the lockers was not mine because the fabric was worn and fuzzy. N inherited her skirts from her older sisters and you could tell from the wear. (And that's the end of that story unless you'd like to hear about how I reclaimed my skirt by vomiting on her, which was an accident but after taking it home to be washed I wasn't going to return a skirt with my name written all over every single seam. Her mom and gma are bitches too because they had to let out the belt and zipper because she was larger and taller than I was.)

*** The thievery of my skirt brings back a lot of feelings, especially as I had sensory issues as a child and I could just TELL that skirt wasn't mine. I even put it on for the teacher to show that it was way too big because it didn't even stay on my waist.

Fucking thieves man

**** It's not uncommon at all. There are some parents at our school who try the 'oh just let me look through the lost property box and I'll recognise it' and then try and take anything that is not named (or even if it is named somewhere easy to cover or cut off the tags). That's why we've had to put ours well away and only return items that are named. Anything else gets handed to the first aid office to use when a child needs a spare set of clothes (they're supposed to come back (washed), but only about 10% ever does).

***** We were in track together, so our parents saw each other every weekend on top of this. I was also one of two families with the same last name, except the other family had only boys, so literally, just me with that name written in bold fabric marker along the seams.

But I could only imagine the possibilities of chaos since robes seem very unisex. Unisex uniforms, save for the underneath clothes. I think it would be very obvious to see the fabric difference between new and old robes. Maybe even just between the Weasley sons, and then their shorter, first year sister who maybe got second hand robes from a shop and not just her older brothers. Even hems not being as crisp, the opportunities for mildly frayed edges, or loose, unstarched creases.

** My high school uniform was only sold at one chain (2 locations) and they were pricey. All the shirts sweaters and blazers had logos embroidered on them. But a few girls I knew when they outgrew their stuff, just cut out the logo and sewed in onto generic clothing (white polos and navy cardigans are easy to find). There was nothing the school could do, but they fumed over it.

Shoes are where the rich and poor showed, they just had to be neutral colors, closed, and no heel.

I think harry mentions wearing his trainers under his robes, so at least there wasn't a required shoe.

** Isn't this canon?

Isn't there a scene somewhere where Draco and his mom go off to another shop (Twilfitt and Tattings, I think?) because Madame Malkins caters to "muggleborns"?

Now granted, Draco was there for his first year robes, so who knows.

My guess is either a Rowlingism, or they're expensive enough even the Malfoys wanted to wait till Draco stopped growing as kids replace clothes FAST when young. :)

** In my high school, uniforms for girls are a white short sleeve shirt and a bright blue pinafore while for boys it's the same shirt with olive green pants.

Girls' uniforms can't really be modified because we have a rule that the skirt can't be above the knees (for modesty) but the two options for acquiring uniforms are either buying them from supermarkets (pinafores that are supermarket-bought are obvious because the skirt will be an A-line skirt with no pleats or ruffles) or getting them tailored made, either by seamstresses or mothers that can sew (like mine).

But boys' uniforms are a lot more customizable as I've seen lots of them having their pants tailored to be more fitted and/or tight. Because you know, the pants from supermarkets are super flared. And our ex headmistress and the head administrator hated the tight pants.

Also, there are specified shoes that you should wear to school. White school shoes. Some people wear white branded shoes to school and the same higher-up teachers were always pissed

** My assumption has always been that while the letter specifies three sets of plain robes the richer students would have more and in different fabrics.

Your basic, bog-standard Hogwarts robe is probably either a heavy cotton, a heavy linen or even a medium weight wool. Natural fibres, warm enough for the winter but with a degree of breathability for the summer. That's what Madam Malkin likely sells as her basic Hogwarts package, minimally tailored and likely with some length in the cuffs and seams so they could be let down by a parent or a house elf. My guess on the cloaks is broadcloth.

Someone like Draco Malfoy might have one set in the bog-standard material but would also have a heavy woolen set for winter and a lighter set (cotton, linen, silk or summer weight wool) for the summer and probably a few in between. His would also likely be better tailored, requiring far more alterations as he grew up. Not done automatically by a spell but done by a person, because that would cost more and therefore would be fancier.

** Possibly, but I think there is more to explore in both uniforms and the casual wear regarding the style as well as the price. Are the students, as they grow older, trying to get away with more risque uniforms/casual wear for when not in class? How are they using clothes to signal belonging to specific groups? Is there a tension between more muggle like and more wizard like fashions? Are kids enchanting their clothes with flashy charms to show off?
