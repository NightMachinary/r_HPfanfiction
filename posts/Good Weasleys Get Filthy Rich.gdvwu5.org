Do they get a really big amount in a lottery draw? A long lost inheritance? Bill getting a huge amount of money from tomb raiding? Getting reparations from the Malfoys?

A wholesome prompt about the Weasleys (who are not being paid by Dumbledore in any way or form, nor stealing from Harry) who become filthy rich. (Like Indy Harry rich, lol).

Richer than all those snobby purebloods who always looked down on them, especially the Malfoys. And despite the new found wealth, they are as kind and generous as ever.

I would love to read a fic that shows the reaction of those snobby purebloods, I can imagine Percy being in charge of the wealth. Arthur still working at the same Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department despite his wealth. Molly with a restaurant of home made food. (No Ron bashing please).

How will this change canon? Or pre-canon? How will it change the relationships of all the characters? Will Malfoy still have the prime minister's ear? Will Percy keep the rat? So many different outcomes!

This is a prompt, but fic recommendations are also accepted!

The riots would spill into Muggle Britain and the non-magical British Government would have to step in to maintain order and next thing you know Her Majesty's Treasury, The Bank of England and the Goblin Nation (through Gringotts) would rehaul the entire currency and economic system and the next thing you know, the Magical Britain is working with Pounds.

** Going by canon, after the war, the Weasleys become very influential within the Ministry. Hermione (Weasley by marriage), Angelina (again, George's wife) and Percy are all senior officials within the ministry. Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, with work from George and Ron, is supposed to have become immensely popular, which implies that the family does get loaded. Ginny becomes a successful Quidditch player which I suppose would include sponsorships, kit deals and everything. I suppose the Death Eaters' and sympathizers like Umbridge's estates are raided and a lot of people end up getting reparations. So, canon Weasleys post-battle are rich and influential.

I haven't read much fanfic, but there is this one dude called Northumbrian who's written stories about Ginny's Quidditch career and George and Ron's efforts in diversifying WWW. So you can check those out. they can be found easily

*** Thanks for the fic recommendation. Yeah, they do become influential, but I'm more interested in how the wealth affects canon.

Just take for instance, how things would have been very different if Ron had a new wand when facing Lockhart in the Chamber of Secrets.

Percy would have probably never taken in scanners as a rat, when there's money to buy any pet of his choice.

Girls would have probably been all over Ron as he searched for a date during the Yule Ball. This could in fact affect the canon pairing.

Maybe Bill and Charlie won't have gone into such dangerous occupations, if there was money.

So many possibilities.

  If the Weasleys were rich, wouldn't they have a house-elf?
#+end_quote

I think Rich Weasleys would have a House Elf. I think their his a line in canon (probably CoS) where Ron says to Harry that his mom would like to have an elf to help her, but they are really expensive. Of course, said Elf would be treated very differently compared to one like Dobby, and would probably be an "help" more than anything else (I don't think Molly would stop doing any household chore, especially cooking even with an elf).

​

#+begin_quote
  Would rich Arthur Weasley still retain his eccentricities and fondness for tinkering with Muggle stuff?
#+end_quote

Since it's more of a passion than anything else, probably. In the case of Arthur, I think that the only "big" difference between a rich one and canon one (outside of think like new robes) would be his job. Would a rich Arthur still work in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department, or would he just leave his job (to have even more time to study muggle stuff)?

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You could even wonder if a Rich Ron would even become friend with Harry? Though I think that, unless really OOC and arrogant/ bullying like Malfoy, they would still become friend.\\
I also think that a Rich Ron would still be worried if Harry never answered his letter, and the twins would still jump at the chance to launch a rescue mission. But since the Weasley are rich, you have the choice between "Ron sends the Elf check on Harry and deal with the problem easily" or "Young kid send a rescue mission and fly his father' car to Privet Drive". I personally prefer the second option, especially since a Rich Arthur may not have modified a Ford Anglia but something a bit more expensive, like a Aaston Martin maybe?

****** It feels like a rich Ron would be taught to ask a house elf for help whenever a task seemed beyond his capabilities. They would have done this just to ensure him and his siblings don't perform too much underage magic. If Ron was brought up in this manner, they wouldn't have flown the car to Hogwarts at all. It just seems to me that rich people don't take matters into their own hands unless absolutely necessary.

******* To be honest, my preference for the 2nd option came more from my desire to see Ron and the Twins drive a flying Aaston Martin than any plot logic.

Though, as often with fanfics, it's possible to find a justification for why he could have done it someone really want to. You could say that Arthur and Molly still remembered their poor years so they still gave some chores for the kids to do to "forge their character". Or they taught them to not bother the house Elf unless they have to because they don't want their children to "overwork poor [Elf_Name]". Or maybe Ron and the Twins didn't think secretely steal their father car and fly half of England to rescue one of their friend was beyond their capabilities (Gryffindors).

***** Exactly! It depends on what time they become rich!

Is it before or after their quirks have developed? Rich or not, I get the impression that Arthur would be interested in Muggle Artifacts.

It's unlikely that Molly would want a house elf. For all intents and purposes, she seems to be a very proud and dedicated housewife.

If there's anyone who would be pampered, I think it would be Ginny not Ron.

There are so many ways this could go. I prefer the wholesome ways though.

*** Bill Weasleys has the air of someone who would love parties or Molly, for a chance to cook a lot of food.

This could force Slughorn to come out of the woodwork. Slughorn, attempting to cozy up with the wealthy Weasleys.

This is what I think could happen. They throw parties overshadowing the Malfoys in wealth, opulence and power.

Lucius Malfoy decides to bring the Weasleys down by using the diary.

In my head, he gets caught by Slughorn or Dumbledore or both of them at the same time.

That's just one possibility.

Here's another.

They get rich, so Bill or Arthur goes out in warding the house, if I go via fanon route, this will include wards against any animagus. This could lead to Sirius released earlier.

I'm thinking all this could happen say in-between the eleven years before Harry goes to Hogwarts. So maybe, when Harry goes to Hogwarts, his fame is overshadowed by the wealthy Weasleys.

Maybe Harry Potter can just be Harry.

** I recall part of a post Hogwarts fic that had ron getting filthy rich as an aside. It wasn't the focus of it, and iirc, only harry really was in the story.

It basically had Harry and Ron running a scam on the death eaters after the war. Having Ron catch up to malfoy or one of the other rich assholes, then accepting a hefty bribe to let them go, with them believing he'll carry through because of his family being so far. Then, shortly thereafter, harry coming in and capturing them, collecting the bounties on their heads in the process.

And them so running a side business, getting the death eaters families to pay them to break them out of prison. Setting them up in safe houses, then hitting them with some kind of magic to get the dumbasses to leave said safehouses and busting them again. Running said scam on the same people over and over again until they were broke.

With people only suspecting the truth when Ron moves in the entire extended weasley clan into the former malfoy manor.

The whole process having two end goals, first to get filthy stinking rich, and second, to deprive the dark families of their money in order to make it a lot harder for another Voldemort to rise.

With ron eventually retiring and harry becoming an international bounty hunter because he'd become addicted to the action.

Pretty sure that's in the first few chapters of Tsu Doh Nim's HP/Star Wars crossover, actually. From Harry's background before winding up in the republic.

  How would the wizarding world be different if Charlie had let his adventurous side take over a little early? A story where Charlie meets some muggles, Ron gets a work ethic, and all of the changes that happen as a result. I only have one pairing cemented, the rest will be up to how the story progresses.

Cue modern times. Maybe Bill finds it in his curse breaking, Maybe it's Arthur on a raid, but whatever is is the Weasleys get the item back but because it has been missing for centuries and was tied to their fortune they get all the money they would have had all those years ago at once and with interest.

** I was always under the impression that Arthur Weasly, being the head of his department, even if it is an obscure department, makes plenty. It's just that a single income isn't enough to care for seven children and send them to a private magic boarding school. It could be that their education is a service provided by the ministry as a way of ensuring new talent and magic gets put back into the ministry but i like the idea that, while some provisions are given to muggleborn families and the like, most pureblood families are well off enough to send their children to Hogwarts. The idea of a poor pureblood family is considered disgraceful so why would they be supported? I don't know, just a thought.

** Ok I like this I think if they were rich then I could see Arthur being high up in the ministry ( but not unemployed ) and bring trusted by the minister more Molly either not working until Percy has atleast passed his OWLS are not working at all. Percy wouldn't have abandoned his family but he would still be have the place in the ministers office. However, Fred and George will stay running the joke shop and maybe Fred wouldn't of died, who knows? Then Ron would of gone into being high up in the ministry like Harry and Hermione straight away so the joke shop would still be successful and Ginny would be a Quidditch star still. Also unlike the Malfoys they would be a welcoming pure blood line not one that looks down on others. But I think Malfoy would be trusted by the minister more but they would get ready for Voldemort to strike not knowing that Lucious one of the most trusted people of all is a death eater and Umbridge would be there checking that Dumbldore isn't giving Draco a hard time but she would also be a better teacher towards the other houses and not start the swuad she progress 's to make.
