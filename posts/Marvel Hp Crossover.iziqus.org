:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I want to find a fanfic. In this fic loki is harry potter's dad . Which effects his growth. Loki visits harry occasionally like on his birthdays e.t.c. Harry knows loki is his father . And he tried to find ways to become immortal so that he can live with him . During the battle of Hogwarts when he collects all the Hallows he goes through tests and becomes immortal. But loki thinks he died due to his jotun heritage and tries to destroy jotunheim. I remember Odin's line he didn't let gods contact his half blood children because when they die the god go on rampage. After gaining immortality harry tries to find loki with luna and meets all the avengers. I think i have given lots of info to go from. Harry is very childish.


** I can think of two fics that sound similar to this where Loki is Harry's father, Lokison and The Triumph of These Tired Eyes. Neither of them exactly match your description though.

  The holidays are coming, and Blair's busy with a little project. He's a thrifty guy, too. Written by Laurie For 2011 TS Secret Santa.I wrote this story after spilling some Maker's Mark whiskey on a counter (I didn't lick it up, but I was tempted).

  In the several millennia he had existed Loki Odinson, Norse God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things, he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before, in his thousands of years of existence had he been a loving father, but all it took was a single glance at the perfect little creature before him and he knew, he was gone.

  James and Lily Potter had a secret, one which led to Thanatos saving young Harry from a dreary life with the Dursleys and changed the face of the Second British Wizarding War before it ever began.

  "I was there every step of the way, I held her hand as she suffered through labor, he has my name, he is my son now...not yours." James said harshly trying as hard as he could to keep his voice low. "We both know that he isn't yours," Loki hissed back at him as he took a step forward. Warning possible Slash
