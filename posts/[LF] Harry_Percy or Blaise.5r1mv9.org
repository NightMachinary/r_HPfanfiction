I've not been able to find many fics (much less readable ones) with these pairings. Looking for well written reqs, prefer longer fics.


** Not exactly what you're looking for but I would say:

A Time for Changeling - There's no actual slash between Harry and Percy but there are some Harry/Percy undertones by the end of the story (at least for me). It has Albus/Gellert too. Rather well written and complete. It has one of the best characterisation of Percy, IMO. linkffn(5733297)
