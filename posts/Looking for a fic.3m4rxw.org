I remember reading this fic but can't seem to find it anywhere. The fic had a harry/Daphne pairing were during a hogsmeade visit daph betrays harry and gives him up to death eaters to save her family. I remember the story starts off with harry ranting in his cell.

**** I often start James Spookie stories and then peter out on them.

I don't really care for all the /intrigue/ in his stories.

**** I would recommend it. I'd give spookie a 9/10 for initial plot and 7/10 overall. My only issue is sometimes his subplot end before the rest of his story, but overall a very good author.

**** Not really. Most of this guy's stories all read identically, So if you've read one, you can be 90% sure that you're going to see many of the same ideas come up in his other stories. Not to mention he's still stuck on all the old Ice Queen cliches and everything that brings, despite it being 7 years out of date by this point. Rarely is there a unique or interesting idea in any of his writings.
