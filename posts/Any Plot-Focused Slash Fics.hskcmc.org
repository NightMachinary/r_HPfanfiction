I like to read slash, but preferably fics where romance and or smut is not the focus of the plot. I prefer Post Hogwarts, but will read well written and not overly sexual fics set at Hogwarts. Any recommendations?

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.

*** It auto-tags due to the fact you used the word smut. Happens with my boilerplate disclaimers all the time. If you want to turn it off, you go to the little 'comments share save hide' bar thing on the post, there should be a little option that says 'nsfw'. If you click that, then 'yes' when that comes up, it should de-tag as NSFW.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.

  “I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”

  “You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”

  Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

  Severus Snape has a change of heart. In an attempt to keep Potter alive, he tells the Dark Lord all about Dumbledore's plans for Potter and the war. Once Voldemort realizes that Harry Potter is his horcrux, his plans change drastically. So does Draco Malfoy's assignment for the school year. Harry's sixth year starts going very differently. Snape is now on a mission to discover why Harry was so ignorant of the Wizarding World. Harry is going to need to learn pureblood politics if he's going to keep up with everything. Draco Malfoy needs to find a way to convince Harry to forgive him. Voldemort finds himself visiting Harry Potter in his dreams. Everyone is realizing that no one is quite what they thought. And through it all, there's a mystery. What is Ancient Magic? Why is it so powerful and so hard to control? And why did Professor Dumbledore go out of his way to make it illegal?

  “The only reason any of this is happening at all is because of you. You seek me out. Again and again and again. You bring me back. This isn't my party at all. It's yours.”

  There was no denying the tension in Harry now and relishing the achievement, Tom pressed even closer, invading Harry's personal space, nearly making him flatten against the window.

  “So tell me, Harry, why do you keep inviting me to play?” Or, in other words, being dead means jack shit.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable. "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.”At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts an undercover mission to assist in his search for the Hallows. Only, the young wizard finds himself involved in far more dangerous matters than he could have ever imagined.
