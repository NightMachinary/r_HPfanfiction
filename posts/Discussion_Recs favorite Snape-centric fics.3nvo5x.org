Let's just talk about our favorite fics & ships for our snarky professor! Personally I'm not a huge fan of Snarry so bonus points to anyone who suggests one interesting enough that I actually give it a shot. Plus, ya know, I wanna make friends with some fellow Potions master fans.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548?view_adult=true][The Boy who died a Lot]]

Well, it is Snarry, a (very long) one-shot and absolutely fantastic. The author sticks to the seven canon books...but with major twists thanks to the use of quite possibly, the best use of time-travel I've ever come across.

The Snarry part is slow to develop, and the story starts out very funny and sarcastic...but gets darker, more and more bitter and serious as the Hogwarts years roll on by.

Seriously, it's excellent and one of my favorite stories. If OP doesn't like it, I highly suggest Snarry fans to read this.

** Snarry is my central passion in HP fandom, but I don't usually try to convert people because I think it's one of those ships where it either hits your id and makes sense to you (in a bizarre way) or it doesn't.

Here are a few Snarry fics I love a lot, and in a second comment I'll link a few non-Snarry fics, including gen.

linkao3(Blood and Fire by cluegirl): Harry put an accidental mark on Snape which saves him repeatedly from the retribution of his enemies and the general public; Snape hates him for it. They work through the moral implications of owning/protecting someone against his will. It starts a little bumpily (and the author has an unfortunate fondness for "gritted" as a dialogue tag), but it's fascinating and intense and well-written, with a fierce, intelligent Snape POV, mob cruelty, a strong, stubborn, and not clueless Harry, and complex emotional ideas. The ending, IMO, cheats a bit, but I'm willing to forgive it for the rest of the fic, which is harsh and sometimes beautiful.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/2690][The Finder's Fee series]] by gatewaygirl, an AU which has Snape and Harry in a D/s relationship, but one in which Harry is an equal, not a helpless quivering innocent. It begins with the two of them sneaking down into the Chamber of Secrets to cut up the basilisk to sell in parts, splitting the profits between them. The magic and the relationship are both inventive, and the last installment has the added attraction of Ron's POV, when he's sent to arrest Harry on suspicion of having killed an endangered and legally protected firebird.

linkao3(Rapture by mia_ugly): Dumbledore gives Harry a pocketwatch that takes him back in time to meet a young, raw, self-loathing Snape. Snape falls in love with this compassionate young man who keeps showing up and disappearing from his life. Beautiful prose, great characterization, and a pervasive sense of tragic romance that overcomes somewhat weak plot machinations at the end. One of my favorite fics of all time.

At the other end of the scale, linkao3(In Between Days by atrata) is a tour de force of Stockholm syndrome dynamics, sexual manipulation, and morally ambiguous (or simply morally appalling) Snape. My bookmark comment for this says: "Brilliant, disturbing, intense, incredibly hot, fucked up, acerbic, intelligent. A dark, powerful, morally elusive Snape with a fierce will of his own. Dysfunctional, unsentimental dynamics. If you crave obsessive Snarry, you've come to the right place." Warning: underage.

There are plenty more where those came from, but that might be pushing it, since Snape/Harry isn't really your cuppa.

(Edited to clarify a sentence.)

** Now to mix up the recs a bit.

linkao3(In Memory of Sigmund Freud by delphi) Snape/McGonagall, Snape/Moody. Vaguely suicidal Professor Snape after his first year of teaching is invited to spend the hols at McGonagall's summer house. A recently injured Moody is there, too, recuperating. The fic is an extraordinary character study, full of hints and subtext and astonishing insight into what makes Snape Snape. I love this fic like burning.

linkao3(A Gramarye of Folk Magic by delphi) Snape/Aberforth Dumbledore. Huge cross-gen, but it works. After he defects from the Death Eaters, Snape is billeted with Albus' brother. This is an account of the year that follows. Aberforth is a triumph, pragmatic, earthy, laconic but funny, still damaged by that long-ago family tragedy. Seeing a very young Snape through his eyes is fascinating and poignant.

Two related short fics create a somewhat different mythology in which the Prince family shares a bleak destiny, tinged with old magic and Ministry politics. [[http://severus-shorts.livejournal.com/13205.html][A Rowan in Winter by duniazade]] and [[http://snapecase.livejournal.com/28671.html][Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree by duniazade]] Beautiful, enigmatic, dark, unsettling. Gen fic.

linkao3(Mutability by kelly_chambliss) Snape/McGonagall. Another character study of Snape during the years leading up to Voldemort's defeat. It's the portrait of a man trapped in claustrophobic duty and pessimism, ordered by the Dark Lord to seduce Albus' deputy. Severus's thought processes are illuminating and self-sabotaging, leading him ever deeper into detachment.

linkao3(The Shadow of Misery's Wings by femmequixotic) Snape/Viktor Krum. Two has-beens, damaged by their pasts, drawn together by need and an intense carnal bond. The fic revolves around a central scene, an amazing and unflinching piece of smut.

Back to gen again. Two fics that are somewhat similar, since they both deal with Snape's final year: linkao3(Penultimate Acts by pasi) and [[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/24152.html][Into the Silence by lyras]].

And one last rec for a Snape gen fic before I go to bed:

linkao3(To Dwell on Dreams by musamihi) Snape is addicted to a potion that lets him hallucinate Lily as a still living woman. The potion is close to destroying him, and Dumbledore locks him in a room to force him into withdrawal. Beautifully written and harrowing.

It is really excellent and well-written with humor, romance and some dark and emotional times for the pair. It's a beautifully crafted love story with a fascinating plotline!

#+begin_quote
  After the 2nd Wizarding War, Hermione works as an apprentice at Hogwarts where Severus is still the Potions Master. She performs a time-turner experiment using Severus in the demonstration, and things go horribly wrong. Follow the pair as they arrive in various times, in unfamiliar roles, and try in vain to come back home while learning about each other and their true feelings.

** linkffn(Bound to Him) is a really good SS/HG, despite the embarrassing title. Voldemort decides to have Hermione spy on Harry for him, so he captures her during the summer and binds her to Snape. In that sense it's like a marriage law fic. But the writing is really good and heartbreaking at times, hilarious at other times.

  At the behest of Lord Voldemort, Snape is forced to commit an act he finds most undesirable. While working to thwart the dark plot, he must find a way to live with himself and also atone for his actions to the one he hurt. WARNING - dark content!

** Not one for Snape fics (or Snape, himself, really), so this is probably not going to be one of the fics from that genre with real literary appeal.

Still, I read and liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6586583/1/The-Prince-s-Harem]]), because it seemed to reflect the whole "fix everything for Harry and make his life awesome" (an occasional guilty pleasure after darker reading) genre onto Snape while being humorous and light-hearted enough to actually keep me reading a genre that, again, I have little to no interest in.

Warnings: Use of potions ingredients as illicit drugs. Marauders era. Snape having sex. People thinking Snape has even more sex than he actually does. Some Marauders&Lily bashing. Not actually as bad as these warnings would make you believe.

  Inspired by the movie "Easy A" & Severus in the staring role. Hogwarts Rumor Mill starts working overtime & Severus is no longer shunned by those of the female persuasion. Warnings for teenage type humor and bizarre ways of offing Death Eaters and Horcruxes.

** Digging for Bones by Paganidd

I loved this Severitus fic, long, but unlikely to be updated.

The Birthday Present by excessivelyperky One of my favorite Snape characterization, with a very rare pairing.

Looking for Magic by Hypnobarb Snape/Hermione-I suppose its more Hermione-centric than you might like.

My absolute favorite: Spellcaster by SGCBearcub

At this point its pretty AU, but it helps fill in conceptual holes in the canonical structure of the wizarding world. Its a Marriage Law fic, but give it a chance!

*** linkffn(Digging for the Bones) is complete, it doesn't need updated.

Paganaidd has another series, that might be the one you're thinking of: linkffn(Dudley's Memories) linkffn(Snape's Memories) and linkffn(Severus' Dreams) - Only the last one is incomplete.

#+begin_quote
  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
