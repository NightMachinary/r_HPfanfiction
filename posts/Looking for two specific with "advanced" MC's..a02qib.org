The first fic I only have hazy memories of. In it, Harry is some kinda of Kwasitz Magerac or something, because he can use made-up spells to do things that should be impossible. In the specific example I remember, a teacher tells him an incantation to create a jet of very hot flame from a block of metal. Later, Hermione is trying to duplicate the spell with no success. He also designs jewelry.

In the second fic, Harry is a sort of transfiguration wunderkind, but has some real difficulty functioning as a normal human being. He forgets the days of the week, has no concept of sarcasm, and has trouble distinguishing between people (calls Draco "Blonde Ponce" and upon meeting Lucius says "Oh, hello Blonde Ponce. You've gotten taller."). In one specific scenario, Harry uses transfiguration to alter his potion ingredient into small chunks, instead of cutting it. Snape tells him to conduct his research elsewhere "If you want to explode your cauldron instead of creating a useful potion," so he tries the same thing in an abandoned classroom and explodes his cauldron.


** Second one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic]] and is pretty great!

** Is it the same one where Harry uses a Latin dictionary to invent spells? Turns fluffy and Mrs. Norris bald?

I can't remember the title and now it's really bugging me.
