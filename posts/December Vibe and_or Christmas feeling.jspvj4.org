It can be the November-December feeling as well.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with male pregnancy as long as it's not detailed

Would rather *NOT* have Weasley Bashing/Weasley Manipulation. As in Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, having Ron abuse Hermione, having Ginny give Harry love potions, etc. *I don't want that*.

Love the feeling of Christmas vibes. Can be Muggle AU or Magical AU

Can be time travel, traveling to another Universe, staying in their universe, canon or not.

Bonus if our main characters are adults but not mandatory.


** This one's short but it's sweet.
