No bashing please.


** I'd actually like to see this portrayed. Harry gets traumatic flashbacks to the basalisk. A twelve year old facing a giant snake who could poison him and kill him with a bite. One wrong glance and he's dead. Hell , he nearly died! He got poisoned by a giant snake and stabbed a creepy diary! He saw his best friends sister close to death and he, a child, was the only one who could save her. Even in first year, he literally killed Quirellmort and nearly died like every year.

Of course Harry had nightmares of the graveyard and was outwardly affected, but why wasn't he affected by the rest of the shit he had done? And he was so young too! I mean, semantics; it's a children's book, but still. I'd like to see this portrayed in a fic; Harry having nightmares about all the times he nearly died and like, idk a perment fear of girls bathrooms.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Perception is Everything. (One of my favorites). Harry struggles with depression a bit throughout. It's not a huge part of the plot, but it's there.
