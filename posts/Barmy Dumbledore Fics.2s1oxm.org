I've recently completed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]], and I absolutely loved it.

Do you have a favorite fic where Dumbledore isn't an evil mastermind or a perfectly wonderful and all-powerful plot device, but is instead just plain crazy?

Please share it. I'd love to read it! Any rating or length is okay.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4086213/1/Lost-Hope][Lost Hope]] by Adari. Pretty much everyone in that story has sanity issues.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] triology by nonjon.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais. Dumbledore triest to play the evil mastermind thing, but is too senile to pull it off.

** I hate HPMoR but can't deny he's batshit insane in that story. He's also kinda nutty in After Dark by Tigerman.

*** I tried HPMoR, but couldn't get past the poisonous amount of author tract.

Thanks very much for the other recommendation, though.

** Oh to me its perfectly believable that even in canon he has a few screws loose. Could have prepared him die without the child abuse IMO.

Seriously. Imagine you're a seventh year during Harry's first year. The headmaster gets up and says "Nitwit, blubber, oddment, tweak." I'd be seriously considering making my way in the muggle world (provided I knew how) if this is the smartest wizard alive. It's a children's book, though, so it's hard to get hung up on specifics.
