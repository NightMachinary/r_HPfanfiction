Does anyone have really good completed next gen recommendations? No one shots please , and it doesn't necessarily need to focus on a romantic interest either. I like a longer fic, but really just looking for a good read!

EDIT: if anyone has any that include Dudley that would be welcome too! Thanks!


** Number of wonderful nextGen stories were written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Realmer06/pseuds/Realmer06/works?fandom_id=136512][Realmer06]].

Also, linkao3(373224).

Concerning Dudley, I really liked linkao3(19475812).

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

**** And of course, every Dudley recommendation should include linkffn(6142629) and its sequel linkffn(6329597). The sequel is not THAT good, but still certainly worthy of reading.

And, I forgot, probably one of the three best nextGen stories I know at all is the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]], where the main heroine is the Dudley's daughter (but his daughter being magical is just a premise and the series is a way way better than just that).

#+begin_quote
  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

** linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

It's older, but it is a 7 book series of Albus Severus Potter fully planned out ahead of time so there are no plot holes.

It is phenomenal. Just under 1 mil words for the entire thing.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

**** Second this; also check out Vekin87's Albus Potter series (which I think is a tad better, albeit less impressive) and the Stygian trilogy by Slide.
