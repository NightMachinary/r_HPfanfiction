As in what's the most disturbing and out there story? or the one that took you the furthest outside of your comfort zone.


** I'm not 100% what you're looking for, so I'm just gonna make a giant(ish) list of stuff I've read.

Mind Fuckery stories? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths][Concentric Wavelengths]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] are my two favorite for this. You have no idea what the hell's going on for most of the fic.

Other things you might be looking for:

In terms of eww, I gotta go take a shower now? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/][Too Young to Die]] (it's got one of the best elaborate dark harry plots I've seen. Period. Oh, and it's one of the few fics that Dark magic usage have effects on mental stability and does it well.) You have to wade through the early bits, but once it gets going it gets really fucked up.

In terms of HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE HELL AM I READING?! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]]

The only fic I've read that's ever gotten me close to crying? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/][A Promise From Her Boy]] It's an Animagus Hedwig and it's fucking brilliant. DO NOT skip this just because of the Hedwig animagus. Seriously, this is one of my favorite fics. It's great.

A story that makes me wonder what the hell I'm smoking? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]

Something I read to punish myself? Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (seriously, everyone's pretentious as fuck.)

I'm not sure where to put this, but the majority of the story is made of of OCs who laugh at Voldemort's power levels like Cell would Freezer and it's the only one like that I've enjoyed. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]]

Something that makes me want to claw my eyes out and pray that I never see it's name again? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble]].

The only fanfiction poem I've ever enjoyed? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2217444/1/A-Mary-Sue-Alphabet][A Mary Sue Alphabet]]

The story that made me like Luna Harry shipping? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]]

Also I haven't started reading this one yet, but its premise isn't something I've seen before so I might as well throw it on here. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations.]] Harry isn't the only one at Number 4 to get a Hogwarts Letter.

Luna's Hubby is awesome and funny. I'll let you know about the others :). Too young to die sounds like my next stop.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** To sum it up: It appears that the author (Perfect Lionheart, or however he is called because it's not his first username) is of the opinion that the hero of his story is always right and always good even if he's wrong and pulling stuff the sort of which the worst villain of the story he is making a fan-fiction of wouldn't dare do. It also appears that he isn't aware how human relationships actually work and yet whatever character he centres on gets a whole harem because why not. There's also blatant bashing of characters that he doesn't like, and not very skilful bashing at that.

The sad thing is, as far as writing itself goes he isn't bad, so he could have been great; but instead he let the above run his writing and what we got is ... a mess.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** What about Oscillate Wildly?

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/108402]]

After a particularly gruelling Occlumency session, Harry practically comes apart at the seams and finds himself living partway between two lives. One is his life at Hogwarts. In the other, he's been in a mental institution for the better part of six years. What happens when Harry realises his whole life may be one elaborate fantasy?
