I was just looking for advice. What do you do when you've come across essentially the same idea you've had for a story of your own, in someone else's story, particularly one of the ideas you hadn't seen once in any other story, and thought was rather unique and would lead to far reaching changes in the future of your story?

Scrap the idea completely and try and think up something else groundbreaking? Try and do it slightly differently - or dramatically different, but still the same idea?


** A story is not just an idea; it's the execution of that idea. Don't focus on "groundbreaking." Write what you want and write it well. Everyone tells stories differently!

** Personally I don't worry about being groundbreaking at all, as it's only fan fiction. There's so much of it out there that someone is bound to do things before you. If you're writing your own unique story then you might worry about it a bit more, but one idea really won't make you stand out. It's about having many ideas work together in a great way.

As the quote goes, "good artists copy, great artists steal". You take the good ideas you like and leave the ones you don't. And if you can, create your own along the way.

** Fanfiction is, by its nature, derivative and fanfiction writers riff off one another all the time, borrowing, tweaking, and twisting as necessary. One should follow Shakespeare's example (he being the most accomplished fanfiction writer of all time) and just use the idea anyway. Forget about whether someone else used it already and developed the same idea independently. As [[/u/someorangegirl]] notes, the quality of your execution is far more important than uniqueness anyway in making for a popular, influential story.

There have been several instances in fanfiction where people independently developed the same ideas. For example, back in the day, before Peggy Sue stories were dime-a-dozen, Jeconais started one only to realize that S'TarKan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] had many of the same story elements he had been planning to include (PTSD Harry, etc.) A more recent example is when BajaB found out that the premise of his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]] very closely matched a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/1/Odd-Ideas][one-shot]] by Rorcharch's Blot that he hadn't ever come across. I had this happen to me as well recently--I've a HP/Starship Troopers crossover I've been working on where one of the premises I used was that one of the Voyager spacecraft is a horcrux of Voldemort (which in my story eventually took over the bug hive mind and caused them to attack Earth). LessWrong came up with the same Voyager horcrux idea in his story. A bit annoying, but that's life. You deal with it and move on.

** Just write it anyway and note that your fict isn't based on (insert similar fict here) or Conversely, if people bother you about it, just go on and say 'well if you liked that then you will LOVE this!' I did the same with one of my own ficts and that was a way for people to find my story because they were looking for the other story and found something (hopefully) better.

I have read ficts that hold a very similar premise and none of them are too much the same in both and bad ways. If you are worried just make sure you write good enough where folks will go 'huh, this really reminds me of soinso but BETTER.'
