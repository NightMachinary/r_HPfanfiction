Edit: I'm replaying Witcher 3 for The Who knows how many time and what do you think of a conjunction of spheres type introduction to magic and all the creatures?


** On theory I have floating around that I may use is that wizardkind are descended from the Fae, but Muggles can gain magic through generations living in an area high in magic. (One of the causes of Muggleborns)

** Looking at the fact 2 muggle parents can have a magical child it's probably muggles turning into wizards

** I think magical races and creatures existed first, and human non magicals who had kids with them created today's witches and wizards. Because magic can't come into spontaneous existence.

** My headcanon is that wizards are descended from magical aliens that came to Earth around the time Neanderthals died off, and mated with who would become wizards and witches.

The idea I like best is magicals becoming muggles, because squibs exist and all. This question is very "chicken and egg".

** Such a loaded question. I personally like imagining that Magicals existed first and just gradually lost their magic and turned into muggles. However, from a historical standpoint, /I think/ muggles -> magicals makes more sense, so there is that. I /like/ the first one better, but think the second is more logical. I don't subscribe to the â€˜same time' theory.

*** What's your thought process on the muggles->magical theory. Are you thinking something similar to evolution???

** The fact that magical/muggle parents result in magical children almost always and magical children can result from muggle only parents, although rarely and siblings don't get it too shows that it's probably the case that everyone has the magic gene, but it's probably only activated through exposure to magic, for example one magical parent or by chance if the muggle parents ran into an anti muggle charm. Squibs still do have magic, but it's limited because their magic gene is damaged.

** I would lean toward either muggle first, with the odd individual wizards starting to appear soon after and gradually learning to control it, or both at the same time. We know that rare individual trees can have their own magic in-universe, and if trees are like that then, fun as the idea might be, I don't think any other humanoid races need to have interbred with humans to have produced wizards. And if they did, you still have the same question of where it /originally/ came from.

** My personal headcanon is that wizard kind is just a result of humans having babies with magical creatures. Half breeds are already canon and humans are the only species that have a magical and non magical counterpart. There is no non magical dragon or giant or centaur.

Wizards are just all mixes of human+ magical creatures..its just that after being filtered down through several generations the magic no longer seems as distinctly different as it would have if they were half magical creature as opposed to 1/20th. Magic cuz its magic never really dies out of a blood line but it can often skip generations.

Muggle borns often hsve some wizard or magical creature related to them that they arent aware of and so people think they pop out of nowhere snd it makes sense cuz magic is weird. This is also why some wizards are better at some kills or some( like seers) are one of the few with those abilities.
