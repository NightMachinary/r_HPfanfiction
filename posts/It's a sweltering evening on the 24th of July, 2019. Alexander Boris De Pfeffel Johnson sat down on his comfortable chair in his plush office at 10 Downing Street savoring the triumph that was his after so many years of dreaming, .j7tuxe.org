The conversation ends with Boris lecturing the Ministry of Magic envoy on the proper use of Latin.

"What are those mouthly spewings you call 'spells,' Mr. Weatherby? We must endeavour with all haste to rectify this farcical linguistic deficiency!"

** "Hem, hem." - coughed a woman clad in a pink cardigan and Boris caught a faint whiff of catnip. " Is that catnip, Ms...?", Boris said whilst he stared at her. " Umbridge. Dolores Jane Umbridge, though you may call me Dolores and yes, it is catnip, Mr. Johnson.", Dolores simpered and she was warm and wet while contemplating all she could do with Boris. " Call me Boris, Dolores.", Boris told her and his cheeks turned red. He looked at the calendar and realized that it's Valentine's day the next day. " Would you like to come with me on a date?", Boris asked her. " YESSS!!!", Dolores squealed and they rushed towards each other and they fell onto the floor gripping each other whilst lip-locked. They went on a date the next day and they ultimately made the beast with two backs and consummated their eternal, undying love on a desk in No. 10, Downing Street.

*** And thus gave birth to a beast with a crown destined to bring misery to the human kind, Muggles and wizards alike. That beast could fly and spread uncertainty, fear, disease and even death. The misery spread out like a virus. Thus their offspring was rightfully called the coronavirus.

  Hermione Granger-Weasley, the Minister of Magic, stared at the wild haired buffoon that the Muggles had somehow managed to elect. How was it that this ... idiot ... had managed to get into position of such power? But as the man turned and Hermione quickly glanced into his mind, answers became depressingly obvious. The Old Tie club, money, lies, betrayals, corruption, pandering stupidity to the masses...

  How sad the state of Muggle politics, the absurdity of current issues. Brexit? Bah! With one look, she made up her mind, quick wave of her wand, and the memory of her presence in the room was gone. There was no point, no fruitful discourse to be had in this association. Perhaps next time Muggles would elect someone worth her time ...
