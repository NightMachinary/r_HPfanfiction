Very well-written! James was in a coma for 14 years and starts teaching defense at Hogwarts disguised as a Peverell during Harry's fifth year, not letting anyone know he is actually alive which results in some very funny and immensely heart-breaking scenes. Slytherin!Harry is witty, smart but also just a traumatized 15yr old

** Everyone calls James an impostor trying to claim the loaded Potter Vaults^{^{TM}} at Gringotts. Harry himself disregards him and asks the Dursleys to chase away the homeless weirdo claiming to be his dad and even if the Dursleys recognize him from their wedding, they still do so because at the time they were still hoping to extirpate magic from Harry. Seeing how scared Harry is, James chooses to comply and to live as a stag in the Forbidden Forest awaiting Harry's return to Hogwarts.

When Harry arrives to Hogwarts he watches over him from afar. In the meantime he befriends the centaurs. When Harry gets attacked by Quirrel, he senses that he is possessed by Voldemort and still suffering flashbacks from his fight with him and a broken heart from Harry's rejection, sends Firenze to save him. In the meantime, he has also mastered the Disillusionment Charm and when he sees his son again back in the Forbidden Forest attacked by acromantulas, he drives a Ford Anglia that randomly happened to end up in there to run over their nest.

Later on he finds out that Sirius has broken out of Azkaban and tries to reach out to him but Sirius is being elusive. He eventually manages to reach out to Lupin and informs him that Sirius is innocent and promises him that he will call him if Padfoot makes a move. At the end of the third year, a distraught Lupin sends a Patronus to James to inform him that Harry and Sirius have reunited but it finds him somewhere at the other edge of the forest. He rushes but by the time he arrives he finds his son and his friends, as well as Sirius, surrounded by Dementors. He casts a Patronus so powerful that it chases away all of them but due to the exhaustion of running all across the Forbidden Forest and having sent a spell powerful enough to scare away hundreds of Dementors, he faints.

Later on he saves Buckbeak (which for some reason is supposed to be executed later on than in the original series) and finally feeling freedom for once, flies around Hogwarts. Thus he spots Sirius in his room and saves him. Snape, in his anger, shoots a stunning spell towards the flying Hipogriff and hits James. James falls off into the lake and he drowns or dies from the impact.

The story continues as canon except that Sirius tells Harry what Snape did and hence why the shift from dislike to complete hatred between the two in later books.

**** I would think it's more plausible than half the stories that are popular around here. As another user mentioned... they could have identified James as the real James using means mentioned in the books, but which were not used in Sirius's case. Realistically JKR ignored those for plot purposes but my headcanon is that most wizards and witches are not as competent as Harry and the gang (considering most can't even cast a proper Shield Charm according to Fred and George) and are only decent with minor spells and weak potions so those means are not readily available.

My story ends on a sad note because, just like in life, you don't get comeuppances, closures or happy endings. Actually that's what I liked about the original series. Neither the Dursleys, the Malfoys or Snape get punished for being shit people so Harry chooses to forgive them instead and move on. Nor do we see Umbridge (despite JKR saying off-page that she gets sent to Azkaban) or Filch, who wanted children whipped, or Pansy, who was shitty to Hermione and was ready to sell Harry to Voldemort, get punished.

****** I'm amazed at how you instantly invented and committed to your headcanon for a silly little prompt response, particularly when it contradicts the response. As you can see from the first sentence, people don't know he's James, so he wasn't put in St. Mungo's, at least not under that name.

And Veritaserum and legilimency are things, but not infallible things. The series would have been a lot simpler and shorter if wizards always easily got to the truth of things.

******* The thing is /someone/ had to have went to the Potters and found James in a coma. Sirius and Remus wouldn't leave one their best friend in a coma without telling someone who could do something about it. Hell, Dumbledore learned of the attack fast enough in canon to arrange for Hagrid o take Harry to the Dursley's on damn near the same night on /Sirius Black's motorcycle/.

So tell my, why would everyone just abandon James and not try to get him medical treatment?

**** Remus was never an animagus, he was a werewolf. Sirius was the animagus, and would have been taken to Azkaban, for the 12 Muggles Deaths, for Pettigrew's and for Lily and James' betrayal. (As in canon)

Not everyone knows Legillmency, so that's easy enough to explain away, especially if the person wanted a Muggle to be the one to find James.

Veritaserum would be the easiest, but again, if [[/u/I_love_DPs]] wanted a Muggle to find James, and James was placed in a Muggle hospital, and most Witches and Wizards do not read the Muggle Newspaper or watch the Muggle News on Tv, they would have no idea where James was.

Of course, there are some definite flaws to it. Once James wakes up from the coma, if you wanted him to have amnesia, that'd be one thing, but then, you wouldn't have him do the things that [[/u/I_love_DPs]] wanted James to do. Plus, once he ends up finding Harry or another Witch and/or Wizard, they can, as you say, confirm his identity.
