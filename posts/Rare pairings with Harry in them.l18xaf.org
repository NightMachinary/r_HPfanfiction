I've found that most of the time the fics with rare pairings are often the best, so please recommend me some It can be one shot, or long stories, i don't mind. I'll read anything the only thing I'm not a fan is harem, but I'll read poly I prefer slash, but I'll also read any other pairing, i just want harry in them


** Linkffn(What We Lost) Harry x Andromeda post war: Surprisingly plausible rare pair. Well written even if Harry is a bit too perfect.

Linkffn(Twins by Andrius) Harry x Carrow twins. Weird but cute one-shot. Ron's character in this is best.

Linkffn(Heterochromic) Harry x Time-travelling abomination : Weird and creepy but cute story. The sequel only gets creepier.

Linkffn(Self Reflection) Harry x female Dimensional counterpart. Fascinating concept. Wish it was complete.

*** Heterochromic is the kind of fic where we should not agree with the pairing, but...we do.

I also called the twist in the first or second chapter IIRC.

Twins is great I would read a full fic, I love their personalities, how Ron is terrified but still supportive, and how everyone is afraid of them but Harry just smiles and goes with it.

**** Heterochromic is an amazing piece of writing. It's also memorably original.

Twins is great fun and I also wish the story wasn't a one shot.

*** I beta'd a couple chapters of Self Reflection. Blandge is still working on it and has an outline for further chapters but is aware that they don't update consistently. It's not abandoned though!

Twins is a good one too.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) by jbern. Harry x Susan Bones, post Ootp.Your mileage may vary with this fic.Theres a lot of death and runaway character assassination here(like seeing one character on the road to become a wizarding school shooter) It's got some nice, brutal action , Harry x Susan is quite well written but a bit sudden. The author is a lore hound, so loves explaining in detail ideas he's come up with for the mechanics and politics and characters. It can be annoying at times when it doesn't go anywhere, but it really helps with the sense of rising doom as the war builds; you feel like there's a lot happening. Another cool rare pair in this fic is Charlie Weasley and Narcissa Malfoy, which I found very entertaining

** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is Harry X Gideon Prewett and honestly, damn.

The Second String is a fantastic story all over. Its completely brilliant and you should read it regardless of the pairing. TBH the pairing isnt a major part of it.

But damn. These two just stole my heart and ran with it theyre completely adorable. And it might be because I have a thing for gingers and Gid is a big muscley man who works on tiny delicate clocks and eugh christ what a man. But also Harry is all strong and determined and badass in this fic then turns into an adorable, sappy, grinning, moron whenever Gideon is in the room and its so funny I love them so much oh im crying.
