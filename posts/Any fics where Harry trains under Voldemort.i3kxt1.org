But I don't want Harry to be like super insanely evil tho. Voldemort can but I'd prefer him to be calmer, and he's not trying to kill Harry cos Harry's on his side. But he's not like, Harry doesn't want to destroy everyone and everything and become a dark lord or anything. He got some control over the death eaters, and they all now see Harry like he'd be voldys son. Or something like that Is there any like it?? (Never read one like it, but I want to üòÇ)


** Try 'The Darkness Within' by Kurinoone. It's a really good story, with some pretty cliche elements that are turned on it's head completely. Including WBWL, Harry has a brother, abusive Potters, loving Voldemort.
