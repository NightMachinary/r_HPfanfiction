I just feel like there was no justice given to muggleborns killed or taken to azkaban during war. There was indications that some death eaters such as Draco Maliit has evaded the prison. I would like to see a fic in which muggleborns form a group, political or military to over throw the government. It is better if Harry potter (or any major cannon character since they left known death eaters such as malfoy out) is not the Hero of the story. I would prefer if muggleborns win this struggle and without the help of some old pure blood family.


** G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series has a really wonderful idea where muggleborns form a progressive activist movement (and Harry is a conservative political figure). Unfortunately, it isn't really expanded upon and the execution is pretty stilted, but I really liked the idea.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided Entwined]] is almost what you want, but they formed their resistance group already after year 6, and they needed to coordinate with Dumbledore.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. I have actually read that. While it is a fantastic fic, they became too dependant on Harry and ministry. If it was me I would not rely on any wizard who were incapable of helping them (like Dumbledore) or didn't care (like most of people). I would like a much more independent group of muggleborns that are suspicious of any help given by pure bloods. Ps: most of the death eaters were killed instantly, It would have been better If their suffering was extended. I know I am a bad person to think like thatðŸ˜Š.
