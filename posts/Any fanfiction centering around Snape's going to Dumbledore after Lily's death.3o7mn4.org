Pretty much what the title says, I guess. Nothing /too/ ridiculous, mostly canon-compliant is good. Thanks!


** Snape Chronicles deals with this aspect of his life and is canon-compliant.

However, it is very long, and that part is not until mid book. You will first have to grow up with young Snape.

I'm 2/3 of the way through and absolutely love it.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

*** Thanks. I dunno if I can read through most of Snape's life, might be too painful. Can you tell me which chapter it is?

**** The part where he's a Death Eater up until Harry is born starts around Chapter 19. You may have to flip a little if you only want that specific part, but it's still a great piece.
