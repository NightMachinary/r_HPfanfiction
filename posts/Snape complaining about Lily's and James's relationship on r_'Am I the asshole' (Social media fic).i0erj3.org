Just imagine this horribly long rant about how he's such a good guy and doesn't understand why Lily isn't friends with him anymore (I mean it was a little slur! He apologized!) And now she's dating his enemy and he wants James dead. I can totally see Snape having absolutely zero self-awareness and expecting people to agree with him, somehow making things worse every time he responds to a comment.

TIFU: by calling the girl I loved a racial slur.

Okay, sounds a little mean, and I regret it, but she took it too far by dating my worst enemy! James Potter, an arrogant little snot who humiliated me!

I was being bullied by the snot and humiliated, and then the love of my life (Lily Evans- it should be Lily Snape!) tried to help me. And then I called her a racial slur (only one, and i APOLOGIZED! Mudbl- I mean muggleborns these days...) and now Lily doesn't want my friendship anymore!!

In my opinion, which is usually fact, Lily should forgive me immediately. I mean, I had a hard childhood! And maybe even take me on a date! Even though that would make us more than friends, it's okay because I have some racis-

I mean Death Eat-

I mean bullyi-

I mean, some really cool other friends! Yup! Personally I think Lily, a well known Muggleborn, should be happy for me, even though my friends are racist and hate Mud- I MEAN MUGGLEBORNS! Totally not my fault for slipping up and calling her just one tiny little word. I was /bullied!/ That excuses my +racism+ mistakes, right?? :)

Now I want James dead- well actually my sweet love Lily, the love of my life, the apple of my eye, the obsession to my Snape, died along with Potter. 10 years ago. But I still deserve to hold a grudge! I mean, I got /bullied/, can you think of anything worse?!

(sorry its really bad lol)

  AITA I (M17) was defending myself from a bully(M17) and accidentally called my best friend(F16) who's also the girl I love, a blood slur in front of the whole school.

  So, I was walking peacefully at school as usual, when this bully(M17) and his group of marauding miscreants come and attack me, supposedly because I associate with people with different political opinions from theirs.

  I try to defend myself, do a good job, but they heavily outnumber me, and start humiliating me in front of the crowd. My best friend comes and stops them, but I was so angry, and was so hurt(I had a very difficult childhood so I don't deal well with physical abuse) that I accidentally , and without /any/ intention, called her the M word, the one use for FGWs.

  I was so sorry, I apologized, but she wouldn't hear it! I know the bully has a crush on her, and she finds him attractive, and now they seem to be getting closer.

  All because of an accident I already apologized for. And nothing happened to the bully and his friends!

  AITA?

  What happened was terrible and many mistakes were made, but I think we must look at that with cooler heads, and that forgiveness is something that must be treasured, both to be given and to be received.

I always hated that line. It's like saying "Oh I just don't like him acting like a smug cunt"... It is such a vague statement and clearly a personal attack. How do you even refute or defend yourself against this accusation?

*** I've always sort of given him a pass for Harry specifically to avoid impossible requests from Voldemort once reborn ("All right Snape, now hand me over Harry who trusts you implicitly"). However, that does not excuse his behaviour towards Neville, or Gryffindors in general.

This is also why I always preferred the movie version of him -- he isn't needlessly cruel the way the book version is.

Eye of the beholder and all that.

I also never found his voice attractive or endearing in any way, it annoyed me and was slightly unnerving. I felt like if I was a child in his class, I would've been terrified of that man. So good on him for doing a good job I guess.
