Just like the title says. I don't mind slash, as long as the characters aren't stereotypical limp-wristed boy-toys without an ounce of self-confidence.


** Not quite what you asked for, but check out Fixing Past Mistakes and sequel by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan. It is an AU that involves time travel and Harry attending another school on one of the Caribbean islands. When the Triwizard Tournament happens, there are indeed 4 schools competing and Harry is part of the group that travels to Hogwarts.

Warning: Lots of Gryffindor bashing, although it is relatively mild compared to other works by the same author.

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?
