So here's what I'm thinking, not so much a new plot but a different way of telling it...hopefully.

Harry is sent back in time to the recent past, but the narrative continues to follow the main plot and shows Harry's return from an outsider or alternate POV (at least to start).

E.G. Harry disappears during the Department of Mysteries battle, suddenly a Mysterious Adult arrives just in time to save everyone. That person is a grown up, fully trained wizard called Harry Potter!

Turns out Harry went back in time a few years (between 5-20yrs) and there were no quick fixes. To prevent him changing the time line he was sent away with an alias to finish his education & live his life as someone else. He could only return to Britain and reclaim his name after Teen Harry disappeared.

Possible subplots include: World-building! Where has Harry been, what has he learnt and what new friends/allies has he made? Can the Golden Trio's friendship survive with this new dynamic? How does Harry's role in the war change? Can the adults in Harry's life accept the fact that he isn't a child anymore? (I'm looking at you Dumbledore). Does Sirius survive the DOM battle?

Sorry if this kind of thing already exists, I tried to look but couldn't find any search terms to cull down the rather large selection of time travel stories. I have seen some stories where an adult Harry comes back from the past, but the plot still followed Harry's personal timeline and the part where he returns is always towards the middle/end of the story - also he usual maintained a disguise instead of dealing with everyone as Harry Potter.


** Who sent him away? If canon Harry found himself in the past he would go to Dumbledore. You could use that for how lax Dumbledore acted in canon, he knew what was gonna happen. Although I don't know why you'd want to keep the timeline the same. Depends how time travel works in the story, closed loop? Branching off timelines?

*** Harry Potter canon Time Travel is supposed to be closed loop only. If you went back in time, it's because you were always supposed to. That means in Harry Potter, Destiny or Fate is a real thing.

***** Not necessarily, another way of looking at it would be that you won't notice any change you make because it would simultaneously change your own memory to the point that as far as you remembered the change would have happened the first time around. I actually have a HC that the reason a character can't see their past self is because since both have free-will it would make the future one be forced to deal with memories of every single variable possible for the time between the existence of the future character and the present, which would be enough to break completely the mind of the traveler. There could be exceptions if the past self didn't actually have direct contact with the traveler, like by using letters or if the past self wasn't cognizant enough at the time or for some other reason couldn't (in the sense of it being physically impossible) take a different path, F ex.: the future self interacts with his baby self.

*** I figure the Unspeakable's would be a possible option for getting him setup safely in the past. Especially if Harry time travel from within the DOM.

As far as time travel theory...what about more of a Whovian take? The events of your personal timeline are fixed, which is why Harry has to wait until he time travels before returning to Britain. But from that point, future history is in flux again and so he can make his own destiny?

Just ballparking here lol, definitely not an expert on the rules of time travel in Dr Who.

** Not completely on point but it is close. Shortly after his trial in 5th year Harry is sent back in time. He has a relationship with Amelia Bones. Then somehow he is returned back to present time though aged older. The story is called Retrograde by Knife Hand.

Any chance the author has said anything about how they update? Seems it's less than 40k words in just a few days over four years. The chapters aren't ever 2k words, but it looks really interesting, I just don't want to get sucked into a story just for it to be abandoned like just about everything else.

** Please excuse the shameless self-promotion. I'm actually writing a story like this where Harry vanishes at the end of 6th year. TBH, the story likely sucks as I don't claim to have any talent writing, but it fits what you're asking for. The story is just getting to the point where Harry reunites with "present day" and I'm trying to give appropriate attention to the internal conflict Harry has with reuniting with his friends and having the rest of the world finally realising who he actually is.

** Lay in some snacks because this is a long haul. Of a Linear Circle series by (deadcatwitha)flamethrower is epic in both length and content. Part 8 (really the 10 parts so far because of side stories) just completed, with two more in the works. Nearly 1.5 million words so far, and all of them brilliant. You might be tempted to skip the histories (parts 5 and 7), but seriously, don't.
