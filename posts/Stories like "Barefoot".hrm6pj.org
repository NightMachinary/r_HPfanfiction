i recently read the fanfiction barefoot and i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for similar reads


** Hi, I can't suggest anything unless I've read it, so it's common curtesy to describe what it was about the fic you liked that you wanted more of. Also to link the fic for others who might be interested.

** I think the barefoot story is this one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot]]

A good story from what I've read, sadly I don't know any similar ones.

  Lily alters her spell to drain the magic of voldemort instead of rebounding it. Magic becomes a very deep part of Harry's life from the very beginning. A story where Harry explores the wonders of magic, and everything that comes with it. AU/Non-canon
