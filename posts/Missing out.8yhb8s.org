I feel as if I'm missing out on great hp fanfiction I'm still relatively new and thus far I've only really read anything with a h\hg pairing and I feel that I'm limiting myself

If there's anything you feel is a must read please recommend not other romances and preferably no time travel or crossovers


** Well, ffn( Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) is a must read imho. Its everything that goes on at Hogwarts during book 7. A bit dark but excellent is the Unbroken Universe. ffn(Promises Unbroken) is the first in the series which is Sirius centric. I also enjoy some crackfics where stuff just happens and is hilarious, here I recommend ao3(The Secret Language of Plants) Also if you like Luna's lunacy ffn(12407442)

Happy reading!

** Depends a lot on what you want.

Personally I think linkffn(Eclipse Of The Sky) is an excellent fic. That said, it's a bit stressful for me. The author is fantastic at creating tension, and I just can't handle that much tension that well. I'm like five chapters behind because I just can't pull up the courage to read them. It's also a bit verbose at times, but not ridiculously so.

If you're up for a one-shot that's sad linkffn(Cauterize) is pretty much required reading for the fandom. Literally anything I've read by Lady Altair is fantastically written and it'll probably make you cry too.

linkffn(Harry Potter and The Elemental's Power by Sage Ra) is great, too.

Eclipse Of The Sky and Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power have romance- your request isn't super clear on whether you want that or not? Maybe consider an edit. They're both HP/OC. That said, they're not /just/ a romance. It's a fair portion of both of them, particularly Eclipse Of The Sky, but they do have a plot otherwise.

Holy shit this request has made me realize how much romance I read, wow.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake. He was going to find him, & then kill him. Dark Harry/OC - Rating for Mature scenes

** Do you mean you want something that's not a romance of another pairing (or any pairing). Because most of what I know is other pairings tbh, but a lot of marauder era or next gen stuff (that's what I usually read).

The only story I can think of that's 100% not a romance is [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]([[http://www.hpmor.com][www.hpmor.com]]) , which is so good I've read it like 5 times and listened to a version . . . too many times. It falls pretty strongly on the you like it or you hate it spectrum though.

**** Okay, I wasn't quite sure what you wanted. So.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony]] This one is a L/J but it has a larger cast that makes it a bit more than just a romance

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7766933/1/I-Am]] This is a cute oneshot that I found while going back through my faves. It's just about the weasleys and takes like 2 minutes to read.

I think everything else I read is either never being finished or 100% romance l o l.
