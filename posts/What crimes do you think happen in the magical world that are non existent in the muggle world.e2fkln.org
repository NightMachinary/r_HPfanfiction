** Muggles are pretty creative when it comes to being criminal, I‘d say the only crimes that don‘t happen are the ones that strictly can not happen without magic.

Reading minds and mindcontrol are the only ones I am sure of, maybe stealing someones hair for kinky polyjuice sex? Bit more than identity theft that.

Can you put a relationship under the fidelius? Its not cheating if they cant remember they were together, right?

Obviously any crimes related to magical creatures/beings muggles don‘t know about, like basilisk breeding.

** Clearly, the magical world has no libel laws. Corruption also seems to be accepted as "the way things work."
