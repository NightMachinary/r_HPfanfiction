** Sit back and watch.

McGonagall has taught everyone who's gone through Hogwarts in the past thirty years. She has been the unassailable law in the school for the majority of that time. She knows how to deal with recalcitrant youths.

An inexperienced Auror is young enough not to be over that yet. They would still view McGonagall as an authority figure not to be crossed.

** You haven't really given us enough information to answer. What type of story are you writing? One that follows all seven books, one that branches off at a certain point, or a complete AU? Hell, you could be writing Harry as a squib, a battle-hardened Auror on a surprise visit to Hogwarts, or a first-year Harry raised by Lupin.

** It really depends on what the exact relationship between McGonagall and Harry was; considering that your story has an Auror actually getting physical with her (i.e. punching her), /something/ in the story went into a different direction than what we got in canon, and as such without knowing what year it is and a bit more about what's happening we can only guess which honestly isn't worth anything to you if you want real advice.

**** So ... second year, then, I presume.

In that case, Harry wouldn't have done anything; there is nothing for him to do.

You see, considering how ... juvenile this Auror behaves, it feels out of character for McGonagall to do absolutely nothing about it, and whatever she would do it would be enough to make Harry not do anything about the Auror. Heck, how the eff did he become an Auror in the first place if he is capable of hitting in the face someone who was a figure of authority at his place of learning just a few years earlier, and over something of that sort; because people who can do /that/ clearly have issues with authority severe enough that they wouldn't get into the program.

****** Even with that backstory, the Auror still comes off as a jackass with issues who needs to be fired. Cops are expected to arrest even cold blooded killers without unnecessary violence (though sometimes they don't- but they are supposed to be reprimanded for it and placed on leave if not fired).

****** While I do not expect McGonagall to /hit back/, a relative of someone who died or not she would not allow herself to be treated in such a way by anyone without doing anything in return if she could help it; the fact that she is supposed to not do diddly in your story makes her seem out of character to me.

So no, as far as I see it it's not hard to /explain/ as much as it is hard to /justify/. Because really, unless there are other factors that'd caused her to become a different sort of person---and I cannot just accept your word that it is so without either reading the story (which I cannot do because I know not what story it is or if it's even accessible) or being given that info by you (which seems to be going a bit slow, but no matter), because if we were to do that then the whole point of this post would disappear in a puff of logic---she simply is not the kind of person who would take such an attack and do nothing about it.

To add to that, by the time of the second year Harry cannot really do anything outside using of the disarming charm, a few other spells that at most rate as an inconvenience to any competent wizard, or burning hosts of Tom with his bare hands. And since this Auror is not one of Tom's hosts, Harry really doesn't have any significant options (as far as we know) and as such whatever McGonagall *would* do to the guy would be above Harry's capabilities and as such we do not see Harry as doing anything.

******** I am not being hostile. What I am doing is being a bit more blunt in that we do need more info in order to be able to actually help you, as I'd said that to you once before already, and in return I got nary a piece of information plus a bit that goes “Its . . . kinda hard to explain.”; compare the length and the content of my messages and your messages; I am giving my best to answer with the information given whereas you pretty just go “no” but don't /actually/ explain why (there is some explanation for your “no”, but without the context you have not actually given us it does not really make sense for us without trusting you blindly) and neither do you give that much more information.

Your story diverges from canon. There are changes that result in things being different, possibly vastly different, and at least one of your characters is supposed to act in a way she never would have actually behaved in canon. As such, without having at least an outline of what happens we cannot actually do shit to help you because we simply do not know and are guessing at best, and as you came here to ask what kind of action /would make sense/ for this-or-that character, guessing is a big no. And if we instead simply accept your words that “yes, this character would behave in such a way” then we will switch the viewpoint from that of a viewer to that of the writer (your viewpoint, that is), in which case whatever answer we could have given you would be worth nothing because you came here to get those who have a reader's viewpoint to tell you whether or not what you are doing with the characters makes sense.

So basically, what I want is for you to stop assuming that I am being hostile and instead make some sort of outline for people to know how the heck it all got to that point, character-wise. /Then/ you will get actual help that is worth what you want it to be worth. Because without that all we can do, excluding guessing and taking your word that it makes sense as both are terrible ideas here and now, is take the characters as we know them in canon and tell you whether it would make sense for /them/.

And do note that I am not the only person telling you that you have not given us enough information. So instead of writing “There is no need to be hostile.” when what I am doing is instead simply persistently trying to get you to give us more information and giving you whatever answer I can with the canon characters (the only ones we know in this thread as of yet) as the base, do take care of that problem. As in, show us the changes that made Harry and McGonagall so different; it does not have to be anything /too/ long, just a summary will suffice but it has to be a summary of /all/ the stuff that made them different.

**** Where did you get that from "she's his favourite teacher"? I'd call bull on that, Lupin was/is his favourite in canon :)

Your auror seems quite sexist - "woman" - he could have said: Don't teach me how to handle myself, school teacher! Instead he focuses on her being female (damned, I hate having to point this out because I am normally not an SJW or a white knight!)

**** Ok, a normal slap would probably have gotten Harry to shove him away, if he did anything. But add to that the Auror blaming her for the deaths of her students? I think that would make Harry have accidental magic and break the guy's leg, or arm, or some other really painful bone injury. Probably something that requires skelegrow, since he had recent experiences with that.
