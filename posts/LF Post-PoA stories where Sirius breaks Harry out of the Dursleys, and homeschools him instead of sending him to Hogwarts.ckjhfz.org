He has nearly died multiple times since starting school, and even though Sirius is on the run and probably not the best parent/teacher he still feels responsible for Harry, and takes him out of Britain before shit hits the fan. Preferably no other support network (i.e. Remus, Minerva helping them). Most stories with Sirius and Harry have either Harry be totally grown already, or with a lot of other people in the picture, so I'd like to see them develop a bond on their own of godfather/godson.


** Fack. I just read a really good one along these lines lemme try to find it
