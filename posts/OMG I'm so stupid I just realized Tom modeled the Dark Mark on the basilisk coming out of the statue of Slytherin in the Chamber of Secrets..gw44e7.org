** Yup yup. I didn't realise it myself until I started reading a fic last week. I forgot what it's called but Harry starts The Melting Pot, Ginny and Hermione have wrackspurts and the cure is turnip juice. They investigate the chamber and write an article in the Quibbler exposing Tommy boy. They write a book. Harry inherits Tom's property. Katie Bell's Dads make phones and laptops that work at Hogwarts. There's the infernal study game. Harry has a crush on Cho. Sirius is out of Azkaban and has an OC girlfriend. Harry accidentally cured Remus of lycanthropy using the elixir of life. They set up a play date and Lucius is there. A week later at Jade's (Nymphadora) engagement party Author accuses him of killing someone but he is innocent. Actually, I'm going to stop here in case y'all want to read it. I'll be back in like ten minutes. I'm going to hunt it down.

  the picture on the front page, which showed Slytherin's mouth opening, and the skeleton of the basilisk sliding out [...] it was essentially the Dark Mark, which Voldemort and his death eaters had used to mark their kills, but in reverse. Instead of a live snake coming out of a skull, it was a fleshed face with a skeletal snake coming out of it
