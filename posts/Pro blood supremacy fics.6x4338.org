I heard there actually are fics that are pro blood supremacy, so my morbid curiosity demands that I ask for some "recommendations", because I was lucky enough to avoid stuff like that.

  but I'm interested in seeing how the moral argument against blood supremacy would be formed
#+end_quote

That is easy:

- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1129063/][What is immoral about eugenics?]] - so outright killing the weak wizards is pretty bad.
- The magical society is small. Everyone that is there can be helpful, even if it's not as grand wizard. In fact, in a lot of jobs we see in the wizarding world magical strength and skill isn't really important!
- If they are really at a disadvantage, no further discrimination is needed: They will get appropriate jobs, there is no need to fight them as they are inferior anyways. So why do you need to insult and exclude them, or even rid Hogwarts of them? In fact, helping them as long as it doesn't cost you too much would be moral and easier.

Not that hard, to be honest. I mean even Hitler didn't say that the Jews are simply worse and that is why they should be killed, he said they were 'bad' and hurting the 'proper Germans' - so he was arguing via their 'negative influence' (that they didn't have, of course).

** I recommend this only because it qualifies on a technicality, but linkffn(Pureblood Pretense).

Muggleborns are generally less powerful and have less control over their magic than their pureblood counterparts. This is only part of the world building and has little to do with the actual plot, but none the less it qualifies.

**** Can also add that as someone who has never read Tamora Pierce's books, I still tore through this series non-stop over the course of a few days. Excellent, excellent set of fics and I'm excited to see where the story goes!

** the only one i know off the top of my head that comes close is language of snakes by falconlux. discontinued but the middling chapters started going on about how for every squib there's a muggleborn & so muggles steal magic from proper wizards, which harry listens to the origin story of and immediately feels a 'tingling rightness' about.

*** This could actually be an interesting angle, Rowling herself said that muggleborn tend to be stronger, because all the incest weakened many pureblood families. There could be a story where magic itself possesses a degree of sentience and slowly strips the blood supremacists from their magic, because they loose the ability to use it properly.

** There's kind of something like that in linkffn(Revival by xingxingzf), which is a fanfanfic of /HPMOR/. At one point the characters visit Grindelwald, and it leaves them very uncomfortable because through Nazi-style experimenting he figured out the truth about blood purity, and it's not what either the purebloods nor the Dumbledorists want to hear.

  Severus Snape decided to revive the dead ones he cared about, and tried to prevent the end of the world by Harry Potter. In the meanwhile, a certain disappeared lord had his own agenda. Note: This is a Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality sub-fanfic, HPMOR compliant except for the last paragraph in Chapter 121.

** Are you looking for stories that are more focused on like the inheritant bias in society where those of lesser blood struggle to get worthwhile jobs, or are you looking for there to be an actual tangible effect of being pureblood, such as the potential to inherit magical abilities such as metamorphmagi, parseltongue and seeing? Those usually end up as two very different types of stories (though I wouldn't necessarily just say it's cut and dry like revolution vs inheritance.

*** I want to really see the biggest bullshit stories, where the tagline is "Voldemort was right", like it was written by a racist, because I really cannot see how someone who would really identify with the Deatheater, can be fan enough that they would write HP fanfiction. Just to clarify, so there are no misunderstandings it really is just morbid curiosity, not because IÂ´m into shit like that.

** I can't remember the name(or much else)of the fic, but there was a scene in it where we follow a pure blood-wizard sitting next to his sister, who is dying of the "mud-blood drain" where a pure blood gradually loses their magic over a period of 9 months because their magic is being drained to a muggleborn who is gestating elsewhere. The scene ends with the wizard vowing to note the time in which his sister dies so that he would know when the muggleborn had birthed, so that when he met them in the future he could have his vengeance. If anyone knows which fic I'm talking, I appreciate the rec as well as OP.
