My dog took her last walk today. Feeling heartbroken. Any nice fics with good doggo's gratefully received. Ideal: Harry gets a puppy/therapy dog and there is cheesy, fluffy comfort. Acceptable: any nice dog that doesn't die.


** I can't think of any off the top of my head but will take a look around <3 I'm sorry for your loss :(

** I'm so sorry to hear about your pupper <3

I don't have any fics, but what about reading about the tiniest ever hero war dog? Smokey the Yorkshire Terrier: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoky_(dog)]] (She does not live for ever, even though all good dogs should, but she did survive the war and became a therapy dog and did all sorts of cool things. All while being impossibly adorable)

** While I can't help you, and I've never been a quadruped person, but that sucks :( Just remember, the dog wants you to be happy, not sad.

** Harry, and his sister, get a golden retriever (I think) before Hogwarts that becomes a big hit with the other first years in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer][Triumphant, the Dreamer]].

  Heather's not exactly sure how she got here, but if these people thought that they would be able to manipulate her little brother without a her raising hell about it, they were about to be unpleasantly surprised.

** linkffn(3155057) features a big black dog that plays a fairly large part for an animal (and no, it's not Sirius).

Edit: bot chose the wrong one, trying to update now...
