The other day someone linked to an "8th year" story where lots of people in Harry's year returned to Hogwarts after the war. They were all shoved into a single dorm because room couldn't be made in the Houses' dorms. I lost the thread it was linked on. Can someone help me?


** I read this - it's good apart from the overt Americanisation which made it feel very unrealistic.
