Maybe a Dark!Harry, but I don't really mind. I'd prefer any recs for including revenge on them (and Dumbledore for sending him there). I've gotten really into Dumbledore bashing lately, embarrassingly, I just can't really see past his flaws and manipulations. ðŸ˜‚


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) has Regulus and Sirius saving him after some time travel shenanigans.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) has him adopted by the Rune teacher, then he creates a successful business, invests in Grunnings just to tell Vernon "You're fired!"

Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has the Dursleys in prison after Harry runs away from home and gets adopted by the Grangers.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has Harry being trained by the Horcrux and he scares the Dursleys into doing what he wants until he eventually gets Sirius freed.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
