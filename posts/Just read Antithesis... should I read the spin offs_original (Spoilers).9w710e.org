So that was soul destroying in the most satisfying way.

I'm wary about reading spin-offs, always am, especially when they're alternative universes. From what I gather the "obverse" series are mostly comical although I'm wary of the "alternate universe - Voldemort wins" tag.

And then there's the original fic "Shadowed Malice" which I know the author said was a "nasty work" but I'm curious to see just what changed.

The problem is that sometimes it taints the view of the original fic. I once read the alternative ending to a fic which was ultimately a lot darker and a lot less satisfying and just generally Not As Good (the author said it was the original draft, oh thank God for the revision). So I was wondering if anyone had read them.

Are the spin offs harmless?

And is the original worth it/quite different? (If it's different enough I can mentally separate it from the original)


** I haven't read Shadowed Malice, but I read the original Paraslenic and now I'm constantly confused with the rewrite. I don't think I will read Shadowed Malice because of this. I do like to read spinoffs though, if they are written well. I'm sure the author [[/u/DragonGal7][u/DragonGal7]] has an opinion?

** Hello! Author here! The Obverse series were generally small spin off concepts that were made by various readers who suggested prompts. Almost all of them are comedic, and were written with the purpose of having a break from the constant angst and depressing content of Antithesis itself. The story in particular where it's â€˜Voldemort Wins' is pure comedy revolving around Adrian's obsession with adopting too many animals later on in life, and Voldemort trying to deal with it. More small stories may be added over time.

Now, Shadowed Malice is a fun thing to explain. Shadowed Malice is very different, in both plot, characters, and overall themes. Adrian is still Adrian (although instead of Selwyn he's Shadis), except he's ridiculously overpowered, bloodthirsty, and faces no ramifications for being basically savage. He's cruel, and there is no love for the character. There is no Luna in Shadowed Malice, and there is very little written about Mylla, Adalonda (who has the completely opposite personality), and Remus. There's no...Vitaedax. Instead I wrote an entire species of sentient shadow creatures from an alternate reality; Harry Shadis is known as Shadow the Dark Heir. It's all very dramatic.

Some people really enjoyed Shadowed Malice, but personally I look at it and I only see the ideas and skills of myself when I was 12. I couldn't ever compare it to Antithesis, it doesn't come close to addressing the mental illness, trauma and abuse that Antithesis strongly implies, but it's something that some people have liked. I do enjoy looking and seeing how I've improved and grown, I don't take criticism to it too harshly considering how old it is. It's very different, I doubt you'd have any difficulty differentiating the two at all.

Edit: Hey! Were you the author who was planning on writing a Time Travel story? I actually looked through your post and took advice and suggestions also! I also have an upcoming story which is Time Travel focused- I hope to see your new story posted! I'll follow it!

*** Oh that's wonderful to hear! I thought as much about the spin offs but wanted to make sure. I'll definitely be checking them out then.

Yes that does sound very different. It's fascinating to me to see how ideas and skill change over time so when I saw that such a great fic had it's beginnings else where I was intrigued. I'm glad you added all of those differences too, they're my favourite parts of your story :P (especially Luna. Your ending left me with a very satisfying sense of /completeness/ that I feel I don't come across as much as I'd like in literature). I'll be giving it a read.

Ahhhh slightly embarrassing to be recognised for those posts! Glad to know you're not one of the people I pissed off then XD. I'm still planning it but another fic has taken the forefront since my friend and I both agreed that I'm best not debuting in this fandom with what's proving to be a bit of a controversial fic. I've been inspired by you, actually, to have my try at tragedy. I'm studying the genre in college right now and it never occurred to me to actually write it until yesterday.

I'll be sure to check out yours when it gets posted! Definitely subscribing to you on Ao3 after Antithesis.

**** Feel free to give the other stories a try!

Don't worry over your posts! Honestly I posted a Time Travel Do and Don't question myself and the amount of scathing feedback was enormous! I feel like Time Travel is always going to be controversial- I personally believe that all cliche or terrible tropes can be written well, if written properly. I have complete faith that your story will be wonderful! If you'd like, we could compare notes! Especially if you're going to make a debut, I can gladly share some tips or tricks I've learned along the way!

(I'm internally screaming at the fact I've inspired you. I never imagined My work would be something which inspired others to write, it's something impossible to express. I am so so honoured and so flattered.)

***** Haha yeah, some people really seem to want the trope to die. I'd totally agree with that idea, I've read some stories where by all means /I should/ dislike them for being so formulaic but they're enjoyable because how the writer approached it.

I'd love to share once I've got more down, you've clearly got a lot of experience from your expansive fic list! I had a quick look and dayum.

It's so weird actually talking to an author of a fic I like for once XD glad I was able to let you know!

  Everyone: WBWL stories are bad

  Everyone: stories where the main character is weak are bad

  Everyone: stories with magical creatures and OC are bad

  Everyone: you can't write a super long story without any romance it'll be boring.

  Me: /Hold my beer./

Oh yeah! I do have a lot of stories under my belt, I'm hoping to get over a hundred sometime soon! I'm almost there, some stories I only post on one website or the other, but yeah I have a lot!

My plans for my next story I can already tell are going to be controversial. I am going to have so many people mad at me but I'm excited to see if I can pull it off. I'd love to talk more once you have a firm idea! I'm really excited!

Don't worry about chatting with me! Honestly I love reading stories just as much as the normal person! I just coincidentally torture characters in my free time!

** I really loved Shadowed Malice, read it within 2 days. I started Antithesis last year, and I'm still reading through (due to author updates, it wasn't complete when I first started). Because I read Shadowed Malice first, it really altered my understanding of Antithesis and I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would've. The plot is definetley different, 'Adrian' has a somewhat closer relationship with Voldemort in Shadowed Malice than in Antithesis. I would recommend reading Shadowed Malice if you liked Antithesis, but expect differences. The author was something like 12? I believe when they started writing Shadowed Malice, but it is truly well written.

** I don't know about the original, but the spin offs are pretty good in my opinion. Absolutely worth the time you need to read them, they are really entertaining! Personally, I think the last one (Flip Flop) isn't as good as the previous ones, but that could be just me

***** Hello! I can answer this!

I want to give a disclaimer that in this really quick review, I can't really explain a lot of the subtle character development that went on- so a lot of these things may seem really out of character.

Chapter 64 From what I can see, this is the start of Part 2.>! Lutain is with Skylar, Adrian is with his Father, Luna is dead. Adrian is in a depressive cycle and decided to leave his father, realizes that to do so he'd need to have Voldemort think he's no longer an 'emotional bratty teen.' Adrian also has a show down with Snape. From Chapters 65 on for a little bit, Adrian ends up killing one of Voldemort's useless Death Eaters and pretending that he is not bothered by it, showing he's powerful and not a risk to Voldemort. Adrian leaves his father and due to the symbolism, Voldemort lets him. Adrian walks out- literally, and keeps walking. Adrian gets dehydration and stress induced mental hysteria, where he sees a thestral looking at him in the distance. The thestral turns out to be Mylla (a descendant of Slytherin turned Thestral). Skylar views pensieve memories with Dumbledore to see what Harry Potter was like as a child, Skylar has a breakdown and realizes how horrible his parents were. !<

Lutain and Skylar become codependent on one another through Lutain's horcrux (Adrian), which makes Skylar sometimes unable to tell the difference in his mind, Lutain's instinctive mind, and Adrian's mind. Skylar goes on the run with Hermione and Ron to find horcruxes, Skylar finds the orphanage Adrian went to and sets it on fire.

Adrian learns about Adalonda and how she is actually a monster from Mylla. Adrian determines that he should kill Adalonda out of revenge and because it's the morally right thing to do. Learns that thestrals are made only from children that die agonizingly from being bit by a basilisk. Adrian visits Luna's house, goes into her room and sees all the letters she wrote to him, and the dress from Yule. The crashed Wizarding Economy makes life hard for everyone. Adrian has a deal with Skylar to fetch horcruxes and in return, Adrian will kill Skylar. Adrian plots how to get into Bellatrix's vault, determines he can glamour himself for public and use legal right to get in (Bellatrix granted him access before her death). Adrian meets up with Lutain and Skylar, breaks into vault, grabs the horcrux and frees the dragon. They escape, Skylar speaks Parseltongue due to Lutain and Skylar's bond, Adrian feels betrayed so he runs for it.

Skylar living as a hermit until Winter, then he visits Remus and Tonks where Adrian has been all along. Adrian slowly dying from the parasite, now its very obvious he wont live much longer. Remus slowly recovering and Tonks heavily pregnant. Adrian talks about life and morality, and what a good person is and what family is. On New Years Adrian runs out and confronts the Potters about his shitty life (this chapter was the greatest impact and one of the favourites of everyone, it's Chapter 74: Abuse)

Adrian, Skylar, Ron, Hermione run to Hogsmede and into Hogwarts; Adrian to kill Adalonda and the other three to destroy the horcruxes and Voldemort. Voldemort shows up, Lutain and Skylar trying to distract. Adalonda breaks thorugh ground and Lutain and Nagini argue, Nagini gets bitten in half by Adalonda. Adalonda and Adrian have a massive showdown, Adrian realizes he can't use any magic (increase Parasite spread and kill him) and he can't physically destroy Adalonda (giant basilisk) although her eyes can't kill him since he's a basilisk animagus as well. Adrian realizes that to kill a pest, you fumigate it. Adrian fumigates Adalonda and survives due to his obscure knowledge of magical creatures (basilisks have one lung), he crawls out into the courtyard, Voldemort arrives and in his fury over Nagini, casts killing curse on Adrian. Lutain rushes out, Voldemort casts Killing Curse.

Adrian is dead, really really really agonizing afterlife chapter with a Luna he remembers but not the real Luna, making afterlife actually hell.

Skylar uses Adalonda's corpse in Great Hall to destroy the Horcruxes. Dumbledore sacrifices himself to sustain the Hogwarts wards and buy everyone time. Rowle invades dungeons, Draco, Theo, Daphne, and Astoria all run for it, Astoria accidentally uses Legilimency and leaves Rowle a vegetable while she takes on his memories which ruin her morals/make her believe she is a monster. Astoria commits suicide.

Skylar sits with Adrian's corpse, thinking its unfair nobody will move/bury him. He's mourning over Adrian. Adrian comes back to life, severely damaged due to chemical burns, likely will survive only a few more hours. Lutain comes back to life also. All horcruxes destroyed. Skylar helps Adrian to his feet, Lutain helps direct Adrian where to look (Adrian blinded from gas), Adrian casts a super charged killing curse and due to parasite influence, it beats Voldemort's. Adrian drops, the thestrals steal him. Skylar runs to the covered bridge where Adrian is dying.

Skylar arrives and comforts Adrian as Adrian is dying for real. Adrian realizes Skylar has Adalonda's fang and asks Skylar to stab him with it (will turn him into a thestral due to curse). Skylar argues that its not fair, and Adrian explains life isnt fair. Skylar realizes that the prophecy in the story is a double prophecy: Adrian and Voldemort, but also Skylar and Adrian. Adrian finds it hilarious that Skylar was the golden boy all along. Skylar states that it isn't fair that Adrian is dying when they had a deal, Skylar infects himself with the parasite to make ends meet. Skylar stabs Adrian, and Adrian dies. The parasite manages to destroy the curse on thestrals which ultimately renders the Elder Wand useless (thestral hair as a core), and all thestrals die instantly.

There's an epilogue with Luna and Adrian in the afterlife too!

I skipped a lot of minor things that would probably make more sense, but that is the gist of it all!
