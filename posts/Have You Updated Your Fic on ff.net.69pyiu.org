Hi,

I realised after I had posted the lastest chapter of my story that FF.net isn't sending out story update notifications, and updating the date of fics.

So I thought I's start up a thread for those who have updated their stories to let readers know.

I posted chapter 51 for Imprisoned Realm for those following it. linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)


** I updated "Divided and Entwined" with chapter 55 on my regular weekly schedule on Saturday. No notification, just an error message.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Yeah, I posted a gripping chapter featuring Firewhisky and a seven-meter body pillow this Friday, but the update date didn't change.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved to the modern day.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
