asked Draco Malfoy after he received his first-year timetable at breakfast.

Basically, the idea is that Malfoy was so pampered and isolated from the real world and the Muggle world that he never learned about a century-old notion before he attended Hogwarts.

Edit: This shouldn't be taken seriously as it is a reference to the show Downton Abbey. Don't get mad in the comments.


** Hahahhah, this is a good one. I just binged Dowton Abbey for the third time,including the movie, since we went on community quarantine. The Dowager Countess' one liners never gets old. Always enjoy her banter with Isabelle. Speaking of, are there any HP fics with the same setting as Downton Abbey?

*** I by setting you mean 1912 England than I would say I don't know, but I assume their would be some fanfics who have the noble house trope, but if there is any I didn't found any and there's like twelve crossovers with Downton Abbey. I'm trying to give a Downton Abbey vibe to my story while still being it's own thing, but instead of having the English 'late-edwardian' vibe the show has it's more of a French mix between the 18th and 19th centuries. I don't really show much the life downstairs, either, since the focus is really international affairs in the greater wizarding world from the perspective of a student in Harry's year, but I try to show and tell and how the household works like they show in the series.

I think my story can come off a bit like the 1960s Family Addams sometimes with all the cousins and other distant relatives shown. Just the extended close family is twelve post chapter 5, after all, but I think that's just my eccentric and simply weird mind overthinking this. If you're looking for valets, butler, lady's maids, footmen, talking to someone's right during dinner, meeting in the Drawing Room before and after dinner, changing for dinner after the gong rings, corsets, a Dowager with an attitude, and daughters of Lords being called Lady (given name) then this is the story for you. Just a warning that I also make world building and focus a bit on the magic side of things so Hogwarts won't really feel like Downton Abbey. I'll tell you more if I find any story with the Downton Abbey vibe and would like if you told me if you did.

***** Linkffn(Scion to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Beaudelaire). Warning that I update slowly because my chapters have gotten big around chapter 5-6 and I don't want to rush my writing. If you could also review and give me constructive criticism where you can that would be appreciated.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

*** There is a non-magical AU Harry/Draco fic set in the "Jane Austen" setting, Facade by Malfoi. It is sadly unfinished and ends with a gigantic cliffhanger, but it is still a good read.

** I've always seen purebloods as arrogant, not ignorant. They may not know much about Muggle pop culture and the like, but they do know the basics of the society, if only so that they can feel superior to them.

For instance, Draco does brag about outflying a helicopter in one of the books, so he clearly does know something about Muggles. It just frustrates me when I see wizards not knowing what cars are, nor understanding basic concepts.

*** As I replied to someone else, this post is more of a joke referencing to one of the most famous one-liners of the British show Downton Abbey which shows us the life upstairs and downstairs of a 1910s then 1920s aristocrat household. The question was asked in the first season by the Dowager Countess who was born in the 1840s and as 'true gentlemen', meaning aristocrats, didn't work at the time she would never have encountered the relatively recent term and notion.

*** Calm down, it's just a joke based on a line of the Dowager in Downton Abbey. The thing is that aristocrats don't have conventional desk jobs five days a week from eight to four, they would manage their estates, go to parliament, join their friends in clubs and give to charities and be on boards. I'm applying this to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy who are most assuredly living like aristocrats. Draco would have most likely been taught things like English, mathematics and such by tutors and some other things by his mother and wouldn't have attended a primary day school with weekends which is a mid-Victorian invention.
