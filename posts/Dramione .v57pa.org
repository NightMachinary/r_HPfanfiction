On the fan-fiction website /Hawthorn and Vine/ there was a fan-fic called, /The Fallout/. Has anyone else felt as if they were going to have a phsycological breakdown?


** I've read just about every post on that site, and without a doubt TF is my favorite. Everythursday also has some other great fanfics, if you haven't checked out her other stuff you should.

** I've been on Hawthorn and Vine a couple months now, and seeing your post here was the first I'd heard of The Fallout. WOW. I am nearly done with it now and it is AMAZING.

I love Dramione and it's hard to find good, well-written ones where the characters aren't majorly OOC. Do you have any other recommendations?

** I read it. I was super skeptical at the timestamp format thing it had going on because it reminded me of journal entries (which I loathe) but was eventually able to look past it and actually give it a chance. and wow. One of the best fics I've ever read, if not the best. I rarely reread fan fiction but I am definitely going to revisit this one.

** I'm curious, not really having been a Dramione fan. How do you become a member so I can read it?

Are you having trouble registering? I had to make several attempts before it accepted me.
