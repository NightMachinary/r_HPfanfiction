:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a specific scene, I know this was a fanfic where Harry was abused by the Dursley's and Snape took him in. In this specific scene Snape and Harry are with Hermione and her mom. Snape and Mrs. Granger are talking and they bring up Surrey. Harry freaks out because he think they're taking him back to the Dursley's. I want to say they are in a parking garage maybe? I at least know they're outside of a car and Harry sits on the ground and has a panic attack. Hermione says something about “I didn't realize the Dursley's were so bad”. They calm Harry down and I want to say the reason they were talking about Surrey was because they wanted to get Dudley placed in a better home. Does anyone know what fic this is from? Any help is greatly appreciated!


** I'm pretty sure this is Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd (Chapter 27) - except not the bit about Dudley getting a better home.
