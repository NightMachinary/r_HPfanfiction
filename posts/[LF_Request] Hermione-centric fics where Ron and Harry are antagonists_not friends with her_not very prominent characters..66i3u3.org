****** Ron bullying Hermione is a very common fanon that does a disservice both to Ron (by making him out to be a bully) and to Hermione (by taking away her agency).

There may have been some minor exceptions, but Ron didn't actually initiate any interactions with Hermione prior to Halloween: it was all Hermione asking him to demonstrate a spell (and expressing her opinion on the subject), Hermione hectoring them about rules (though for good reasons), Hermione talking about not talking with them, and so on. In all evidence, Ron didn't even mean for Hermione to hear his "nightmare" remark: he was complaining to Harry in frustration about Hermione's hectoring and condescension.

If you don't believe me, I would suggest rereading the first few chapters of PS.

********** Yes! That's the point!

They both deserve consideration, including consideration for not giving the other person the consideration they deserve. Neither of them is a bad person for doing what they had done.

If an adult had behaved like Hermione or Ron (or Harry, for that matter), I would certainly think less of them. As 11-year-olds (or 12, in Hermione's case), I wouldn't, though all of them could use a talking-to in a way that makes sense to them:

1. Harry and Ron both need to be told that rules are there for a reason: magic is dangerous and there are many ways to get hurt or even killed at Hogwarts, and when an instructor tells you to stay on the ground or the rules tell you not to wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night, it's a good idea not to.
2. Ron needs to be told that he shouldn't badmouth other people behind their backs, unless it's about something important (like truthfully warning someone that the person they are considering dating has a history of abusing their significant other).
3. Hermione needs to be told to be more accepting of others' flaws (and they, in turn, would be more accepting of her own if she were); that if she feels that important rules are being violated, she should speak with a prefect or a Professor, and not try to intercede herself; and similarly, that if a classmate wants her to help, he or she will ask: unsolicited advice and help can be misunderstood as bragging or an attempt at social domination.

****** Regarding your edit, yes, pretty much. Or, if there were other incidents, I would think that they would have followed the same pattern as the ones that we got to see: initiated by Hermione trying to tell Harry and/or Ron how to live their lives or generally lecturing them on things, with Ron responding with honest annoyance.

Or, are you suggesting that Ron would secretly sneak off and harass Hermione while Harry wasn't looking? That would require him to have more subtlety than he ever showed in the rest of canon.

Hermione had not had a lot of fun at Hogwarts (at that point) because she was turning people off with her personality, and people kept doing things wrong (like wandering around hallways at night or flying without permission).

To claim that anyone was bullying her at that point requires making up off-screen events that have no support in canon, or at the very least attributing far more subtlety to the alleged bullies that they had shown before or since.

** Mate, the way you phrased that, you're asking to be deluged by bad Dramione fics that bash Harry and Ron, and where Draco is this suave badboy with a heart of gold and Hermione turns out to be a pureblood and has no personality.

Assuming that's /not/ what you're looking for, there's,

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk): Harry and Hermione sometimes end up working together, but they are also quite leery and jealous of each other; Ron thinks Hermione is scary and is always suspicious of her.
- linkffn(Wake of War by JeanHermioneSnape) is an abandoned fic that never gets to the annoying shippy parts, but it can be viewed as an interesting character study.
- In linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew), Harry and Ron aren't really on Hermione's radar, because she has enough troubles of her own.

As with lots of bad Hermione-in-Slytherin fic, there's constant Dumbledore-bashing (complete with his still being into "Greater Good"), and Gryffindor-bashing (because there apparently aren't enough bullies and other sources of conflict for a Muggleborn in Slytherin during Voldemort's second rise, so instead there's a gang of Gryffindor bullies out to get the protagonist).

Hermione, initially set up as a brilliant, powerful, and ambitious young witch with emotional scars she is trying to hide is quickly reduced to an unrecognizable woobie, who doesn't actually /do/ anything interesting with said brilliance, power, or ambition; and that's probably the saddest cut of all.

** In case it's of interest to someone, reposting an old plot bunny of mine along this lines. There's a single point of divergence: on Halloween 1991, unbeknownst to Harry and Ron, Hermione wanders back to Gryffindor Tower shortly before Quirrel lets the troll in. This leads to a cascade of events along the following lines:

1. Harry and Ron go to warn her, lock the troll in the toilets, only to have it break out just as the teachers show up, so they end up losing lots of House Points (because McGonagall doesn't reverse Snape's penalties).
2. As a result, not only is Hermione not friends with Harry and Ron, she is actually angry at them over what she feels is a betrayal (because she thought that they were friends, and then Ron called her "nightmare"), not to mention annoyed at them for getting themselves (and, sometimes, her) into trouble.
3. Hermione refocuses on her own studies, much more reluctant to help others; if she hangs out with anyone, it's the Ravenclaws, or maybe Percy.
4. Though she doesn't have friends in Gryffindor, she, ironically, becomes more popular than Harry and Ron, after Harry, Ron, and Hermione's Replacement (HR) get caught after smuggling a dragon: between Harry's Quiddich victories, and Hermione's relentless pursuit of House Points, Gryffindor actually had a shot at the cup, but then Harry, Ron, and HR went and lost 150 points in one night, /and they are refusing to tell anyone why/.
5. Eight months later, Harry, Ron, and HR, having somehow solved the Philosopher's Stone mystery without Hermione, prepare to go after the Philosopher's Stone, when they run into Hermione (as they had into Neville in canon), and she is sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory about Snape, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it.
6. She knows the Petrificus Totalus jinx, and she's not afraid to use it...

And so, Hermione Granger dooms the world through an excess of competence and common sense. (Or, alternatively, "Hermione Granger delays Voldemort's return indefinitely due to Dumbledore's Erised trap working as intended." I like the first version for irony value.)

*** Even if HP hadn't gone to save Stone, it wasn't in danger. Dumbledore wasn't stupid. He had perfect protection. And we don't even know if that was real stone. I don't see immortal Nicolas lending someone his done just to lure might-be-alive voldemort when he is old enough to remember Dumbledores 'greater good' days of DH hunt.

**** Well, I did mention that option parenthetically, though Voldemort is no slouch either. I do like the irony value of a disaster brought about by Hermione Doing the Right Thing Competently, but that's me.

Actually, if you wanted a second year out of the fic, the option of traps working as intended is indeed the better set-up: the plot hooks of CoS (Tom Riddle's Diary possessing Ginny to open the Chamber) and PoA (Sirius escaping form Azkaban) can still happen no matter the dynamic between Hermione and Harry and Ron, even if what actually happens and how it ends might be very different.

In any case, the outcome if Voldemort doesn't get the Stone would probably be something along the lines of Hermone becoming more popular in Gryffindor at Harry's and Ron's expense, since she singlehandedly stopped another embarrassing point loss in a very Gryffindor way, and it might further embitter her relationship with Ron.

Meanwhile, Draco gets a talking-to from Lucius that a mudblood beating his marks is unseemly (which is canon, but please correct me if I am wrong), and since Draco doesn't view her as Harry's sidekick anymore (and thus a part of his general Harry Problem), he might try to bully her, which could produce some fun fights in Hogwarts's hallowed hallways.

Lots of interesting character development and interaction possibilities.

** I actually would rather read a Ron-centric fic than a Hermione-centric fic tbh. Seeing through the eyes of a Mary-Sue that is only smart because she can memorise things isn't as fun as one might think. I also can't stand how close-minded she is about everything from S.P.E.W. to Muggleborn Rights. Yes, it is wrong for outsiders to come into a community and dictate their rules. If you weren't born in their culture, why do you believe you can dictate what it should and shouldn't do? It's the classic liberal anomaly that escapes me; it's no wonder JKR emulates through her.

Nice Strawman, but there are no societies that do so, mainly because the eating of their children would make it so that they wouldn't actually be able to carry on generations to eat other children. Yes, the Mongolians and Vietnamese eat Dogs.
