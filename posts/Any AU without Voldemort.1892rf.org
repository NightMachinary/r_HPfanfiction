Hello everyone. I have been reading a lot of great works made by great fan-fic authors, but many of them tend to become too generic, and focused on the same thing.

So what I want, is something entirely different, but not quite. I wonder, how Harry would grow up and who he would become if Voldemort wasn´t the looming threat that he was. Would he face perils all his life? Would he have a family?

I recently read "A different beginning" and I rather enjoyed seeing the authors take on him growing up in a large mansion with his Father alongside him. That doesn´t mean I liked everything about it, but it does make the question come to mind; are there any fics like it?

So, */TLDR: Are there any good AU fics with harry growing up without the threat of Voldemort or any fics where Harry grows up with his family?/*


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] is a story that basically shows the HP world if Grindlewald had won and Dumbledore lost. Massively AU.

*** Thank you!

Is it incomplete? I see that the last chapter posted has "End of Book I," but it hasn't been marked Complete and it also has not been updated since 2010 . . .

**** Well, so far as I can tell that particular one is complete. I think the author may have meant to write more stories in that world, an either hasn't gotten around to it or decided not to. The story itself is complete, though.

**** Sometimes I like those, too. However, other times I get lost in the middle . . . the writing just peters out.

It is interesting how fanfic readers love massive stories, while the trend in publishing is to go shorter, shorter, and shorter.

I've been reading that--if you want to have any real hope of publishing a debut novel--you have to trim it down to about 50,000-90,000 words. Anything longer than that, and it becomes too expensive an investment for publishers to risk on a new, unproven author.

** His whole life in canon is influenced by Voldemort in one way or another. If you remove Voldemort, what you have left is unrecognizable. Not saying there isn't anything out there of course, just that you're unlikely to find much.

**** It would be interesting, and to be honest I'd probably read it, but so little of what J.K wrote would remain that it would be almost entirely original. That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course. I'm just saying that less fanfiction writers would want to do something like that.

********* Well, I don't know! I'd have to do some thinking about it. I'm sure many, many things would be different.

My impression and quick online research suggests that Grindelwald, for instance, has no bias against Muggle-born or Half-Blood wizards--just against Muggles. He also doesn't seem interested in /killing/ Muggles, but rather in bringing the Wizarding World out into the open and gaining /control/ of them "for the greater good."

I highly doubt that a wizard like that would--even if he is fascinated with the dark arts--have done what Dumbledore did: let Tom Riddle, Jr. survive that first interview in the orphanage.

I can also imagine him personally selecting the most talented/promising children to attend Durmstrang, again "for the greater good" -- he'd want /them/ to be brought up with the most power. That could lead to an entirely different core trio. He might hobble other children by sending them to the other schools and offering a sub-par education.

If he beat Dumbledore and there was no LV, then the UK would be firmly under G's thumb by the time James, Lily, and their peers were in school. The entire attitude of many families might be different. Perhaps the changes would be so profound that Molly and Arthur only had one or two children--not the pack they have now. IE, Bill and Charlie, but no Ron . . . Perhaps Harry would exist, and have the tag-along sister that Ginny was at first. It's an entirely open question. An interesting one.

Thanks for the idea!

********** You are very welcome :)

Another thought. We know LV were in London doing the blitz, imagine if you would, that he died doing a bombing.

As for the evil that lurks in the shadows we should think about the era. Grindlewald is the equivalent of the nazi-movement, whereas LV is along the lines of fascism. Were it to be in the 50's to 80's we might be thinking something along the lines of a cold war drama. But the 90's?

Hmm. There might be a huge power gap, but that wouldn't really be something of interest when writing about Harry and Hogwarts.

There's always the old conflict about new and old traditions, where it's a subplot in many fanfics. Damn it! I can't think of any good antagonists from the top of my head.

*********** It's not easy, and there'd be practically no way to have canon characters still be IC in such a different world. I guess you'd have to think of who would have their beliefs most challenged by the different regime.

If Grindelwald is tied to WW2 and the nazis, it isn't a perfect parallel, not if Grindelwald had no interest in exterminating Muggles. So, we can ask--if looking for an antagonist--who would be the /real/ opponents to a world in which Wizards are openly in power and Muggles are subservient.

I guess the opposition would come from two sides: the Pureblood-supremacists like the Malfoys and the Blacks on one side (would not agree with Grindelwald that all wizards are superior to Muggles, even Muggle-borns) and rebel pro-Muggle-abolitionists. It would be strange to see an alliance of that sort . . . it would be very uncomfortable. Kind of like Spike and Buffy's compromise in Season Two of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

This would take very careful plotting and I have a hard time seeing how any of the JKR characters would survive. I mean--Hermione as a witch, but raised by parents who are basically enslaved? Harry raised in a wealthy household? Draco as the son of resistance-fighter (though not for good motivations)?

********** I think Harry would exist, but grow up with James and Lily.

With every oppressor, there's always a resistance, and I think J&L are the type of people who would secretly be a part of it. Lily, at the very least, would be strongly against Grindlewalds views. But of course, publicly speaking out against him would have.. /unpleasant/ results, so it would be more of an underground movement, like the Order of the Phoenix. Assuming Harry sides against Grindlewald, maybe something could happen, like James and Lily being discovered to be against Grindlewald, and subsequently executed? Then, Harry is left to protect his sister and get revenge.

Major characters in canon such as Draco, Hermione, Neville and Luna could be included also, although I see this story as one that happens more in the later years, with less time spent in Hogwarts. So maybe older characters such as Bill and Charlie would be more prominent. Oh and Tonks! Because Tonks is /awesome/.

I don't know, that's just my take on it. It would definitely be an interesting read.

******* [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Here]] is a story I stumbled across a while ago called /The Skitterleap/. Essentially, Grindlewald won, Dumbledore lost, and now we see the HP universe as it unfolded. It's actually really fascinating. Follows Harry, and we see some other familiar faces as well.

Edit: It has Voldemort in it, but as Riddle, and he isn't the prime enemy of Harry and the others at all.

** Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]

Very good fic, one of my favourites. Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived, Harry raised by Lily and James. Caring, well written James and Lily. No abuse, no "wrong Boy Who Lived". Harry's brother genuinely is the BWL.

There are chapters in Dark Lord Potter's WBA section that don't exist on FF.Net.
