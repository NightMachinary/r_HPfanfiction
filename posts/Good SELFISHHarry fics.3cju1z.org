Hi all,

I'm looking for fics in which Harry isn't some power-of-love-Jesus-White-Knight that looks out to save everyone and everything and cries with guilt when he can't.

*In other words, I'm looking for a Harry that can watch out for himself, put his needs above those of others, and is in general capable, stands up for himself, and is intelligent* compared to a weak Harry in many fics that wouldn't stand a chance in Rowling's last few books.

I've read through all of Taure's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][excellent favorites list]], which has many examples of what I'm looking for.

Seriously this is the best HP fanfiction i think I've ever read (crossover with HP and Dresden Files)

I was hoping to release an update by the end of June and then the rest of the Year 4 chapters by the end of July, but that estimate was very optimistic. I just recently completed a cross-country move which has taken up a lot of time. It's unfortunately slowed my writing down and that's why you the projection has been missed and you haven't seen an update in a while.

Fingers crossed - I hope to have an update out in a week or two and the rest of Year 4 completed by the end of August.

Moving is the worst.

**** I know. But, well, looking at all the other recommendations in the thread, as well as the OP, there seems to be this weird assumption that "selfish" implies "ambitious, hard-working badass".

When you consider that magic lets you get away with doing much /less/ work to get pretty much everything short of immortality, that seems to me like an odd jump to make. It's only if you want some sort of a legacy, or to change the world (for good or for ill), or to be respected and admired, that you have to roll up your sleeves.

It's telling that in many of the fics mentioned so far, Harry isn't, actually, selfish. In /HP and the Boy Who Lived/, his very Animagus form exemplifies loyalty and protectiveness, and he accepts a sanity-destroying punishment on behalf of his girlfriend; in /On the Way to Greatness/, he reveals his mastery of Dark Arts in order to save a random pair of classmates from cursed objects; and in /Hogwarts Battle School/, he risks his life to rescue others at least once or twice.
