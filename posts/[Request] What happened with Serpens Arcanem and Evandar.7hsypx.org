I loved Serpens Armarum and Serpens Arcanem and it pains me the latter will never be finished but while looking for the fics to reread I discovered they were no longer on AO3 nor on FanFictin.net. I also saw that Evandar has posted on their FF.net profile that they "have had enough". My question is does anybody know what happened with Evandar and the fics? Also has somebody tried continuing Serpens Arcanem?


** I don't know what happened, but the stories are still on fiction hunt

** The author wrote a comment to someone in her LiveJournal back in 2014 that she started the story very young. She wasn't the same person anymore, and her writing style was different too. She had said even if she had inspiration for it, she wasn't sure she could do it justice. Officially it's on hiatus. If anything more ever comes of it, it'll be published on their AO3 account.

*** I actually wrote to her to ask her about it. She said people were incredibly rude to her about the story being on a hiatus for so long that she regretted ever writing it and just want to forget about it
