Since most of us grew up on Harry Potter (and quite a few of us are big Doctor Who fans, Sherlock fans, so on and so forth fans...), we probably have a better understanding of British culture and lingo than say the average American. But do you ever have moments where you go "crap, I honestly don't know..." or have someone call you out in a review? What do you do to combat this anxiety? Also, tell stories if you got them :)

I once had someone fuss at me for using the word "awesome" in dialogue, saying that it was mostly an American thing.


** As an American, I have a patriotic duty not to feel bad about not being British.

That said, I do like to gather Britishisms to include in the background, and even I find that an obviously American phrasing of dialogue coming from a British character to be jarring.

Also, I've picked up their allergy to the letter 'z', so I rely on my spell check to remind me that all those 'ise's should be 'ize's on U.S.-made work-related documents. Americanize, for the win.

*** Haha, I gave up on spelling after awhile! It wasn't my best subject, so the fact that I can manage to post a document with correct spelling (even if it's American spelling) is good enough for me!

** Dear all American writers,

Nobody in England has ever said Grandmum. Stop writing it, it's not a word. Mum is a word grandma, grandmother and nana are words but not Grandmum! I swear to christ every single fic has it in and it makes me howl with frustration. Also, we don't say teakettle we say kettle and we only use snog in a derivative manner, no-one says let me snog you, that's gross.

An Englishman.

** Lots of HP fanfic writers used to have a 'Brit-picker', not sure if its still a thing anymore. I find that poor writing puts me off a story a lot more than improper slang does

** I'm Canadian. When I write fanfiction, I wish that I could have a better grasp on British-isms. I have been a bit lazy about compiling a list, so I tend to use what I know from movies or books. Unfortunately, some of those get really repetitive and some readers do take notice.

Fortunately, some Canadian ways of spelling words (defence, neighbour, colour) are also the same or similar to the British spelling, so I have a leg up in that respect.

I think what would help is if I went to England for a year. Of course, I don't have the money, so would anyone be willing to finance my trip? Haha.

*** Try watching some of the shows from the UK to help you get a grasp on locations and such. Honestly one of the best ways to do this is to watch Top Gear and you can not only pick up on the locations and really get a sense of the climate but also when they cover topics, you can see how muggles would view politics when talking about transport and commuting in London.

*** Haha, I wish. I actually did live in England for four months while studying abroad. I think I have a better grasp on the location of everything, but then again, I could have figured that out from using a map (which I did frequently to get around). I'm also able to picture things better - like roads and houses and such. The little differences from my country are what surprised me the most. That doesn't help my writing THAT much, but it makes my mental visuals much better.

It also helped me realize how much I didn't know. There were times when I would talk to locals and just respond "Pardon?" because I didn't catch a word they said. Especially in Wales.

** I try to include britishisms that I understand, the ones I don't know full well, I do not use.

I try to avoid "american"isms as much as possible as well, but it isn't that hard as long as you know your character.

** I have Brit friends who nitpick for me when they notice discrepancies. Occasionally, I get a reviewer who points out Americanisms but they're usually nice about it; on the opposite end of the spectrum, readers who assume I'm British. Since my writing only consists of HP fic, my writing vocabulary is this weird Brit/American English mix, and dialogue-wise I'm accustomed to writing in a British cadence. I'm going off all the Masterpiece Theater I watched growing up!

** No, I don't really care so I don't stress about it. Hopefully the double-quote dialog marks suggest I'm not, actually, British.

I do attempt to stick to a style that seem right to me, based on the dialog from the movies and whatever made it into the American versions of the books that I own and read. Sometimes, I let stuff slide.

In fact, I have occasionally attempted to suggest that Muggleborn students might have had the same cultural corruption as everyone else in the world, including watching movies like normal people. So if someone says "awesome," maybe they saw Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure ('89) last year?

I've changed things once or twice due to Brit-pick suggestions, but running my casual fanfic through a process? Ah, no.

** Also Americans have the realise the UK is four distinct countries, each with their own offical language, culture, dialect, history what have you to the point where stereotypes happen (see scouser for details).

Honestly i'd be more than happy to BETA but I have no clue at all where to start advertising. :/

(Sorry Americanisms are a big pet peeve /flinches from oncoming downvotes/)

** I'm not american, so I never really felt bothered. I did learn the british spelling in school and I love to use all those british insults like prat, twat, git and so on. But I'm not writing that much fanfic in the first place.

** As a writer I don't really care one way or another. My goal with fanfiction is to improve my own writing. I'm often working on loose concepts that I'm going to try to apply to original work at some times and using Harry Potter as a playground. So I write them much like I would anything else more worried about the story than their British origins.

I am secretly amused when I get reviews telling me I shouldn't use 'mom' because the characters aren't American. But yet they never point out that they say color rather than colour, Izes over Ises and do use a more 'americanized' language in general. No, it's only 'mum' that bothers them. And honestly, I'd find it bad writing if I used American everything and then Mum randomly. I'd rather it be consistent, one way or the other.

** I used to worry and fret over it [and american here] and that just lead to me not writing at all but then I thought, 'it's funny people want to brit-pick but I know for a fact that none of my british friends have someone american-pick for when they write supernatural fanfiction'.

So I say screw em and write with british spellcheck on and go from there. The people who willl read it will read it and the ones who won't won't. Some of the best fanfiction I have read in the fandom are by non-brits and no they aren't all 'they had a spot of tea pip pip' but they aren't 'then he AK-d that mofo' either....though the latter I may read just to laugh.
