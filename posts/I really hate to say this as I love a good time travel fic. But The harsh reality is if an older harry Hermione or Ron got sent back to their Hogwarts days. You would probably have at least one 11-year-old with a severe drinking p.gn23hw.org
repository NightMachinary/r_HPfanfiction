Can you imagine Minerva McGonagall's Reaction to Percy Weasley filing a complaint about depressed 11-year-olds binge drinking around the common room fire muttering about evil spirits and rat bastards. The Head boy showing even greater concern when reporting To the deputy headmistress about The golden trio plotting to a prison break to liberate a mass murderer during one particularly indulgent bender.

​

I don't know if this scenario is hilarious or sad but That possibility in time travel fic Gets overlooked a lot

​

​


** Is it really probable though? Amazingly, alcohol is not the thing everyone turns to when faced with stress. You point out that many adults in Britain choose to drink recreationally but with that argument, you neglect the difference between recreational and addictive drinking.

​

It gets even more improbable when you look at the characters personalities. You have Harry, Ron, and Hermione who have gone through so much together and faced a lot. Interestingly, you didn't find Harry, Hermione, and Ron binge drinking at 17 when being hunted down by the ministry and death eaters.

​

The real harsh reality is that they probably wouldn't be interested in going to Hogwarts. They'd probably meet up with Dumbledore, start working to get rid of Voldemort's horcruxes, and pursue legal and extralegal means of aiding Sirius.

** Why? Not everyone copes with alcohol addiction. Or any addictions. Lots of people are healthy and normal enough not to turn to drugs and poisons just to get by in life. Or to handle stress and trauma. I actually hate how prevalent this is in fanfiction, like it's "just the thing you do". It's not, and it's actually the worst thing you could do. It isn't cool or healthy. And I don't think it's as common as fanfic authors think either. Where like every other character is a binge drinker or whatever.

*** I can understand your point of view but The reality is most of Britain has at least one alcoholic beverage every day I think the statistics is at 60% which is the majority of the population and if you have characters that might have been in their late 20s or early 30s sent back in time to relive the most difficult and possibly traumatic years of their lives you have a good possibility with the cultural normals of the UK of The golden trio at least having a few nights where they get blackout drunk. They might not be alcoholics but they might a few too many firewhiskeys to cope with the stress. Alcoholism isn't healthy but its still very common.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
