Are there any fics where fem!Harry has the red hair + green eyes of her mother? For some reason, lots of fics like to give her James' eyes if she gets her mum's hair. Bonus points if she was also named Lily since she looked so similar when she was born.

The general premise would be that when she arrived at the Dursley's, Petunia tried to hate her, but she looked so much like the young Lily Evans that she missed so much, she couldn't bring herself to do it. Snape would also have trouble acting nonchalant trying to teach her but the memories would be so much more painful. Her personality would be less timid than canon and her interactions with her peers would be vastly different because of her gender anyways.

It also would be cool if the interactions at platform 9 3/4 varied from canon too. I don't have anything against the Ron and Hermione gang, but it seems so implausible for everything to be so close to canon despite such a huge deviation. She wouldn't be dropped so late if the Dursleys actually treated her decently and she wouldn't have run into the Weasleys at that time too. Or maybe she hit it off with the Weasleys so much more since she looks like she could be part of the family. She would get more attention and get along better with the others and that could make Ron jealous and negatively impact their interaction in their first year.

The idea sort of popped into my head and I supposed that if I thought of it, many others before me probably have too.


** Snape would be so confused.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** Not really what you are asking for, but in linkffn(Red Sorrow) Harry has a half sister who looks like Lily. Her father is Snape though (although she only finds out later in the fic) and she was raised by him apart from Harry.
