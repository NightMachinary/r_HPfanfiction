So one of the five principal exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration is that you can't conjure nutritive food (nor, possibly, transfigure it from non-nutritive material). I've seen fics with a couple of different interpretations - either it's completely impossible, it only has the nutritional value of whatever you made it from, or it will eventually revert (much to the dismay of whoever ate it).

Outside of maybe that last example, why not use magic to produce huge amounts of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-Glucose][L-Glucose]]? It's prohibitively expensive to make by normal means, at least at present, but could be hugely valuable as the perfect zero-calorie sweetener. In the same vein, there are plenty of other substances that are ridiculously expensive to produce and therefore extremely valuable - a clever witch or wizard could stand to make a /lot/ of money...


** Presumably for the same reason the Weasleys all buy and wear second hand clothes rather than just conjuring or transfiguring them.

Honestly canon gives us no actual reason here, nothing ever indicates such spells are temporary.

** Molly uses a charm to create a sauce. The Weasleys are considered poor but eat a lot of food. It seems that magic allows for easy and therefore cheap production of food. I doubt an artificial sweetener would be highly valued.

Incidentally, transfiguration in canon is permanent. Conjuration is the act that is not.
