** Linkffn(Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage) is my favorite, personally.

Linkffn(Child Of The Storm) has a few crossovers. One of which is Dresden Files. Dresden is a fairly important character himself in some parts of the story, but I wouldn't describe him as a main character. The Summer Lady and Knight also make an appearance, iirc.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
