Everything with more than 50 thousands words will be much appreciated. The longer the better. I'm going through a depressing period of my life and reading about Snape rescuing Harry from his abusers (whoever they are) helps me cope. The abuse can be whatever physical, sexual etc.


** Try [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3048][To Trust]]. Harry is located in London just before his first year at Hogwarts and is placed with Snape for the time being. There are some heavy themes, but the fic deals with the subject of abuse and abuse recovery really well.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** Most of my favorite fics where Severus is truly Harry's bio dad are unfinished but here's some where Severus is his dad in every way that counts!

Also this is my favorite so I'm giving tons but I've read so many!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5926514/1/Perception-is-Everything][Perception is Everything]]

When Severus Snape is left in charge of Hogwarts over the christmas break, he is less than pleased to discover Harry will be one of his charges. Events force him to face that Mr Potter may not be quite what he has assumed all these years. Year 6

Love this Snape rescue! With the added bonus of some great Remus moments as well, because let's be honest Snape isn't the best at feelings.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1008166/chapters/1999790][A New Place to Stay]]

Harry Potter is called up to Dumbledore's office and told he was being moved elsewhere to keep him safe. He no longer has to stay at the Dursley's, but Dumbledore tells him he has to stay with Severus Snape. For a few days it seemed like a bad idea. Until Severus Snape uncovers the truth of who Harry Potter really is and what he's been through. Watch as Severus does as nobody else has done before him. He takes care of Harry. Watch him flourish into who he was meant to be, a boy with the heart of a Gryffindor and smarts of a Slytherin. The Dursley's, Umbridge and Dumbledore had better watch out Severus is out for revenge. Spy or no spy, Severus is not allowing anyone away with hurting Harry.

You've got to stick with this one it doesn't start strong, but once you get past that first summer it's amazing!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13357839/1/The-Potions-Apprentice][The Potions Apprentice]]

AU Harry is abused by the Dursleys. he hopes to be able to save himself somewhat through the use of potions since underage magic isn't allowed, so starting 4th year he will try much harder to get good at potions. Will Snape help or sabotage him? Set after PoA - Snape as mentor - no slash - Abusive Dursleys - No Triwizard tournament and Horcruxes are not a thing. COMPLETE

Sequel in progress but was literally updated today! Great story!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2519543/1/][Skin Deep]]

Harry and his friends create a new type of magic embodied in Harry's tattoos to keep him protected from his uncle. When the new magic works Harry is removed to Hogwarts where Dumbledore finally tells him the truth. Severitus. Written PreHBP HarryBill

Warning: abandoned but I honestly remember almost being ok with it? Like they didn't finish the Harry Potter arc but still great for the story told.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6500900/1/Moment-of-Impact][Moment of Impact]]

An accident the summer before 6th year puts Dumbledore's plans for Harry in motion sooner than planned. Will an unexpected truce with Snape better prepare Harry for what is to come? A Snape mentors Harry fic with all the regular players. AU after OOTP.

Completed Series!

Now I've placed this one last because I don't actually remember if there is any true “abuse” (I'm a firm believe that the abuse was canon) but Snape 100% saves Harry here and they're relationship is so realistic. My favorite moment “He has feet”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/329404/chapters/531524][The Definition of Home]]

Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.

Ok I lied this is the last one. Once again no “abuse” but Snape gives Harry exactly what he needs, a home. Plus how they complete the HP arc and battle is the most unique I've ever read!

If you want more I can browse my favorites lists!

This is the most unique story I think I've ever read in HP fanfic! It's very heavy and dark. Not the tropey dark but handle dark subject matter. This was seriously so cool!

When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?

Broken Mind Fractured Soul Sensiblytainted Summary: Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else.

Just one conversation between two eleven year old boys goes slightly differently, and the world changes. Just how much will be different with Harry being sorted into Slytherin, and how much will stay the same?

Swung by Serafim Summary: In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them. The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success. Other consequences are not short-term at all.
