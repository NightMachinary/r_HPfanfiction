A lot of the fics I encounter (not to mention canon itself) treat the muggle world as novelty at best or as a place to escape from.

What I really want to read is a story about muggleborns who don't give up on the muggle world just because they're magic. Maybe they have sibling who aren't magic- what is their relationship? How would a muggleborn manage to live both lives? Perhaps he chooses to work in the muggle world but not to sever ties with the magical one.

Anyone has a recommendation?


** This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but in my WIP story one of my Muggle-born OCs was raised by her older brother. I really enjoy the dynamic between the two of them and Todd Ollivander, my other protagonist, so much so that I'm going to delve into it in the next chapter I'm currently working on.

Here's a taste in Chapter 18: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723602/18/The-Ollivanders]]

*** Actually I'm an avid reader of the story and I'll use this opportunity to tell you it's one of my favourites. However I love it for very different reasons from what I'm looking for.

Glad to hear Simon's making another appearance, he's great.

***** Oh, I get what you were trying to say. When you wrote "I just finished", you meant "finished reading", not "finished writing", as I first interpreted it.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.
