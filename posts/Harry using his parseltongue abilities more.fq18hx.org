Maybe in a spell or talking to the potraits, and snake familiars/pets are very appreciated!


** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man has all that and oh so much more. It's a bit long-winded at times, but in my opinion, it's one if the best wrong-boy-who-lived, mystery stories out there.

It's fun and heartbreaking, at times vindicating and frustrating. And nobody is stupid, or makes inexplicable choices simply for the sake of plot progression. And parseltongue plays a considerable role in the story.

*** Ah, the famous Prince of Slytherin. Truthfully I only got through about 3/4 of it or less when i read it. Not because it was lacking, in fact it contained all my favourite tropes, (and Reglus's backstory was fabulous) but because I have a very short attention span LMAO.

Thanks for the rec, tho, and I might even revisit it if I'm particularly feeling The Vibe. Hope you're staying safe!

Lol, then you better stay away from "like none other". It is looong! After seeing it got updated I started reading the whole series again, only to give up halfway through the first part.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8106587/1/][Deconversion]] is something I read several years ago. I remember it involved Harry in St. Mungo's because of his parseltongue abilities, and Draco Malfoy saves him. Somehow. It's probably Drarry.

*** Hmm, Lomonaaeren fics are holes that are scary and deep to delve down. I might give it a go if I'm feeling particularly jaded, but Dark!Harry is something that I will never enjoy. Thanks for the rec tho, and I hope you're staying safe!

**** You know, that's a very valid opinion. That author has, what, 300 fics? Honestly crazy. Dark!harry is an acquired taste, I think. Deconversion does get pretty weird (as far as I can remember), but I haven't read it in years. I haven't been out of the house in a week! It's great! I hope you're doing ok too!

***** Ikr! If anyone knows how on Earth they manage to write so much I'd love to know. I love some of their fics tho, like Practising Liars, Brother to A Basalisk, and a few others I can't remember the name of lmao.

But I am hands down terrified of Dark!Harry. I'm a very emotional/empathetic reader and so it definitely isn't good for my mental health or the people around me if I'm constantly reading from the viewpoint of a racist, lethal and mindless killer/torture ðŸ˜… Also yay! I wish I had the privilege but my mom keeps dragging me to the grocery store ahhaa. Sorry for the long paragraph :/

****** I'm also an empathic reader! I tend to put myself in the place of the character, so while dark/evil Harry is fine (I tend to empathize with the side characters then, I think) I can't stand gaslighting or other mind-altering things... I recently read a fic where Stockholm syndrome played a big part and while it was really interesting, I wouldn't re-read it for the world. My county has implemented a stay-at-home order, so my family is trying not to go out too much except for the occasional walk. Talking is fun! Maybe I should go out more, if I'm so willing to strike up a conversation with a stranger... (no offense, you've been a very nice stranger)

******* Exact same problem-- I've been one of those obsessive readers since childhood (only now its reformed into a strange fanfic addiction. What am I supposed to say when someone asks me what I'm reading currently?!) I sometimes read Dark!Harry fics out of a morbid intrest and they make me feel disturbed for days. I too, am supposed to be staying at home other than buying food, etc, but for some reason my mom keeps needing to stock up- I don't really approve but there's not much I can do against her authority unfortunately.

Talking is very fun (sometimes)! I can appreciate that ahahaha, I often get caught up in taking with everyone (especially if it's something that I'm passionate about) and it seems you've been dragged into the bubble. Fun fact: I was in the delicate process of being maybe-diagnosed with Aspergers before this pandemic blew out. And no one I know reads Harry Potter fanfiction (probably a good thing)

** Seriously Snapped by TheRogueHuntress

Hilarious, really! And Sirius is alive, bonus points! Harry has a snake named Baneofallrodents. Ding! goes Harry's bullshit detector. Other hijinks ensue.

** Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady

A really intricate Slytherin Harry AU, with lots of divergence from canon. This Harry is neutral magically (Dark religiously), and seems more 'Claw than Snake most of the time. Quite a unique characterization, nice magical world detail, many characters to appreciate who are three-dimensional and complex. Love the pagan religion practice.

WIP series, Part 6 completed in 2018.

** Grounding Magic series by NotVampireJasper

I love the deeply characterized Harry in this 'verse, and how his past and religious beliefs affect the way he lives and how he treats others. He could be angry or bitter, but he's content and peaceful, while still purposeful and driven to learn and create. This is a Harry that I would love to be friends with.

Series still actively being written, last updated in February 2019
