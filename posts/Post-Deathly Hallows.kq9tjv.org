I'm of thinking that JKR's write ups on the world after Deathly Hallows are a tad unrealistic and too perfect. What are your headcanons on what the wizarding society looks like today?


** I mean the Death Eaters that escaped the battle and there definitely was some would have wanted revenge

** If we talk about the British wizarding world, I think the next Dark Lord is gathering his forces. Whoever he or she is.

Everyone is concerned about that virus thing, that presumably eats magic forces and make squibs out of wizards.

** The Statute of Secrecy can't hold given modern surveillance. A wizard apparates in front of a security camera he doesn't recognize, it's uploaded in Youtube and treated as a hoax. Accidental magic is accidentally recorded or sent live into Facebook or Instagram and it's treated as a hoax. The people handling the security cameras at King's Cross notice the wizards going to Hogwarts (or stuff getting erased) and the government helps the Ministry cover it up, but there is just too many people silenced/obliviated/in the loop. A campsite is filled due a wizarding international event and the algorithms of Tripadvisor and other sites notice. Eventually, a dragon escapes, it's recorded and it blows out before the wizards can stop the news. Simply put, too much stuff gets accumulated to be treated as a hoax.

So the muggle and wizarding world go to war for supremacy and Dumbledore is universally despised by wizards for having stopped Grindelwald, who's proven to have had the right idea after all.

*** I was with you right up until you said that the guy whose whole schtick was that wizards should subjugate muggles for their own good was right all along.

**** The question is: can wizards and muggles coexist? If not, and one would rule the other, then wizards will want to make sure it's wizards rather than muggles doing the ruling.
