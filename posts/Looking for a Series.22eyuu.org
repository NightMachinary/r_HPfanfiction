I read a Series of stories about a year ago that I would mind reading again.

From what i remember they start out in Diagon Alley in Harry's first year.

At the robe shop when Harry meets Draco, he and Draco discover they can talk in their minds. During the time their in the robe shop Draco see's memories of Harry's abuse but Harry asks him to keep it secret.

Once their at Hogwarts the act like they don't like one another but through their link Draco comforts and talks to Harry.

That's all I remember.

Thanks.
