** Marriage law is my most hated trope in this fandom. It's such a blatant rape law that even Nazis and Stalinists didn't dare to push. Only the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields][Khmer Rouge]], the worst scum of the 20th century, did something similar.

But If they passed the law before Voldemort's defeat, before our heroes really got strong, the most likely outcome would be an exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243).

But if they tried to pull the same crap on the Vanquisher of Voldemort, then violent revolution would be most likely. Maybe Harry wouldn't go as far as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), but significant bloodshed should be expected.

Good guys could only be pushed so far.

The author of Nightmare of Futures Past wrote an (anti) marriage law fic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901). Basically, Harry was badly hurt after his win over Voldemort and was in no shape to fight the Ministry. So, he hired some super assassin SI from America to take out those responsible for the marriage law.

Bobmin356 wrote the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536), in which a super!Harry took out those responsible by himself.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098429/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter and the Marriage Law]], linkffn(13098429), Harry staged a coup d'etat by assassinating those responsible Wizengamot members.

Honestly, the 'marriage law trope' was an utterly brain dead idea cooked up by delusional shippers who wanted to force their favorite characters together. They had no sense of how real world people would respond to that kind of shit. As for governments wanting to stimulate population growth, tax incentives, child credits, and other privileges are the way to go.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.
