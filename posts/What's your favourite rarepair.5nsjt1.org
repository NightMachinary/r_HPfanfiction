** Harry/Katie. Unfortunately there's really not much of it.

I also confess that i have a thing for Harry/fem!Harry that I can only partially blame on my love for dimension travel fics.

Seriously. Only a year older and on the same sports team? You'd think that'd be one of the pairs people would jump at.

Then again, we don't really get many bro-fics with the quidditch team, that I know of at least.

And while we're on the topic, whyyyyyy the fuck do people pair Katie with Flint? Seriously, why?

**** Equal and Opposite was already mentioned but there's also linkffn(3992226) if you don't enjoy dark!Harry (although Equal and Opposite is fantastic and i loved it despite, or maybe because, the frankly terrifying Harry)

There was another one that's fairly popular though not as well written but i can't quite recall what it was called. It shouldn't be too difficult to find though, there were quite a few posts on this topic on here in the past.

Nonetheless I found the interaction between them wortwhile to read. The last one is the best out of those in my opinion, even if it's a bit short.

******* Annnnndddd I'm hooked.

Oh! I've just remember this fanfic (and it has a sequel). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2255955/1/Bed-of-Roses]] I read it the first time years ago, so it may not be quite as grand as I remember it, but it does have a special place in my heart. And I think was the first SB/HG pairing I read.

***** You rang?

linkffn(If You Could See What I See) isn't finished and may or may not be abandoned, and rather contrived for some tastes, but the buildup of the relationship was quite enjoyable and hit all my high notes for good Sirius stuff.

** Hermione/Theo is my otp. I think Slytherins balance Hermione's activism really well, and I've always thought Theodore Nott was a quieter, more studious Slytherin, which makes this more realistic for me than Hermione/Draco. Unfortunately, I usually have to settle for Hermione/Draco fics where Draco is particularly intelligent and a bit softer than usual.

** Harry/Hermione/Luna : It seems to always be Ginny with Luna in these types of things.

Harry/Tonks : Might not seem that rare but in comparison to other major characters it really is. At least.. well done ones.

I always love time travel stories where Harry is paired with the Black sisters or at least A black sister. Those also feel rare.

And then there is always Harry/Hestia

PS: I second those on the Harry/Katie front. I am always a sucker for a good Harry/Katie story but they are much rarer then folks seem to think.
