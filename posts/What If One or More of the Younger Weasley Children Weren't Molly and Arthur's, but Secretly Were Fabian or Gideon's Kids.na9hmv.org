I've been thinking about this the past few days. What if one or more of the younger siblings turned out to actually be the orphan(s) of one of the Prewett brothers? I can think of so many weird and interesting ways that could go and I'm really wondering what other people think of this idea.

Like, for instance, maybe the Weasleys record of not having birthed any female children for generations still holds true, because Ginevra Molly Weasley was actually Ginevra Molly Prewett. It's just a very well kept secret.

Or maybe Ron was secretly a Prewett son. Maybe that's why he always feels a bit "othered" by his family. Molly doesn't pay less attention to him than his siblings because she's just overwhelmed by so many kids. Maybe she has a hard time giving Ron the same treatment as his brothers and sisters because she's never gotten over the loss of her brothers and it makes it difficult for her to be normal with him. Maybe his older siblings know and that's why they all treat him with varying degrees of disinterest or antagonizm. Or perhaps his parents did an innocent little memory charm just to make sure the kids all accepted him as their real brother but on a subconscious level they still somehow just get a sense of it and that drives their behaviors.

I could honestly go on a what if for every single Weasley kid, but I'd rather hear what other people could imagine!


** Not quite what you were looking for, but this one has all /seven/ Weasleys be adopted.

  AU. Harry Potter always wondered about how easily the Weasley family accepted him. Turns out, he wasn't the first child taken in. So yeah, this turned out darker than I intended. Whoops. One shot.

*** That was my thought! But, he would need to be a lot like the unknown mother personality wise. I think it somewhere acknowledged that the Prewetts were similar to most of the Weasleys personality wise

*** It could. I'm no writer, but I've been trying to figure out if I can do something with this idea. It would be awesome to explore how the world would be different depending on which Weasley was actually a Prewett. ðŸ¤”

** Something slightly similar: as a reaction to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf%3Cspan%20style=][my own prompt]], I have started to work on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][this story]] of Ginny being actually Harry's sister.

** What about Fred and George? Fanon sometimes compares them to Gideon and Fabian as pranksters. Plus Molly can never remember which one's which!

Plus aren't Fabian and Gideon twins (or is that fanon too?)

*** I don't think OP meant that. I think they meant that Molly's brothers (and their respective wives) were killed in the war and she is raising her nephews/niece as if they were her own.

**** but then why the secret, unless its a molly bashing story there is not really a reason to keep an adoption secret, because narativley it just provides a point of contention between ginny and her "parents" when they find out they actually aren't

***** Gideon and Fabian were targeted in the first war for opposing Voldemort. If Ron or Ginny were the kid(s) of one of them, death eaters could have targeted them. Molly and Arthur were much less involved in the first war, if I recall correctly, and as such keeping the adoption a secret would mean less risk.

*** Uhh, yeah, I meant like she was raising the children of her deceased brothers and whoever their partners had been. Incest is definitely not the first place my mind goes when someone says "a woman raising her dead brother's child." That's just... ðŸ˜¨

And why the secret? Because why not? Because it's just an idea of something that isn't canon and if people are allowed to think up stories about Harry Potter being an anime cat creature, Tom Riddle being raised by Hermione, and all other manner of odd plots then why is Molly raising an orphaned niece or nephew while passing them off as her own so unacceptable?
