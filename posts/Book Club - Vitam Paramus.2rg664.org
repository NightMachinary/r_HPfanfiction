I'm also running short on recommended fics. If there are any you think would be a good choice for the book club, be sure to submit them via the button in the sidebar.

** I thought it was a really nice, understated slow burn and Harry had hidden depths that had yet to be revealed.

Then it ended, and I realized it wasn't building towards anything, and Harry was just very boring.

*** I'd argue he's not so much boring, as an adult. The 'depths' are hinted at, but not fully explored, because the story focuses on such a short amount of time. It wouldn't quite make sense for Harry to open up about everything when he's really only spending a month of actual time with Gabrielle.

**** I actually liked the more adult, grown-up Harry. It was a nice change of pace from the usual fanfic (although not something I'd want to read a bunch of). And I'm fine with depths only being hinted at. I even agree with you that, from a realism standpoint, it makes sense that Harry didn't really develop, change, open up, whatever.

My point is that it's a story, and traditionally stories have things like conflict and development of themes. Stories traditionally have structures that center around rising action and some kind of climax. The fact that I didn't realize the fic was over until the author slapped a "complete" label on it means it failed - for me - to resolve itself in a satisfying way.

I'm not trying to trash this - it's pretty well-written, and like I said, I did enjoy the change of pace. In the hands of a once-in-a-generation writer, it could have been a phenomenally understated meditation on loss and ennui in the same vein as /The Sun Also Rises/. As it stands, it's more of a curiosity - a piece with some interesting pieces, some tantalizing hints at depth that are never realized.

***** Well I'll certainly never claim to be Hemingway. But it does amuse me that your critique for VP is almost identical to the first critiques for the referenced novel. At least I left out the homophobia and anti-semetism, right?

I don't know if it's really fair, for lack of a better term, to think of VP as a story. I didn't really write it as one. It's my least planned fic and looking back on it it should have been much, much shorter (not unlike aSAR)

But at the same time, I understand there isn't really any other way to view it. I tried something rather out of my comfort zone and while I'm happyish with the final results. I'm going to make a long-winded post about my views on VP shortly. Although I'm not sure if the author is really supposed to interject his opinion in the discussion, but well, why not?

****** Yeah, that's about right. I was happyish reading it, as well. Maybe if you'd been a bit clearer about what the project was in the beginning, my expectations for where it was going would have been tempered?

I'm definitely curious, now, how you view it, if you don't view it as a story.

******* I don't really know, which is half of the problem. I mean, as a whole, it can't /not/ be a story. Because it is. But I wrote it without planning a standardized plot. I wanted it to just be three months of the minutia of life, knowing full well that wouldn't entertain many people outside of myself.

It's why I can't really argue with people who say 'it doesn't really have a plot'. As a whole it doesn't. It's just sort of writing about life of people for a set amount of time. It would have probably been a better story if that set amount of time was like a week that focused a bit more on Harry before the accident, had the accident, and ended a few days after. But I got stubborn about the 'summer' concept and went from there.

***** Not really in HP. I'm screwing around with a Frozen fic. I may work on TV a bit here or there, but mostly I'm moving on from Fanfiction and trying to do more real writing.

*** There probably won't be a part two. I've kicked around a few epilogue ideas, but they're epilogues that would appeal to me, and likely not most readers who have stated there isn't enough Romance in the story.

** I started off a big fan of the fic but around chapter 20 I realized that the author must have quit on the book. 203k fic that lasts only a summer and there is zero character growth. There was zero romance and the Hurt/Comfort was few and far between. 3/5 stars
