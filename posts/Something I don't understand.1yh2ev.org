I don't understand the attraction of certain pairings. -Snape/Hermione -Draco/Hermione -Lucius/Hermione

In the slash department, I don't understand -Snape/Harry -Draco/Harry

Any thoughts?


** I'm not that eloquent, but I'll try and explain the appeal I find in them.

- *Harry/Draco:* This one's pretty simple - it's the whole thin line between love and hate thing, enemies becoming lovers. It's about Draco changing and throwing off the Death Eater In Training stuff and being a better person. (Or, occasionally, about Harry turning dark.) This pairing was helped by HBP when Harry was pretty obsessed with Draco and it's easy to make that obsession about love rather than hate. I think this is a good pairing for the lighter fics, coming of age stories, discovering and learning about themselves and each other. (But that's not to say they can't do dark fics just as well; H/D is my OTP of the HP fandom, so I will read anything about them.)

I don't really ship Hermione/Draco, but expect the appeal is much the same as for Harry/Draco only with a het pairing.

- *Harry/Snape:* The big thing for me about this pairing is seeing Snape as someone that helps Harry. With this pairing I like fics that portray Harry as struggling with himself, with abusive Dursleys, with guilt of the people who died in the war (I've mostly read pre-OOTP fics for this genre, so alive Snape and different outcomes from the war), and then have Snape as the one to help him come to terms with it because as a spy and someone who's killed and dealt with the darkness inside himself, he knows how to help Harry. Also with this pairing I like the idea of dark, self-destructive, unhealthy relationships.

- *Hermione/Snape:* For me, this is very much an intellectual pairing. We all know Hermione's clever but I always saw Snape as very intelligent as well and I like seeing them being intelligent together. Hermione's tough and wouldn't put up with Snape's bullshit, and I think that would make her attractive to Snape.

- *Hermione/Lucius:* I've only read smut for this pairing, which is bit of a different issue to actually pairing them. As a pairing that's about more than just PWP, I'd guess it's age difference kink + bad boy thing + dark!Hermione or light!Lucius, maybe? Not read any so couldn't really say for sure.

And for the age issue with those three pairing, I personally only see it as an problem if the younger partner is under 16 (the age of consent in the UK; though in the wizarding world it's probably 17). Some people find age gaps between partners to be shudder-inducing, but it's really a matter of preference. My opinion--the only important thing is making sure the younger, and thus less experienced, partner properly understands the issues at hand and makes fully informed consent. Older person manipulating younger? Icky. Fully educated younger person engaging by choice? No big deal.

(Again, all this is just my personal opinion. I wouldn't presume to speak for anyone else.)

*** I'm a huge Hermione/Snape fan, and you've got it exactly right. Hermione is (let's face it) too smart by half. She's incredibly intellectual, and this is why I never thought she should have ended up with either Ron or Harry. Yes, the boys are smart in their own ways, but Hermione was one of the brightest Hogwarts had seen in years. She placed huge value on intelligence, so her ending up with someone who couldn't hold their own intellectually never made sense to me. Unfortunately, JK didn't really write any other incredibly clever people Hermione's own age - not to mention Hermione has always struck me as the type to go for some one older than herself, simply because she's so mature. That, coupled with her innate sense of kindness, courage and determination to strive for what she wants.. They're all qualities that lend her to a relationship with an older man. It's why I ship Snape/Hermione (and occasionally Remus/Hermione).

** I have had and gotten over my obsession with Harry/Draco so here are some of my thoughts.

I liked the pair because of the conflict it creates for the story. They are from completely different backgrounds and have been taught different values and ideals. Basically, it has a kind of Romeo and Juliet type of feel to it and I love shakespearian drama. Sadly, it is also a pairing full of clichés and about two years ago I stopped reading it altogether because of that.

Harry/Snape has not a lot of appeal to me and I don't read it very often but I'll try to explain.

What I like about this pairing is how very complicated the relationship is. There is the age differance, the war, the fact that Snape was once in love with Harrys mother,... I could go on but I'm sure you get what I mean. So what draws me to read these stories is that if the author can work this into the canon in a believable way, the stories usually turn out to be very well thought out and awesome.

Lastly, I'm sorry but since I can't imagine Hermione with anyone other than Ron I can't say anything aboutthe other pairings you asked about. But that's just me and there are certainly other opinions around.

This is almost word for word how I feel about Harry/Draco. I like maybe 3 HP/DM fics at this point, when 5 years ago I used to read them constantly. The funny thing is, while the quality of other pairing fics has drastically improved over the years, HP/DM seems to have remained stagnant. I can only think of one high quality HP/DM fic that's been written after 2008 or so.

It just seems like the ship has been completely explored, with very little room for any real originality left. Just cliches and more cliches.

** I think that the explosion of slash fanfiction (particularly anything with Draco and Snape) and the Hermione/Draco and Hermione/Snape pairings in the HP fandom occurred with the release of the films. I'd even go so far as to credit the popularity of Harry/Draco and Hermione/Draco as being solely because of the movie casting. Tom Felton is very attractive and women, who write and read most slash and Hermione/Draco fanfiction, see it at some level as wish fulfillment. Their head-canon for Draco is strongly influenced by what they see on the screen. Similarly with Harry/Snape, as Alan Rickman (arguably the best actor in the series and without whom the films would have fallen miserably flat) is also far more attractive and charismatic than the character he plays.

** Hermione/Draco is popular for a few reasons. First of all, Draco is a really interesting character, and a lot of his backstory is unknown, allowing others to make it what they want to be able to fit their story. Secondly, once you get past the blood status (which Draco overcomes in a lot of Hermione/Draco fics, due largely to the first point), they actually have quite a lot of similarities, and could actually get along if it weren't for Draco's upbringing ( which, again, can be avoided due to rule 1). Finally, the tension between Harry/Ron and Draco can make for some pretty good drama/heavy writing.

*** I can totally see where you're coming from, but a large majority of the fandom agree that Wizards age differently to muggles, which is how a lot of them get around the paedophilia thing. Also, Hermione's use of the time turner - people tend to use that plot device to add a few years to Hermione's age. Not to mention that, in the books, Snape was actually a lot younger than he is portrayed in the movies - same with Lupin, Black, etc. Harry's parents were killed when they were 21 (Jesus I just realised I outlived Lily and James Potter. That's scary). If you add ten years (Harry's time before Hogwarts), then another seven (so that whatever character is of age in the Wizarding world) then Snape/Lupin/Black ends up being 38. While a 38 year old with a 17 year old is no way near common, I'm not sure it's paedophilia - that to me runs more along pre-pubescents. That being said, different people have different ideas on what makes an adult - for me personally, it's an experience and maturity thing. For others it's age. It really just depends on what you believe - thats how some people can ship certain ships. Like, I can ship Hermione/Snape - the age thing isn't really a factor for me, I just think that their personalities, high levels of intelligence, and Hermione's ability to see past a persons short comings or mistakes - that all to me is what makes me like them as a couple. On the other hand, I dislike Snarry. Harry (in my opinion) just isn't mature enough to be with someone so much older than him. That might seem strange, given all he goes through, but I think that part of the appeal of Harry as a character is that he is a Child who goes through so much trauma. He deals with things adults would struggle with, but he still manages to remain childish throughout. I can completely understand where you come from, I just thought I'd say how I can ship a pairing. :)

***** Ok, think of it like this. In the hundreds upon hundreds of years human society, it has only very recently become unusual for there to be large age gaps in relationships (and this is mostly in Western society mind you). I'm not saying that it is a good or bad thing for there to be an age gap, I'm simply saying that, to me, it doesn't matter. So long as everyone involved is a consenting adult (seventeen in the British Wizarding world to be known as an adult. It's eighteen here where I live in New Zealand, but the age of consent - to have sex legally - is sixteen). I just don't really tend to get caught up on age. I am much more inclined to focus on whether two peoples personalities are a good match, rather than focus on such an arbitrary thing as age. To my mind, Hermione is far more suited to someone like Snape than she was Ron. I don't care about age differences, I care about chemistry and compatibility. In saying that, that's just me. Some people get really grossed out by the age difference, and that's fine. I just thought I would explain why, to me, Hermione and Snape make a good pairing.

(Not to mention it seems that the majority of Hermione/Snape fic is extremely well written - something I Do care about!)

** Draco and Hermione are my favourite ship. Through the things we all know and love about Hermione (stubborn curiosity, intellectual power, fierce bravery) there is room to expand and ultimately redeem Draco. He's an interesting character who could have been used to show us many things that were shoved to the wayside. Pure blood upbringing, dark arts, wizard history. Wouldn't it have been cool to hear a story about Grindelwald from Draco? Alas, jkr didn't give us that. But with Hermione, she can bring that all out to the open, coupled with the reckoning of blood bias (and class, really) which is the stuff of great romances and tragedy since the dawn of time.

** The Draco/Hermione pairing was actually the first fan-fic I read. It sounded so utterly ridiculous to me I just had to see how a writer could even attempt this but a few hours later I was 50 chapters deep. I wish I could remember this first story but I am blanking. But as with any ship, particular the controversial ones, done right it can be a really satisfying read. I like that Draco becomes the character I always hoped he would be post-hogwarts. He retains his snarkiness and begins to form his own independence of thought and action as he ages. The psychological battles and trauma from his upbringing that he has to conquer in order to be with Hermione are often the most interesting parts for me. As for the Hermione aspect I like that Draco challenges her and lessens some of rigidity. Though opposites attracting don't often make for great real life relationships they do make for an engrossing read.

** I started typing out a comment, wrote 400 words explaining my fascination with my ship (Snarry), and realised quickly that I was entering tl;dr country. So, rather than subject everyone to a novel about the Good Ship Snarry, I'll leave it at this: they are two men cut from the same cloth. They are two sides of the same coin. They are yin and yang, darkness and light, bitter and sweet.

Given Harry's penchant for noticing every male within a fifty mile radius, his confusion about Veela, and his disastrous relationship with Cho Chang, he reads as questioning at best. To me, he seems as straight as a corkscrew. I don't buy the epilogue (I am firmly in the EWE camp) and find Harry/Ginny as horrifying as most people find Snarry. But there has always been an intensity to Harry's relationship with Snape and when the veil is finally lifted (The Prince's Tale), Harry's change of heart becomes crystal clear. From there, it's a short step to a relationship, if you accept that Snape didn't die. Which I do.

** I don't read any non-slash anymore. Harry and Draco is always fun because I thrive on the idea of the line between love and hate being so thin. I especially like the ones where they're arguing/battling passionately and suddenly someone just crosses the line and kisses the other. Cue the whirlwind of secret tension filled trysts. So, I guess it's the taboo. Similarly for Snape and Harry, that is has to be secretive, also the idea of a cold, confident, smooth Snape becoming so weak-willed around a silly boy is entrancing.
