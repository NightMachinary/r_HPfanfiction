*********** What I will probably do is 3-4 days before the match, let you and your partner know of the topic so that you can do some research and prepare initial statements. Then you'll each have 24 hours to respond to each other. After that the audience gets 24 hours to ask questions.

Once that's all done we'll have a vote and the winner gets gold and moves on.
