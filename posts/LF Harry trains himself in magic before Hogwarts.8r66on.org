As the title says im looking for fics where Harry figures out he has abilities and trains in them before going to hogwarts, i know there is a few where he believe he is a jedi, and one where he lives in a living tree, but im really up for any kind of fic, as long as it is before he is contacted by the wizarding world. As always, no slash for MC.


** My current story has that (shameless plug), though that of course means it's not complete:

  Upon realizing his strange abilities, a young Harry develops them to free himself from his hateful family & runs away. Given his importance to a world he doesn't know exists, how will life on the streets change the Boy-Who-Lived & the destiny he is fated? Through faith & family will he gain what he'd never had. AU, Black Coven & political themes. Formerly titled "Break the Limits"

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.
