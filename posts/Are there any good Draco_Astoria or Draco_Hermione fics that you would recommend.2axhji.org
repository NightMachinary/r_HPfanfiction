I've read a few good Draco/Hermione fics but I haven't read any Draco/Astoria. Are there any really good ones that you've read and would recommend of either of the two pairings?


** I haven't read any Draco/Astoria but as for Dramione, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] is of course, the most popular Dramione fic at the moment. If you haven't read that one yet, then I would definitely encourage you check that one out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] is probably my favorite Dramione fic followed by [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6725154/1/I-Spy][I Spy]] (I like Hogwarts era fics).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][The Bracelet is a really popular Dramione story]] : Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2064124/1/Parenting-Class][Parenting Class is HILARIOUS.]]: Sixth years at Hogwarts are now required to take a parenting class, what fun! Hermione, Draco, and Harry are paired up in which they'll trade off being children. Can they live through the class or will being a parent prove too hard?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea][We Learned the Sea is a really good story!!]]: Draco Malfoy turns himself in after a very successful career as a Death Eater, then enlists Harry and Hermione to help him in a scheme to bring down the Dark Lord. DHr. A story of forgiveness.

I recently just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][A Cruel and Beautiful World]] and it was one of the best Voldemort wins scenarios. Definitely a must read: After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater who let her be captured in the first place.

** I love Draco/Astoria! If you're open to bleaker stories, try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290059][Memento]]. I also wrote one, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][Dreamscape]]. Both post-war.

** Draco/Astoria is a ship I really enjoy. I wrote a post-war novel about the two of them meeting and falling in love.

** I also can't think of any Draco/Astoria fics that come to mind, that are just about them. There's a good Lily Potter (the younger) and Scorpius fic that has a lot of Draco/Astoria in it, but it's not specifically about them.

As for Draco/Hermione, here are some of my favorites:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6364608/1/Slippery-Seduction][Slippery Seduction]] is a great one, Hermione and Draco start a secret relationship and Snape uses his spy prowess to try and figure out what's going on. I was fascinated by the way that Hermione's work in arithmancy was worked into the story in a way that I had never seen before, the way the equations made visual projections was brilliant and I loved that aspect of it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3626876/45/Stolen][Stolen]] is one of those more complicated journeys that takes place over more time, more locations, more emotions than most others. There are a lot of different aspects to it, on the foundation of being a marriage-law fic. It has a rather more realistic take than many of those stories, in that Hermione and Draco don't immediately see what they were blind to all of those years, fall in love, and live happily ever after. It's a struggle and it takes a long time for them to begin to understand and respect one another, and their adventures along the way are very engaging.

I liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3667037/1/Gravity][Gravity]], it's a lot about Draco figuring himself out after turning to the light side, and his friendship/relationship with Hermione weaves through it all.

It's sadly not complete, but one of my favorite Draco/Hermione fics is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7958303/1/How-To-Marry-A-Malfoy][How to Marry a Malfoy]]. I typically don't even start uncomplete fics, but this one is so clever and entertaining that I didn't even mind too much. Last updated last year, so maybe it's not completely abandoned.

** There are some amazing Draco/Astoria dics out there! One of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6817919/1/True-Colors]] . This is a hypothetical DH fic where Draco is forced to either side with the girl he loves or follow his father into ruin. Narcissa's character is also explored throughout this piece as well as the unspoken question of what place religion holds in the wizarding world. A fantastic and complex story and the companion piece by the same author is told from Astoria's POV during the same time frame.
