** This is woefully underrepresented, yeah. Additionally, I'd like to see more fics where Harry or some other character resists a soul-bond, or that weird Veela "mate" thing - citing that at that point, it really is just the magic overriding his free will. I think the worst example of this trope I've seen was when Harry saves Fleur's and Gabrielle's lives, and "ancient veela magic" demands that they do a sex ritual, and Fleur is bound to him as a slave. The author didn't write little gabby as a participant, thankfully, but it was still extremely disgusting from a moralistic standpoint. This was Identity by Highbrass, btw. Wouldn't recommend it though.

I mean what the fuck, why is that even a thing, what sort of species would willingly invent and then bind itself with magic like that?

*** Right on! I despise all these soul-bonds, soulmates, creature mates nonsense with passion. I truly do not understand the popularity. Why such tropes that we can argue is nothing but allegory for forced marriage and rape.

**** It's even more perplexing when the author can clearly write romance. Like, you're capable of writing a non-morally bankrupt "holy shit I think I love her/him" segment, so why don't you??

***** As a guess, because it's an easy trope. There /are/ interesting spaces to work within the trope, but the massive downside is that few bother attempt to dig that deep.

Granted, that applied to 90% of the maligned tropes you can find.

**** Well I like soul bonds, soulmates and mates fanfics. I think it's pretty romantic that you see one person and you know they are the one for you. But I definitely need the part where they get to know each other. Some fics make it seem pretty straightforward and too fast paced for my tastes.

***** No worries for each their own. If you enjoy them - go for it.

Personally I see them lacking in /agency/. What is it that /decides/? /Who/ makes such decisions? I can be okay with such a story if there is a point with genuine choice. Say there is a soulmate, but parties have freedom to reject. I could maybe read that.

*** House-elves, maybe?

Then again, the fact that they are called /house/ elves implies there are non-hosue elves, or at least were at some point. Hosue elves were probably soem race of small humanoids who got enslaved by wizards, and then magic and culture made them either like or think they like slavery.

**** I read an interpretation once, which was that House-elves are a corporeal manifestation of a small spirit like a brownie or that nordic one. They come to your house and take care of it, but leave if you offend them.

I can definitely see wizards capturing one and then twisting the bond to their chosen house to them, and robbing them of agency at the same time.

*** There's Nature of the Beast by Lomonaaren [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/362231]]

where Harry finds out he's a veela's mate and basically laughs it off, before facing a lot of people who are confused he's not falling into Malfoy's arms (though he does in the end, of course. oh well)

Lomonaaren is a decent writer, but has characters argue (a lot) in a really repetitive and formulaic way.

**** I mean, that's like the exact opposite of what I'm asking, though? If it does happen in the end, the story is just another instance of the problem, but with a bit of token effort inserted first.

****** I just read it, even the short sequel. Neither submits, not really. They compromise and grow to care for each other as anyone in a relationship would. It had a terrible start that caused a lot of tension that then had to be worked through.

** While not a "Dark" creature by definition Hell Eyes has Harry be half human and half something else and he constantly struggles with it for most of the fic.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** I can recommend "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4228464/1/Desperate-Measures][Desperate Measures]]" . It doesn't play much on the mate theory and shows Harry making his admirers work for his affection.

Other than that I also would be curious about a dark harry not wanting to reproduce.
