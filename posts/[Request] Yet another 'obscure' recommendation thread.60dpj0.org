I've read a lot of fics from this fandom, as well as a lot of crossovers with it as well. I feel like I've run out of things to read, and even the other recommendation threads aren't coming up with much. I see threads like this pop up every now and again so I thought we may as well give it a shot as the last one was probably at least a few months ago.

Please in this thread link some more 'obscure' fics that you feel are, well, good. Doesn't matter what website its from or what its about really, just anything that you haven't seen recommended here or don't see recommended often. Personally I don't have much limit on what i'd like to read outside of a preference leaning towards Harry-Centric fics, no angst for the sake of angst (I can't read another fic that starts by describing the poor abused Raven-Haired-Green-Eyed-Too-Short-And-Thin-For-His-Age 8 year old) and a strong preference for either complete or currently being updated fics. Outside of that though I'd love this thread to be somewhere people can bring to the attention of our little community fics that they think are just great, whether it being an old hidden gem that you think people would love or something new that looks like it has promise, please bring it to our attention!

I've linked a few fics below to give you an idea of my taste, but like I said really just link anything that you think is worth reading, I'm rather desperate at the moment for something Harry Potter and stimulating.

** Seventh horcrux is not an obscure fic. It's mentioned every third thread it sems.

** Hermione-centric:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has the Ministry selling out Muggleborns to appease Voldemort after Year 4. One Year later, Hermione formed a Muggleborn guerrilla group and killed hundreds of Death Eaters and their sympathizers. But Voldemort also had some cool tricks up his sleeves. Combat scenes and political intrigues are extremely well written.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is another superb Hermione-centric story. I like it so much that I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5b2js4/fanfiction_friday/d9lh1uw/][a detailed description]] 4 months ago. Several other people on this sub have also repeatedly vouched for this fic.

--------------

Ginny-centric:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is Year 6 from Ginny's POV. This story has a strong canon feel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408) is IMO the best canon-compliant, Year 7 Hogwarts story. Snape's portrayal is very well done.

--------------

Ron-centric:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is an extreme AU where a cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and had ruled magical Britain for the next 20 years. But Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione. This fic is my favorite Ron/Hermione romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684), has canon Ron reborn in a different universe. He met Violet, the Girl-Who-Lived there. Other key female characters were all taking on very different roles.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** Well, it's definitely *not* a top tier fic, abandoned and it's got some nonsense (Lordships and magical cores (though no magical exhaustion, so eh?) but /no/ friendly goblins) but I am greatly entertained by linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War).

** linkffn(Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak). The best epilogue-compliant (sort-of) HHr fic I've read. Unlike most such fics, this one doesn't have any long angsty divorce scenes or or forbidden love scenes etc. Basically, upon becoming the Master of Death, Harry obliviates himself of his love for Hermione to save her. This leads to problems in the future and Hermione must now go back in time to prevent him from obliviating himself. It may sound a bit weird, but the fic is really well written.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]] is one of my favourite obscure fics. There's also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C.

  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
#+end_quote

Completely different tone, but I recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]] and thought it was very sweet.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
