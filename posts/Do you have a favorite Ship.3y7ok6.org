Hey guys, I was just reading through some comments and saw that someone didnt like a ship. It made me wonder what ships you all like and which fic personifies that ship for you?

My Favorite Ship is Harry/Fleur. The two best fanfictions are linkffn(This Lie Ive Live by Jbern) and linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)


** My favourite one is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck][Bismarck]] and 2nd is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_(BB-39][USS Arizona (BB-39)]]

For Harry/Fleur just look around in this thread and you'll find all I would recommend as well.

For Harry/Daphne, I'd say that "The Grass is always Greener" is the most solid. I, for one, had a good time reading it.

#+begin_quote
  I ship Tomione, or Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger.

  This is for several reasons. One, when one gets down to details, they both share some similar character traits. Both are logical and driven to succeed academically, to be "the best" when it comes down to who achieves the most in classes each year. Hermione can also be quite ruthless, cunning, and cold at different parts of the series, especially in OOTP - her face-disfiguring hex and having Umbridge be kidnapped by centaurs - and DH. If it wasn't for Hermione, Harry and Ron would also be in a world of trouble in DH. In a way, Hermione - even in PS/SS, helping Harry with the Potions room - helps to foil Tom Riddle's attempts to capture and kill Harry.

  However, even from the start, Hermione proves herself to be a very intelligent, bright, capable, and ambitious witch. To me, she also has some very Slytherin traits - trapping Rita Skeeter in a jar for /weeks/ as a beetle was one among several - and almost reminds me of a young, albeit Gryffindor-esque, version of Bellatrix. (...and we all know how Bellatrix views Tom Riddle, or Lord Voldemort.) Hermione is even able to /lie/ convincingly to Bellatrix, and fool the Dark Lord's right-hand woman into believing a falsehood. That, in itself, is incredibly impressive.

  In COS, Hermione is also the first one to "figure it all out". I'll c/p the portion I wrote for the HP Wiki, all of which is canon.

  - ...Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have "magical powers", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally "caught" the "Heir of Slytherin" when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, she attempted to use the spell /Aparecium/, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an "interested" Hermione.

  - When Ron compared Riddle to Percy "in disgust", mentioning the former as being "Prefect, Head Boy...probably at the top of every class", Hermione responded in a "slightly hurt" voice, "You say that like it's a bad thing."

  - Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had "caught the wrong person", and that "it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people". Later on, after Harry mentioned "hearing the voice" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory.

  I definitely feel that, to an extent, Hermione was the Irene Adler to Tom Riddle's Sherlock, in the sense that it was Hermione who outwitted Riddle, particularly in DH.

  From the books, Riddle and Harry are also directly paralleled, especially in COS. While Harry and Hermione do not end up together romantically at the end of the series, they are, however, best (and good) friends. If Harry is paralleled with Tom Riddle, and Harry is good friends with Hermione and views her "like a sister", chances are, Tom Riddle also would have at least felt some sort of kinship with Hermione as well. Riddle and Hermione also share, again, several similarities: Hermione has some Slytherin traits; she can be cold and ruthless at times; she's clever, cunning, conniving, and intelligent; and, like Riddle, she became a Prefect, and likely in her 7th year, Head [Girl].

  In COS, Hermione also shows "interest" [as per canon] in Tom Riddle, if purely for the fact that Riddle was a Prefect and Head Boy. Later on, in GOF, Hermione displays the /same/ admiration for Cedric Diggory (also a Prefect), to which she has this interesting conversation with Ron:

  - "That idiot, Hogwarts champion?" said Ron, as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd towards the staircase. "He's not an idiot. You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch," said Hermione. "I've heard he's a really good student --- and he's a Prefect." She spoke as though this settled the matter. "You only like him because he's /handsome/," said Ron scathingly. "Excuse me, I don't like people just because they're handsome!" said Hermione indignantly. Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like 'Lockhart!'.

  Speaking of Lockhart, we all know that Hermione had a rather /large/ crush on him, also in COS. Combined with the Cedric Diggory interaction with Ron, it's clear that Hermione is apparently attracted to intelligent, seemingly accomplished, handsome men - and Tom Riddle is not only those things, but highly charismatic. I think it's pretty obvious that if Hermione had met a teenaged Tom Riddle - /without/ being aware of his identity as Lord Voldemort - she would definitely be attracted to him.

  As for Tom Riddle? I think that he would be attracted to Hermione for the same reason he has Bellatrix as a Death Eater: he would see Hermione as both a potentially dangerous threat, as well as a possible, powerful ally. In COS, as soon as Hermione discovers the true identity of Slytherin's monster, what does Tom Riddle do? He orders the basilisk to petrify (or kill) her. Much like Slughorn, I think Riddle likes to "collect" people - as seen with his Death Eaters - and he would want to lure Hermione to his side as well.

  Hermione's a Muggle-born, yes. However, Rowling has also confirmed that Voldemort tried to get Lily Evans - a Muggle-born - to join him as well. That provides clear evidence that blood status does not matter to Voldemort, and his "blood purism" is a facade to keep the Purebloods in his inner circle pacified.

And this is where your entire ship sinks. While Riddle paralleled Harry, he was also very, very different, especially in regards to friendship. Considering that Harry himself frequently felt agitated with Hermione's behaviour and hardly enjoyed her company (reasons and examples detailed in [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html][this]] article), it's hard to imagine Riddle enjoying Hermione's company. He would surely mock and ridicule her for her foolish self sacrifice and Gryffindor tendency to get into danger for her friends, adherence to muggle social ideals (S.P.E.W), benevolent morals and occasional naive attitude.

When it comes to intellectual pursuits, Hermione is not even close to Riddle's level, not even to Snape's level. She didn't invent any new magic or dabbled in obscure magic (in fact, she was averse to "non-Ministry-approved magic" as she says and shows in HBP).

So, sorry to ruin your fantasy, but there's no chance in hell that Riddle would ever get romantically involved with Hermione. Or anyone else, for that matter. Riddle doesn't /do/ romance. And I hardly think she would like him as well, for all his admirable qualities.

***** Why do you feel the need to "sink" other's 'ships?

It was never a matter of debate, as I pointed out on the original thread, as linked. It's a matter of preference; for example, not everyone is going to like chocolate ice cream, or believe in God, but that doesn't mean that you can try to poo-poo them for it.

This isn't Battleship, for Merlin's sake. It doesn't work like that. Do you really think that people are going to say, "Hey, you sunk my (battle)ship"?

Do you go around telling little kids, "sorry to ruin your fantasy, but Santa Claus doesn't exist"? Or how 'bout one of those people who would run around the bookstore during the release of /Half-Blood Prince/, shouting, "Dumbledore's dead"?

Fanfiction isn't about, and has never been about, debate, unless you count ship wars, and those are both immature and irrelevant. I have no desire whatsoever to participate in such petty pissing contests of "whose 'ship is better".

If you don't like it, my advice is to ignore it, and move on. You are not contributing the discussion with additions like the above, and you're not going to change my mind.

Personally, I think it's also incredibly rude and disrespectful to go around telling others, "your 'ship sucks", or "sorry to burst your bubble".

The whole reason why anyone reads Harry Potter is to escape into a /fantasy/. It's unrealistic /by nature/. Saying "your 'ship is unrealistic" is merely redundant to me, because /that's basically the entirety of the Harry Potter world/ already. Especially in Harry Potter fanfiction, where the most popular 'ships are the "unrealistic" ones!

Even Ron/Hermione, by Rowling's admission, is "unrealistic" as a 'ship. Does that mean that people don't have a right to enjoy it?

#+end_quote

I don't. Just like you felt the need to explain why you think Hermione and Riddle would fit together, I felt the need to explain why they wouldn't.

Your argument about fantasy is completely incorrect. The fact that the series is a fantasy about unrealistic things happening, does not mean everything can happen against reason. It's like I'd say I ship Harry/Umbridge because they fit, and you'd say they don't, and I'll respond with "but it doesn't have to be realistic!". It's simply not a valid argument. Otherwise you wouldn't have gone through the effort to justify your ship earlier.

Can you give me the exact citation that says this, please?

You can ship Riddle/Hermione as much as you like, but, please, just drop the pretense that they canonically fit.

The thing is, doesn't that just defeat the entire point of shipping? I mean, I'm not into it, so I might be wrong, but isn't shipping about looking at two characters, and saying "they would make a great couple"? it's not like you just ship characters randomly. You choose them for their qualities, and the way they fit each other. So what's the point of shipping characters that don't fit?

**** Sure. I really dislike three tropes that are extremely common with that pairing: bashing, endless angst, and (conversely) 'Harry & Hermione have always been in love,' so most of my favourites tend to be slow building romances or adventure/mystery where the pairing isn't a prominent plot point.

linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick; Favorite Things by Stanrick; Hermione Granger Is Stupid by Ruinus; Senses by Lorien829; Nocturnal by forcedInduction; Harry Potter and the Acceptance of Fate by Arya1)

On portkey.org I like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=4723&chapterid=&agree=1][Magic Never Dies by Lynney]], [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Coulsdon Eagle]], [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7056&chapterid=1][Angelica by DerlierMeFromEve]] and [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1179%20(and%20its%20sequel][The Power He Knows Not by Vicarious Leigh]]. Many of the stories posted on portkey were completed before HBP and DH so it's interesting to see how early authors imagined Harry defeating Voldemort.

Hope one of these interests you.

** Lucius and Hermione. It was the reason I even started reading fanfiction in the first place, and it remains my favorite pairing. I like older men/younger women fics, obviously, and the dynamic of them basically having nothing but pure hatred for each other leads to some of the most fascinating build-ups in romance fics I've seen. At first I was all about the smut, but at this point I don't even care if it mentions them having sex as long as I get to read banter between them, walk with them through their angst and guilt, or delve into their minds when they realize the gravity of their forbidden attraction. I just love it so much. Plus (no offense to Draco lovers) I can't stand his son, so Dramione is completely out of the picture for me.

  After a year of litigation, Lucius Malfoy has a choice - a year in Azkaban to pay for his sins, or prove he's a changed man by passing third-year Muggle Studies, the new and improved version taught by none other than the esteemed Miss Granger. Even worse, his only son may be attracted to a Weasley. Oh, the horror.

  #+begin_example
      I'm not going to lie, Lucius can be a bit OOC at times, but I'm working off of the extreme Woobie\!Lucius we saw in Deathly Hallows, both book and film, who's sort of broken\.  I mix and match where I please, also, taking bits from the films and taking bits from the books, and sometimes just making things up, and not trying all that hard to keep them straight \- hence the 'alternate universe' tag\.  Well, that and I completely ignored the epilogue, and most canonical pairings\.  Fred is still alive, also\.  I missed him too much to do without him, even though he barely appears in this story\.  I'll update when I can, although RL is no one's friend\.  In the meantime, enjoy this little\.\.\.thing\.

**** Honestly my favorite is probably Muggle Studies linkao3(2506055) just because it's funny and easy to read. It's definitely one of the most light-hearted ones anyway, haha.

  After a year of litigation, Lucius Malfoy has a choice - a year in Azkaban to pay for his sins, or prove he's a changed man by passing third-year Muggle Studies, the new and improved version taught by none other than the esteemed Miss Granger. Even worse, his only son may be attracted to a Weasley. Oh, the horror.

  #+begin_example
      I'm not going to lie, Lucius can be a bit OOC at times, but I'm working off of the extreme Woobie\!Lucius we saw in Deathly Hallows, both book and film, who's sort of broken\.  I mix and match where I please, also, taking bits from the films and taking bits from the books, and sometimes just making things up, and not trying all that hard to keep them straight \- hence the 'alternate universe' tag\.  Well, that and I completely ignored the epilogue, and most canonical pairings\.  Fred is still alive, also\.  I missed him too much to do without him, even though he barely appears in this story\.  I'll update when I can, although RL is no one's friend\.  In the meantime, enjoy this little\.\.\.thing\.

Come at me, downvotes!

I /hate/ all canon pairs except for Lupin/Tonks which I love, Mom/Dad Weasley, and Bill/Fleur. I also enjoy Snape/Lily as long as it isn't a cheating fic, which I won't read.

Bellatrix/Hermione is a guilty pleasure and I like some more "crack" pairs as long as it is written well...but I guess that goes for a LOT of pairs - except the ones I hate (most canon pairs).

I once read a simply amazing McGonagall fic where she falls in love with a British Muggle (soldier) during WW2...very well written, very sad and the worst part is I can't find it anymore!!!

The age gap ships are often either with her out of Hogwarts by the time it starts, or certainly an adult (like those 'return to finish 7th year but there's a new marriage law' stories). Or good old time travel.

linkffn(the debt of time by shayalonnie) linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by mrs j's soup) linkffn(roundaboutdestiny by maryroyale) are all great for Hermione/Sirius, though the first one definitely has Hermione/Remus.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  When an unmarried Lily Evans joins the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore gives her a simple mission: meet with the Death Eater Severus Snape and tell him what she's done. AU.

** Harry/Hermione is my favourite, although angst and tropes can be a big problem in this ship. There are so many fics written about them it means there is a lot of bad fics written about them. I got into FF to read this ship so most stories I read are Harry/Hermione.

Otherwise I've been through stages of Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks and Harry/Daphne.
