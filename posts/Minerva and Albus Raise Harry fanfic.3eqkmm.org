Hi,

I'm searching for this fanfic that I remember reading ages and ages ago on fanfiction.net. It was this amazing story about McGonagall and Dumbledore raising Harry as their son. It was quite lengthy with a lot of chapters but it was really, really good. I've tried typing phrases from it into Google but it doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know the name of the story/author? Or can help find it anyway? I just feel like reading it.


** The only fic I know kinda like this is called Home, Harry is raised at Hogwarts by all the faculty, I don't think that is what you're looking for though.
