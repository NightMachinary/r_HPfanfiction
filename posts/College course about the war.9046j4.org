I'm searching for a fic I've read years ago.

If I remember it correctly it was like a college (university?) course about the second wizard war and every chapter was a different lesson. You didn't know who the teacher was and I think it was written in the second point of view. I think one lesson was about Pansy Parkinson but I'm not sure

Slight problem though, I know I read it in German but I think it was a translation.

Does anyone know it?

(As you may noticed English isn't my first language so please forgive me if something doesn't make sense)


** Nevermind I found it :) looks like it's a German one

If anyone wants the link pm me please :)
