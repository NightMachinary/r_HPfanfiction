** Personally, nothing. I tend to ignore most character description and just picture the movie actors regardless of anything else. In my head, Harry looks like Daniel Radcliffe, no matter what description a fanfic gives.

** Definitely agreed on the long hair thing. Similar for growing a goatee or similar.

It amused me when Honest Trailers described GoF as "the year where nobody got a haircut" because it's true, and it looks ridiculous. I think it came out in the year where there was a (thankfully) brief fashion of boys having long hair, even though most of them did not suit the look at all.

**** Nothing wrong with it, l honestly think that a genderbent character is/should be fundamentally different than it's canon gender counterpart given gender roles, different upbringing (in Harry's case possibly different forms of abuse) and so on, considering that I haven't found a story that sells me, so to speak, it's premise. I'll admit that on many cases I judge genderbending stories on the premise that they are an excuse to pair the changed character with a character that would be of the same gender without delving into queer topics and I'll also acknowledge that it is likely a gross over generalization on my part.

******* Yeah sure here ya go. series: yule ball panick, power of love, heart and soul. The first was a short story the author wrote. They then decided to turn it into a full novel length story with the 2nd and 3rd entries both being around 350k words or something like that.

The story explores a female harry who has no trust in authority figures due largely to dumbledore and the dursleys. She initially doesn't even trust mcgonagall but changes over time. The story explores a lot of the "old ways" and delves into a HP world where the bigotry is extended to same sex relationships not just blood status, and it is one of the larger struggles throughout the story. The author also presents fleur and gabrielle in a cool and interesting way and gives them an importance to the story that is not relationship, but is also not limited to the triwizard tournament. The horcruxes are also felt with entirely different from canon, and in the context of the story, it makes sense.

It is a very good read and it's on my reread list not my read once and done list. I hope you enjoy it

** I can /kind of/ understand basing Harry's looks on Daniel Radcliffe (blue eyes, relatively short, etc).

I don't /like/ it because the movies did basically all the characters dirty and using Radcliffe!Harry's looks implies basing the characters' personalities on that, but I can /understand/ it as the movies are a lot more popular as a franchise-entry-point than the books nowadays.

What I never understand is changing his appearance to match neither the books nor the movies. I've seen at least one that clearly just made stuff up, while it's trivially easy to look up in the first book.

Other than that, it's usually the accompanying clichés that bother me about an appearance change. Long hair is synonymous with Lord-Potter-wank for me (seriously, it's way too common for a Lord Hadrian Way-Too-Many-Last-Names to have/grow long hair, no doubt because of Movie!Lucius Malfoy), whereas Short!Harry might indicate starvation by Even More Abusive Dursleys.
