Most of the best stories I've read were written before JKR turned a magical world into a world full of McGuffins. So book 4 and earlier. I'm looking for more of that kind, with no Hallows or Horcruxes but instead a deeper exploration of what magic could do. Ideally over 100k words and finished. Crossovers are OK, but hopefully not anime ones. Has anyone seen stories like that written in the past 5 years, or is that breed of story dead now? Examples of what I'm talking about include The Lie I've Lived, Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, Runemaster, Browncoat Green Eyes.


** If you're ok with AU I suggest A Girl Can Be More Important Than A Firebolt.

Voldemort dies (for real) trying to kill Harry and Harry lives with his magical aunt. Story starts in 5th year(?) summer holidays.

Cute story but definitely romance rather than adventure. Still one of my favorite takes on the magical world

  Harry is the top quidditch player, a prefect and the most popular students in Hogwarts. His bane: Hermione Granger. The bossy, annoyingly brilliant.. cute.. girl that has kept him from making top in class for five years. Returning to Sark Island, he won't have to deal with her for two months. Or so he thought... AU. Fluffy. Mature for suggestive themes and language. Minimal bashing
