To be honest, I love writing short fics but I find plotting/writing longer fics overwhelming. I tend to use a timeline format where I basically just list everything that's going to happen and when, but it's hard to keep details straight or remember who knows what information when.

So how do other writers do it? A [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/images/jkr/op-notebook-jkr.gif][grid]] like JKR? How do you keep everything organized?

In addition, what other strategies do you find helps you write? Do you like to set word count goals or just see where things end up? Do you have one massive word doc for everything, do you prefer to write everything on paper, etc.


** Make a timeline of events is the simple answer.

Then, I make a timeline of the character arcs.

Then, I write down the rules of the world.

Then, I throw it all together and hope it's coherent.

Then, your beta tells you it isn't.

Edit:

In all honesty, you should write out a general plot line and include as many details of your world and your characters as you can

But as you write, you'll find your mind changing. It's a natural process of writing. Some people want their grids. Some people just want a framework.

Do what you think is best, but make sure you're writing instead of just planning.

And get a beta.

** I have a little time line made so I know what I want happening in each month, them I have a chapter lay out so I know what I am writing about with each chapter I update. I also have a million of little notebooks I keep on me at all times, when I think of a scene I write it down and update it in my timeline and chapter summaries, also when I read books and I see words used for description I will jot those words down in another one of my journals. I feel like it really helps me improve my writing, I don't like using the same words again and again.

Also, my beta is a big help and will let me bounce ideas off him. My fic is currently at 398,174 words and I don't know how I would be managing without keeping it organized. I think the best way to do well in writing is plan out right away what you want to happen, it doesn't have to be planned to the T, but planned enough so you know what you're writing about each week and your main issue is getting the writing to flow. I use google docs to write and make a doc for each chapter, it also makes it easier to share chapters with my beta. I do the same thing for my timeline. :)

Don't let the idea of a big fic discourage you. This is fanfic, you may get some nasty comments, but it's not the end of the world. Take them in stride and improve. I look at this as a way to let my writing improve, so just start and think of it as practice. A good beta can go a long way in making a project that seems overwhelming more manageable too, so keep that in mind :) Good luck!

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll Be the Death of Me]]. It's a Neville/OC fic that takes place 6th year after the battle at the ministry and when Draco gets his task to kill Dumbledore. I have the OC being Draco's twin sister. She's not all mary sued though, I promise. She's definitely in character for a Malfoy- snooty, prejudiced and as you can imagine very spoiled... BUT I think the pairing works well.

** The story I'm currently working on has close to 20 pages of notes at the beginning...and I'm still working on it. First I make a timeline of everything. Down to month and day. Then I add relevant information. For example, my current story is about Ginny during DH, so I have the lists of people in Dumbledore's Army, her class schedule, Neville and Luna's class schedule, and noteworthy people. Before I actually write chapters, I outline them first. It's just a quick sketch of what they look like in bullet points. Easy to change if I decide something else down the line conflicts with a particular bullet point.

I also have giant computer documents that are strictly for timelines. For example, there is one that is 1960-1981 (for the Marauders), and then there is one that is 1998-2024 (for the second generation). It's really impressive, actually. That's what I do when I'm bored. Sometimes I have trouble writing because I get too compulsive about how it should be formatted (really stupid, I can't help it sometimes). Having those beautiful timelines to perfect has calmed that down a lot. I haven't done much with it yet, but if you were curious, it mostly contains birthdays, babies born, and weddings. Some of them are canon, some of them are my own made up days when a date isn't given to us.

*** One of the stories that I'm trying to get going on is a ginny-centric DA story (though I've written about 2 chapters so don't worry about the competition). Maybe we should combine forces haha.

** This is a great topic as I'm writing a multi-year fic right now and would love to see how others tackle some of the more practical challenges of writing. Thanks for asking this!

#+begin_quote
  How do you keep everything organized?
#+end_quote

I fleshed out my initial idea until it was a chronological 7K word long prose outline. I'm using a shifting third person limited as narrator, so every plot point involving a character/setting had to be mapped out. From that 'broad strokes' outline I create a smaller, more concise outline that selects several plot points that I want to cover in a given update. I write the actual story from the smaller outline.

#+begin_quote
  what other strategies do you find helps you write?
#+end_quote

Knowing my characters and being confident that they'll find ways through the conflicts and roadblocks I put in their path. Also reading original fiction has an enormous impact on my own writing style.

#+begin_quote
  Do you like to set word count goals or just see where things end up?
#+end_quote

I write smaller chapters so that I can update more frequently. I hate having to reread an entire fic because the author does 6 chapters each of 15k words once every month. My usual goal is 3750 words, but it usually works out to 3.5K to 4K.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have one massive word doc for everything, do you prefer to write everything on paper, etc.
#+end_quote

Several different word docs. I'm not usually an organization freak, but I find that it's a lot easier to stay motivated writing if I'm not combing through one enormous document looking for a plot point, etc.

** I start with a beginning and an ending. It so important to start with the ending of the fic in mind. If you're not excited about the climax of your fic then you're not going to be motivated to finish it. This is why so many "what if" stories get abandoned--once the set-up is complete, the "what if" has been demonstrated and there's no real reason to keep going.

Next I figure out how to get from the beginning to the end via a series of mini-climaxes, each of which moves the plot forward significantly. Each of these mini-climaxes constitutes the end of a plot arc and the beginning of the next.

Then I "zoom in" on each individual arc and work out the steps needed to get to that mini-climax. Here's where you develop the chapter plan. In the planning stage, I reset the chapter numbering after each mini-climax, like I'm planning a series of short stories in sequence. For each chapter I'll write what needs to be achieved by the end of the chapter, but won't go into more detail than that.

That's the main plot sorted. But you also have lots of other things involved in the story: character arcs, maybe some romance, new magic, Quidditch, exploration, etc. So I think write a kind of "timeline" for each of these categories. For example, in the "magic" category I might want Harry to learn a certain spell, which may tie into the central plot by proving useful for one of climaxes. So I'll write in the magic category around what time he starts learning the spell, and at what points in the story he shows improvement in his ability to cast it. Another example: if there's a romance plotline, I might have something like "Chapter 4: meet in passing", "Chapter 6: do something together", "chapter eight: first kiss", etc.

Finally it's time to start writing. Before writing each individual chapter I'll write a scene-by-scene plan, checking it off against the arc plan for what the chapter has to achieve, and the characters/sub-plot/magic plans for what else I want to fit into the chapter around the scaffolding of the central plotline.

** Pretty simple, really. I have a notes document (currently just above 20,000 words). The first part is a well-edited timeline that I refer to and tweak a lot, delineating when "big" events happen and how they tie into each other. Then there's a section about continuity and running jokes, reminders to keep certain themes consistent. Then a section about various characters and some thoughts on them. Then, the largest section, which are basically drabbles - quick scenes that I know I want to include later, sometimes in shorthand, just to remind me what the original idea was.

I think it's important to have an outline, especially in a longer fic, but I also think it's important to give yourself enough room to improvise. You don't want to have things so meticulously plotted that writing becomes almost like dictation - you want to leave enough leeway to surprise yourself.

** I got an app on discount from completing NaNoWriMo a few years ago called scrivener which I used to write some stuff. It's helpful for what your looking for I think.

But lately when I write I just do an outline at the bottom of the document I am in and delete it as I go. So the end of the document is right near the top of the outline. But I write rough drafts very linearly and keep a lot of organization in my head.

** I first draft the shit out of my story. Just straight forward until I reach a point where I'm saying to myself that it all starts to make absolutely no sense.

Then I slice the whole thing up, looking for the parts that make no sense, feel strange or just straight up suck.

Then I write the second draft and fill in between the cut out chapters. If too much was cut, I rewrite the first draft completely, trying to avoid the mistakes I have made previously.

Then I analyse the story and draw up a timeline with the already existing story as the epicentre. Everything before and after is determined by what the story needs.

Then I finish the draft.

Then I edit.

Then its done.

** Usually, with other fandoms, I construct a bare-bones timeline and fill them in with little events that occur between each major plot-point, along with side-plots and how characters should develop.

For Midnight Blues, my HP fic, I get really drunk, word-vomit on the screen, and see where that takes me.
