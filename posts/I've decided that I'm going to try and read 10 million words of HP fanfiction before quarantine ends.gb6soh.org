Quarantine is expected to last for a long time (I think September at the latest where I'm from) and I'm just taking advantage and reading. A lot. I've read probably around 800k-1mil words of fanfiction since quarantine began (not so rough estimate) and this is the first time I'm keeping track of what I read (I don't favourite/follow/write down fic names) and so I decided to set myself a goal. I'm not sure it's achievable (I was going to set a more achievable goal of 5 million before, but then thought that would be boring) but I'm going to try! Well, not so much try as keep track of progress. I spend from 20-42 hours reading fanfiction a week (in quarantine ofc) and so I thought this would be a fun goal.

Anways, if you'd like me to post progress reports here, or even (God forbid) join me on my quest, tell me! Hope you're all staying safe ;p


** The only reason I'm probably somewhere close to that number is just because I severely don't care about sleep and the extrovert in me is thriving in this time. Also I would like to see the progress.

Edit: Introvert.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Have you tried linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)?

It's sitting at 2,414,556 words right now and updates with about 30k words PER WEEK, the author is a true monster.

You said you liked Slytherin Harry, and this is Slytherin Ron, lol. It's actually surprisingly good, it's not like poetry or the best thing you've ever read, but there's NO spelling or grammar errors and the writing and plot are very serviceable and fun. I've gotten used to and love having an update to look forward to every week, it's definitely grown on me.

*** This is completely off topic, but when you mentioned "like poetry" it made me think of something.

Anyone else notice that a lot of fics on AO3 are written in a style that seems like it's constantly trying to be poetic and flowing. Focussing a lot more on the emotions characters are feeling than the events that are happening and just generally being less straightforward prose wise than a typical style? I don't look at much HP stuff on AO3, so not 100% sure if this is prevalent there too, but I think I've seen it among the few HP fics I've looked at there.

I'm not saying this style is bad per se, though I don't enjoy it as much as a normal style. Just something I've noticed repeatedly.

**** That's actually exactly what I meant when I wrote that, because some people do think it's the absolute pinnacle of writing. And when you get both- great story and great prose- it totally /is/. But mostly you don't get both, and in the fanfic world you get to see all the stuff that an actual editor would reject if people were trying to publish, and people are of course growing and perfecting their writing styles... so it's no wonder some people prefer one and some people prefer the other.

When I say that "Fate" is serviceable writing, it doesn't contain any of that at all. Not even, like, a little description of the weather or outdoor scenes or a single nice turn of phrase. And that's okay, but for some people playing with words a little is a marker of a good author, so I just thought I'd let people know what they were getting.

If you want one that is a perfect blend, the best I can think of rn is linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb). It's both beautiful and action-packed. Worth a read!

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** Good luck! I'm gonna rec you some long-ish fics in hopes that a) you haven't read them yet b) you'll enjoy them, and c) they'll save you from reading rubbish

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I by flamethrower) -- first part of a 1.4 million words and counting series. Solid writing and great worldbuilding.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) -- almost a million words as of the last update; amazing take on WBWL and also has incredible worldbuilding

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) -- 350k standalone fic. Snape believably mentors Harry

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) -- 640k+ fic, and boy oh boy is it a wild ride. Tropey, but actually engaging to read.

linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) -- first in a 230k and counting series where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Slytherin. Has politics and worldbuilding, but no child politicians or bashing

linkffn(The Augury by La-Matrona) -- 173k Harmony fic inspired by Cursed Child.

linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsionoe de Blassenville) -- 210k+ and has a sequel. Severus rescues Harry from the Dursleys.

Happy reading!

To be honest, I think I would prefer a slower reading speed because I get through everything so quickly. It gets boring sometimes.

**** no, its not. I don't actually know what tag to add to signify that he will have multiple normal relationships, that's why the description has such an odd tag. Originally it was marked as Multi!Harry, but so many people complained that i finally just added that bit

​

edit: that is odd, The tag is changed on FFN but not for the reddit link

** Since you said you liked Severitus, also, here are four classics that are pretty long! The best thing about older fics is how much they can diverge from later book canon and surprise you.

linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko) 500k words, has two sequels that add another 1.1 million words. Great OCs, very interesting story.

linkffn(Blood Magic by GatewayGirl) 250k words, starts a little rough but is a great story by the end and bonus, it's slash.

linkAo3(A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight) 790k fic with two sequels that add another 765k words. Takes a bit to really get going but is a great story once it does. Very original and in-depth and emotional.

linkffn(Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) save this for a day when you're looking to cry- but it ends on an uplifting note. 212,292 words.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

**** These are IMO the best Severitus fics out there, but Year does indeed take a little while to get going and has magical cores, they aren't the dumb Lord Potter cliche ones though, since the story is a lot older than that trope, and they aren't really the focus at all. I'd definitely give it until, oh, say, chapter 24 or 25, because that's when the actual story starts.
