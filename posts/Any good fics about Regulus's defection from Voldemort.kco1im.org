Am interested in the thought process of what pushed Regulus further and further down the path of defecting-the psychology, if you will. So far this is pretty good "no answers for no questions asked" by tonberry, would recommend. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12231759]]


** You could honestly just read the chapter “Meet Regulus Black” in linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) you can literally skip the rest if you want, but that one chapter has an amazing Regulus backstory.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Hey I just read that one section-thanks for recommending it! It definitely gave a better picture of what exactly made Regulus turn away than other fics.

** The latest section of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] is about a spy organization fighting Voldemort. Regulus is one of the recruits.
