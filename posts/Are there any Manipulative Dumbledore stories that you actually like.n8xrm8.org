I know Dumbledore is a mixed character with how he's written in canon. There's a LOT of ridiculous manipulative Dumbledore stories in fanfiction though, but I was curious if there were any that you actually didn't mind, thought did it relatively good/well.

**** I tried to sprinkle some eye-twinkling, "m'boys", and other Manipulative!Dumbledore cliches. However, I haven't read any particularly ostentatious Manipulative!Dumbledore fics recently, so there were probably many missed opportunities as well.

** It is hard to write Dumbledore and walk the lines between the manipulative fanfic Dumbledore, the Dumbledore from the books, and the Dumbledore from the movies. He is such a complicated character that people can take in any (sometimes horrible) direction.

I have been /trying/ to write a well-written (manipulative? misguided? damaged?) Dumbledore for my fic; a more PTSD ridden and aging version of Dumbledore who is trying to stop the second war, and failing, totally making mistakes based on his fear and experiences from the first war. He's not manipulative, he's just been through some shit he doesn't want to live through a second time. I was hoping to hit a sweet spot with how I portrayed that, but IDK I think it's still a bit tropey. Oh well. He's in there now. Most of the chapters turned out ok, with the exception of one my drunk self wrote where Dumbledore sets fire to the Hogwarts Express in a fit of rage. Oops.

*** A good way to explain it is that he is suffering from PTSD, but in the way that he's trying to prevent as many casualties as possible, but fails to realize that his plans are creating more

** THIS ONE.

THIS ONE THIS ONE THIS ONE.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30195072/chapters/76720607][Under the Auspices of Generals]]

It just completed yesterday, and it is brilliant and canon-compliant, Dumbledore manipulating things for the betterment of the many at the expense of the few.

(Also has some Remus/Sirius and a bit of the fallout of the Prank and starts with a brilliant "James and Lily captured by Death Eaters" escape scene and just read it because it's /so good/)

(Also, it's not mine. I'm just the only person to comment on it and that's a TRAGEDY.)

*Edit:* I am no longer the only person to comment on it! :D

One of my favorite HP fanfics. Has a lot of lore, Griffindor and Marauders Bashing but some surprisingly sweet spots. You still have a lot of good friendships and next to no shipping.

** A Harry is Merlin reincarnated fic where it's not bbc Merlin. It's actually old Merlin and he acts like Dumbledore. Dumbledore is said to have a manipulative streak that Merlin also has. So this is 2 manipulative old men playing literal chess together. Like the actual game chess. Only problem is that it updates so fucking slowly. Like there was a literal year in between two updates
