the idea's are something i don't think I've seen in an HP fic before. i been reading for years.

1. The first one " Have alittle Remorse, Be a man."

In the last book, its discussed how to heal the soul from a Horcrux which is remorse. Now we have seen when harry says

- "It's your one last chance," said Harry, "and it's all you've got left... I've seen what you'll be otherwise... Be a man... try... Try for some remorse..." -

My thought idea is. An odd one. what if Voldemort used *Legilimency* to attack Harry before he cast the spell and saw.. what had become of the soul shard, it shook him to the core. literally changing his whole life as he knew harry did not have the skill or way to lie to him

) as in he soul Harrys talks with Dumbledore, Hermione, etc about the damage he did to himself, and to his soul seeing the shard of the Horcrux in the "after life king station"

He surrenders, and in the words of harry " Becomes a man," faced with the horror of the after life he had seen, his fear of death. Tom changes his nature to become a better person. Yes, a huge personaility switch. But the idea is almost he tries to become better..

​

But is still tempted by his darker nature's still fights the way he was, but after seeing what could happened the fear of god so to speak has been shoved down in him

​

1. Ouroboros

Following similar idea as above. And going with the time travel trope, Tom is the one who travels back realizing how many deaths he caused, and damage to the wizard world seeks to earn redemption by saving people and training Harry.
