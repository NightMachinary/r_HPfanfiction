:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry or the Twins kept pranking Snape, and they would get past his locked and awesomely warded and cursed door. By removing the hinge pins. Hilarity ensues.


** The first thing I thought was /the hinges can only be seen from inside!!/ and right after /do British even use those? Maybe they only use lift off hinges/

/sigh/ I see plotholes everywhere. How am I supposed to enjoy reading anything?

*** I don't think they'd use modern hinges at all - they tend towards big old doors with the old castle two-layers of wood, so they'd probably end up with T-hinges and similar more than anything else, maybe an H-hinge if they upgraded sometime after the Statute. I can't find any pictures of any classroom door from the movies, so I can't say for certain, but it's my best guess for now. If they used a T or H hinge, they'd probably be visible on the outside, but it'd depend on where the hinge was placed and again, I can't say what the doors actually looked like until I dig out my copies of the movies. They'd probably go for a T-Hinge though - Iron was expensive back in the day and the longer hinge (if decorated, usually with a Fleur de Lis) was often a sign of wealth.

And hey, Rowling's work is full of plotholes, far bigger than the doors. She breaks her own rules so many times it's ridiculous. Just gotta Hakuna Matata your way out of it, fellow internet person. :)

And atm, what we use depends on the door you get. The manufacture can differ sometimes for different types of door and functions of doors (house front door, house back door, double-door for schools, double door for offices, etc). Also depends on what era your house was built in. The oldest house in Britain was built in 8500BC and we've only built more since then - and we haven't really kept styles consistent. :)

(Basically - /Shrugs/ "Could be anything.")

**** Damn, that's a lot of text! I have absolutely no idea what half of what you said means, but I'm gonna be googling hinges in a moment and see if I can understand it.

In the meantime, I can tell you I did find one photo of Snape's classroom door from the movies.

***** Heh. It's strictly an amateur interpretation - I'm a DM who runs a game for a very... creatively insane group, so I try to prepare a lot of broad knowledge like this to react to whatever they choose to do (and yes, Door Hinges did come up). I'm probably wrong to anyone who actually knows anything about Door Hinges, but I'm close enough that I can shrug and pass it off as a layman understanding. :D

Ah. Damn. That's a bound door (see the metal running across the upper middle? It's essentially there to hold the wooden bits of the door together) and not an obviously t-hinged door. The hinges would be internally accessed then, not externally. Thus, impossible to remove the pins from the outside without some really creative magic use (maybe you can levitate them through whatever small gap might exist between the edge of the door and the doorjamb the hinge is pinned to?

The Hinges part of the below link is a pretty good explanation of what I was saying.

***** Oh yeah, definitely. Probably one of the Robst/Faery Heroes era of writing, I'd guess. Definitely gotten me curious - I can remember it but also not and it's weirding my brain. :D

******* Well, we've got two suggestions in this thread already - so it's definitely not a singular-fic thing - but I feel like the one I'm thinking of isn't either of them.

********* Yeah, that's the one of the two suggestions (reichts2k) in this thread already. It could be it, but I remember it being a slightly bigger thing that that. Might just be getting it confused though.
