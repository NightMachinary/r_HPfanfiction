We all know the threads that exist to vent about tropes we don't like, but how about the opposite?

For instance, I'd like to see more Good!Dumbledore where effort is made to have his actions be positive instead of negative.

How about you?


** More "Golden Trio". The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione is one of the greatest parts of the series.

*** True, but it's also one of the more demanding tropes. After all, it doesn't depart far from canon AND it has been used in an uncountable number of works. With every story written, the minimum effort increases to stop the story from being a boring railroad along the Stations of Canon(Fanon). It requires new ideas, new events - but done right, it's a delight to read.

** I'd love to see more firmly Gryffindor!Harry. A Harry that is brave, daring, determined and chivalrous. Proper Hero with a capital H.

Also more power of friendship-sort of things. Forging the sword-ish fics. Overcoming adversity using the power of love. Canon themes. Good person!Harry. Thrilling adventures.

I like a Slytherin!Harry as much as the next person but I'm honesty getting a bit fed up with all the jaded, smirking, dark-magic practicing Harry's out there.

Oh, and Mentor!Dumbledore. So much potential wasted.

*** - Harry with a Paladin mentality is pretty rare, but so good. Like, brave, protective, firmly light, it's great is what it is.

- Yes! Adventure fics in general are needed. Just being in britain every single story is boring. Like, how about a fic that has Voldemort hide his Horcruxes all across the planet, with an epic journey through other magical countries, strange temples and all sorts of stuff?

- People seem to forget that Slytherin doesn't just stand for smirky, scoffy "cunning", but also ambition. A kid who wants to be "The best, ever" or "know everything" will go to Slytherin, not just 11 year old politicians.

- I treasure the few Mentor!Dumbledore fics we have dearly. My current favourites are Linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) and Linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip), though that last one has Harry being sort of whiny a lot.

***** People seem really reluctant to write original aspects into the magic system. Like spells! All Harry ever fights with are bone-breaker curses, stunners, severing charms and the occasional unforgiveable. Where is all the whacky shit? The deep transfiguration? The potion use?

And that's nothing to how trivialized or paled the entire world often is. Like, where are the lich-courts of Germany's Black Forest? Where is the hidden magical section of the Vatican Library, which contains notes by a magical apostle of Jesus analyzing the way he used magic? Where are the ruins of olympus? The merfolk library of atlantis? The anchor stones in Antarctica, powering the veil of the worlds?

JKR's magic system is open-ended for all of these to have a place. But people don't use it.

****** That's the nature of Fanfiction, even when the world is overly massive like the comic worlds of DC and Marvel people play overly safe and never expand further than the tight rails they see for themselves or if they do their walls are all miss matched, like sure magical section of the Vatican Library but it's mostly just for plot point to have Harry end up in Rome rather than Harry actually learning the magic to use but heaven forbid Atlantis comes up that's silly.

Its why stories like Cursed Summer and a smaller known fic "Identity by Highbrass" were so interesting to me, they expanded the Wizarding world beyond just the shores of Britain and maybe some of France. As for OC Spells, not many people do those at all especially since many of the debilitating effects without getting overly silly already exist as spell ideas if not out and out spells.

***** That's a fair point on Kingsley beating two Death Eaters simultaneously.

Canon information is thin on Aurors but I've always thought of them as a hybrid mix of special forces and an intelligence agenncy. Arthur says in OOTP that regurgitating toilets are too trivial for Aurors to deal with. McGonagall says the selection process is extremely stringent with Tonks being the only graduate in years, which suggests Auror training is similar to SOF selection where there's a high dropout rate. Kingsley pursuing Sirius and saying that he was in Tibet is kind of vague, but suggests that Aurors could have operational capacity in other countries.

****** Where the heck do you get that idea? Fudge is absolutely terrible, full-stop.

He gets Hagrid thrown in Azkaban without evidence in Book 2.

He, while knowing that there's a dangerous convict after Harry, just leaves him in Diagon Alley without any kind of escort in Book Three.

He orders soul-sucking demons with no concept of mercy, and precious little restraint, floating around a school full of children, also in Book Three. He then keeps them there after they storm the Quidditch pitch during a game, which could have had utterly catastrophic results with students being Kissed, if not for the actions of Dumbledore and presumably other professors casting Patronuses. That was a very near miss and Fudge should have immediately removed the Dementors.

He refused to believe or even listen to Harry and Dumbledore at the end of Book Three about the innocence of a man who, it must be noted, never received a trial (though that lack of a trial occurred under a previous administration, it should still be enough to get him to actually listen for a bit).

But by far the most important screw-ups come at the end of Book 4 and in Book 5. He has Barty Crouch Jr. Kissed without a proper investigation, which is horrifyingly sloppy work and effectively destroys tons of evidence in a massive ongoing murder and terrorism case. He refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, and instead of preparing his nation for the civil war that is coming, he decides to have Dumbledore and Harry slandered and marginalized, and even has Harry dragged into a kangaroo court after Harry is forced to defend himself against rogue dementors. He refuses to entertain any notion of Harry's innocence until he's forced to by the court system.

He then orders Umbridge to essentially sabotage the educations of every Defense student in Hogwarts out of paranoia about a coup d'etat that would, I have to emphasize, would be composed of /schoolchildren./

Fudge is, at every turn, venal, petty, incompetent, and so terribly afraid of having to face a crisis that he will do absolutely anything humanly possible to ignore oncoming disasters until he is forced to do otherwise. He acts hastily and without forethought when caution and diligence are required, and is completely indecisive when action is needed most. He is also an abysmal judge of character, since he is quite close with a semi-retired terrorist (Malfoy) and an unrepentantly, insanely-bigoted and sadistic flunky (Umbridge). He's not just your average politician; he's much, much worse.

******* I'm pretty sure that JKR intended all of that as a critique of the real world government. The British government has plenty of feats to its name in recent history that go toe to toe with the Ministry of Magic.

- Internment in Northern Ireland, where suspected terrorists were held without trial indefinitely.

- Extraordinary rendition and CIA/MI6 black sites, where both foreign combatants and British citizens were tortured without any recourse to judicial protection.

- Prime Ministers personally intervening to shut down fraud and corruption investigations into prominent individuals in order to secure lucrative arms sales.

- Sales of weapons to regimes engaged in genocide.

- Passing laws dramatically reducing liberty and privacy in the name of combating terrorism.

Meanwhile, for the vast majority of people, life goes on, peace endures, and they feel prosperous and happy - much like the vast majority of wizards appear to feel in peacetime, dysfunctional government notwithstanding.

Honestly, the Ministry is only slightly hyperbolic in its dysfunction. I don't think there's any example of recent politicians ordering the summary execution of prisoners, but that's pretty much the only thing Fudge does which is substantially out of step with Muggle government. And that's probably just because Britain doesn't have a death penalty anymore - I'm sure if you look at the governments of countries with capital punishment, you will find at least one example of a politician being involved in a wrongful execution.

********** This is true - bashing is not fun. Unless an author specifically hate a character, I believe it is just an easy device to use for ease of writing.

Often when Dursley abuse is taken to the extreme, bashing Dumbledore is an easy excuse to use instead of creating a reason why he never knew or didn't intervene (Although I once read a story where along with Lily's blood protection, Dumbledore placed extensive wards that made it impossible for anyone of a magical nature to know about, approach or think about the Dursleys until Harry's 11th birthday - including himself!

Or when they want to replace Ron with Neville or someone else but don't want to start their story back in first year when the friendship formed - bash him. It's too often used as an easy out.

Lastly, thanks for all the recommendations! I usually prefer ones with a bit more romance, but they seem very interesting regardless.

**** Um, that seems debatable at best? Granted, given the massive holes Rowling left for basically anything that wasn't in the narrow tunnel vision of Harry "I can't learn the names of the /maybe/ 30 kids that went to school in the same year as me over the course of 6 years" Potter you can basically make up almost anything you want for large parts of the Ministry/larger magical society to cover areas of concern. But presuming you don't, there are very much issues to be had.

 

As a single example, lets take the Ministry's ability to handle and foster foreign relations. While obviously the larger magical world is perhaps the biggest black hole in this entire series (counting only the books; I'm aware that Pottermore, Rowling interviews, etc. probably fill in that stuff but the line has to be drawn somewhere and the books is where I almost always draw it) what bits and bobs we do get are concerning.

 

What little we know of the ICW is that Dumbledore is the Supreme Mugwhump, which to me not only speaks well of Dumbledore's reputation abroad (makes sense for the savior of magical Europe) but also would after all these years imply that Magical Britain's international reputation is very much tied up with Dumbledore himself. In the same way that America's international reputation is very much tied up with the Commander in Chief.

 

So when the Ministry denounces Dumbledore and removes him from the ICW as Magical Britain's representative, the reputation of both took a hit. Indeed, when Dumbledore is reinstated as Britain's representative, the ICW doesn't reelect him to his former position. Given that Dumbledore probably served years if not potentially decades, its rather clear they do not hold him in as high esteem to not put him back in the chair after an absence of less than a year he had no control over.

 

Not that Magical Britain doesn't cause problems for its reputation all on its own. Even ignoring the whole "A terrorist became the dictatorial head of government in all but name" bit. Afer all, 99% of the events within the Goblet of Fire didn't take place within any civil war.

 

Two-thirds of the Triwizard Tournament events being duds for spectators is rather small in the grand scheme of things but you can imagine if something similar happened when say the UK hosted the Olympics there'd be quite a lot of talk and discontent about it. More important is the whole "oh, this innocent 14 year old boy is going to be forced to compete in a competition that's a deathtrap even for those arguably qualified for it. And we weren't able to prevent him from being entered and have no basic safety precautions that would offer a way to stop things now that the fire in the goblet has been put out. /shrug/ Oh well, hope the Boy Who Lived puts on a good show". Especially when it comes out that the culprit behind it was not only someone the Ministry thought had died in prison, not only had they been sneaked out of prison by the Head of the Department of /International Magical Cooperation/ (aka the guy whose whole job is foreign relations) who then subjected that future culprit to countless Unforgivables, but that culprit succeeded by impersonating probably the most well known of Auror the Ministry had, Mad-Eye Moody. Even if you hand-wave the entire ending of the third task as being the restart of the civil war, the tournament does not do good things for the Ministries reputation abroad.

 

What wasn't part of the civil war was the terrorist attack at the Quidditch World Cup. How could it be when no one knew of Voldemort's continued existence or Pettigrew's efforts to restore him? What you had was a terrorist attack at an international stage at an event that was almost certainly purposefully set up to show how much Magical Britain had recovered from the civil war and to help that very same process along. The one thing they could not afford to have happen happened. And after all that, did we hear of the Ministry doing anything? Arrests? Prosecutions? (or at least, of anyone other than literal no-name [and possibly nonexistent] mooks) What exactly would be the reaction if the UK had something similar happen during the men's football final in 2012 and never made an arrest?

 

All of this is only compounded of course by the Sirius Black fiasco. When he breaks out of course, but more so when the body of Peter Pettigrew is discovered and the whole story is eventually unraveled. (also, for more fun, our man Crouch is involved again! But I'm sure he's the perfect fit as the face of the Ministry to the wider world, right?)

 

What is just as important as what we see is what we don't see, namely international support either in 1996-97 or back in Riddle's first run. This is the nation that is the home of Albus motherfucking Dumbledore. It is inarguable that Magical Europe, at a minimum, owe Dumbledore and Magical Britain a debt. Outside of pure enlightened self interest of course, which states to put down dark lords before they gain momentum and it is all the more important to stamp them out when they do. And yet?

 

Silence. Not from Magical Europe. Not even from the former colonies that even after breaking free still maintained strong connections to Britain (at least on the Muggle side) Keep in mind, depending on how long he served, this could very well all be happening while /Dumbledore is still the Head Mugwhump of the ICW/ And still nothing more than a single French which that came over to be closer to her boyfriend.

 

The absolute best case scenario I can see to explain this is something analogous to Italy and the EU recently where Italy not wrongly feels they were abandoned in their time of need. An abandonment driven by fear. Which would perhaps absolve the Ministry from whatever horrible acts it caused/allowed/failed to prevent that would have otherwise caused that isolation, but still doesn't say great things about foreign relations.

 

Which leads us to the last "foreign relation": the goblins. Singled out here because they are organized and sizable enough to have all but made their own nation and launch the many rebellions Binns goes on about. Again this is an area of black holes where fanon reigns supreme. I will simply say that if a group that is all but a foreign nation, that you've had multiple wars with, controls your entire money supply (or at a minimum runs your only banks), you are /not/ in a stable and safe fiscal position.

 

Moving to internal politics would point toward many more issues, but this is already a much too long response to a two sentence comment.

He singled out Harry from day one to belittle and humiliate him, and it only got worse from there. Snape is a genuinely terrible person, obsessed with a woman long dead (and how creepy is that?) but spiteful enough that he would single out an 11-year-old who I can almost guarantee he knows lives with the harpy that is Petunia Dursley for further ridicule.

"It's lonely up here," Harry says. He's leaning against a pillar, the moonlight casting an eerie glow on pale skin and hollow cheeks.

"More like peaceful," Snape drawls. He stands nearby like a statue and looks at the empty grounds below.

It really quickly shows the drastic difference in their worldviews.

and after that establishes their relationship :

Snape sneers. "Leave it to an idiot such as yourself to be unappreciative of the peace and calm that midnight delivers."

**** Well I had a plot idea (that will probably never see the light of the day because a writer, I am not) where the Scrarcruxe is aware, but don't tell Harry who he is (for various reason such as "Don't tell to the kid whose collaboration is vitale to your return that you are the one who killed his parents".

So because of it, you would have an Harry who is at least partially aware (parents where not drunkards but wizard, you will receive a letter around your 11th birthday, stay discret until then . . .) thanks to the voice in his head that he call Tom (or Marvolo, or whatever).\\
Said Harry would go to Slytherin (cause he went to do his shopping another day so never met Draco, and "Tom" told him Slytherin were the best for years) and do his own things. Concerning the events, I always believe that the one that happened without any interference of Harry should always happen unless justified (Dumbledore hiding the Stone at Hogwarts, Lucius giving the Diary to Ginny . . .) but others should not.

As an example, I find it stupid how Hermione is always crying on Halloween, and Harry is always saving her, starting a friendship/ ship.\\
I mean, Hermione could cry in a loo that day (because at that point she was at the end of her rope and would have broken down at any time), but why would a Slytherin/ Voldemort's heir Harry (like we see in some fic) know about that, and why would he care about an annoying Mudblood crying. In canon, Harry and Ron went to tell Hermione about the Troll because :

- They felt bad about being the reason why she was there (Ron was complaining about Hermione to Harry, who totally shared the sentiment and didn't bother to contradict him).
- They knew where she was
- They had a moment of Gryffindor's bravery.

A Slytherin Harry (like one who grew up around Scarcruxe) should not have any of these reason (except maybe the bravery if you go with the Nature Vs Nurture idea) so while I could see a Ron (or any other Gryffindor who made Hermione cry that day) go to help Hermione that day. Why is it always the outsider Other House Harry that goes help her in a pure Canon fashion (except the fact that Harry would have died without Ron that is completely ignored). 90% of the time, reader can see the scene coming miles away and it's pretty cringy.\\
I disgressed but anyways, I think that this scene should not happen in a fic where Harry is different from canon, as well as some others such as the Flying Lesson (let's be honnest, even if the events happened exactly like canon except Harry is in Slytherin, Snape would rather strangle Harry himself than letting him joing the Quidditch team early).

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

The hat does take your consideration into account. Most of the people in Slytherin aren't in there because they are ambitious or cunning. They were in there because their parents were. Having a child point this out accentuates this and makes it even more in-line with canon. Hell, Draco should have been a Gryffindor. Crabbe and Goyle? Hufflepuff.

In this particular story she tries to come on to him. He tries to use the fact that they are in a public place to deny her without pissing her off. Thankfully they hear footsteps approaching so she leaves. He awards Hufflepuff 10 points for saving his ass. Said Hufflepuff is thoroughly confused because Professor Snape gives the kid absolutely no reason for why he earned so many points from Snape of all people.

** I will make a small list:

- Good is not soft Light side characters. As I have mentioned before multiple times on here, I feel this trope is sadly under-appreciated and underutilized in fanon, even though there is quite a bit of it present in canon. Chilord's Wind Shear (RIP, man), MarauderLover7's Innocent series, especially Sirius, Snape, Marlene McKinnon and Tonks, and both Harry and Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Unforgiving Minute are pretty great examples of this.
- As a corollary of above, war fics that actually delve into the cost of war. I hate fics that glorify war about as much as I hate fics that just... handwave a war away. I want fics where characters have to make harsh choices, have to leave with the consequences of those choices. I want fics where characters understand that they are doing, and will keep doing horrible things because if they don't, innocent people will pay the price. Once again, Chilord's Wind Shear is a great example of this. An even better example is Bobika's Beyond the Curtain, and Starfox5's Divided and Entwined, although I don't like fics with useless Harry and Ron.
- Good Ron fics, of course. I don't think enough good, or even competent Ron fics exist to make up for all the mud that has been slung at him to fulfil people's bash fantasies. In the same vein, competent Weasleys, by which I mean Weasleys taking more proactive roles than canon.
- Deeper exploration of magic. Rowling's magic system is very flexible, which means it has a lot of potential for any author who wants to play with it and take a deep dive into the magic system itself. Transfiguration in Harry Potter and the Art of Self-Fashioning, the elemental offensive magic and magic detection in MarauderLover7's Innocent series (especially in the latest fic, Intensity) and the peculiar matter manipulation that Harry uses in Wind Shear are all great examples, as are some of the very inventive Dark curses that Chilord came up with in Wind Shear.
- Mysteries set in the Potterverse. Maybe focusing on Harry's time as an Auror, or just an Auror procedural in general. Two of the greatest fics that I can name in this regard are FloreatCastellum's Auror Trilogy and Philo's Fate is a Four letter word.

*** - I think the problem with this is that there aren't any canonical light combat spells, while dark combat spells exist. You could totally make ones up, even have them make sense in canon (if a wizard is corrupted by darkness, this spell will attack that darkness directly). They also don't all just need to be bolts of light, they can be fire, shields, ethereal chains, etc. However, canonically, the "good guys" don't have magic that's equivalent to the destructiveness of the dark arts, which makes them seem very underpowered.

- I agree. Some tactical warfare or strategies wouldn't be amiss either.

- I agree with the Ron thing. Posted a few comments in this thread to that effect also.

- Same with this. The magic system is loose enough for all kind of whacky shit to be possible, not only in the magic system itself, but even the world at large. Strange magical communes, places of power, that sort of thing.

- I've read a few of those, but even there some of them just /had/ to bash Ron or Ginny. It's ludicrous.

**** I am fully aware that there aren't very many canonical light combat spells...but the fact that light magic seems underpowered in front of dark magic is entirely a fanon invention. In canon, we have /one/ good example of a proper light vs. dark duel, and that is the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in book 5. Just think back to that duel, does Dumbledore seem in any way underpowered or lacking in ammunition when compared to Voldemort? And they needn't be all bolts of light or fire either, transfiguration is a very powerful offensive discipline if one can use it properly in a battle. The Unforgiving Minute has some absolutely /kickass/ battle scenes between Harry and Dumbledore that make tremendous use of Transfiguration.

That said, I never meant that the good guys should only be limited to Light-seeming spells. War is a horrible business, and the concept of "innocence" very quickly loses all meaning. Even canonically, Harry cast both the Cruciatus and Imperius when necessary, and McGonagall cast the Imperius without so much as a second thought. Nor does the limitation of the Light side to Stunners and Disarmers make much sense. A Reducto or a Diffindo will kill every bit as effectively as the Avada Kedavra, or whatever the hell that internal organ damaging curse was that Dolohov was fond of using. The only difference is Reducto and Diffindo can be blocked by a Protego; Avada Kedavra, and presumably, Dolohov's curse, cannot. Similar results can also be achieved by a well-aimed, powerful Banishing spell on a large rock, or another suitable solid object.

And finally, I know we both agree bashers are the bane of fanfics, but can somebody please explain what is the need to bash Ron and Ginny in a Suspens/Mystery fic set in the /post-Hogwarts era?/

The more complex triwizard tournaments, with representatives from across the world instead of just western Europe, is also a nice trope when done well.

Smart/competent voldemort is one that we can always do to see more of. Where there's actually a political battle going on between Voldemort and Dumblebore that's not just incredibly simple, too.

Argue, and not say something remotely apologetic.

Having trust issues with Dumbledore because of his secrecy, but without the "Dumbles, I am Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell, and I own Hogwarts." MaybeMayba's fic "A beautiful lie" shows this quite well

linkffn(12792189)

Rational, pragmatic, competent Harry. Harry was easily in the top 10 most powerful wizards (among the living ones), even in OotP. The patronus driving off a 100 dementors in PoA was matched only by Aberforth Dumbledore in DH, and that dude is a 115 years old at that point. His magic was fully developed. Harry was in the beginnings of puberty. And in HBP, Dumbledore clearly states that there is a wide difference between the magic of an adult wizard and a less-than-17 wizard. He also said, in GoF, that Harry succeeded in overcoming Voldemort's will during Priori Incantatem. Wasted potential.

What Harry and Ron don't know can't hurt them. Actions have consequences, so get better at avoiding the consequences. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Master Memory Chars, Legilimency, Confundus, and Occlumency to keep that from happening. The ends justify the means. Dark Arts... are probably still too dangerous to practice without an expert to supervise you, but it's important to know the theory, just in case.

I want Hermione lose out on the Prefect badge because of what McGonagall and Dumbledore strongly suspect but can't prove. I want to see Harry be worried about sharing Half-Blood Prince's Potions book with Hermione, because of how she might use the knowledge in it. If the fic doesn't diverge before then, I want Harry and Ron to learn that Dolohov and Throwle have both died of a mysterious illness or committed suicide a few months after Hermione obliviated them at the diner---and have a debate about whether or not to talk to Hermione about it.

Good Ron Weasley, instead of constantly bashing him. I can deal with Dumbledore bashing, if need be, (even though I'd rather have little bashing as possible). But I love Ron, and hate when he's bashed.

Doing things the more mundane way, I think I read a couple of stories that dealt with people like Harry or Hermione dealing with things the Muggle way, but it'd be interesting to see more of that, imo.

Part of a story that just deals with friendships in general, rather with the Golden Trio or other characters. The Marauder Era interestingly enough has many fanfics that deal with friendships, and strengthening of said friendships, but I'd love to see more of that in the Golden Trio Era, even if it's not Golden Trio focused.

  but most people just aren't that good at it.

True, I have a difficult time writing sarcastic people, without making it seem edgy, or like they're older then they actually are. The few Marauder Fanfics I've read seem to do a slightly better job with this, imo.

True, you'd have to balance it somehow, would be appreciated if there were more that wasn't just a crackfic.

** - Harry figures out a way to have a decent life while he has to stay at the Dursleys, either before Hogwarts by using guile or after by using magic/allies' help.
- Harry figures out how to buy potions, or make them, that will heal his health issues.
- Harry learns to do his own research or at least uses his gold to buy help from experts.
- The Flamels become interested in Harry after the stone incident and become his mentors/help him.
- Sirius takes better care of Harry and ensures he gets medical care, clothing, and a better home (whether with him or not).
- Harry gets smart and finds another school, where he gains the skills and allies needed to defeat Voldemort and his DEs, as well as the Ministry idiots and pureblood wankers.
- The Unspeakables are more effective at dealing with Voldemort and/or the horcruxes, because if they were competent, they would realize how he continued to exist.
- Hedwig Lives
- Sirius Lives
- Remus and Tonks Live

** Honestly squib Harry gaining magic.

Like Izuku Midorya from My Hero, which is a decisive character by himself.

I honestly believe a my hero inspired fic would work very well, Toshinori filled by Dumbledore or any other character.

Shoto is obviously Draco.

Bakugo is hard, but I could make a case for a different Ron.

Yaoyorozu is Hermione.

Another idea is due to many WBWL fics following the same cookie cutter combo.

James and Lily are bad. Poor Harry. Brother is a dickhead. Dumbledore old coot. Hermione and Ron bad. Ravenclaw becuase author thinks their smart, and tries to create a "thought provoking", meticulously crafted "plot. Becomes an overpowered 1d character by the end.

It sounds like a genuinely terrible anime. And most of the time they arent finished.

Prince of Slytherin kinda does this but makes it work, yet I still dropped it die to being bored by it's slow pace. Like I know MHA is slow as well, but at least I care about the characters.

Harry acts like a bitch, and James is a fucking fool for the prophecy. Lemme just put an imperio on my son to go against my other son because I'm scared.

What a fucking loser.

WBWL fics need to cut out the "wrong" and have someone different for the chosen one. Have Harry go on seperate adventures, or even have him go Itachi style and have the PoV as the brother.

TL;DR use stories around you and shape these tropes into more creative things.
