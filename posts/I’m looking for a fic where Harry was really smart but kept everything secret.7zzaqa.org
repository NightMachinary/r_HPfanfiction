He was still a Gryffindor, and friends with at least Hermione. All I remember was that he borrowed the Ancient Runes syllabus and followed its timeline while learning on his own, but Hermione was really surprised because the class never manages to follow it and falls behind.

I think the story was not mainly about Ancient Runes like RuneMaster, but of Harry being more secretive about his learning of multiple subjects.

I've been trying to find this fic off and on for like two years, and I appreciate any help!!


** I have no idea what fic that is but I definitely want to read it.
