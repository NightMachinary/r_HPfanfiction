It was kinda like a wrong boy who lived fanfic except harry was like three years older than his brother. It started during the brothers first year but Harry's fourth (?) year, but it was still in harry perspective. Harry was a ravenclaw and at some point became a quidditch player. It was a harry/Fleur story and Fleur was a veela, but harry was immune to the allure. I don't remember what site it was on but I looked on ao3 so I was thinking it was on fanfiction.net.


** It's great, but unfortunately abandoned. Just as the last chapter introduced new characters and plots. It's a real pity.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD

*** Thanks anyway, I've been searching for this for a while and was going a little crazy over not finding it.

** It's not exactly a match to your description, as Longbottom is the BHL, but /Knowledge is Power/ by SerpentSannin might be what you're after.

It may be against site rules (#6) to post a link (though the "author's" note by Defenestratable suggests otherwise, that this is an authorized copy), but if you Google "Knowledge is Power SerpentSannin Fettucini", you should be able to locate a repost within the top couple of links.
