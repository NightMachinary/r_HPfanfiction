Basically, removing the marrow from one's ulna (i.e. forearm) and hand bones, and replacing it with wand core material.

Obviously in the realm of the dark arts as it involves defiling one's own body for power and performing a perverted form of wandcrafting.

It's not intentional. Basically Voldemort blew up Harry's wand and the shards embedded in his arm.

** This is the only fandom where you can ask for fic with something so bizarre and specific and actually get some results. Mind-boggling.

I still feel obligated to encourage you to write it, OP. ;)

*** Why are people downvoting this? It was relevant, concise, and I highly doubt that most of the HPMoR haters on this sub have ever so much as seen Significant Digits - which, BTW, was not written by the same author, and is quite a different style to HPMoR. It's a fan sequel.

  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.
