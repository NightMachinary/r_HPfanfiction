Looking for a co writer for a harry potter slytherin oc story. It is a bit au in the sense that Harry does not have his canon dad but a maruaders oc and his mother is the same. The story is from a slytherin ocs point of view and they met as childhood friends in primary school. Pm me if interested for more details. I am in the Us cst time zone. It's a story me and another co writer started but they quit half way through it. So need help pm or dm if your interested and what timezone your in.
