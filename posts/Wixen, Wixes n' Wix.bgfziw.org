Stumbled upon these gender neutral nouns for witches n' wizards on ye old Tumblr today. After some light research I have no idea where these originated from - anyone here have a clue?

​

That besides, what're your thoughts on these being used within fanfics? I haven't found any fics with these utilised *yet* but I wouldn't be surprised if there are already many out there.


** In German, Wixen (Wichsen, Wixxen, ...) means wanking. I wouldn't be able to read a fic using these pronouns without giggling.

*** My cat's name, Ember, means human in Hungarian. Cookie is a childish way of saying penis too. It's inevitable that words are going to be weird in other languages. Doesn't stop it from being hilarious.

** Hmmmm, tried to find something in thesaurus - I did find that /vixen/ can also be used for /witch,/ that word being in mostly associated with, well, a crafty supernatural female. The word /wix/ is not, in fact, included in thesaurus, so... I guess, it's not a real word, lol. It doesn't seem to have any other use other than in surnames.\\
Etymology from thesaurus:

Old English *fyxen (implied in adjective fyxan), fem. of fox (see [[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fox][fox]], and cf. Middle High German vühsinne, German füchsin). Solitary English survival of the Germanic feminine suffix -en, -in (cf. Old English gyden "goddess;" mynecen "nun," from munuc "monk;" wlyfen "she-wolf"). The figurative sense "ill-tempered woman" is attested from 1570s. The spelling shift from -f- to -v- began late 1500s

As you see, the ending -en already means that it can't be gender neutral word, lol.

​

Truthfully, to me it reminds a lot of Winx Club, hah.

​

But, yeah, I have occasionally seen them used in fanfics - can't tell in which ones, as they mostly were used randomly. But they are more likely to appear in 'high fantasy' fics, I think.

** There isn't any history behind it if that's what you mean by 'where these originated from.' It's just a word Tumblr made up as a gender-neutral term, since Tumblr needs a gender-neutral term for everything and apparently doesn't want to acknowledge that both witch and wizard are gender neutral. They aren't the same thing, either - having them be the male and female version of a generic 'magic-user' population is something relegated to Harry Potter and some other recent fiction.

Witches make covenants with the Devil for demonic power. Wizards study magic. The end.

If you absolutely need a gender-neutral term, try arcanist.

** I prefer the term "magicals" myself. Seems to make a lot more sense than whatever the hell "wixen" is.

** I thought it came from Tumblr with the Wiccan community. I've seen it a bunch of time and more and more frequently, it feels.

The first time I read it in a fic, it really threw me. It's probably because English is not my native language and I'm still learning, but it really made me stop and took me out of the story. I'm always disturbed by these things, mostly because I never understand them haha. I still don't understand what difference it brings in the HP universe. (But at least, after the third fic, I got used to it somewhat).

*** I'm a native English speaker, and it throws me, too. I've only seen it maybe three times in my life, and I've read a lot of fanfiction.

Considering that a good chunk of authors write harems and another solid part pairs Harry and Hermione with fascist thugs/war criminals, I really doubt that many authors would care.

** I actually came across this term in a fanfic and I've decided I quite like it. It seems a very convenient plural form. If you're interested, this is the fanfic, I've been following it for a while and I enjoy it a lot:

As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom... some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry. Disabled OCs. Slow-build. No pairings.

** Does anyone else really hate these nouns? I've only seen them a few times, and they just... really bug me. Besides, we already have a couple of words (like "magicals" or "magic-users" or "mages" if you want to be high fantasy) that work just fine, so why do we need new ones?

** According to Urban Dictionary, six is a gender neutral term for witch or wizard.

This definition was entered in June 2016 so I'm guessing somewhere around that time. A few months before June.
