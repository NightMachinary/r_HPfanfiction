While reading the Harry Potter books I came to the conclusion that the position of Head of House are more of a honorific title for the teachers than a job designed to help the students.

The prime example would be Professor McGonagall. While I can understand that she is overworked what with her three positions (Teacher, Deputy Headmistress and Head of House) that doesn't excuse most of her behavior. Her priority should be the well-being of the students under her care. But throughout the books she never really did anything for her students : -The letter to the cupboard under the stairs?? -She didn't take the time to investigate the claim of the Golden Trio about the Philosopher's Stone. -She punished them instantly when she caught them coming back from helping Hagrid with the dragon instead of going down to the bottom of the story. -Detention in the Forbidden Forest at night while unicorns where being killed ?? Really? You were caught out of bounds after curfew so your detention will be to be out of bounds after curfew. Makes sense. -She didn't do anything to protect Harry when the school turned on him for being the Heir or Slytherin. -She never investigated Neville's problem with his wand, thus never tried to remedy the situation. -She let Hermione use a time-turner when she should have known that the girl would work herself to the ground. -She never put a stop to Malfoy's bullying of her students. -Knowing Harry didn't enter his name in the Tournament, she didn't try to set the record right in front of the school. -She didn't do anything for Harry's detentions with Umbridge. A biscuit won't fix a butchered hand. (While some might argue that she didn't know. It's her fault, she never made herself available to her students. She's never seen in the Common Room).

Having taught Harry's parents, she assumed that Harry and James were made of the same cloth. So she didn't listen to any of Harry's excuses thinking that he was spinning takes just as his father would have done. She seems disappointed that Harry isn't more like his parents when she has no right to expect anything from Harry.

She assumes that because she knew Harry's parents she knows him too on some level (by use of comparison). Her professional behavior prevents her from truly knowing him, and that's a shame.

Her efforts to remain fair and neutral towards Harry are actually harming him. Harry will always receive special treatment be it good or bad. (Snape singling him out in his first lesson, Rita wanting to tarnish his image, Umbridge wanting to break him and his influence, the Ministry either trying to use him or destroying him)

Harry is not normal and it is unfair to treat him as if he was.

Harry is muggle-raised, introduced to the Wizarding World by Hagrid (nice chap, not the brightest lumos), and everyone is treating him like he has lived in the Wizarding World all his life. He doesn't have parents to fight his battles for him and help him adjust. Harry doesn't know anything about his rights in the Wizarding World, he doesn't know how to handle his fame or the press, he can't complain to anyone if he is treated unfairly or is abused, he doesn't know anything about his parents/family, nobody taught him how to write with a quill...

Let's imagine a student is deaf. McGonagall's response to that would be to treat them as any other students. But that would mean not giving them the means to achieve as much as their peers.

This is a problem with fairness. It's not treating everyone the same way, it's tailoring your response according to the person's situation so they have the same chance in life as everybody else.

So I'm very disappointed with her character both in the books and in fanfiction.

We don't know much about the other Heads of House but we know that : -Professor Flitwick never stepped in to stop his students from bullying Luna. -Snape favored his Slytherin so much that they never learned from the consequences of their actions. It reinforced their beliefs that they were superior and could get away with everything. -None of the Heads stepped in during the Heir of Slytherin episode nor during the Potter Stinks badges incident.

So in the end, what is a Head of House for. To me the position appears to be symbolic more than anything.

Hogwarts' staff seems content with teaching only. They do not involve themselves in anything else. They punish and take points but don't seem keen on helping the students achieving to the best of their abilities.

--- Side Note---

I find it funny that Snape tells Harry that he won't be receiving special treatment from him, because he already is. -Singling him out in class. -Asking questions only to him. -Treating him more harshly than the rest of the student body. -Talking about his father. Really. Snape spent more time with James than Harry, he is more likely to have been influenced by him than Harry. Giving James, a dead man, power over his actions. James is dead and Snape is fighting against his ghost, giving his son importance. Whether he realizes it or not, James has won; Severus is miserable and unable to move past the treatment he received from the Marauders.

I wish Harry would have fought back at the unfair treatment he received in Snape's class.

“I don't expect special treatment, sir. Before coming to Hogwarts, I didn't know anything about my parents, I didn't know I was a wizard, and I didn't know I was famous for something I don't even remember. So I didn't grow up expecting anything to be handed to me. What I want, sir, as a normal student is to be treated like everyone else. You tell me I shouldn't expect special treatment from you and yet I still am. Pausing at my name on the class roll? Singling me out with questions you know I can't answer? Reminding everyone I am a celebrity when you should just treat me as any other students. Blaming me because, I, a first year in my first ever potion class didn't have the knowledge required to stop Longbottom from melting his cauldron, when might I add, my back was turned to him. Do you expect me to know everything, sir? Do you expect your student to come to their first class with a Mastery in potions, or is it just me? Is it because I'm the famous boy-who-lived? Talk about not receiving special treatment from you, sir. If I'm given special treatment by anyone then feel free to talk to them because it's their choice, not mine. But don't take it out on me when I have nothing to do with it. Special treatment, good or bad, is still special treatment. I can't control how people treat me, or their reaction to my name. Only they can. So either you treat me normally, or you're just another victim of the boy-who-lived myth. I'm taking Neville to the infirmary, as I can guess you don't want me in you classroom. Good day, sir”


** Two sentences inton your "fighting back" Snape would have been like "50 points from Griffyindor, detention, and see me after class".

Have you forgotten how it is to be in school? And I mean not even specifically a British boarding school (which is even more extreme), but just a normal, modern school. There are some teachers who give a fuck, but if they don't, they don't. And as a student, you are always powerless and at the mercy of the teacher.

Then there is the fact that this is a British boarding school in the 90s. Thirty years ago.

Back then (and to an extent, today still) bullying and roughhousing was not only allowed, but to an extent encouraged.\\
Blah blah, stenghtens you, blah blah blah.

The argument essentially boils down to "How are you ever going to have authority, when you appeal to it for all of your problems? How are you ever going to have authority, when you cannot deal with adversaries who don't play fair?"

I'm not in favor of this kind of teaching, but that is the underlying idea behind these "teaching methods."

If Harry had gone to Dumbledore, and he had spoken freely, I bet his response would have been along the lines of "Harry, all your life you will have people hating you for who you are, through no fault of your own. You can either learn to deal with it now, or later. I recommend now, when a mistake costs you 50 points and a detention, not your job and career."

This of course doesn't make it okay, it doesn't help social justice, or is healthy - but it is a way of thinking that exists, was prevalent at the time.

In other words: this is an explanation, not a justification.

** As an aside, I find it really weird that one teacher teaches seven year groups worth of classes by themselves. I'm a secondary science teacher, and I'm basing my observations and thoughts off my own experiences teaching in the Australian (specifically in the state of New South Wales) system.

My first two years of teaching were at a Central school (K-12), where each year group at the secondary level had roughly 50-60 students. At Years 7-10 level where they have more compulsory subjects, this translates to two classes per year level. Let's equate Science with Potions. At Hogwarts, Potions classes were organised as Gryffindor/Slytherin and Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff, so student numbers in the 1st-5th year classes would have been similar to what I experienced with my 7-10 classes. The school I was at worked on a Week A/B timetable, and the students in each year level did 7 hours of Science classes in a fortnight. For this to happen, plus the 11-12 students doing 7 hours of one or more specialist Science courses in Biology, Chemistry or Physics, we needed to have 3 teachers (1x Head Teacher + 2 teachers) in the Science faculty to cover all the classes. The standard load is 5 classes per teacher. Head Teachers typically have a reduced load of 4 classes due to their increased admin load. Even allowing for the fact that there are no specialisations within Potions at the 6th and 7th year levels, and that it tends to collapse into one class for those year levels due to the small number of students who meet Snape's requirement of achieving an O at OWL level to be eligible to continue with Potions to NEWT level, I don't see how it is physically possibile for him (or teachers of any other subject at Hogwarts) to teach 12 classes apiece.

*** Yes I've read some and I think it's because the authors realized that the Heads of House were not what they were meant to be and wanted to remedy that.

But I seem to have stumbled upon a bad string of fanfictions in which McGonagall is her usual canon self and Harry accepts it. Harry goes to see McGonagall with a problem, she doesn't take the time to listen, doesn't believe him or dismiss what he says as exaggeration. Harry then leaves, disappointed and without a fight. Harry is a wimp. It's fanfiction! He should say something! It would be interesting seeing McGonagall realizing her mistakes.

“I don't know why I even came here. Just as usual, you're of no help. Am I wasting your time? Do you have more interesting things to do than to listen to me? Do you think I come here just to annoy you? No, I come here because you're my Head of House, you're supposed to be the person I go to when I have a problem. But do you listen? No, of course, I'm always exaggerating or lying or you don't have the time. Personally, I'm used to deal with things on my own, but some of the students in your House are eleven years old, they are children who need help and sometimes a Prefect won't cut it. And after that you blame me for getting into dangerous situations when you won't take me seriously when I come to you. Do you investigate the claims of the students? Never, why bother? If they were assigned detention, they deserved it. If they lost point, they should be trying to win some back instead of whining about it. Children's problem are so inconsequential. Severus Snape is Neville Longbottom's boggart? Why the young man is easily scared. Harry Potter is slandered by the student body? It will toughen the lad up. I loathe Professor Snape because he is a bully and a lousy teacher but he's a better Head of House than you are, at least he fights tooth and nail for his students. Why are you Head of House, exactly Professor? Because of your Gryffindor Pride? Wear a badge it will suit you better. If you don't care for us, at least step down and let us have someone who will. My parents would have been so disappointed in you. Goodnight”

**** A time traveling Harry delivers the sickest burn to McGonagall exactly for this reason, in this story among a one-shot collection, called /Quantum Leapfrog/.

** I swear no one has heard of suspension of disbelief.

The vast majority of your issues stem from one core fact: if the adults of canon had acted in a reasonable, responsible manner, canon would have been much different and honestly boring.

Year 1: don't tell students about the third floor corridor, and put an age line/fidellius on that door, tell the teachers the fidellius secret. The mirror traps Voldemort, nothing else happens.

Year 2: Slytherin's monster is in the castle, has an incredibly long lifespan, can petrify and kill people without leaving a mark; teachers research magical snakes, stock the castle with dissollusioned roosters, and maybe stake out the toilet where the ghost of the only dead victim from the first time happens to be haunting.

Year 3: Remus and Dumbledore do a quick check of the Shrieking Shack after Halloween, apprehend Sirius, find out WHY he broke out of prison, capture Pettigrew, Sirius is exonerated, etc.

I could keep going but it doesn't matter, because in this situation, canon from Harry's perspective would be boring as hell. Or at least, not remotely the same story and more “slice of life” in a magical world. In the story that JKR wanted to tell, Harry was the protagonist and mystery solver. That means that the adults can't solve the problems for him. They can certainly help or hinder him, but in the end Harry saves the day. Characters behave the way they do to tell that story, regardless of how they should logically or reasonably act. This is compounded by the target audience of the books, along with the narrative style: ie, for children and then young adults, and fantastical/whimsical.

Finally, there's the intent of the writing vs the perspective of the reader. JKR intended for Dumbledore to be a the wise mentor, for McGonagall to be the stern but fair teacher, for Molly Weasley to be the overbearing but loving mother. However, based on an individuals past experiences, biases, and beliefs, they may regard each of these characters WILDLY differently.
