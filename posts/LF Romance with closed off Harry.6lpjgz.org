Looking for any story that features an emotionless Harry being in a relationship. Or any relationship where his partner has to force him to show emotion.


** What We're Fighting For by James Spookie

H/Hr. Harry is emotionless as he was trained as a soldier and is clueless about emotions/feelings.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
