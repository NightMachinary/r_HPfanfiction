*** I think in the fandom at large, Hermione is much more popular than Ron - but on this subreddit in particular it appears flipped.

In any case, I also quite like Ron, and I think most of the fandom does as well. He's funny and an important part of the trio. I think part of it is that he ended up with Hermione, which pleases some, and displeases others (and will thus acerbate the feelings towards him). That + his fairly memorable angry moments/""""betrayals"""" towards Harry, combined with his normality, make it easy for some to dislike him.

** Albus Dumbledore. I really wish he and Harry had hashed a few things out and OotP/HBP will always leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I really do still find him hilarious and enjoyable.

James Potter, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Sirius Black. Great potential 3D characters that were flattened in the end. I'll never be over Bella dying at Molly Weasley's hand when Minerva McGonagall was standing right there and Sirius dying so Arthur could live.

Cho Chang. Another great potential character done dirty. I don't mind the splitting in the end because Marietta is still an issue, but the narrative that she was just over emotional doesn't sit right with me. It should've been a source of character growth for Harry and i get he was 15/16, but he walked away only learning he didn't like crying girls.

***** For Malfoy (and Snape), the reason they're popular/likable is because those actions aren't particularly emphasized or presented in as horrific a light as they really /would/ be. It was a stylistic choice from JKR to make the reader not /hate/ them as people by the end.

For instance, if we look at Snape, we get some of the backstory that leads to him disliking Harry - so that puts the earlier interactions with him into some context, instead of us simply hating the guy. He comes across as a tragic figure, which the reader will tend to find sympathetic.

For Malfoy, most of my opinion of him got formed in the first few books - where, although he's an antagonist, he's not a particularly /serious/ one. When I see him pop up, it's usually somewhat incompetent, schoolyard rival kind of vibe. His bigotry and superiority complex are also explained by how he was raised, which makes it easy to not blame him for it. It's only in the later books that we see him commit some truly horrific acts - but they're not particularly emphasized there, and IIRC the passages emphasizing his doubt/how he's being made to do it are more of a focus. So we combine that to have an impression of him as a schoolyard bully that's that way because of his family, a fairly /incompetent/ character there for Harry to triumph over, and not a real threat.

Lavender, in contrast, gets scenes that are really focused on her being annoying and clingy and doesn't really get many redeeming characteristics - simply because those are the only scenes that we get that focus on her. In a vacuum, she's a lot better than Malfoy - but when reading, she's very easy to slot into the 'annoying' box and never shift away.

******* Well, if we look at the early books as entirely serious there are a lot of situations that get far worse than they are when viewed from an in-genre way (eg - all the adults being incompetent, the abuse the Dursleys use, etc etc).

Malfoy fits in fine there - like, he's clearly incredibly bigoted, but it's just as clearly a function of his upbringing and he's a child. It's hard to look at a 12 year old and say that they're a monster, or at least it is for me.

For Snape, in a society where it's perfectly acceptable to toss a child out of a window to see if they're magical, is his acerbity that bad? And for Neville's parents, I'm not actually sure how early on JKR decided they'd have been tortured into vegetables (they only get mentioned as such in book 4, so it may be a situation like Dumbledore not using Apparition in book 1 because it didn't exist). In any case, everyone's had that 'Mean' teacher - I had one in elementary school who you could hear from three room away when she was mad, and who scared the parents. That's a pretty trope-y inclusion for Snape

Those are both coming from his upbringing - again, he's a 12-13 year old. There's a reason we don't treat children as adults - here, it's almost certainly coming from how his father talks about muggle-borns and half-humans.

If it's in a children's book series that isn't meant to examine every situation objectively and where events in earlier books make little sense with new magic available in the next? Yes, it certainly could.

So much of the early books/world makes no sense if looked at /seriously/ that I wouldn't use that sort of inference as major proof. And it's not like we don't see how Snape interacts with Neville. It's /bad/, but it's not /horrific/ like torture.

********* *Reinhard Heydrich*

Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich (; German: [ˈʁaɪnhaʁt ˈtʁɪstan ˈɔʏɡn̩ ˈhaɪdʁɪç] (listen); 7 March 1904 -- 4 June 1942) was a high-ranking German SS and police official during the Nazi era and a main architect of the Holocaust. He was chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD). He was also Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor (Deputy/Acting Reich-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia. He served as president of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC, later known as Interpol) and chaired the January 1942 Wannsee Conference which formalised plans for the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question"---the deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe.

Snape might be a dickhead, he might have treated Lily like shit, and he certainly may have been a bigot. But at the end of the day, he loved Lily.

Being able to love someone certainly doesn't make you a good person, and that's not the argument I'm trying to make. I'm also certainly not saying that Snape "deserved" Lily.

But the idea that someone could love someone so fiercely that they would do anything, endure any torture, and undergo any mission to try and avenge them, Snape being the vehicle for that vengeance or not, is certainly, on its own, beautiful.

"Always," is a pretty apt summary of that feeling and, for what it was worth, being delivered by Snape's character shouldn't diminish its affect.

Snape flipped before Lily died. Immediately after he discovered Harry was the target of the prophecy he asked Voldemort for mercy for Lily, and then immediately went to Dumbledore, anyways, to plead for him to protect her.

The rest of your response is fairly similar to someone else, so I'm just going to paste my message to them:

Snape obviously cared more about Lily than whether or not she returned his affection if she'd been dead for 16 years.

#+begin_quote

To be honest, I'd think it was creepier if Snape pulled a complete about face and became a good person after she died as some kind of, "Look at me, look how much you'd have been happy with me."

Lily died. She died hating Snape. She died fighting against a cause that Snape was a part of.

Snape fully understood that. He didn't need or want to change into what Lily would have wanted. He lost that chance for her to see that he could be better. Perhaps, even, he felt he didn't deserve to be anything other than bitter and unhappy.

Love is not "good." It's a human emotion that practically everyone but sociopaths are capable of feeling. Even evil people.

Snape, a mostly rational person who was fairly firm in his belief in the cause of the Death Eaters, turned traitor immediately once he found that Voldemort might be targeting Lily directly. Even after receiving Voldemort's assurances that he wouldn't kill her.

Then, after she was dead, and the "obsession" would have been far out of his reach, he spied on Voldemort at his own peril for at least 3 years, before eventually being murdered, using his last seconds to pass on the vital knowledge to Harry on how to kill Voldemort, despite the fact that he would be /long dead/ before Harry could make use of it.

I'm not saying Snape was a /good person/, I'm saying he /loved/ Lily. There is no obsession in human history capable of imitating love so closely.

He also kinda went around it in a... not super great way. As a teacher he was petty, spiteful, and malicious. It's not what Lily would've wanted. In the Legend of Korra, the way Katara treats Korra as her person, despite being the legacy of her dead lover, is healthy and emotionally mature.

To be honest, I'd think it was creepier if Snape pulled a complete about face and became a good person after she died as some kind of, "Look at me, look how much you'd have been happy with me."

Lily died. She died hating Snape. She died fighting against a cause that Snape was a part of.

Snape fully understood that. He didn't need or want to change into what Lily would have wanted. He lost that chance for her to see that he could be better. Perhaps, even, he felt he didn't deserve to be anything other than bitter and unhappy.

#+end_quote

I don't believe they're fundamentally different things.

The cliche of hyper-rational (or just evil) characters who scoff at Love as a blinding, irrational and hazardous emotion aren't /wrong/. Love can be categorized quite neatly. It is an emotion evolved by humans (and, arguably, in a few other species of animals) to encourage reproduction and ensure we care for our young.

However, by virtue of being a sentient, thinking species, we have turned it into something more. Something extremely powerful. It's why I dislike the idea that hyper-rational characters would discard it so easily. We humans put so much value into feeling loved and cherished, that it can accomplish amazing feats. A mother can lift a *fucking car* to save her child. We'll jump in front of bullets, a sure death, to save our loved ones. The ultimate sacrifice.

The "love as an emotion" isn't different from what the DoM would be researching. However, I think the DoM, with any sense, would be researching how extremely powerful such an emotion could be. Lily loved her son and, with that love, took down the most evil and powerful Dark Lord to ever grace Britain's shores.

Dumbledore, I think, says it most aptly.

#+begin_quote
  "There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times.

It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all."

I'd probably say personal choice. I don't think Lord Voldemort much cared what happened to the children in the school, so long as they /stayed/ in the school. They were his hostages, and nothing more, I think.

#+begin_quote
  or that he couldn't be reasonable even if given a sufficiently good argument?
#+end_quote

I don't think, nearing the end, that Voldemort was a very rational person. There's ample evidence for this, such as killing Snape to gain control of the Elder Wand, despite having literally been the person to kill Grindelwald in his cage. Voldemort, had he any rational bone in his body at that point, should have known that either he was the master than and there, by virtue of having killed the previous master, or that killing wasn't necessary. Only defeat. In which case he would have suspected Draco.

To actually answer your question, I don't think that Voldemort would respond to any argument rationally. With his position of power, the only things that may have changed his courses of action would have been a significantly persuading threat to his goals.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think he could have been convinced to catch more flies with honey at Hogwarts like he presumably did back in the day?
#+end_quote

I don't think Tom caught many flies with honey while at school. He put up a front to his teachers, but to everyone else he was already gathering a base of power. This is the boy who went on to ask Horace about Horcruxes and murdered another student and opened the Chamber of Secrets to start petrifying students at the age of 16.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think that Harry wouldn't have sacrificed himself if Dumbledore told him about the scar earlier or that he needed to be told at the last possible moment?
#+end_quote

Oh, there's no doubt in my mind that Harry would have sacrificed himself no matter when he was told. I think Dumbledore delayed telling him because he knew as soon as Harry was aware, he'd want to end it as soon as possible. It was two-fold, I think.

One, Dumbledore knew there was at least a chance, perhaps the greatest chance, that Harry would survive.

Two, having Harry sacrifice himself at the last moment would ensure that the Horcruxes would be gone or, at least, would be well on their way to being destroyed. If Harry was kept unawares of his potential survival, it would allow him to pass on his mother's sacrifice to the rest of the school.

#+begin_quote
  “SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and *silence was forced upon them all*.

  “He beat you!” yelled Ron, *and the charm broke*, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, *more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.*

  But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. *Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort*

  “I'll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore's Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from *the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.*

#+end_quote

I do think a heroic act was needed to pull the sword from the Sorting Hat. Beyond that, I think a courageous or heroic act is necessary to even properly wield the sword.

1. Harry was preparing to fight a Basilisk, when the sword was introduced.

2. Dumbledore used to to destroy the ring, yes, but we're unaware of *when* he obtained the sword. It's entirely possible that he, knowing it was imbued with Basilisk venom, took it to the Gaunt house and intended to destroy the item there. I'd say setting out to destroy an item of great danger and evil was quite courageous.

3. Snape wielded the sword, at least temporarily, to take it to Harry in the forest. You could debate whether or not this action, just transportation, would require triggering that requirement however I think, should you force the issue, an argument could be made that defying his Lord would be quite courageous.

4. Ron jumps into the water to save his drowning friend. Quite heroic.

It is, I suppose, entirely possible that such a requirement is a self-fulling prophetical myth.

***** Yup.

The entire WBWL trope is based on the idea that James would have been a terrible father who ignored Harry.

Many Snape fics (and there are a lot) are based on the idea that Snape was forced to join the Death Eaters to protect himself from big bad James. There's a fic I've seen rec'd here more than once that makes Snape Jewish and James an anti-Semite, so the other Marauders decide to be friends with Snape instead. Or the popular fic where the Weasley twins travel back in time to learn that the Marauders were bullies not worthy of the twins' worship and Snape was a put-upon abuse victim.

This sub is quite anti-Snape, but go to the main sub and say something pro-James. You'll likely get a response like "I'm not interested in your bully apologism, maybe if you'd been bullied in school you would understand that James left lifelong scars."

Then there's the entire "anti-marauder" tab on tumblr. Look no further than the infamous "James Potter was a bully who sexually assaulted a fellow student and deserves no redemption, you can't change my mind" picture.

Or take a look at the Harry Potter movie tour. No mention of James/Sirius/Remus in addition to no Marauder merchandise (beyond a few things with the map). There's a reason Snape gets marketed and the Marauders don't.

And I mean in the context of Romione being bad. I have literally had people present these things as reasons they'd be good together.

  Her "love" for Lupin is written as a creepy obsession.
#+end_quote

I just didn't read it that way. (Hey, this is an unpopular opinion thread.)

I wasn't at all bothered by her depression in book 6. She had just been seriously wounded by her aunt; her cousin died picking up the duel when she fell. She knows that the war could accelerate at any minute, putting her Muggle-born father in serious danger. And to top it off, the man who had been a work partner/personal support to her had not only rejected her but run off on a suicide mission. Add in her well-documented family history of mental illness, and I'm not surprised that she had a rough go of it.

I didn't care for her public declaration of love in the aftermath of Dumbledore's death, but I can forgive a young woman under a great deal of stress for making a poor choice. If Lupin had said "I'm not interested, I don't love you," and she had carried on, THAT would have crossed the line to creepy obsession for me. But he didn't. He made excuses for why she shouldn't feel the way she felt... and she knew how she felt. She wanted him regardless of the age gap, the money situation, and the lycanthropy.

Maybe Lupin just didn't say "this isn't mutual" in the moment because it would have made for an awkward situation. But he didn't have to marry her or have sex with her. He could have said "no" at any time in the next few months. He didn't. And when he DID leave, he again pulled out the "for her own good" card rather than "I don't love her." In the last scenes in which Lupin appeared, I thought it was abundantly clear that he wanted a marriage and family with her; he'd just been convinced that he would hurt her.

I do wish she'd come to the final battle talking about Teddy and the cause they were fighting for rather than Lupin alone. The cut scene from the film improves upon this nicely when they see each other and do talk about Teddy. Probably the one time I think the movie does something better than the book and it gets cut, lol.

That being said, Lupin had a point, even if he didn't believe it. He was too old for her at the time, and he did let her down easy.

The whole scene about publicly declaring her love is pretty much what sucked for me though, where they pressure Lupin into accepting her advances.

I can't argue the too old point because that's completely subjective once everyone's a legal adult with a career. I wish they were a bit closer in age because it's heading toward ick territory for me, too, and if Lupin hadn't been concerned about the age gap I would have thought less of him.

The whole “oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” Scene and the Big-Head Boy badge, I used to find so hilarious, but thinking back, it's kind of dark how he was so proud of his accomplishments, but then ridiculed for them. As well as this was when he was given the promotion and his family hinting that he might not have got it on his own merits, which may have been slightly true, but you still don't say that to someone who's just told you they've achieved their dream job! I mean, yes he said some things back that were pretty ruthless, but he'd just been told that he had only got his dream job because the Minister had ulterior motives, and to me that seems a pretty normal response.

Snape joined the DEATH EATERS right out of school and people pass it off as ignorance to what they did. Sirius joined the order right out of school and they call him reckless for fighting for his friends. Sirius grew up wuickly to help Harry and escaped prison because Peter was close to Harry. Snape bullied Harry as a grown man because he looked like James. Dumbledore trusts Snape because Tom killed Lily and Snape liked her despite him having spied on Dumbledore yet still distrusts Sirius after Tom killed Lily and James, tortured the longbottoms and basically ruined his life. Sirius is the Snaoe that made the right choices yet Sirius gets shit and Snape gets pitty and second chances.

Sirius was such a good character and everyone calls him an arse who put revenge before family and a person who bullied those he deemed beneath him. Its exactly what Snape is yet Snape is treated well and Sirius like shit.

If I had my choice, I'd have had her + the rest of the Weasley family more adopt Harry, to have her as more of a sister figure to him. Or, if going with the relationship route, having her be more of a character before book 5, with some more scenes involved (particularly at school).

** Oh yessss, this is the thread I've been waiting for /cracks knuckles/

I have a real soft spot for Percy Weasley. I see how he's easy to hate/overlook - he's pompous, arrogant, and a huge stickler for the rules, but he ultimately does what he thinks is right... even if his interpretation tends to be pretty black-and-white. He's /very/ different than the rest of his family, which must have caused some tension, and his frustration with them / the family's reputation is understandable, especially considering his ambitions in the ministry. And thinking about OOTP/HBP, and Percy's choice to side with the Ministry after the return of Voldemort... something about him abandoning his family and then realizing he was wrong hits me in the gut. That must have been a brutal realization. Again, he did what he thought was right... he just put his faith in the wrong place.

Another surprisingly unpopular character... Remus Lupin! When I started reading HP fanfic, I was heavy into the Marauder Era. I think a lot of my love for him comes from my headcanon/fanon of his time at Hogwarts: I imagine him being very insecure about his placement at Hogwarts, and somewhat high-strung because of that, but also funny, clever, gentle... I don't think Remus made great choices during the series, but being non-human in the Wizarding world would be incredibly mentally draining, and I think the public's beliefs around werewolves really screwed with his head and his self-worth, especially, you know, after all of his friends died :/

Speaking of the Marauder Era... I want fics to include Peter Pettigrew as well. I have a lot of sympathy for him, especially as a child and his choice to betray the Potters to Voldemort. He was an average person who was friends with some exceptional people. Not particularly smart or brave, and /very/ motivated by fear... life-and-death choices bring out the best and the worst in people, and Peter just couldn't measure up. If I was up against Voldemort, I don't know what I would have done.

And then to name two obvious characters, Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley :') Dumbledore is a phenomenal character that highlights JK Rowling's strength as a writer - a brave, strong, flawed man who did what he thought was best, with mixed results. And Ron Weasley... this sub is pretty good about recognizing the differences between canon/HP movies/fanon, but there's still very few decent Ron fics out there. Ron was a /very/ good friend: caring, supportive, light-hearted, and shockingly willing to risk his life for Harry. He had his flaws, but did a good job working around them, especially with his jealousy. I think JK Rowling really screwed him towards the end of the series... he never got the chance to shine in the way that he could have.

And to top off this already overly long list, why are there no stories about Charlie Weasley?!?! Just because we "barely see him," SMH, that doesn't stop people from writing a million stories about Daphne Greengrass... Charlie and Hagrid would be an iconic duo, and yet I've never read any stories featuring the two of them, or even any oneshots where they hang out and ramble about dragons... where are all the Charlie stories?

Some of her greatest strengths are also her most egregious weaknesses. Unfortunately, this dichotomy gets washed over because people want to see themselves as the “smartest of the age.”

This whitewashing then leads to people hating the character because they're pelted over the face with people ignoring the incredible depth that was written into her. She's a good hearted person, but she's also flippantly cruel when she believes she's right. She's an advocate for the dismissed and the downtrodden...who approaches everything from the perspective that someone of her station would: she knows better than you, if you'll just let her help. She believes that authority should be listened to...but only if it's working for the good of the people, at which point she will rebel to extraordinary lengths.

****** She has some growth in later books. For instance, in PoA her character growth comes from realizing that she can't, indeed, do everything. There's a lot of focus (as a secondary plot) on her overworking herself to do /all/ the classes, on her fear of failing, etc - until she realizes and accepts that that'll be the case (resulting in ditching multiple classes, and at least /some/ self reflection in other areas). Book 4 we can see some of her growing understanding of relationships/others - she showcases a good amount of social perceptiveness that goes right under Harry and Ron's eyes in some scenes. In addition there's the whole SPEW arc, which although I have a lot of problems with /is/ character growth.

In later books we see her starting to be more comfortable as a leadership figure, romance, and further realization of more than just book smarts being important.

I think it's fairly wrong to say she's not getting character growth, as just like Ron and Harry she does change a good bit as a character from early on to the end. Sure, Hermione's most /visible/ growth happens in book 1, but that's by design - we could say the same about Harry, as his evolution with having friends and people who know /him/ and don't see him as a freak seems pretty sizable to me as well. That doesn't mean he doesn't have any growth after book 1.

*** That's the one I was looking for in this thread, and here it is all the way at the bottom! Snape does some nasty things and that is not something I have forgotten, but he's also done a lot of genuinely good things besides spying on Vldemort and his role in the war. One quick example which I think is often overlooked in this community is how quickly he springs to the aid of students in danger.

In the climax of PoA, for example, he enters into the site of his worst childhood trauma to save three kids (who he /doesn't even like/) from Sirius Black, the very man who tried to kill him there when he was a teenager, and Remus Lupin, a werewolf on a full moon. In HBP, he of course saves Katie Bell's life. In the same book, there's also the Sectum Sempra scene, wherein he hears a ghost crying that there's been a murder, and sprints into the scene without any idea of who is involved or what's going on. In Deathly Hallows, if I'm remembering right, he assigns Neville et al. detentions with Hagrid in order to save them from being tortured by the Carrows. The whole reason he stays on to be headmaster at all, in fact, enduring the hatred of his colleagues, is to do his best to protect the students. And so forth. He may not be a great instructor or a master of pedagogy, but Snape cares deeply about saving the lives and protecting the health of his students, possibly to a greater demonstrated degree than any other character (including Dumbledore and McGonagall). And that's just admirable.

I know that, like Ron and Dumbledore and a few other characters mentioned in this thread, Snape actually /is/ liked by the fandom at large, but he is not within this community, so I feel like it's relevant!

As a person, Snape is utterly disgusting with few redeeming qualities. The examples that you give don't show him as a good person or him doing good things. They show him being a teacher. Those are things that he HAS to do, there is nothing "good" or "altruistic" about it. Him not letting Katie die can not be counted as a brownie point. And while that (probably) wasn't the case, him running when Myrtle scream could have been simply because he wanted to push someone. Not to mention, it's quite likely that he didn't take het seriously. And since the victim was Malfoy, saving him can be discounted.

Yes, he did to some degree protect the students while he was headmaster, but that doesn't have to be a good deed. It could very well have been in preparation of having to live in the wizarding world after Voldemort's death. Mo

But she's tamer about it than Malfoy (No "Enemies of the Heir, beware!", she seemed genuinely sympathetic to Malfoy after Buckbeak hurts him and thus righteously angry at Hagrid, and so on and so forth), but she never physically harmed a fly, she was not a Death Eater, and yet she winds up alone and unredeemed?

Her advocating selling Harry out even makes sense. One life in exchange for not fucking over the entire resistance? Even if she was on the side of good, I'd have appreciated /someone/ making that call. The fact that there are probably friends of hers on both sides of the fight only makes it more poignant. Oh, and what does Harry eventually wind up doing anyway? Exactly.

** Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson.

Unpopular opinion, furshur, but I'm a big believer in Martin Luther King's message of forgiveness. Can we all please remember that these two characters (like most others TBH) were only pre-teens when the story started? They were literally raised in an atmosphere of bigotry, hate and superiority-complex-inducing parentage. Honestly, the very fact that they managed to see sense and do what was right at the end (not true for Pansy, I know but I like her more for her fanon! representation) is admirable to me.

To this very day, I am somewhat disappointed that we haven't seen an official redemption arc for these two characters.

Talking exclusively about Pansy now, I really love how she is portrayed in the fanon! and especially when it's the Dramione shippers that are doing the writing. Also, since we're doing unpopular opinions anyway; Harry should've ended up with Pansy. Don't care how or why, I just root for that ship.

Thank you for your patience with my babbling. <3

Draco is also a character that aides in exploring world-building/events that canon didn't cover: the inner-workings of pureblood culture, what Voldemort was doing the summers before 6th and 7th year and the entire 7th year while Harry and co were camping, exploring real love and family in "evil” characters (like Lucius and Narcissa). Plus post-books, what punishment and consequences does Draco get? How does he survive in a wizarding world that hates him for good reason? How does he seek/find redemption?
