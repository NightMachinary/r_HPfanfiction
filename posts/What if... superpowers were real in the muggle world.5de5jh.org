Not exactly much of a stretch. If the laws of nature can allow magic, then what's to say that science cannot get cosmic or dr strangey?

Imagine metas starting to pop up in the muggle world. Not just that, what about the exponential growth of technology? Superstrong, immortal, hyper-intelligent muggles!

What kind of a world would that be? I think if things like that started to happen, then the wizarding world will slowly introduce itself to the muggle world cus I don't see the wisdom of staying hidden forever especially when those damn muggles are getting more and more advanced.

I just got a splendid fanfic idea (request). There are some superpowered muggles due to heightened tech. But humanity have basically created a godlike AI but it's basically SkyNet. The wizards have to bad with these metas and muggles to now fight against the machines!

Damn, I'd pay to watch that crap!

EDIT: I think a pretty good series could come out of this. More mature and very techno-magical. It would focus on the wizarding world where a big discussion is being had about what the wizarding world should do, peacefully integrate with the now more powerful muggles or confront them with force. Like the Cursed Child, Harry and Hermoine are in the Ministry of Magic. Harry's an inspector or Auror there. Hermoine is a politician of a sort trying to get people to study the muggles so that they can peacefully coexist with them. But the official position from the government is that the discussion is not necessary; that things will remain the same. But ofcourse, that isn't the case in reality because sections of the muggle world are now capable of studying metaphysics and cosmic powers. "Superheroes" start to emerge as well as individuals who are more or less super-terrorists. Basically, the muggles themselves are having various discussions on how to move forward.

The politics outside the ministry is basically split between those who see the muggles as "usurping" the wizarding world's unique state or as dangers to their societies. Grindelwald and Voldemort are suddenly becoming icons to extremist sects.

I have a pretty good plot in my head with this. I wanna centre the story around the next gen of Potters and also some of these new metas of the muggle world. But I'm kinda scared a story like this will be hated by fanfic enthusiasts. I've never really been involved with fanfics before. I love HP but I'm not a Potterhead, that's a worry to me as well.


** If you had posted this a few months later I would have been able to recommend you my own fic. I have a plotline planned about how there is a group of wizards who believe in Muggle equality to a frantic degree and go around giving muggles powers by use of permanent spells and artefacts to prepare them for what they believe to be the Unification of Muggle and Wizarding worlds. But as of right now, I haven't gotten along to writing that part, so I can't.

Hopefully you'll find the sort of thing you are looking for now. Good luck.

*** I have a crazy idea of my own. Where the humans rapid progress makes them suddenly godlike. I wrote a mini plot where the UK gov't decide to start a meta arms race and Albus Potter is one of the metas.

Tolkein - DC/Mutants - Potter crossover verse basically.

** You gotta look for some Marvel/HP crossovers. A lot of those have him grow up with Thor or Iron Man, and somewhere I have a fic in which he learns from the Sorcerer Supreme.

They implement a bunch of theories as to why magic exists. Some decent some less so.

*** More like X-men and DC esque reality in the Potterverse.

But not just that but also Singularity and Transhumanism. Wizards and Muggles are basically the same, humans. But with a Transhumanist or Posthumanist world, we'll suddenly get superior beings who have evolved out of humanity.

It would cause problems for the wizards 1) A schism in the discussion of whether it'll just be a matter of time for the muggles or.. super-muggles to discover the existence of the Wizrds 2) A schism within the group that say "yup, we'll be discovered" with one group saying that Grindelweld and Voldermort were right all along and should fight against the Muggles. Strike first Policy. And the other wishing to integrate peacefully. The Progressive Policy.

This could be a pretty interesting story. Better than the "cursed child" storyline. Set in teh future
