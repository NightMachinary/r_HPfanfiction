So Quidditch games can theoretically last for days, but this has never been explored in any of the fics I've read. The closest I've seen was the player intentionally not catching the snitch to run up their house points total, but are there any fics where the players are actually trying to win but the snitch decides to take a vactaion in Siberia? I kind of want to read about the fallout of a Hogwarts match lasting a week or more.

Now, I know in this scenario, the most likely solution would be to call the game after so many hours or temporarily halt the match and return the next weekend, but this is Harry Potter Fanfiction, and I'm not in a logical mood.

Give me the teams playing for hours on, scrambling to find backups while the main team goes to class, give me the random second year that sneaks onto the field at 3 in the morning while the match is still technically live and scores an absurd amount of goals for one team, give me the hype around the starters taking back over every night, only for the backups to catch the snitch 2 and a half weeks in.

Basically, is there any fic which embraces a month long Quidditch game at Hogwarts?'

Edit: Formating


** I've seen it at least a couple of times. The game just goes on, they eat on their brooms, they get a break at night, they start recruiting extra team members, the twins make a killing by selling potions for sore butts.

In one of the stories I saw this the MC just went to the ongoing game to put up a sign that said something like ''add a fucking time limit''

*** I think that last one was from Methods of Racionality, where Harry pulls out a banner that said "Just buy a clock", or something like that. If I recall correctly, that's the match that goes on and on while a future version of himself is fighting Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. I think there was a time-turner involved.

** Doesn't it say in /Quidditch Through the Ages/ that the snitches schools use are different to one's used in pro play? That they have boundaries on where they can fly? Or am I thinking of something else?

*** It might, but I remember trying to read Quidditch through the Ages when I was a kid, and I barely got 5 pages into it. I bet most fanfic authors didn't read it as well. (I know this is a fallacy but shut up)

Even if I'm wrong though, as I said, this is the land of Fanfiction, where authors make the rules, and I want to read a story where the rules are stupid and the story embraces them.

**** Yeah. Qtta wasn't the most engaging book. I'm just saying it might be a reason there aren't many stories like this

** In linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) , Harrymort says he once paid the Slytherin and Ravenclaw seekers to sit down while their chasers racked up points.

** What if two schools wanted to make their points go up and beat other schools so they let the game go on earning a lot of points so they could be leagues above the two other houses.

*** As I stated in the blurb above (I could probably format better), I've already read that a few times, most notably in methods of rationality. I am more looking for a fic where the players aren't trying to make the game go on as long as possible, but it still does.
