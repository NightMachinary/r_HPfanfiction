He finds Voldemort stood behind what appears to be a Muggle Hairdressers Chair, with a plumbed-in sink? "Are you ready to Dye, Potter?" Asked Voldemort.

"Go for it, kill me" Harry replied, determined.

"No you foolish boy, I said dye, not die. That black hair really doesn't suit you, you should go for a lighter tone, maybe a dark brown to start, and have you seen how much of a mess it is?" Voldemort sighed, exasperated.

It turns out destroying the Horcruxes jolted Voldemort's soul, and made him remember his real dream, to be the first true Wizarding Hairdresser. Dark Lord was just a phase that kind of stuck because the Horcruxes made him crazy.


** It was such a heartbreak for him when he realized, much too late, that the Horcruxes were turning him bald.

*** "Dumbledore didn't even have a long beard before I began my quest for power," Voldemort said in a low hiss. "He knew what my ambition was, and when he saw what I had become, he grew it purely to taunt me."

"My hair never does grow," Harry pointed out. "In fact, if it's cut, it just grows back."

There was a pause, a silence.

"You really are my nemesis," Voldemort realised aloud.

***** Voldemort just wanted to ask Lily how she had kept her hair so smooth, silky and vibrant! It was disappointing that all that work to try and find her place of residence so he could question her went down the drain when he went berserk at the sight of James Potter's hair and ended up killing them both.

Severus had always wanted to join the Dark Lord, because he was possibly the /only/ one who knew a way to get the damn grease out of his hair, too bad he had died before he could cash in on the appointment he was owed after reporting the prophecy to him.

Voldemort has repeatedly tried to recruit the elderly Potters so he could get the secret recipe for Sleakeazy's hair potion, something that would speed up his work immensely (for all that their son was an idiot for never using it)!

Pettigrew returned to his master as his fears were becoming reality, he was slowly going bald! He could only hope that the Dark Lord knew what to do to help him.

Bartemius Jr joined the dark lord because his father wasn't taking care of his hair at /all/, he didn't even comb it, just put a hat on and never took it off, and it was driving the boy insane!

False. Barty Jr joined him because of his father's insistence that he grow a toothbrush mustache like his old man. How gauche.

**** but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must dye at the hand of the other

Harry is not really Voldemort's nemesis but his perfect match.

For Harry can have his hair styled in any way to help realize Tom Riddle's dream of being a stylist, and it will just change back the next day.

And Voldemort simply needs to dye Harry's hair to fulfill the prophecy.

*** Lucius, instead of going Muggle Baiting, went to Muggle Salons. He hated that there wasn't a Wizarding version, but it was a price to pay to look that good, and he always hoped that Voldemort would follow his original dream again one day, Lucius never believed in the World Domination gig, he just went along with it because the Horcruxes made Voldemort dangerous to his own side too, he just wanted to truly be Luscious Malfoy.
