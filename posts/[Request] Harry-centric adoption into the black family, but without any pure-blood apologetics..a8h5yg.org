I tried reading Linkffn(The Black Heir by Firephoenix8; A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story) and I can't stomach the way the writers try to justify pure-blood bigotry as a rational and justifiable world view. Then have Harry and/or Sirius embrace it.

I'm just not into it.

I've also read stuff like Linkffn(Innocent By: MarauderLover; The Reclamation of Black Magic By: ShayaLonnie) but they both suffer from Harry being shunted to the side in favour of adult characters, which contradicts the 'children saving the world because adults are incompetent' theme that runs through cannon and that I personally enjoy.

So if anyone knows any Harry-centric Black Family Drama fics that spends most of their word count at Hogwarts I would be very grateful.

  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely. Despite a name and gender change, Harry Potter wasn't someone who would let their family suffer for no reason. Lyra was a Black, and Blacks protect their own.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

** I don't think my story focuses on Black Family, just Sirius himself. I take a route that implies a very canon tone to my story exploring if Sirius didn't die in Book 5 but went on to become freed instead. So not much Hogwarts, but atleast there's no pure-blood apologism.

Harry and Sirius' relationship has the power for a lot of exploration as they already have an instant connection of trust and familiarity with each other and its a shame we couldn't see that in canon because of his untimely death. Linkffn(12866177)

** Another gender flip plus time/ dimension travel is Flipped by Katropis9 involves Fem Harry waking up in the body of a powerful Black heiress and shows her going to school with younger Tom Riddle and guiding him through political intricacies and changing things from within Slytherin. It does become a Tom x Fem Harry pairing and it's mostly a convincing one. It's a WIP and some elements of the story (though they come into play much later) put me off a little, but it's really well written and I'd say it's worth a read, it mostly fits what you're looking for!

** My own "No Longer Alone" fits this. Pettigrew is kissed during the confrontation, Sirius cannot prove his innocence and ask Andromeda to take his godson.

Andromeda gets the Black Lordship and uses it to blackmail Fudge into improving the conditions for Bellatrix. She overall feels sympathetic for her sister because they were very close before Bellatrix joined the DE with the goal of protecting her sisters. And while her crimes are her own, Andi blames the Lestranges for breaking her sister and turning her into a monster.

Overall it has more competent adults, but they are still unable to keep Harry out of the tournament. He gets help preparing for the tasks but has to complete them on his own.

It starts out with Harry fed up with Ron and Hermione for the constant fights about their pets but they patch things up at the start of the 4th year. Due to the fights he also spends his free time with Katie Bell and Leanne instead.

**** I did my best to avoid bashing of anyone but Madam Pomfrey (although even that is entirely based on the fact that she did not notice the Dursley abuse). The (second) falling out with Ron is just that. No insults, no shouting matches, simply not a lot of interactions either way. I think it is fairly accurate to canon (so no badmouthing, turncoat Ron, secret Death Eater membership or anything)

Neville hates Harry for his association with and adoration of Andromeda, who is very public in her support of Bellatrix (and contempt for the Lestranges).

Andromeda has a low opinion of all Weasleys due to something that happened between Nymphadora and Charlie, even if her daughter is long over that incident.

McGonagall is her canon self.

Dumbledore is disliked (but not hated) by Harry and the Tonks, but they can't really pin something to him so it is more of a vague suspicion and very far from anything you might see in an IndyHarry fic.

****** Bellatrix does not make on-screen appearances.

That being said, Andromeda goes to visit her in Azkaban, so she is under Dementor influence. Bella is her canon self, but with cracks due to the exposure. Andromeda blackmails the Minister into getting her better accommodations at Azkaban (dry, with a working heater and shower, away from the dementors), which makes Andi Bella's saviour (as opposed to canon where Voldemort rescued her). It's not sunshine and roses, but Andromeda feels that she has to take care of her sister either way.

Then again, Andi is rather pragmatic and does not particularly care about the Longbottoms since she had nothing to do with them. As long as Bella didn't harm friends or family, she can easily turn a blind eye.
