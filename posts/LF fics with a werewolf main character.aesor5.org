It seems like a popular enough trope, but I've never read any good ones. I would appreciate some recs where it's maybe Snape after the Shrieking Shack incident isn't stopped in time by James, or one of the trio gets bitten by Greyback during the hunt .

The fics I've seen that focus on werewolves are often about packs or bonding or some Twilight-like shit, which doesn't interest me. Instead, i would love to see something exploring the magical underclass / living with stigma.

Thank you!


** I remember Linkffn(Weres Harry). He gets bitten at a young age, and his head-roommate clashes with the curse of lycanthropy, giving Harry a sort of anthro-werewolf, pseudo-animagus form (I think of Movie!Lupin for this, and assume normal werewolves just turn into wolves) Shame it stopped right at chapter 23.

It took me a moment to realize you meant the horcrux. Hilarious phrasing.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** I recently read linkffn(12855468), where Harry is a werewolf raised by Remus. It was generally enjoyable, though it moves a bit slowly and is still in progress. It has a little bit of the packs stuff, but also quite a lot about living with this stigma.

  Summer of 1993, Professor McGonagall visits a small American town hunting the one man who might be able to help capture the escaped convict Sirius Black, and more importantly fill in as the DADA professor. There she meets a boy that disappeared eight years ago sparking a massive if fruitless manhunt for the missing Boy-Who-Lived. Werewolf!Harry with DAD!Remus

**** Is on-going and the child is merely as interesting as Harry was in the first book... Oh, I remember! They had a daughter who is an obscurial and she developed double personality with the obscurus. I am just waiting for the next update. I got passed the whole "child" thing after chapter 3--

** In this fic Harry is bit by Greyback during the full moon in PoA ! it's a little ways in (the fic is very long) and isn't the only focus of the fic, but how he deals with being a werewolf is a large focus and it's done in a way I really enjoyed. linkao3(3089927)

  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his bio dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. See more notes inside.

** Linkao3(2378855)

Harry is the MoD and fights for werewolf rights in his second life. There is a sequel where it is his third life too, he has siblings in that one.

Dunno if HP/LV is up your alley though.

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.
