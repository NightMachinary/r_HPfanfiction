I love a good fic with an emphasis on digging into magic and exploring ideas and concepts. So I'd love to find some new fics largely featuring that.

Doesn't have to be from Harry's perspective (I'd prefer a Hermione centered fic, but anything is good!), and generally any ship is okay as long as its well written.

Thanks!

The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring and dry but it picks up to be something of an epic later on. It goes really deep within the lore of magic. Very detailed and very well written. (I mean very, very detailed and intricate that it is like reading a textbook in the beginning.) Harry centric in the first chapter than Regulus Black centric. linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

** You've probably already read these, but I recall The Arithmancer (Hermione) and The Pureblood Pretense (AU & Fem!Harry) as being pretty well into interesting magic systems. [I haven't read either in years, though, so my recollections may be incorrect.]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]] - Focused a lot on spellcrafting

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]] - Lots of potions-y stuff, iirc.

** - The story has its flaws (and its many haters), but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has a very unique take on the history and nature of magic, especially powerful magic. Also creative variations on the nature of Dementors and Phoenixes. And let's not forget the excellent worldbuilding of how Horcruxes work in that universe. Bear in mind: you must forget all but the very basics of how magic seems to work in canon. This doesn't /try/ to fit canon, it's a self-declared AU.

- linkffn(Core Threads), for something a little more "fun", also has an interesting non-canon take on magic. It's the only fic I know to feature magical cores in a notable capacity, and an OP!Harry to go with it, that is still tremendously fun to read with barely any "flaws" besides having no conflict whatsoever past Chapter 1 (which is more of an advertised feature). Keep an eye out for Hedwig the Dark Lady.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** For something that doesn't get recced so much around here: The Spellmaker by SonnyGietzel linkao3(689909)

It's abandoned and, despite the tag, isn't actually slash (due to being abandoned), if that's a concern for you. It's a 'Harry explores wandless magic before Hogwarts' fic.
