** Erm, my work is going in that direction? Twice? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049643][Linkity link]] because I can't make those fancy bot-supported links work :S

Edit: Whoops, it's a sequel, so you may wanna read the first fic, Flowers in Bloom, for context!

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl who walked on water; The Sum of their parts) both have Harry/Ron/Hermione trio relationships, both are post-war and the three went through some real horrors together and can't sleep without each other or they'll get nightmares. In both cases the relationship is somewhat in the background.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
