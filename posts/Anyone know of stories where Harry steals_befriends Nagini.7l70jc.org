I'm in a rare mood, so I'm looking for stories where Harry either A) Steals Nagini from Voldemort and they form a bond, or B) Nagini finds Harry on his own and befriends him. Het/Slash/Gen, don't care. What do you guys have?


** In Seventh Horcrux - linkffn(10677106) Harry steals Nagini.

*** Doesn't really count. It's just another Voldemort, isn't it? Not truly Harry.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
