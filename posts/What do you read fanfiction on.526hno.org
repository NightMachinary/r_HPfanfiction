I have so many tabs open its getting hard to go through important things. If you have things other than a computer you can keep fanfiction on, tell me! Please!


** Get Calibre. It's a free app that you can use to organise e-books for your kindle. It works on PC and Mac. You simply download the fic (any format), and drag and drop it into Calibre. Then you right click it and convert it to the format you need. Kindle needs mobi. If you downloaded the mobi, skip this step.

Then, plug in the kindle. Let Calibre recognise it. Then, choose the e-books you want to add to the kindle, and right click. Click "send to device". Done.

Calibre is like iTunes for the kindle.

****** Oh nooo. Wait, do you have a kindle fire? If so, make sure that the books you put into the kindle are on MOBI format, and only MOBI format. Else, it won't read natively.

** Kindle - download direct from the mobi links linkffn bot makes or use FicSave, then either email to Kindle or just save straight to the device if I have it with me.

For works in progress, I usually get the notification email on my phone and read the new chapter immediately on it.

****** I only read on my kindle. I use a program called FanFiction Downloader to download fics off of fanfiction.net as a mobi (there is also a website called FicSave that works pretty well). Then I just plug my kindle in to my computer and copy the mobi to the kindle. Hope that helps :)

******* To add to this, on some of my favorite fics that are either very long, completed or just really good, I use fanfiction downloader to get an html file of it, edit out all of the Reviewer replies, author notes, and spelling mistakes if I am feeling ambitious that night, change some of the formatting and add links to the start of the chapter to go back to the start of the chapter list so you can go to any chapter you want without have to search, and then use calibre to convert it back into a .mobi file and plug it to my kindle.

Since I found this subreddit last week, I've been downloading sooo much fanfiction on my kindle. The fanfiction bot has a download .mobi link under each story so you can just click to download, open your gmail, send the .mobi fic as an attachment to your kindle email. You can attach a bunch of fics in each email!
