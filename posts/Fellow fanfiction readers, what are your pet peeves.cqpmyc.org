For me one of them is the way some people write letters. For example if it's a letter from James and Lily to Harry, it might have conversations between the two while writing it. It feels more like a telephone conversation to me rather than a letter. One could argue that they were using a spell to dictate it, but I haven't seen anyone bringing it up and even if it was a spell why does it alternate between each person's handwriting??


** Outside of all the Harry gets a million titles and a billion gallleons with it, probably my most hated problem with fics are giving a 12 year old shut-in British child from the 1980s who's just now experiencing the world for the first time the brains, vocabulary, and mannerisms of a 40 year old genius master level war strategist Victorian prince.

It takes me clear out of the story when I'm rolling my eyes every time Harry is kissing someone's knuckles or bowing when he's never been taught to. Or he's monologuing how he's put one past ole tommy boy moldywarts or dumb as a door.

*** I don't mind it as long as Harry gets some exposure to it via actual experience or movies or books in his childhood. Even then I'd rather have his personality be tinged with small insecurities or something rather than be completely confident in his abilities .

** Another pet peeve thread?

On the serious side, my pet peeves are:

1. Canon rehash in AU fics, especially in time travels

2. Voldemort and Death Eater apologies

3. Potter and Weasley bashing, especially those WBWL fics

4. Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin... fics with ridiculous power progressions and harems, and fuck fuck Hadrian

5. Ridiculous characterizations like idiot!Ron, IceQueen!Daphne, LovePotion!Ginny, LeatherPants!Draco, and SexGod!Snape

*** I don't mind canon rehashes in AU fics as long as the author has figured out an interesting way to spin it. Like there's an AU fic, and it's all from Professor McGonagall's perspective and she only sees the things that don't stick so closely to canon that it's boring.

*** I really don't understand why people write time travel stories if they are going to let everything happen again with minor changes.

I don't get the hate for Ron tbh, he's a normal guy with tons of insecurities. There are more reasons to hate Hermione than Ron imo.

I don't mind a character being OP, but I wish people would put more effort into the progression. Like rituals that the main character researches instead of going to the Goblins and getting it done or finding a book with rituals so easy that a 11 year old kid could do it. The goblin rituals , huge powerboost from magical maturity and all those things feels like lazy writing.

** It drives me pretty crazy when the characters are obviously mouthpieces for the author's feelings to the detriment of characterization and established character relationships.

Yeah, Dumbledore did some questionable things, but the characters all still respected him even if they had complicated feelings about his actions and they'd never refer to him as 'Dumb as a Door' or 'the old coot'. Yeah, the Order of the Phoenix was loyal to Dumbledore possibly to a fault and made mistakes, but none of our 'heroic' characters would call them 'the Order of the Fried Chicken'. Harry would never rhapsodize about how Ron is just as bad as Draco, the Weasley children would never shittalk their mother, etc. etc. etc. etc. It's okay for the story to confront bad things characters did in canon, but keep the characters reactions consistent with who they are.

** This is a bit more general than just Harry Potter but applies here too.

Whenever someone is pregnant, there's bound to be problems with the pregnancy. There'll be an accident (falling off the stairs seems like a used example) and then there's fear of miscarriage. If the pregnancy continues, it's very unlikely to carry on the full term. The birth is difficult and there's rarely only one child.

**** I suppose that's where it comes from and then writers think that's the way a character pregnancy has to be dealt with like it wouldn't be interesting enough without the drama.

I don't encounter fics with pregnancy all the time but when I do, I tend to get a bit annoyed or sometimes, I soundlessly congratulate the writer for exceeding my expectations.

*** All indy!Harry fics:

#+begin_quote
  Harry went shopping in muggle London and bought 5 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of new sneakers, and some t-shirts that fit him. He then wrote Hermione and told her that the Weasels were evil and fumbledork was manipulating him. He decided to start exercising so he went for a run every morning, about 5 blocks one way and another 5 back. When he got back he went to the restroom before having a donut for breakfast.

** I have a few, which is odd, considering I've read just a few fics:

use of movie canon or characters from Hogwarts mystery game in fics;

tactlessness shown as some sort of charming character trait, particularly in Tonks case. This is why I ended up hating her;

pre full moon symptoms that are related to sexual drive or anger;

noticible americanisms, like vacation or fall. It's lazy not to correct these, even if fanfic is just a hobby.

â€‹

mixing up canon details that were repeated many times,like Dumbledore wearing horn-rimmed glasses. Has he stollen them from Percy?;

Long discussions of 'do you like him' or 'you should date him'. They aren't annoying usually, but they can be if they sound like something from a particularly stupid romantic comedy;

emphasising how cool it is that a woman doesn't cry.Crying is not a sin.

** Bashing doesn't ruin a fic for me, but I never like it when it's present. Bashing is never a good thing, with the possible exception of crack fics.

Then there's tropes that will probably make me stop reading a fic completely: mpreg, romantic soulbonds, fics with an imminent bad ending in the form of heartbreak (which has caused me to spoil endings to fics if I suspect this is going to happen). I never liked mpreg, ever. I've read fics with romantic soulbonds (hell, I even thought Debt of Time was a decent fic at the time I read it), but they've never improved a story IMO (not even in that fic -- I just found it offputting), so I no longer read fics which has them. I've never been able to deal with fics where the protagonist experiences heartbreak well unless I know things get better. If I suspect this with how things are going, or am reading a fic with a trope/pairing especially prone to this, I have a habit of spoiling the ending and, if it has this, run away from it.

These aren't the /only/ things that make me stop read fics, but they're the most usual ones present in my personal little corner of fanfic preferences. For example, I stay away from the Indy!Harry trope or the Tomarry ship, but I also happen to not really read Harry-centric fics much in general, so it wasn't worth a mention.
