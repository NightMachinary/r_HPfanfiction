Harry is fated to kill and be killed by a dark lord. Unfortunately after the death of Voldemort, the yearly "dark lord tries to kill Harry" didn't stop. Until Harry permanently dies under the hand of a dark Lord, Harry will attract the attention of the nearest dark Lord and will try to kill him.

Years passed, Harry is so done with it. The 'Dark lords' that attacks him seems like they were scraped from the bottom of the barrel. No one bats an eye anymore when the yearly Potter assassination attempt occurs.

Grandpa Potter looks at the latest rainbow vomit dark idiot from his rocking chair, contemplating how embarrassing it will be if he gets killed by this guy vs wishing to pass on to his next adventure.


** It was Halloween and James Sirius was adorable dressed up as a Dark Lord. Getting into character, he thrust his trick wand at daddy and shouted, "I got you!"

Clutching his chest and staggering to the ground, Harry gasped for breath, "Oh no, you got me. I'm... dead." And he collapsed limply to the floor.

Moments later Ginny, holding an infant Lily, nudged Harry, "Don't think death is going to get you out of trick or treating. Up!"

** Harry batted away a series of sickly yellow curses. With his bare hand.

"Pathetic," he spat. "How are you even a dark lord?" he asked the wizard. "Don't use that title. Honestly, I'm embarrassed /for/ you. You shame all muggleborns by calling yourself a dark lord while being so weak."

"I'm /trying/, Uncle Harry," said Malcom Dursley, firing another volley of curses at Harry, all deflected. By hand. Again. "You're not making this easy for me."

"Back in my day, your grandfather didn't even need magic to beat me up. He's probably rolling in his grave right now. Look," Harry looked through the wreckage of his drawing room, pulled up his trunk and produced a wand.

"See this, Malcom? This is the Deathstick. It's the most powerful wand in history. This is the wand that killed Voldemort. This is the wand wielded by Dumbledore, Voldemort, /and/ Grindlewald, three of the most powerful wizards of the 20th century," Harry tossed it to Malcom. "Do your bloody job. The incantation is 'Avada Kedavra.' I'm going to turn around and walk for ten paces, and if I'm not dead by then I'm going to be very upset. Don't disappoint me."

Malcom Dursley glared at Harry, but gave him a nod. Harry relaxed, turned around and proceeded to walk ten paces. At the tenth step he heard Malcom yell the curse and smiled, looking forward to seeing Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, his parents, Fred, and everybody else he had lost over the years. This was it. He was ready.

Then he saw the curse sail right past his head.

"You've got to be joking! I'm right here, Malcom!" Enraged, he turned around to Malcom, who was continuously firing off killing curses, but with a hand shaking so hard that they all, somehow, missed.

"/Expelliarmus/!" Harry shook his head as he held the Elder Wand once again. "Okay, Dursley, here's what were going to do. /Accio Dark Arts books/!" A small pile of books landed neatly in front of him. "Don't worry, we'll make a proper dark lord out of you yet. See these books? You're to read all of them by the end of the year."

Malcom looked at the pile, intimidated by the sheer volume of pages. "All of them?"

Harry placed his head in his hands with an exasperated sigh. At this rate, he was going to live forever.

** Just a thought: what if, after waiting for so long and all his loved ones have passed away, Harry becomes a Dark Lord himself and commits suicide?

**** Well, anakin was also "the chosen one", cursed by a prophecy as well. (he was meant to bring balance to the force. He did it in the end. With both jedi and sith gone the force is not pulled to one side or another. Until they decided that we need more star wars.) what Anakin did is the reverse of what Darth Revan did. Revan was also "cursed" to bring balance to the force.

Personally I think it's more likely that Harry will turn into a 'light lord' than go Dark lord at that point. One whose loved one killed by the dark, his constant fight with dark lords will cause him to lose faith and decide to cleanse the world of dark. Thinking his purpose is to remove the dark therefore he can only rest if he removes all of it.

Like a crusade or Spanish inquisition, he starts purifying the wizardry world by removing the dark taint. Thus one dark arts user, dark creature or someone from a dark family rise up and lead a rebellion to stop the persecution of the dark of Harry's dystopia. Harry gets killed, an era of balance occurs.

** It seems like at first there would be plenty of aspiring Dark Lords in Europe, getting more and more pathetic until they all get defeated. Eventually everyone in Britain or Europe would stop aspiring to that title and Harry would get more dangerous ones from far away.
