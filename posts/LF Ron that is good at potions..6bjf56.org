I recently finished reading linkao3(No Way Back by Meri) . It included a semi-motivated Ron who wanted to prove to Snape that he could be good at potions. I've never come across a story that had Ron focused on one subject, but now I'm interested to see what's out there.

They can be Ron-centric or not. No preference for pairings or length either.


** In Canon, Ron got an E in his Potion OWL.

** Ron got an Exceeds Expectations on his Potions OWL and he didn't study (at least to the extent of other student). He was only one of twelve to go on to NEWT level potions, which meant he was quite proficient in the subject. While not as studious in contrast to Ms. Granger, Ron was always an above-average, exceptional student.

Except in History of Magic. Fuck all that noise.

Aside from Transfiguration, Charms, DADA and Divination, I guess yea?

**** Transfigurations, Herbology, Potions, Charms, DADA, Astronomy, and Care for Magical Creatures. He was innately good at Divination but wasn't good at the schoolwork. He got Exceeds Expectations in the first five, since he went on to NEWT level in all of them. He got an OWL in Astronomy and Care for Magical Creatures, but the grades are never revealed. He most likely got Exceeds Expectations, since Hagrid was angry about him not taking NEWT level Care for Magical Creatures.

****** He occasionally made accurate predictions, but the schoolwork was so ass backwards that he couldn't make heads or tails of it. I imagine this is why someone so imaginative like Lavender was good at it.

****** Snape only let you in NEWT-level Potions if you got an O, and only one student that we know of did. Hermione. Slughorn accepted E's. McGonagall told Neville he wouldn't make it in NEWT Transfiguration because he only got an A. Most classes, if not all, require at least an E because someone with a lower grade couldn't properly handle the coursework.

** Ron-bashing fic is so prevalent that I've started to avoid it at all cost and keep an eye out specifically for the opposite....and then I get distracted. Will definitely check out 'No Way Back'.\\
Also, this one might be of interest: Midnight by the Weasley Watch linkffn(Midnight by the Weasley Watch) is a chess centered piece somewhat centered around Ron and Snape as they represent Hogwarts at an international tournament.

*** Just a heads up, No Way Back is slash. Specifically, Harry/Snape and that's the biggest focus in the fic. There's still a lot of potential for Ron though, which is why I continued to read it. Midnight by the Weasley Watch sounds really interesting, thank you!

**** Yah, saw the tags. Was actually concerned for a bit, because the first couple of paragraphs read almost exactly like another old fic called "Mirror of Maybe". Everything up to Harry getting sucked could almost be word for word (...or close enough. It's been years since I've read it).

  COMPLETE. Ron Weasley makes up his schoolwork, and actually thinks for a change. Snape gets some Christmas presents he doesn't expect. The old game is over, but a new one is just beginning. Please read and review. And thanks to you all!

** There's a story out there by Chilord in which Ron and Harry are inspired to take a different perspective in looking at Potions independent of Snape and become prodigies at it. The fic's title is Sekrit Project(don't ask me why he chose that title).

It's not on any of the regular fanfiction repositories that I know of, but it is on [[http://s3.zetaboards.com/FanFictionFederation/index/]]
