I'm seeing similar posts so I hope this is ok. I'm looking for a story that was on fanfiction.net that I can't remember the title of. It starts in Harry's first year, I believe. Minerva notices something is off with Harry, gets Severus' opinion, going so far as to get him see Harry without the blinders of Harry's father. They take him to Poppy, find out all. This leads to Minerva and Severus plotting to insure Harry has a better home for the foreseeable future. They get the Heads to confront Albus, who is determined to more concerned with his plan. Filius disarms Albus, gaining the Elder Wand. Amelia Bones is also involved, who chooses Bathelda Bagshot (who is a force to be reckoned with) as Harry's new guardian. Help, this was a great fic, but I forgot the name and I can't find it!!!


** Okay. I went looking. Is it this?

Minerva realises what a terrible mistake leaving the Potter boy with the Dursley's was all those years ago. Will things change if she does something now? Minerva and Severus join forces. Rated T for safety.

**** It's not written poorly, which is the main reason people don't like first person- crappy oneshot fanfiction by 12 year olds.

There's a beauty to first person when written well. Certainly not my favorite thing to read all the time, but the change is nice sometimes.

I read a book once written entirely in present tense, and it was good because the writing was good (and s/he didn't slip into past tense).

Anyway, give it a chance (although if you don't believe in how much of a softie McGonagall can be, maybe you should skip it anyway).

***** I absolutely cannot do first person either, even if it's written well. I get way too frustrated with the characters decisions and end up ragequitting since they're not my decisions. Third person i can distance myself from.... not so much first.

** The first ever fic I read, and still one of my all time favourites, is

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3278149/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Guild-of-the-Night][Harry Potter and the Guild of the Night]] by Katling.

/Harry suffers a terrible injury at the Dursleys that leaves his ability to face Voldemort in doubt. But with the help of Remus Lupin and a mysterious new teacher he has a chance to become more than he was before./

It's fantastic. Go, read it. Seriously.
