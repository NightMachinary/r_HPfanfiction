[[/u/KidCoheed][u/KidCoheed]] and a few others who've posted about it in the past few days had me thinking about Lily Potter. We know so little about her, especially when compared to her husband. Thus a lot of people characterise her as some sort of saint who could do no wrong and died a martyr's death for her child (in fanon, often intentionally for the sake of her child).

Forget that, her lack of solid characterisation has made her perfect for this idea: Lily Potter now has/had a superiority complex and genuinely believed she was better than everyone else.

×××

Here's the timeline. Little Lily was an innocent, saintly child who had weird things happening around her. Her parents and sister found them strange (and a little scary) but showered her with love and she genuienely loved them in return. But everything changed when Severus Snape met Lily Evans and told her she was magic.

Imagine Lily thinking she was better than Muggles, not maliciously but she was magic, she could do things Muggles would never be able to. It was an empirical fact she was better. She'd have never jumped to march behind the likes of Grindelwald or harmed anyone because of this, but she did recognise that he wasn't technically wrong...

Thus why Petunia hated her. Her sweet little sister was gone when she left for Hogwarts, she came back and enthralled their mother and father with her tales but spoke to them all with such an air of arrogance and condescension that it made her skin crawl.

But it didn't just extend to the 'normal world', for she wasn't just a witch in a world of Muggles. She was a genius and gifted with all walks of magic, a prodigy that appeared only once a generation (if at all). And her professors never let her forget it...

So she not only believed herself above those without magic, she was in the top tier of those who did wield it. A witch above witches if you will, striving to be better as she studied, whilst also believing herself to already be one of the best.

By the time she came to her senses and was rudely awakened from her arrogant mindset, her relationship with her sister could not be salvaged, her parents had died and James Potter had changed and grown so much just to say he was worthy of her. Humbled and flattered, Lily latched onto the one person who genuienely saw her as the amazing woman she'd always thought herself to be.

Yes, very vain. But the love they held for one another was genuine at least, even if the dregs of Lily's believed superiority was what really drew her along to James.

×××

We're constantly told how clever Lily was, but only really get Snape's (incredibly biased) opinion on who she was as a person. So imagine Lily as a sort of insufferable reflection of Hermione, a girl/young woman who knew she was a genius and special from day one and let everybody know it in (mostly) backhanded ways. Have Lily be somewhat disliked and unlikeable, hence why she latched onto her friendship with cruel, Dark Wizard Severus Snape for so long (less because she was inherently a forgiving angel of a person and more because she had very few who could actually stand her).

Lily died a heroic death, a symbol of a pure mothers love and a showcase of what a parent will sacrifice for their child. But Lily doesn't need to have been so pure and angelic her entire lives (alternatively, as in kost WBWL stories, she doesn't have to be some hateful, evil crone).

Be a bit more imaginative, try something new.

EDIT:-

I wrote this because I really like the idea of Petunia having a genuine/tangible/relatable reason for hating Lily besides jealousy. I don't think Lily would bully her, but maybe she'd look down on her and subsequently make Petunia feel small/insignificant.

Maybe their parents really did prefer Lily and neglected Petunia, leading to Petunia's jealously and eventual hatred of what her precious baby sister had become because of magic.


** I always want to see Lily as Good at Potions and Herbology and all those classes that didn't require a wand, and was very good a Charms but Transfiguration and DADA were her weak points, just not very good at them. Outside of classes I want to see a Lily who's just Naive, she's friends with Snape because her friends wouldn't lie to her, her friends wouldn't hurt other people, it's everyone is mean and cruel to her friends and she must defend them even if her friend started it they obviously had a reason

** One of my favorite lines about Lily from the book is actually from Order of the Phoenix, during Snape's Worst Memory,

"Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, 'Let him down!'"

I think people who say Lily is a Saint, or that she's "too good for James", or think that she and Snape had a perfect friendship, have forgotten about that line. It's so very loaded in a completely unidentifiable way. The line says, 'Lily is not perfect' (since a 'perfect friend' wouldn't have found humor in her closest friends suffering, as well as that this was /before/ Snape called her a mudblood) but leaves it up to the viewer to interpret the exact imperfections she has. It's like Lily is a seemingly flawless gem, but this line is a single crack on the surface that hints at much deeper flaws, flaws that are rarely if ever explicitly shown.

The potential answers this line gives to the endless questions the books leaves us about Lily are fascinating imo.

For instance, one major trope I see in not-so-good fanfic is that James must have manipulated or potioned Lily into being with him, because why else would she so suddenly changed her feelings from loathing to love? Except, at this point of the story, she's not close at all with James, and yet she's finding his 'prank' amusing, and mostly seems to have an issue with the viciousness of it. It then stands to reason she probably finds some of his other pranks enjoyable too, but takes issue when they go too far. It's an easy jump from there that when James grew up a little and stopped being such a dick, that Lily probably found his humor and pranking an amusing quality, and became more interested in him.

** I really like the Lily in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13092314/1/The-Gates-of-Azkaban]]

In the story she's shown as realistically flawed in the sense that she's a well off 19 year old girl that hasn't really faced hardship. She's still a bit ignorant of the world, still a little disconnected from the harsh realities of war, even while being in a war. It's a fic that's very friendly to Snape but I honestly feel that the accusations against the Gryffindors are fair.

** I've always kinda wanted to write a Lily that sucks at school except at Potions and have James be the book-smart one in their relationship. She'd be like Harry, in that she's kinda lazy and only gets really involved in subjects that interest her? She ends up becoming head girl because she's involved in people's lives, the way Slughorn would approve of, not because she's a once-in-a-generation genius.

Or a fic where Lily is a loner and her parents always doted on her because they were her only friends other than Snape, leaving no time for Petunia. Snape liked having her all to himself. After she stops hanging out with Snape, she reverts to her loner ways and Mcgonagall appoints her as prefect because she's worried. When she and James start dating, their lifestyles are literally the exact opposite of each other and she desperately needs space. She's not really committed and breaks up with him several times until her parents die. She marries him then because life is short, but this socially active life hurrs her. Sacrificing herself for Harry is the first time she commits to anything in her life and values someone else above herself.

Or Lily's dark, so dark she enthralled everyone without realising it. Her parents, Snape, the professors, James, etc. Petunia is the only one resistant to it because she's so muggle magic doesn't work on her at all. Lily realises her abilities and that Snape, being outwardly dark, will only give her away, so she drops him as a friend the first chance she gets.

*** I love the first one, cause it fits my headcanon that Lily and Harry are identical personality-wise (to offset Harry being identical, physically, to James).

And the second one is my favourite because I feel like you could slot it into canon and it changes nothing. This could really be what Lily was like, she could have only had Snape before she dated James and started hanging out with the Marauders.

And I like the last one (for an AU where Lily WAS dark) but it seems to be implied that Lily gave him chance after chance and only dropped him when he crossed a line.

**** Does "her attempts to discourage him from dark arts was actually just her trying to tell him to be quieter about it" work instead?

Or maybe pretending to give him chances was something she used to establish her innocent persona?

*** This is pretty much canon. In the Snape bullying flashback, her response to being called a Mudblood was basically 'Watch your mouth Snivellus, maybe washing it out would do you some good', so when she's insulted she gives as good as she gets.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

While not part of my headcanon, I could definitely see this. Not consciously -- but subconsciously considering her own welfare more important than everyone else's. It's very much possible that she was favoured in her family at the expense of Petunia with her parents amazed over all the magical stuff giving her more focus, which would serve to explain the way Petunia turned out in the end.

The only thing that is an actual part of my headcanon of Lily flaw-wise is that she's naive. And that's a minor flaw at most (hell, some people consider this endearing). This conclusion was drawn based on her worldview with respect to Snape's memories -- mainly the view she has on the Marauders vs the Slytherins. Both of them did some horrible stuff, but Lily generally seems to put significantly more focus on the Slytherin actions. Not strictly because she's Muggleborn (although that's probably part of it) but because they practice Dark Magic. I have no interest in entering a Dark Magic argument, but suffice to say, you don't need it to hurt someone. This, combined with the fact that she doesn't seem to realize that Severus /can't/ openly defy his housemates, if he wants to sleep safely.

I'm not excusing his actions! He genuinely behaved despicably at times even before the friendship broke down -- the Mary incident comes to mind, and I highly doubt it was an isolated incident. But she seems to want to force him to, sorry, behave like a Gryffindor, and openly defy them. This is a very naive view of the situation, since she doesn't realize that doing so would leave him outright unsafe, considering who his housemates are (even if he theoretically agreed with her, at least at first).

The fact that this is her only flaw in my headcanon doesn't imply that she is, besides this, perfect. It simply means that her almost non-presence in canon makes it more or less impossible to build a proper image of how she is as a person overall. I mean, it's not like I can write out any virtues either -- besides the fact that she utterly loved Harry.

** What are you talking about? Lily does have flaws in canon.

She makes excuses for Snape's behaviour for years to her friends, even though it's clear to nearly everyone that Snape has Death Eater aspirations. She's gullible and naive in thinking that Snape isn't like the rest of the crowd he hangs out with. While you could argue that believing the best in someone/everyone is a good quality, it can also be viewed as a negative one.

Also, before they start Hogwarts, Snape (accidentally, sure...) makes a branch fall on Petunia. Her own sister (who was nowhere near as foul as she'd later become) has a branch fall on top of her, Snape is partially responsible, and Lily keeps being friends with him. You think this isn't a flaw?

You don't have to make her vain or arrogant or kill her parents or anything - the flaws are already there in canon.

*** ...I never said she was flawless, I stated she lacks solid characterisation, which is true.

Being naive/overly forgiving can be perceived as a character flaw, but it's not much is it? How much does that actually tell you about Lily Evans? We know she was clever and good at magic, we know she loved her son, we know she didn't like James initially and we know she gave Snape several chances (for reasons we DON'T know). That's what we know about her. Compare that to what we know about James. We know he was arrogant, a bully, he was jealous of Snape AS WELL as being disgusted at his use of Dark Magic (also giving us an ideology that he stood by, technically we don't even know what Lily's opinion is on Dark Magic). He cared about his friends, enough to risk his life AND break the law for them, was incredibly smart and gifted with at least certain branches of magic. We have a character for James Potter, it isn't much in comparison to the likes of the main cast (or even some of the secondary cast like Sirius) but it is very clear who he was and who he later becomes before he died. He was an arrogant kid who mellowed with age, what was Lily?

Also, Lily still befriending Snape after a bout of ACCIDENTAL magic isn't that out there, is it? How is that a flaw? Snape did something bad ACCIDENTALLY as a child and, fellow child, Lily forgave him for it. How is that a flaw? It showcases that Lily is kind and forgiving if anything.

Reread my post again.
