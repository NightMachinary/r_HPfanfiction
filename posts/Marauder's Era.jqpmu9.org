I have recently read stuff on Quotev, adn have absolutely fallen in LOVE With the amount of OC action there is! I look on other sites, and there isn't much at all.

Are there any Marauders era fics with:

1. Extremely Kind female character
2. She is the 5th marauder
3. Love triangle/square within the marauders for her love
4. She's really pretty
5. James isn't attracted to/eventually doesn't like Lily

I know it's a ton of points, but this just would be my dream story. I have been craving Marauder's era, specifically Love triangles or squares within the marauders, and have so far come up with nothing that isn't from Quotev. ANYTHING would be greatly appreciated. I am fine reading ones where Lily is horrible.

Thanks!


** Well, this one is time travelling Hermione but it hits a lot of the things you're asking for. She might as well be an OC, because it was older/Minister of Magic Hermione who went back and was reborn as the third Evans sister due to a magical accident. It's pretty well written and nice to read.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
