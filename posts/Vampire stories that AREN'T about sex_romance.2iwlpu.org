I love vampires, but I'm really not a fan of romance and junk. I like horror and loss of humanity and stuff like that.

I just finished reading a ridiculously good one where Snape's cover is blown and Voldemort- discovering that his worst fear is vampires due to a childhood trauma- decides the best possible punishment would be to become one himself. Really, really heartwrenching and intense. Sad thing is, the author has lost interest and is going to cut it short and wrap it up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1842903/1/To-Consort-With-The-Devil][To Consort With The Devil]] (Words: 30,198 - Reviews: 281 - Favs: 103 - Follows: 112)

So, I'm on the prowl for more.

I have trouble taking vampire /Harry/- or any of the big three, really- seriously, but if you say it's good I'll give it a shot.

The vampire thing doesn't necessarily have to be the main focus of the story. I've found that lots of the best scenarios come up in stories that you wouldn't initially label with that subject.

I don't mind crossovers as long as it's something I'll be able to understand without having read the other series. (I'm a big fan of Hellsing but I've already gone through that crossover section.)


** A second chance at life and its sequels has a lot of vampires in it and is not a love or romance story at all. its very AU and does not take place at hogwarts at ll besides th first few chapters. Harry goes to a new school and is very powerful. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094199/1/Grey-Clouds-Loomed][Grey Clouds Loomed]] is pretty good. Harry is an immoral world of darkness vampire.
