** Perhaps you're thinking of /Unsealed/, by Esama? She unfortunately took down all her works from fanfiction.net, but [[http://onj1.andrelouis.com/hp/esama/Unsealed.txt][someone else put up a copy here]].

**** Either Bing or the DarkLordPotter forums; I can't remember which. (I'm not a member, but sometimes I check their recommendations page.)

** I've read a similar story, but IIRC, he kills Dumbledore. Unfortunately, my google-foo wasn't strong enough to find the story. I remember a few more details from the story, but don't want to spoil it ...

I was hoping someone else would have found the link. I'd like to add it to my favorites. Oh well.
