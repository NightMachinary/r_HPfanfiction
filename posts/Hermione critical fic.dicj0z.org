Which is to say a fic that calls out her actual flaws in the book series and holds her accountable for them.

How she can be insensitive and lash out at others, how she isn't considerate when she thinis shes right, how she can get jealous etc.

This doesnt have to be a bashing fic it could be one where she just learns from her mistakes but it cant be one that sympathizes or excuses her more than it calls her out.

It also cant just give her flaws that she doesnt have or make her look worthless for the sake of doing so.

Preferably not from Hermiones pov but it can be. Its Hermione critical it can be harsh but harsh in a fair way not just bashing for the sake of bashing. It should be fair in what it bashes. Focus on her flaws while down playing her strengths or making a story where her strengths matter less is ok. Making a story that says secretly she was stupid all along isnt.

Also not a Hermione ship fic


** I'd like such a moment after war when the Trio sit down and discuss about their shortcomings during the past 7 years.

As for Hermione, here are the things that could be mentioned:

- Totally insensitive about her monster cat eating her best friend's pet rat
- Curse the DA contract without telling people before hand. Even worse, her little scheme could not prevent traitors.
- Refuse to consider Draco Malfoy a Death Eater bent on carrying out terrorist activities
- Assault Ron with birds in a fit of jealousy
- Refuse to consider the possibility of a Horcrux hidden in Hogwarts
- Refuse to believe the validity of Deathly Hallows

Of course, the list of Harry and Ron's mistakes are also long. It actually makes sense for them to work out these issues.

*** I like it!

But as neat as this would be id prefer a fic where she sufferred consequences because of this when it happened.

Like for example the cat thing. What if Hagrid hadnt called Harry and Ron out for distancing themselves and she slowly had to make amends while they decided that while they were upset they still liked her as a friend? And they came to that conclusion on their own.

Or like with the bird thing if people gave her the cold shoulder or this only drove Ron further from her and he ended up becoming closer to Lavender and Hermione just had to accept that sometimes the person you love doesnt love you back and you have to move on. They shouldnt answer for your jealousy.

**** I think this would be interesting, especially if you could take these instances, make a series of one shot stories about the consequences. Also, I'm pretty sure the centaurs hate her after the whole Umbridge thing, quite surprised she didn't somehow get arrested for that. I recently read an NCIS fic which was a set of standalone chapters following each episode of season 1, with the consequences of the teams action, or inaction, ranging from just getting called out and a talking to by the boss, to legal action taken because the team messed up big time.\\
I would like to see something like that in regards to Hermione, not just her being bashed into the wall, but basically there being consequences, and potential for character growth. If you're never called out when you mess up, how're you going to grow?

***** Exactly!

Its why in my opinion after the first book she never had any issues that needed working on.

Even when she did it was handwaved away or someone else was more wrong than her or it was justified in someway.

Because of this she never had an arc

What a waste so much more could have been done. I know when this series was coming out Hermione being the competent smart badass who was in the right was likely a bigger deal and great representation and a good rolemodel. But its 2019 now there are tons of more female characters like Hermione who still had flaws that had consequences and got character arcs. You can have both. Sure canon cant be changed but fanon can. And this thing of giving characters arcs that dont exist in canon? This is a thing Fanfics do alot. Not as bashing but just having them grow from flaws. Even in the hp fandom.

Like alot of people get salty about Malfoy getting redeemed in fics because its not uncommon for him to get woobified and he was a bigot growing up.

But its also not uncommon for him to be dragged for his actions. For him to face alot of reprocussions to earn that redemption. And chances are if you like fanon Draco youve read a story like that. And if you do...who could blame you? That is a really interesting story that makes the character compelling. And some are very well written too. You can dislike canon Draco but appreciate the fanon version for capitalizing on that potential. But all that effort for a canon character that people have mixed feelings on. Wouldnt it be great if Hermione a fan favorite had an arc like that in fic? Wouldnt that be super compelling and make you root for her?

For some reason people have embraced this concept for other characters but not Hermione. At least not in my experience. And maybe thats true for more than just me because it seems more people have hopes of reading a fic like this but few have.

****** Alright. So. I'm maybe not the best writer in the world, but this has all raised my interest, and it won't be like a 7 year 'what changes if Hermione changes' fic, more like a series of what could've happened if someone had either talked to someone else, or brought things to Hermione's attention directly, and/or what consequences there are, and what could change. So if we'd start with Scabbers and the eating of him, maybe Random Gryffindor Prefect overhears the fight, and thinks Hey, I should tell McGonagall about this, because students' pets shouldn't be eating other students' pets, and it rolls from there.

Then there can be a chapter on Why You Shouldn't Assault Your Best Friend.

Also You Shouldn't Confundus People On Brooms. Because seriously, that could've gone really badly. Reaaally badly. But mostly sticking to canon things, and not having McLaggen fly into the Whomping Willow.

******** I will do that, I've opened a doc for it in Scrivener, though if you'll allow it, I might bug you (and the rest of the sub) for inspiration and ideas. Some are pretty obvious, like Scabbers and the attacking birds, but what other chapters could there be, SPEW and the hats comes to mind, I don't think she was ever informed that Dobby had the clean the entire tower alone because of her. Personally, I wouldn't mind if someone complained about her just barging into the boys dorm, because that's totally not ok, but I can't remember how often/which years she actually did it, will have to look it up.

********* Bug away I love this idea !

For the houseelves personsally i thought the issue was she didnt consider their feelings about being unpaid labor. True they could have been indoctorinated. But if she wanted to free them of that she should have changed their opinions about their status first try to understand things from their perspective and then when they were more comfortable with the idea leave socks around the common room. If you dont consider their feelings and go straight to socks even if you are right it wont work

Maybe her growth from the fireboldt incident ( maybe talk to Harry and Ron about it being from Sirius black instead of going straight to a teacher could be a lesson she learnt because not taking into account others feelings regardung your actions about their well being will hurt them despite your best intentions) could make her handle the elves differently

********** Exactly this. And it can be excused by the fact that she is still a child, but again, if no one ever actually brings it up with her, and I'm sure she'd be horrified to learn about Dobby having to clean the whole tower alone because of her actions, well, she won't know, won't be able to learn, grow, adapt.

Was talking to a friend and she brought up how, unfortunately, often when a girl is wrong in fanfic she's portrayed as 'a silly girl' and put down, and I really want to avoid that. While I'm sure there's characters that would react that way to her, say Snape, that's just not really what I'm aiming for. There's a difference between constructive criticism, and just tearing someone down just because you can. While I think some stuff might require a harsher dose of reality check, possibly Marietta and her permanent disfiguration, and the whole attacking Ron, I still don't want to hit her with a big bashing stick? And I do feel she should have a right to reply. There was a story linked recently that was just a list of flaws read outloud to her, some real, some made up, some taken out of context, or exaggerated, and she never got a word in edgewise, and then ran out crying and that was the end of the fic, and while I guess that could be interesting once or twice, it doesn't leave room for character growth, that's just being mean?

*********** To be honest i feel like rather than call outs there should be consequnces

The scabbers and fireboldt situation shouldnt be resolved by Harry and Ron telling her she was insensitive and took things into her hands without discussing it with them even thoughit involved them, its resolved because they start avoiding her because they are upset and feel it was a breach of friendship for them . She has to figure out on her own why they are upset why that sort of thing is damaging and try to rekindle the friendship which works because they do like her. .

Or a consequence about her lashing out physically with Ron is that he becomes even closer to Lavender and she applogizes for her actions and realizes that making Ron take respinsibility for her jealousy is making them more distant. She has to at least for a time accept their relationship

She also learns a lesson and yes she feels bad but grows

Its not a author mouthpiece ranting away about all her flaws.

**** Ya thats more my thing Harry and Ron make mistakes and when they do they face consequences or the narrative makes it clear they are in the wrong by calling them out. Like when Ron is jealous about Krum and hurts her feelings the narrartive makes him look like a dick. Which in that moment he is.

But when Hermione lashes out in jealousy in a similar set up only in reverse its poor Hermione she had a one sided crush.

I want a fic that makes her suffer more consequences and call her out more.

But the only time i see it is in bashing fic which exaggerates things so much that it doesnt resemble the character. Or just dismissises all good qualities she has and twists them into bad ones instead.

So im looking for a fic that does this with a Hermione thats in character and is fair about what they call out or bash.

You dont always have the luxury of being right and even when you are that doesnt always matter especially in relationships.

But Hermiones behavior is excused in cases where others dont have similar behavior excused. She also has flaws hand waved because shes right about something.

She is suspicious of the HBP book because she is jealous. Shes right about being more careful with the book but this came out of jealousy. And being insecure about her intelligence is something she never has to deal with ever again.

Theres never a smarter person, a skill she values in magical academia she cant exel in.

You have that set up with her why not follow through with it.

The answer isnt Hermione is dumb. Its Hermione isnt good at everything and has to accept it and focus on what she can do not what others can do better.

But you never get that in fics

So it feels sue ish. The world is being altered to make her look good. And unless its a bashfic just shitting on her in a unfair way or "putting her in her place" there is no alternative...and i want it i want.that alternative.

It has to exist somewhere...please someone give me.

It's not that Hermione is a bad person in the books. In my opinion the books' portrayal of her is probably the best official one. It's that she does get away with things Harry and Ron would not because she's an author favorite.

It's still way better than movie and fanon portrayals of her. I don't want bashing and I don't want her worshipped. I want an intelligent person who grows up and realizes she's disregarding people.

Woah, woah, woah. Why would they have such an open and frank discussion of their personal issues?

** The thing that both Hermione “apologists” (for lack of a better term) and her detractors tend to overlook is that canon Hermione is a smart girl with little to no social skills dealing with people her own age. It's understandable for someone who's an only child and didn't have friends growing up. Unfortunately JKR isn't very good at showing realistic character growth (my biggest issues with canon Ron and Draco also stem from this). So we have teenagers often acting like they're still eleven.

I don't think you could do a realistic fic with her making all of the same mistakes as canon, she would probably be mostly the same in books 1 and 2 with steady improvement from book 3 onward

*** I don't agree with that. Hermione and Ron act their age and mature in the books steadily throughout in a realistic way. It's one of the many things you actually see fanfiction fail regularly at, they forget that the characters are still young and people are flawed.

Draco does not exactly have character growth. That's not really the point. Draco simply reached the point where he had to back up his words, and it turns out he wasn't truly capable of being a murderer. His character growth happens post-series.

The important bit for each of them is how they improve across the series and learn to utilise their strengths. Ron learned how to treat Hermione with greater maturity and respect. He learned to have greater confidence in his abilities both as a Quidditch player and as a person, and the major part for Ron was how he realised instantly his mistake rather than stew on it as he did in Goblet/Prisoner. Hermione learned to respect Luna in spite of their differences and relaxed much more about the spirit of rules.

#+begin_quote

Him dealing with jealousy is all over; from his gradual realization that Harry's life is actually kind of shit because for all Harry has going for him, he lacks all the things that Ron has in abundance; to his fears about Hermione finding someone else.

His laziness is given stark relief - he's only lazy about things he doesn't believe matter. He works hard in the DA, and never shirks one of the year-long projects or mysteries that form the main plot (except year 6 because he and Hermione have decided that Malfoy isn't evil for some reason). He spends half of year 1 in the library looking for Flamel, he helps Harry train for the tournament, he's there for the Ministry raid, etc.

He controls his temper enough to make it through year 5, when an entire group of people who hate him, specifically, have Inquisitorial powers. He defends Hermione to Snape when he and her were in an epic fight (that she started), he swallows his pride to check on Harry when he's out of bed in year 4 because he's concerned for him after an epic fight (that Ron started), etc.

His inferiority is the same as his jealousy.
