More or less as the topic says. I tried to come up with an alternative to “ruled with an iron fist” because I figured the type of person who'd do that wouldn't use an idiom that called to mind Muggle fisticuffs. I came up with an unsatisfactory “Unbreakable Wand”. Maybe “ruled with Cold Iron”?


** I haven't got any particular suggestions but a good thing to keep in mind is that Statute of Secrecy isn't all that old in civilization terms and they would have similar idioms from back then.

*** Exactly. How many "new" (came into use post-1692) idioms are there that have stood the test of time?

**** Sorry, I wasn't trying to counter your topic or anything. I just think it's something to keep in mind. There will definitely be some newer idioms that won't be the same as the muggle ones.

** Well I've seen "What a load of Hippogriff dung"

I've also seen "when the Dragon Dung hits the fan"

Then I swore I read a fic where they used "When the Hippogriff dung meets the blasting curse" but I can't fing the fic it's in.

*** For what it's worth, I think I've seen "what a load of dragon dung" more often than "hippogriff dung". I think the alliteration of dragon dung helps it roll off the tongue better(though one doesn't want dragon dung on their tongues)

** I'm thinking "rules with Death's Wand". It's a wand everyone knows and the deathstick is known to be more powerful than all others.

** I've noticed them here and there in the fanfics I've read, and I always think, "Hey that's cool," and keep reading. I should start making a note of them.

ETA: One I do remember is "on the other wand" instead of "on the other hand." *shrug*

** Oh I love to think about magic idioms.

One I thought up, but haven't been able to use yet is, 'You won't burn your wand just because you're cold'

I hope I don't have to explain the meaning, because if I do I have to rethink it

** I have two:

"Their core is shorter than their wand/doesn't reach the end of their wand." A few cards short of a full deck, their elevator doesn't go to the to floor.

"They've got a wand with two cores." (Or five, or seven;. whatever number would be ludicrously impossible, if in a world with multi-core wands.) Someone who is naive, gullible, or otherwise easy to deceive.

*** Too many fanfics actually have wands with two cores for that not to be a little confusion.

I think maybe, "They've got a wand with no core" might be a more accurate turn of phrase to express naivety.

**** That's why I mentioned the variable number. The implication is supposed to be that they believe they have a wand like that when every sensible person knows it can't exist.

Which isn't too say that "A wand with no core" wouldn't be a great expression! But I'd see that as someone powerless, myself.
