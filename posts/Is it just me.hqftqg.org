Did anyone else start reading fanfiction that was riddled with mistakes and barely readable, and now only read fics that have good grammar.

If I read a summary and see a spelling mistake, I will completely ignore the fic, even if the concept is interesting.


** I'll give the summary one or two mistakes, but if in the first chapter it takes me longer to decipher the words they're using than it does to read the chapter, I won't continue with it.

If used in exactly the right way, it works, but the usage has to be /perfect/, the literary equivalent of splitting the adversary's shaft in archery. It's possible and amazing when it happens, but it usually doesn't.

On the other hand, a more non-cliche approach can be used, such as "The weather should have been dark and raining with lightning flashing overhead as it would have fitted with the emotions he was feeling. Instead, the sun was out in the almost-clear sky, the brightness making him squint as he stomped along the path..."

Slightly off topic: I cannot, absolutely cannot read fics that a) don't separate paragraphs by speech(a character talking should have the dialogue separate from everything else, including other characters dialogue, unless the same character immediately follows it up with something, and even then, if their ranting or saying a lot at once, apply paragraph rules to it. This is how to properly do things) or b) have middle-alinged text. It fucks with me and I can't read it.

** I can stomach a certain amount of spelling mistakes, ie the wrong variant of a word, or its just a similar word that could be easily muddled if English weren't your first language. And if the story is compelling then my tolerance does increase. So long as it is generally readable then I'll just get on with it. Though I will proof read and correct in my head, ill also reword sentences to better suit my preferred syntax, I've considered doing betawork, but I dont have the patience for it, I like completed works I like to think I have a pretty decent vocabulary and grasp of the English language, but I also recognise that that comes from a place of privilege, I had good schooling, I dont have a language related learning disability, and British English is my first and only language.

I have found some fics unreadable, I just chalk it up to experience and move on.

A few examples that really takes you out of the story would be when Harry gives Daphne a kiss in the forehead. It was jarring to have the image of him ripping her skull open so he could kiss the inside of her head. Similarly when Harry is showing some of his memories he mentions that he and his team got in the thestrals on the way to the MoM. That was another disturbing mental image.

** Slightly the opposite. When I just started out reading fanfics, I was a grammar snob. (English is not my native language but I was quite proficient at it, and I was so proud and such an arrogant brat.)

Any sign of error and I would hightail out of it. Incorrect tenses, inconsistencies, even just misspelled words (defiantly instead of definitely, fucking door jam instead of jamb, things like that).

I learned pretty fast that if you have such high standards for fan fiction, you'd be left with ultra slim pickings.

Gradually I learned to sort of read over mistakes---my mind would either absently note, “That should be lied instead of laid,” or automatically “correct” some words (particularly tenses and subject-verb consistencies).

I still draw the line at awful grammar. Works that feature mistakes every two or three sentences are consigned to hell.

** I'm completely unwilling to read fics with spelling/usage errors, or bad writing, but I'm willing to forgive the latter in the case that the story is well-plotted - it's fanfic, after all.

A lot of my reading historically was done either late at night or drunk (or both) which definitely caused my standards to slip. I don't reread fics, but occasionally I check over my top 20 list, and some things that end up there after 4 am reading binge are completely unpalatable when I'm fully aware of what I'm doing.

There are definitely fics I read in high school that I simply can't enjoy anymore, simply because I can no longer relate to many of the plot points or characters the same way I did back then. In general, fanfiction has become less appealing as I've aged, with the exception of certain really well-written, mature works. But I have no problem with fics I consider immature or badly written being popular; to each their own.

**** I misremembered. I had more time to think.

I first started reading fanfiction when I was 19 (7 years ago), I found stories by google searching for recommendations. I did go through a phase where I loved reading genderbent characters for the different perspective mostly (and some hormones? no lemons) and for a while I accepted them despite most being lower quality than what i normally read, but beyond that I liked reading do-overs.. my capacity for bullshit was lower back then but I was still a cynical little shit.

😎

Nowadays I usually look for a premise I like and then read the first 1k words before habitually closing the fic to prevent myself from going blind!

Why do I still read? Some fanfiction stories are just really, really fucking good, and theres a lot of them. There are many talented authors out there and a good part of them happen to visit this reddit!
