** Amicus Protecto Fortis (someone already dropped the link) is most likely what you're looking for. It contains that same spell, and the DA is formed as the Defense Association after Harry, Ron and Hermione's troll attack in first year. Originally a study group, after Cedric's death they form a resistance rivaling the Order of The Phoenix (Sirius is the only one who knows about it) and thanks to Harry's inheritance as a lord, they have the money to do so. However, after Umbridge comes to Hogwarts and scars little Dennis Creevey with the blood quill, they get to start taking action against the Ministry of Magic themselves along with the Death Eaters they had been anonymously defeating.

#+begin_quote
  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
