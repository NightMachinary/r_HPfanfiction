I'm looking for good stories with a focus on a romance that Harry is part of. I'm good with any pairing or type of pairing except slash. Het, harem, fem!Harry/male or female character, etc. is all great.

Thanks for any recommendations you have.


** Just as an exercise, I tried out a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&_c1=6&_c2=9][filter on ffnet]] to see what came from it:

Ratings: All; Language: English; Genre: Romance; With: Harry P.; Without: Severus S or Draco M. Sorted by: Reviews

Outcome: 57000 fics, and of the top 25, 5 were Harry/Voldemort and another was a M/M/M/M thing.

I wish you good fortune on your quest.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=toplist][This is one of my most used bookmarks]]. Many of the stories on portkey are sugary sweet with a heavy focus on romance.

** My favourite is this one:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel and the Chosen One]] Harry/Tonks - nice buildup, dialogue is entertaining. Its a fun little romance story.

I'm not a fan of romance fics, to be sure, but this one did it for me.

I also liked:
