** Just tore through the posted chapters.

There's only two chapters at the time of this comment, but the first one engaged me straight away, from the tense rescue attempt to Harry's various emotional reactions.

There are a few nitpicks, mostly to do with formatting. In dialogue, some sentences don't have the needed commas or periods in place, and there's the occasional blip with dialogue tags. Example: "He/She said" instead of "he/she said."

I'm also a little wary, though, that things might turn into a Snape-bashing fest. There are a lot of grey, dark, and indy Harry fics where the writers punt Snape into "worse than Voldemort" territory, which always kills those fics for me. (Canon-level Snape is a big enough piece of shit.) And seeing a bunch of students outclass one of the more powerful wizards in the series would be a bit implausible for me, so, like I said -- wary.

But the formatting issue is a small one, and the second is personal taste.

Anyway, the premise is neat: Harry as a wizard version of the Punisher? I'm in. Also, the love of friends as a path towards darkness is a motivation that doesn't crop up very often (/The Sum of Their Parts/ comes to mind), so that makes it interesting.

** God damn man, just read through both chapters. This gave me chills. It seems to be going in a "ever growing list of people to kill" direction which sort of reminds me of assassins creed 2 haha. Unlike [[/u/mistermisstep][u/mistermisstep]], my opinion of Snape as the next target and Snape bashing etc etc. Your story doesn't feel like it will turn into a bash-fic, you wrote emotionally compromised teenagers who have been given condemning information on someone without knowing the context around why he did such things. So I can see H&H creating an incredibly methodical plan to capture Snape and extract the info out of him. Afterwards finding out his reasons as stated in canon, offing him, then finding more targets.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
