I want a fic where on the first train ride for first year, Draco Malfoy goes around introducing himself to all the first years and manages to piss off/scare off every first year. Even the traditionally dark families who were raised to want to go to Slytherin are slighted enough to not want to be housemates with him. And because he loudly proclaims his intention of being in Slytherin, all the incoming first years pull a Harry and plead with the hat for anywhere but Slytherin.

The professors are mildly worried when no one is sorted into Slytherin at first and breathe a sigh of relief when Draco is sorted. They are utterly dismayed when Draco is the /only/ one sorted into Slytherin.

And maybe a few weeks later, the heads of houses overhear their first years talking about the sorting and where the hat wanted them. Or when whatever house has class with “Slytherin”, Draco ends up sitting with a large margin of empty seats around him. The heads of house are quick to figure out that Draco did something big enough to alienate the entire first year class.

Please have fun describing what he did to each group, especially the characters who would have been in Slytherin originally.


** That honestly could make for a really amusing and entertaining story. There could be multiple chapters devoted to how Draco turned off each student over the years. Purebloods and halfbloods as they grew up around him...muggleborns during trips to Diagon Alley, on the platform waiting for the train, during the train ride, riding the boats, waiting for the sorting.

**** There's also the bit in linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot) where the tendency of supporters of the Dark Lord to suffer bizarre fatal accidents leads magical Britain to the conclusion that there's a curse on Slytherin House, to the point where damn' near the only kids getting sorted there are the muggleborns, who don't know this and don't make any objection known to the hat.

**** Yeah, I've seen that fic before. It's chilling.

Arguably, stripping Draco's magic and banishing him to live as a Muggle might be a blessing in disguise since I doubt he'd be treated well had he somehow avoided Slytherin, depending on where in the Muggle world he ends up.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** "Of course, Father says that if it's not a love marriage, I would be free to have an affair," said Draco knowingly.

"An... affair," said Daphne Greengrass, raising an eyebrow. She wasn't sure what those words meant exactly but she knew that it was kind of weird for an eight year old to be saying them.

Draco nodded. "Father always says that if he and Mother weren't such a great match, he'd have seen Auntie Bella on the side."

...

"Crabbe, why aren't you talking to me anymore?"

Crabbe shrugged. "Your da' stopped giving me sweets."

"...oh."

...

"Father says it's improper, of course, for a woman to go through too many husbands," Draco said loudly and obnoxiously.

Blaise and Tracey shared a glance. Tracey cleared her throat. "Didn't you say you were in talks for some sort of betrothal to the Greengrasses, but you'd be glad to 'fit me in' on the side?"

Draco nodded eagerly. "Oh yeah, it's perfectly okay with a man to hold hands with lots of different girls, but if a woman holds hands with a lot of guys she's probably murdering them for their inheritance. Like, she has poisonous nails or something."

My headcanon is that the Malfoys got the same deal as Karkaroff and betrayed any other death eater they knew of, its not perfect but its the only way freeing them could be justified.

I'm not going to try to explain it because it's almost my bed time, but for real world counter-examples to all kinds of objections people have in this forum to how Death Eaters are treated post war - post *either* war - which posters think are utterly implausible ... you just need to look at how Nazis were treated after WW2. The majority of party members and even members of the armed branches of the party like the SS weren't really true believers, they were just people who joined up to get better jobs, or who were suckered in while young and impressionable and either didn't realise until it was too late what they'd signed up for or were effectively brainwashed. Those people didn't deserve harsh treatment, and when at first the occupying powers in the west were zealous about de-Nazification it was deeply unpopular with the German population.

De-Nazification was taken much further in the east, where of course public opinion didn't matter. Brutal dictatorships can get away with that sort of thing, but the HP world isn't a brutal dictatorship after either of the wars.
