** Hagrid would obviously be his Kronk - muscular, unintelligent, and far too sympathetic to the protagonists to really qualify as evil.

--------------

"Pull the lever, Hagrid!"

Hagrid, as instructed, pulled the lever. Immediately, a trapdoor opened under Dumbledore - and Dumbledore alone. It took him a good 10 minutes to walk back from being dumped into the Black Lake, and the things the Squid attempted to do to him would make this story's rating shoot up if mentioned in any amount of detail.

"Wrong lever..."

Hagrid was mildly confused by this turn of events, and let it never be said that Hagrid didn't occasionally question his employer over the small stuff.

"Why d'we even 'ave that lever?"

** Dumbledore: "Severus, make Lupin's wolfsbane and Gryffindor wins the House Cup."

Snape: "Don't you mean, 'make Lupin's wolfsbane OR Gryffindor wins the House Cup'?"

Dumbledore: "Nope."

** But then he'd be totally transparent unless Harry and everyone else is Kuzco-level dumb.

*** No it's just that everyone, Harry included, knows Dumbledore is super Yzma manipulative and they all just pretend to go along with it. The Dursleys actually treat Harry like family, but he had to sleep in the cupboard the day before his Hogwarts letter came so that Dumbledore would think he's mistreated. And the room he's locked into from the outside? It has a door to the bathroom, hidden behind the wardrobe. Every week or two, Harry and the Dursleys put on a "play" of some sort---sometimes really elaborate ones involving an "Aunt Marge," who's really a witch from Europe---so that Harry has plenty of disturbing childhood memories. Even Voldemort is in on it, because for all his manipulations, there is a truth to Dumbledore: he is powerful. Extremely powerful. Literally able to shatter the earth powerful. And as for the prophecy? Well, it's actually real, but the Dark Lord? Yeah, that's Dumbledore.

They can't even stop pretending after he "dies," because he has Horcruxes (of course he does). Thankfully, he loves scheming more than anything else, and isn't the most observant, so doesn't realize everyone's playing him.

Oh, and I nearly forgot: he hates trans people; he's a TERF. Unfortunately, Harry is trans. Fortunately, the Ministry for Magic---which exists primarily to keep Dumbledore placated, even if it means convincing Dumbledore he's fighting said Ministry---has a metamorphmagus, one who was more than happy to take Harry's place (coincidentally, during Harry's first year at Hogwarts, Nymphadora Nigellus Tonks missed many of their classes).

Unfortunately, when Sirius came out as trans, it was difficult to arrange a substitute, so they had to fake his death. (see, all HP fanfic now must be trans; sorry, I don't make the rules)

**** Okay, so Dumbledore's Yzma, Hagrid is Kronk, Harry is Kuzco and Ron is Pacha.

** The only thing I can picture right now is where Yzma pulls up her skirt and everyone cringes and backs away - so Dumbledore's leaning down to pull up his robes and Harry, Ron, and Hermione just flinching with horror.

** Actually, now that I think of it, I did read a Dumbledore-bashing fic where he was siphoning money as the guardian of every orphan that went through Hogwarts (including Harry), to build Dumbledore Castle. Doesn't have quite the ring of Kuzco-topia, but a similar idea.

(No, I don't remember the title or author. Unlike some, I enjoy bashing fics so I've read many.)
