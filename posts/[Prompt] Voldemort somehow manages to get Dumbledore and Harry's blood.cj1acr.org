*** It's just a prompt. You could make it so he gets some sort of power over Dumbledore. You could make it so he grows a beard and gets a candy addiction.

Seriously, prompts are not the place to argue over logistics.

Edit: As the person below mentioned, I was harsh. I like leaving these open-ended so that the person who replies can surprise me. You want to write a serious fic where using Dumbledore's blood makes for an even scarier Voldemort, be my guest. You want to make a fic where Voldemort changing the ritual messes it up and he turns into a goat, then by all means do so.

**** Your apparent grudge against discussing the logical and canonical implications of prompted scenario aside, I don't think [[/u/eAlouda]] was an attempt to "argue over logistics" so much as a genuine question asking what kind of scenarios you were expecting from this prompt.

***** I apologized to [[/u/eAlouda]] and clarified what I meant. I was too harsh, and I definitely misinterpreted whatever was said.

I've had quite a few prompts with the reply being "Harry wouldn't do that." or "You're wrong." And such with some of my recent prompts.

I don't want that. I'm a sucker for getting into arguments, so staying directly on topic is important to me. I don't mind constructive criticism or such. I don't mind getting asked to clear up the prompt.
