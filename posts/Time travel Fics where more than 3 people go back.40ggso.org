** The only one I've fully read is linkffn(Hallowed Time Twists) which has the entire Potter Family go back in time. It's... readable, but not not much more than that.

There is also linkffn(Far too many Time Travellers), which fits your request and is relatively well liked. I was never a fan.

The only Ron one I know of is linkffn(Through a Dark Mirror by Deadwoodpecker). Great start. Too bad the only thing written is the start.

  Mixing the Potter kids with the Master of Death, not-so-secret horcruxes, haywire magic, and the dawning Second War could only end in catastrophe. All was well? Harry Potter really shouldn't have tempted fate like that. For the Potters are now stuck in a year where Voldemort is far more than a half-forgotten nightmare. --- Canon compliant, Next Generation Time Travel.

** I present you *The cost of time travel*, linkffn(6905950), quite possibly the only existence of a /Ron only/ Peggy Sue fic on FFN. That's right no Harry, no Hermione just Ron. And no this is not an April Fools or a troll fic.

In one of the A/N of The cost of time travel, it mentions *Mein Teil*, linkffn(3224489), which is a HP x Buffy crossover where Ron and Faith are the Peggy Sues.

*Three's the Charm*, linkffn(8326928), Trio Peggy Sue. There's not a lot of drama, and it's rather nice and clean. Where everything is going exactly as planned, so it's not exciting. But it's still a decent read simply because Trio Peggy Sues don't really exist.

Sadly enough I do not know of any three or more time traveller fics besides Backwards With Purpose.

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.
