Harry goes through so much, never either loses his mind or actively deals with problems the way a human would.

I want to see a harry that becomes actively batshit insane to the point that only Luna truly understands him, and they'd be the only pairing that'd work, either because of someone's death, or bullying, or the Dursleys, the tournament,any of it really.

Ideally Harry/Luna, and no slash (Because 99.9% of the Slash recs are Death Eater slash. You could pair Harry with Rider of Black/Astolfo as Slash fairly easily, and have it still be more believable than the Harry/Malfoy/Snape/Voldemort/Greyback/Adult Deatheater weird fics out there)


** HP/Pokemon fusion. It's adorable. Harry/Luna. linkao3(7353028)

HP/LOTR crossover. Harry/Luna. linkffn(12944186)

A few others with no Luna pairing: linkffn(12703694;8212843;8197451) and linkao3(7693897)

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

** You could always try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4130255/1/Phantom-Limb][Phantom Limb]] by Rbackwards. It features a Harry that was kidnapped as a child and memory charmed every day so his brain is... well it doesn't work quite right. It's Harry/Ginny, but he gets along swimmingly with Luna, for the reasons you're looking for. It's quite good, but a bit odd, so here's a sample from the meeting of Harry and Luna to see if it's something you'd like to read:

#+begin_quote
  All right, then - large, very large blue eyes, that might be able to see backwards as well as forwards; that demonstrated a profoundly neutral mind operating them. I still remember them now, what it was like to see them erupt from nowhere behind my aunt, followed Cheshire-cat-like by the rest of a silvery-blonde woman in black robes. She had the appearance of evenness, of the person who meant the phrase "all things being equal". She took me in and processed me somehow and then put me back almost untouched, like a careful botanist.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "Yes," she said in a light voice that sounded like a violin played very high and very soft. "I'm a bit early. I'm very eager to begin my journey." She stepped forward, her eyes following my aunt before returning to me. They seemed to land anywhere but on my own, but not in a shy way --- rather, she was seeing details that interested her. I had an impulse to ask her if she knew me, and did so.

  She almost smiled, in the sense that her face had been so tranquil beforehand that smiling didn't change her face much. Her eyes went to my right, then somewhere above my eyes. "We have not met."

*** That fic is an experience! Not my thing, but the writing is something else.

It just vaguely irked me how Harry could judge a person at a glance and it was always correct - seemed a bit Gary Stuish, if that's the right word. Arthur kidnapped him as a child and Obliviated him regularly until his mind turned into mush. Zero resentment from Harry. He meets Snape, who hasn't done anything to him at that point, and is instantly a jerk to him. Same with Dumbledore if I recall right. Feels a bit like the author was projecting his dislike for the characters, maybe.

**** In regards to Dumbledore he was being possessed by Voldemort so he should really be given a pass on that one. It's been so long since I've read it that I don't recall the meeting with Snape... but considering that Snape is such an incredible asshole, it doesn't surprise me that Harry dislikes him immediately.

EDIT: And in regards to Arthur/Molly it's explained in the story: He doesn't remember anything. Without a past to inform his future decisions, he has to just take people "as they are". And he had always been cared for by that person, so Harry is upset, but it doesn't shatter his world because you need to remember a world to have it shattered.

** In Art of Self-Fashioning, nobody really understands Harry and he doesn't do anything to help them either. Longbottom is the BWL but Harry still ends up at the Dursleys. No pairings, but Harry is for sure deeply affected by his treatment by the Dursleys and it carries over to his school years.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
