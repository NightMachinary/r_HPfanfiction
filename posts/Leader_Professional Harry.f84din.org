Anyone have any fics where Harry becomes like a leader to Hogwarts? As in, the students look up to him and he takes charge during dangerous moments? Preferably with him being distant or composed. House doesn't matter, but I'm guessing most fics like this would have him in Slytherin.

I just really want to see my boy being a bamf. :)


** I just read a fic last week where post-Voldemort, Harry realizes none of the discrimination in the wizarding world has changed and basically decides to be a dark wizard since they're apparently the only ones who get things to happen. Harry ends up leading a lot of the kids from DA as his “followers” and half the time he's just floored that they're willing to follow him at all---which is what makes him such a good leader, according to them. Really nicely written, and I had a great time with the character study of Harry that it kind of was.
