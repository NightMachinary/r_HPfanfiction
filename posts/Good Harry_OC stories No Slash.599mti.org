*** Can really recommend this one, having just caught up on it today. It's a very slow building relationship though. It's mostly canon-compatible (not the epilogue and CC though) and is set 12 years after DH.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I remember enjoying The Brave New World by bellerophon30 back in the day. But I haven't read it in forever, so no idea how it holds up. Also, it seems to have recently disappeared from the Internet; google still lists it, but you get "story not found" when you click through. I have a copy, but I won't distribute it publicly until I know what's up with the author.

*** I wanted to keep reading that but the dialogue was so abysmal. Conversations were walls talking to other walls. Dobby spoke like a human.

**** Also, Harry falls for the OC in like 40 minutes, if I recall correctly. Back when it was written though (I want to say 2003 or 2004?) standards were much lower. That's why I wasn't sure how well it would hold up today, and I didn't want to reread that giant series to find out.
