** I prefer reviews that are specific. I understand not everyone has the time to do this, but readers picking out little details that they liked or disliked, or backing up their feelings with a direct quote or something, that means so much more to me than even the most positive but generic review.

***** I mostly just had the thought that I read all this fantastic (sometimes that's not the right adjective) fanficton, and I review haphazardly in bursts, but that I may as well review in a way that's going to encourage the author and make them at least fractionally as happy as they make me sometimes. If that makes sense..

** The ones that tell me that they laughed or cried, that they've read it more than once. That it should have been the way the story ended or went. One of my favourite comments said that she avoided slash stories on principle; you could do anything you wanted to Harry---make him dark, make him Slytherin, pair him with Hermione, pair him with a Muggle---but changing his sexual orientation was changing his character too much. My story changed her mind. I took that as a helluva compliment.

**** That is definitlly a compliment! I've always found it interesting that people associate sexual orientation as such a defining feature to someone's character especially as they're growing up. As a lot of people who identify as something other than straight don't figure it out until they're a bit older than Harry and he himself didn't really have that much experience in romantic love and relationships.

** If it's positive, I have no criteria. Maybe someone reads this stuff to clear their mind from a bad day, and a "nice" is really all they have left to give. I feel like I don't really have strong feelings yet about my reviews, but when I am a reader, and I see a review that argues the reviewer's head canon, or is unkind, or is just wishing the story were a different story, it really annoys me. Honestly, that irritates me more than anything I've gotten for my own writing thus far.

I also agree. I always get fed up with people fighting the author because the head cannon presented doesn't align with their own.

** I like rambling reviews that tell me weird crap about what my story made the reader think. The ones that wander on for paragraphs about how in the reader's childhood, they heard an adult say something, and how paragraph two of chapter two reminded them of that. You know, the ones where you sit there and go, "I just impacted this person's life. Dang."

I used to have a fic up about Ginny after CoS which implied TMR had been a sexual predator, and had basically spent the year grooming Ginny, and now she was trying to cope with the aftermath. Got some rather heartbreaking reviews from a few women saying they'd done similiar things to get past similiar times. They said they felt like they were not alone from reading it, which made me pretty happy that I could help. Those were probably my all-time favorite reviews.

** *Positive:* I got a review that said a plot point was "done more skillfully here than by JKR herself, I think". That was really nice to read, although I would definitely not throw something like that around a lot unless you mean it.\\
I also love when someone notices small, subtle hints or analogies I put in thinking nobody would get. That makes me really feel like readers are reading between the lines and thinking about what I write.

*Negative:* I haven't really gotten any negative reviews, but if I had a boggart, it would take the form of a review that told me my ideas were unrealistic or tried to find plot holes. But then again, that's more related to my fear of failing as a writer. Hmmm... other than outright mean reviews, I also wouldn't want to see one that said "so and so isn't gay". If I cared, I wouldn't be writing the story!

** I got told once my story was "literally unreadable" due to the fact that I had a brain fart and called Tonks Mrs Tonks. Tbh there is no such thing as a bad review. That review gave me an error to fix even if the way it was presented to me was a bit silly.

** I like the ones where I get to hear the person's thoughts and they ramble on why they liked something or why they hated something and I actually understand /why/. I also like hearing their favorite parts and its especially better if they quote sentences from the story. Ones that take the time to thank the author for updating is really nice too.

I don't like reviews that are just like "pls update!" when I just updated two hours ago and update frequently because it feels so demanding. I mean Im glad you're eager, but telling me to update when I just did isn't really that fun to hear.. I /do. have a life you know.
