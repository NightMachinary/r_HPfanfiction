Looking for fics in which Harry can fly unassisted like Voldemort.


** There is a part of the end battle in “honour thy blood” where it looks like to others that he is flying unassisted if that helps

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
