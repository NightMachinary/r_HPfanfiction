** I'm trying to write a story of me as Harry's twin. I have the outline done but haven't started writing it out yet, but basically what happens is that Pettigrew gets found out immediately and half the Horcruxes are destroyed before first year is over. Oh, and Quirrelmort gets a nasty surprise when trying to get the Philosopher's stone.
