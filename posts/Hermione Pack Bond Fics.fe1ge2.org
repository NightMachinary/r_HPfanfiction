I recently read the W.I.P. ‚ÄúUsed To Be Mine‚Äù by Kittenshift17 and I loved it!

Hermione starts learning to become an Animagus and she starts getting canine tendencies, and it's really cute because she has this sense that Remus, Sirius, and Tonks are in a bad mood, and she makes them tea and senses that they're all part of Pack, and she rubs her cheek against all of theirs as a cute little Pack Bond action as she gives them all their tea.

It's also a time travel fic, so Hermione was added into pack in the 70s and even though the present Hermione hasn't been bitten into the pack yet, she still smells like it and has a draw to Remus and Sirius.

I don't need a time travel fic, I'd love it if it took place during canon, or if it did something like this fic, where it's part in the present and also part in the past.

I'm down for a triad fic between Hermione/Sirius/Remus, but also cool with Hermione and Remus only or Hermione and Sirius only.

I'm just looking for a fic where she gets this draw to Remus and Sirius because she's destined part of the pack, whether it's because she gets bitten by a werewolf, or is an animagus, or just as a human, and they all do these cute little involuntary canine interactions with each other.

I also read ‚ÄúTethered‚Äù (another W.I.P by Kittenshift17,) and loved how Hermione started getting werewolf tendencies and how she was linked to Remus and all of that.

Sorry this was so long!

TL;DR: Looking for some fic recs where Hermione is part of the pack with Remus and Sirius, and theres cute little scenes that show how their bond affects their interactions and stuff! During canon or present day preferably!

Edit: I've read Debt of Time! It's one of my favs and I was super happy when I found Used to be Mine!


** This sounds a lot like The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie (it's on both AO3 and FFnet). Hermione is also a time traveler who grew up with the marauders, but she doesn't know it yet while they remember her.

Sorry, I don't have any other suggestion.

** This is one of my favorite tear-jerker long stories that may meet your criteria.

*** Is there a HEA? I'm fine with tear jerkers as long as it's somewhat happy at the end ;)

**** The epilogue isn't sad per se, and could easily be considered a HEA story, I'm just a crybaby lol. The bulk of the fic is not really a tear jerker and is a good read.
