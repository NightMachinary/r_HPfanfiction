I am looking for a particular story that i think was written by the author krytos, but the author profile seems to have been deleted.

I was looking for a particular story in which Harry is transported into a body of another Harry in another universe, in the new universe his parents are still alive and he is bethored to Daphne Greengrass. But the old Harry was still dating Ginny, after the new Harry was transported to this universe he dumps Ginny and even has a fight with Voldemort. I think he was a lord of grey or something like that. The title also was something like lord grey.

Does anyone have a copy of the fic?

And btw i remember there being a website that automatically makes copy of the stories in fanfiction.net and stores it so that even if the story is deleted in fanfiction.net that website would have the story. Anyone know the website?

*** Yup that is the website.

But that is not the story. He was only bethored to Daphne. I am pretty sure there was not any multi pairing
