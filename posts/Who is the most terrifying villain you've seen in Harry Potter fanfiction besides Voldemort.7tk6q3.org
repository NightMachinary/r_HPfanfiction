As the title says, which non-Voldemort villain scared you the most?


** In the fanfic The Prince of Slytherin, there was a Death Eater with a small role. He basically cursed child toys with dark magic and mailed it to muggles and wizards alike.

I can't remember the character's name, but I vividly remember the scene when one of his 'toys', a small model train, activated and proceeded to slither into people's bodies and kill them.

Some messed up shit, man. But a hella cool design too!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus; Animagus at War) There is a /quartet/ of Dark Lords/Ladies, and Voldemort is only one of them. The other three are:

La Pantera: The Dark Lady of Veracruz, casts magic with daggers made of obsidian and bone, and can create new rituals at the drop of a hat. She is the one who performs the ritual to restore Voldemort, which gives him fire powers as a bonus.

Kinani Ngeze: Used the Rwandan Genocide the same way Grindelwald used WWII, and had a full-grown Nundu as a weapon. It took Dumbledore and another wizard with equal power to defeat him, and /then/ he joined Voldemort.

Jugashvili: The Dark Lord of Leningrad. Two words: Evil. /Seer/. He also has ways of keeping other Seers from seeing him, or making them pay for it.

** Delores Umbridge

Can't remember what story it was, unfortunately, but she takes over the ministry before 4th year by assassinating Fudge, then goes full tyrant. She prints all the propaganda to make people believe that muggleborns are actually a problem in their society, and when Voldemort is resurrected she starts committing acts of terrorism and assassinations against her own populace and blaming it on him or Dumbledore.

[[/spoiler][Eventually, once Voldemort is defeated she becomes the main villain of the story and we find out later that she has actually set up work camps for muggles, muggleborns and political opponents, that the dead are then turned into inferi to use as a terrorism tool.]]

It was really dark at times.

***** Particularly evil, then, compared to his canon counterpart? Anything can be well-written, but I'm not sure I'm really that eager to see that. Pettigrew strikes me as a rare example in HP of a sympathetic villain who is /still/ a villain (where all other "tragic" antagonists end up redeemed, be it Regulus, Snape or even the Malfoys), making him an unrepentant manipulator seems to be missing the point of his character. ...What did this Pettigrew /do/ (since I believe /PoS/ is a heavy AU)?

The main premise for the fic is that he willingly betrays the Potters and yet all of them survive. So he rushes to the scene when they are all incapacitated(before Hagrid or Sirius or anyone else can show up) and fixes things up in a way to frame Sirius and enact some long term plot relevant plans.

And while Lucius didn't /do/ anything to seal his switch on-screen in the books, he defected from the DEs at the tail-end of the Battle, and subsequently helped the Aurors round up the remaining Death Eaters in the months following the Battle.

According to Rowling, all this allowed the Malfoys to "weasel out" of punishment again after the BoH.

** Peter Pettigrew, because they trusted him and thought of him as a friend. Sirius placed his friends lifes in his hands and he did the most horrific betrayal.

Actually, I made a list: Most stylish and foppish villain: Lucius.

Most misunderstood villain: Snape.

Most boring villain: Umbridge

Most disgusting villain: Greyback

Feel free to add...

Perhaps: most adorable villain?

/What?/ Umbridge was a fantastically entertaining villain. I mean, obviously we're talking about opinions here, but you'd be the first person I've ever heard say she was /boring/.

**** I'm going along the lines of Hannah Arendt and the banality of evil. Since the regime under Voldemort looked a lot like the Third Reich, I'd apply it here. Umbridge is banal in her liking kitschy things (kitten on china) and in making burocracy working for her.

**** i mean, was she? most people claim that she was an effective and coherent villain, but that doesn't make her an interesting one. i'd imagine if she was, there'd be more fanfiction about her, or that includes her

***** There are plenty of fics which include Umbridge. There are probably more fics with Umbridge as a main antagonist as any other side character in the HP universe.
