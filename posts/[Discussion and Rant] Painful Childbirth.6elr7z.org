I'm getting increasingly annoyed by fanfic references of painful childbirth, and "witches yelling to curse their husbands". Apparently, these writers have never witnessed or experienced what are really happening during childbirth in modern times, or they learned from hopelessly outdated information about this topic.

I've never seen a single fic mentioning the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural_administration][Epidural Procedure]], where the woman do not feel any pain but still maintain her muscle strength during the labor. When my wife gave birth to our first child more than 10 years ago, she initially wanted to toughen it out, but the first contraction quickly changed her mind. Luckily she did that because she had spent a total of 12 hours in labor. With Epidural removing the pain, she was actually able to get 8 hours of sleep.

When I went to work in China as an expat later, several of my colleagues had given births during my time there. Without exception, all of them chose the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section][Caesarian Section]]. I also happened to learn that 85% of births in China are Caesarean, and higher in cities. Of course, this procedure has the disadvantage of longer recovery time, and the woman is no longer advisable to try vaginal birth.

So, these examples lead me to believe that Wizards, with their high demand for personal comfort, would have developed painless means of childbirth long ago. Canon has never mentioned about this matter at all. I think those fanfic writers who insist on writing about how difficult Ginny, Hermione, Fleur, and etc have with their first labor are either ignorant or just trying to manufacture drama.


** A few things - firstly, your wife was lucky. Epidurals don't always eliminate all pain though they do heavily reduce it. I agree that it is likely that there are magical equivalents to epidurals.

But secondly, and most importantly, you've touched on something quite complex and that is different cultural attitudes to childbirth. I'm going to be long and boring here - my university dissertation was on traditional childbirth practices.

You're right that in modern China, c-sections are completely considered the norm. Childbirth is heavily medicialised, with a move away from traditional and natural practices and a heavy emphasis of doctors over midwives. In the US, c-sections and epidurals are also at an unusually high rate, but not as high as China, Singapore, etc. Amusingly, one of my participants from Singapore said she was having a c-section and choosing not to breastfeed because that's how they do it in the west. One of my British participants was going full hippy natural because "that's how they do it in Asia."

In European countries, particularly here in Britain, there is a greater emphasis on midwife led childbirth. While obviously epidurals are available, many mothers report a social pressure to "experience" Childbirth naturally, though like your wife they often quickly change their mind. However doctors and c-sections only occur if there's a problem, unless you go private, but there's a bit of a stigma against it.

Even the position women go into varies from culture to culture. British and American fanfic writers have the screaming, angry woman on her back, husband gripping her hand and healer between her legs. The World Health Organisation is very clear that this is a dangerous position for the woman to five birth in. It was developed as part of the medicalisation of Childbirth to give doctors better access, but makes things harder and more painful for the woman. They recommend squatting or on all fours, as was the historic norm. But most people writing fanfic won't have experienced that - they'll have seen birth in films, or maybe even educational videos - but the position is still the same. In addition, historically pain in Childbirth is associated with the punishment of Eve, so there's an assumption that women SHOULD suffer and that the purest births are painful and traumatic - it feeds into the idea of the self sacrificing mother after all. From a western perspective, it quickly becomes clear why women start to compete over who had the most natural, longest birth, to the point where they may even shun women who had elective c-sections. There are positives and negatives to both attitudes and all in between.

For fanfic writers, especially ones who write about Childbirth, the romanticised version of a traumatic birth with bloody sheets is probably all they have seen on TV, and it immediately turns their female character into a good mother. Logically we know this is ridiculous - by that point it's not like there's any choice in the matter - but it's become so expected that women go through agony that if they didn't, it would seem like they weren't doing it properly.

** My headcanon is that childbirth is equally simplified by magic as healing a bone, for example. Its basically "Oh, shit, my water broke" a quick trip through the Floo and an hour later you leave St. Mungos with a baby in one hand and some potions to get your intestines back in place in the other - all without any pain or possible complications.

*** That's really interesting. I remember that Rowling said at one point, that wizards can heal any common injuries and only hve poblems with magically inflicted ones. I never thought about it, but childbirth does belong in the former category.

My headcanon was always that the mothers magic goes a little crazy during pregnancy, due to an instinctual need to protect the child, thus making it hard or downright impossible to magically intefere with it.

**** I'm with this, to some extent. Healers would probably be reticent to use spells or ingested potions on the mother, since the effect might also include the baby. There may be some salves appropriate to lubricating the exit procedure, and I could see an equivalent of the epidural being some tightly-targeted spell; a Torpeo to numb the spine below a certain point.

I think it's worth noting that midwives were accused of being witches around the time of the Statute of Secrecy being implemented. I'm thinking about a way to work that into a story somehow.

** The school nurse can regrow your bones overnight. If there isn't some sort of "apparate the baby out" option for childbirth I would be very surprised.

*** Hell, just cast that space-expansion charm on the woman's reproductive system and the baby would just slide right out.

Actually, now that I think about it, they could hypothetically cast that on the uterus during the pregnancy to keep their slim figures even while pregnant. Infinite room for the baby to grow as well.

** Ugh, I hate it when authors make their women in childbirth so the whole "You did this to me, I hate you!" thing to their husband's. Maybe it's just because mine was quick and easy, but I didn't feel like this at all. Does anyone have an experience irl, or is this just a common literary trope?

*** There's a British TV programme called One Born Every Minute where they film a maternity ward. There is a particularly amusing clip of a woman saying to her husband "I can't believe what you've done to me," and his response, perfectly deadpan, is "don't look at me, I wanted a dog."

*** It probably happens to some people, because whatever you choose you are likely to find /someone/ doing it no matter how unlikely it is. So it likely happened at least once.

That said, all in all I think that outside of exceptions it's just a common literary trope, most likely stemming from the fact that for one people might find it funny (well, well played it can be) and for two at least in USA c-sections are fairly prevalent so people might very well have over time gotten used to the idea that normal childbirth is unbearably painful no matter what (because common sense says people wouldn't get their bodies cut for no reason ... which actually is what happens at least sometimes).

** Well I'd not surprised if backwards Magical Society has never heard of an Epidural, but their healing capabilities seem quite advanced, I'd expect them to offer something with similar effects.

This is actually the field where I'd expect their superiority complex to stem from. In my headcanon problems with childbirth (like the mother dying) are unheard of in magical society.

** Like someone else said, epidurals aren't always foolproof.

For starters, there's all the contractions you have to deal with before you get the epidural. With my first, I had to walk the halls to progress further before they'd give me the epidural. I remember developing homicidal feelings towards that nurse. But I walked, squeezing my husband's hand until I thought I might break it, and after about an hour the epidural was in and I felt nothing but pressure. Even when pushing, I didn't feel much.

With my second, I was /miserable/. I didn't walk, but I did bend over a lot with the bed as support during contractions, and also sat on a birthing ball. I got to a point where it was just too much, but I hadn't progressed enough yet for the epidural, so I got IV pain meds. That took the edge off a bit, but not a lot.

At my hospital (not sure if it's a growing trend throughout the US or not) they changed up the epidurals a bit. It's a different dosage, and they put them in a bit higher. So I still had the pressure, but when it came time to push I felt a lot more, thus making it much more effective. I only pushed for 12 minutes.

Never cursed my husband though. But I was a little annoyed that with both I never had enough time to watch a movie.

** That's interesting, because I mentioned an epidural procedure in one of my stories, but it was a muggleborn lamenting the fact that wizards didn't have one. I figure as with so many things, wizards are big time traditionalists. They might give you pain relieving potions, but at least my own experience with that kind of thing leads me to believe that pain relief only takes the edge off of such things (though I've only had rocks, not babies). I imagine that wizards and witches probably do have something to help with childbirth, but that doesn't automatically make it pleasant. Even C-Sections and epidurals are still loaded with problems as you mentioned.
