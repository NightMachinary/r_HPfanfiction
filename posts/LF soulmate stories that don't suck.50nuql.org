I'm a fan of the soulmate trope, but I've only ever seen a handful of stories that had interesting concepts surrounding what a soulmate/soul bond is. Most of the time the story or concept just isn't good--anyone have any recommendations? :)


** linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) is the only soul bond story I've read that I think is worth reading.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

#+begin_quote
  Imagine a world of soulmarks where it is not your soulmate's first spoken words to you, but instead the first spoken worlds of someone who would make a great mark on your soul. It could be anyone: a friend, a relative, a coworker, a lover, an enemy, a person who complimented you at an airport and you never saw them again. Some people have no marks at all; some people have more than they can count with all their fingers and toes; but most people have one -- for someone who marked their life and soul beyond any point of return.

Probably not exactly what you were looking for, but I found the premise interesting and refreshing. The way soulmarks work in that story is certainly unique and the writing itself is quite good.

  A soulmarks universe one-shot that traverses the entire series. Harry Potter is born with the words "Avada Kedavra" written over his heart. The world is different, but the story is the same.

** linkffn (The Price of Love) is my favorite - possibly favorite fic, period. It's not as explicit as some others, as the soul bond isn't the entire focus of the story throughout. Also, it's Ron/Hermione, instead of the usual Harry/Ginny, though there is some mention of them.

Edit: apparently I linked the wrong fic. It's definitely Harry Potter, by RogueSugah.

  Hermione & Ron spend the summer together, but the closer they get, the harder it becomes to share her secret plan even though she must. If love really is stronger than hate, as she believes, their feelings for each other may be enough to save them all.

***** Well, and that is why it's preferable to use the ID number. I've seen the bot pull some really weird stuff when the names were used.

Once, I think I saw it pull three stories (out of three requests in a post) with names different from the requested ones and about a completely different series. It was hilarious, in a way.

Starts in sixth year, AU in that Harry was raised by Sirius and didn't come to Hogwarts until he was 16. Specifically to meet his soulmate. Not an insta-bond, not immediately in love, either (though, immediate attraction and rather rapid relationship development, but not unbelievably so). Pretty awesome Dumbledore and McGonagall.
