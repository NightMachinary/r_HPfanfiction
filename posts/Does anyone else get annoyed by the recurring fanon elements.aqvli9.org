******* Thing about OCs in fanfiction, they often fit the purpose of their being there too easily, and they fit that niche so much that they lack actual character aside from being a plot device, self-insert, background character, etc. plus they're likely to understand the things the readers understand too easily, instead of getting wrapped up in their own theories and experiences and such.

They're by no means an inherently bad thing, after all pretty much every character in an original fictional work is an OC. But in fanfiction they're not often handled well.

Limitations being imposed on the writer are an important thing, at least for narrative tension. In order for conflict to be resolved in a satisfying way, the readers must already understand the thing that's used to solve it. In fanfiction you can skip some of the steps setting it up, but if you change those rules you can't use the readers' pre-existing knowledge of the world.

** Well, "Malfoy Manor" is canon. And "Lions" was used in the books for Gryffondors ("Lions, get the cup!"). And "wards" is just another word for "permanent magical protections". The idea that wizard homes aren't protected would be a much bigger turnoff for me.

**** Magical protections don't play much of a role in canon - the trio's inside Hogwarts for the majority of the books, and they never have to deal with breaking through magical protections, unless you count Gringotts. Dumbledore does the heavy lifting in the cave, for example.

In fanfiction stories where you have to break into manors and homes, or have to defend them, of course, protections would come up more often. Same if you want to protect your trunk.

With regards to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_house#Naming][naming conventions for manors]], it certainly isn't wrong to follow the Malfoy example since that's a real convention, if not the only one and a more modern one - but it's the only example of a manor named in canon.

There's a few issues wrapped up with 'wards'.

- Things that aren't wards are turned into wards. The blood protection, fidelius charm, etc.
- The mechanics of wards. This is the real crux of the issue. The mechanics don't align with the mechanics of canon. That's okay, but when those same mechanics are used in so many other places, it becomes tedious.

************** Well, We have spells who can kill, we have spells who can vanish dead bodies - use those two in sequence, and you have a canon way to "disintegrate" someone. Shield Charms are canon as well, so force fields are possible. So, canonically, a trap or ward which does that shouldn't be impossible. That authors choose to add some runestone as requirement, and don't allow it to be cast with just a wand, doesn't seem really out of place either.

I don't really see the problem there. Of course, it's a little boring if everything does the same thing - but on the other hand, it's also logical that if something works, people keep doing it.

How to protect a home from intruders has been a core question in my latest major story, so I've given that quite some thought - and even while striving for variety so not every house has the same defences, there are some things every house defence had in common: A way to identify those who are allowed to enter, a way to keep those who aren't allowed in out, and a way to alert the owner if someone tries to break in. Assuming that the walls are magically protected so a wizard cannot simply transfigure or vanish them, or create a hole in them, isn't much better where variety is concerned. And without "force fields" you need to find reasons why someone wouldn't simply cast Fiendfyre from a broom high above the manor, for example.

And, honestly, if an author isn't writing, like I was, a story which focuses on breaking into heavily guarded manors, then simply using "wards" as a shorthand to explain why this or that location hasn't been destroyed or plundered is a smart choice instead of making up half a dozen different defences or simply ignoring the whole thing.

** I honestly rather like political elements in HP fanfiction provided they're not one sided and different factions can have legitimate, agreeable points even if you are generally against that faction. For example, the Accidental Animagus has two big political events where the Wizengamot votes for a new law for Muggle protection and another one for Werewolf rights.

In the first one, I believe it was Mr. Nott Senior for the "pureblood faction" that went on about how Muggles are ruining the environment and how their own scientists even say it, yet nothing is being done about it. He goes at length describing the problem, the consequences, and the overall complacency that the Muggles appear to have towards such a glaring issue. When I read it the first time, it caught me off guard how, while still with clear fascist undertones, factual the speech was. It wasn't just sprouting some anti-muggle stuff out of a misguided, unproven conception that wizards were superior, but it also tied in actual consideration and research into muggles and using their own information against them.

Now, with the werewolf one, something similar happens, but I'd rather focus on another aspect that made me enjoy those scenes. There was a rather discriminating overhaul of the law presented against werewolves. Andromeda Tonks, that at the time holds Harry's seat in the Wizengamot on his behalf until he comes of age, helped Harry, Sirius, and Remus devise a counter plan. There's a lot of back and forth between the press and the various gatherings. These events eventually lead to the realisation that they can't win it with their current plan, so they do some concessions and revise it. And even then it's still on the edge whether or not they can get their version approved.

I think politics can work to make the world feel larger and more lived in and I especially enjoy it when there's an actual struggle to it. Sure, it's annoying when suddenly everything changes just because the Boy Who Lived took up his seat in the Wizengamot and nearly everyone just does what their great hero and saviour says. I wouldn't like those stories at all, either, but I don't think that that means politics in a HP fanfic are always a bad thing. And I also think that sometimes discussing or thinking about politics as children, especially between the ages of 11 - 18, is great. In my country (western Europe located) kids get encouraged to think, discuss, and write about it and find out what they find important. If you have a werewolf acquintance, it doesn't matter how old you are, you're going to worry if it becomes likely that their lives are being threatened.

The same goes for wards or other fields of (mostly) unexplored magic. I especially enjoy it when it comes on a more international level. I think it's perfectly reasonable that magic from, say Spain, can have a couple different branches than the UK. This is even more so when different continents get into play. I'm not too familiar with the other tropes, though.

In the end, rational discussion can be had and everyone should agree that it is not a good idea demand that mixed mugle and wizard kids PE class has mandatory broom riding and quidditch games in the name of /insert buzzword/.

Well, that depends on what you define as superior. Yes, magic is cool and handy and wizards usually live longer. However, their culture and traditions are obviously still very flawed. The majority doesn't want to adapt to modern times and won't consider anything the Muggles do possibly valuable even though the Muggles' new/growing perspective, especially in our age and time, could give wizards new insights as well. In the original books, and even in the Fantastic Beasts movies and some of the Pottermore articles, this conservative attitude is the norm. McGonagall is said (on Pottermore) to have quit her job at the Ministry because of their low views towards Muggles while she herself was a half blood with a Muggle father. Even wizards that find Muggles worth more consideration, like Arthur Weasley and Professor Burbage (from Muggle Studies) have a hard time understanding Muggles. Physically speaking, I agree that wizards are superior, but intellectually they're not better than Muggles. They should open that debate, that you also mention, and recognise each others strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of wizards, even those that are not obsessed with blood purity, don't want to have that debate any more than that the majority of people in our world are willing to calmly discuss the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity.

*** Thing is, these elements are ubiquitous in almost any fanfiction. They don't bother me because I don't like politics, they annoy me because aside from whoever first came up with these ideas they're unoriginal. Almost every fanfic recycles so many elements that they become difficult to read.

The best fanfics keep almost everything the same, until a point where it diverges, or explore some aspect of the original story that hadn't been considered.

7/10 works mention wards, when they were barely in the books, if at all. Many of these changes are implemented lazily, and raise far more questions than they answer.

**** I think that's more just bad writing (or perhaps just novice/inexperienced writing) in general rather than that there's anything wrong with the idea or trope. Sure, any story will have a couple flaws, but I think most tropes will simply work well when it's clear that a lot of thought and consideration went into them.

But that's also the wonder of fanfiction in general. You can get super hyped about an idea that someone else came up with and just get very eager to try something similar yourself. Even if perhaps it doesn't have a place in your fanfic or when it doesn't go well with some of the other tropes. It happens. We all make mistakes and we can all learn from them.

I also don't think that the best fanfics are those that are the most canon compliant. Personally I prefer canon divergence fanfics, but that doesn't mean that an AU can't be an excellent work of fanfiction, too. Besides, canon divergence can be a very broad term already, especially for vast fandom verses like Harry Potter. I want the HP fanfics that I read to add more depth to the HP world, be that by adding more nuance to the cultures, heated politics, exploration of art, high school dynamics, world magics or magics that aren't very well explored in the books, a focus on Quidditch and/or other wizarding sports, or pretty much anything else.

I also prefer it when the characterization at least starts out in what I would expect of that character from canon. Naturally, I would expect something different from a 7 year old Harry than that I would from a 15 year old Harry. From there, I'm perfectly okay with a character building up and then doing a literal 180 /if/ the events that play out in the story make it plausible. Like Draco being an absolute prick in the first three years and then having a year of self reflection and doubt so that in year 5 or year 6 he might be more of a "good" character. Works for anyone, Draco was just an easy example right now.

However, for other fandoms I've read AU and I've read fanfic where characters are quite different from their canon characterization to the point where they had entire new personalities and relationships. Sometimes the AU was in a very different world, but with mostly canon characterization, sometimes the characters were very different in their own world, but something went different that had a large impact which affected them all to grow up and develop differently. They can still be enjoyable reads, especially if you're into that kind of thing, and that's okay. It's just not where my personal preference lies.

You are free dislike anything to do with politics, no matter how they are done, and that's fine. There are thousands of Harry Potter fics out there and yes, it can be hard to find one that you like, but I think just shutting down so many tropes also limits you and denies you a potential to be amazed by what people might do with an idea. I never thought I would like an apocalypse story. Yet my favourite Supernatural fanfic is exactly that. :)

***** For me, I think a good work will almost always only be different to the source material in one (possibly two or over, but the more the worse) way.

This can be a tweak to the setting, adding a character, being set in a different work, emphasising dark elements, changing how magic works, changing a character in a fundamental way, an event that never happened in canon, etc. but from there any other changes should happen as a result of the first one.

We don't even have to know what the inciting element is, or what its consequences are yet. Some of the fun of some stories is finding out what else is different now that that one thing has changed. The more logical and self consistent it is, the more fascinating.

There is of course also room for a change in tone, adding in elements where there are gaps, but they should fit. Now that Voldemort is a mongoose, it's natural for the rest of the story to be funnier, and it makes sense for the fact that there are snakes hidden in the Slytherin common room to come up now.

For these fanon elements, almost always nothing ever comes of them, and they aren't done in isolation. Suspension of disbelief in fan works has to also hinge on the source material.

I don't hate politics, or even universally hate the way they're done.

But no matter how well-written a story is, if the premise is that Harry Potter is now a red-headed girl who was Salazar's descendant and Hermione is a dog animagus, in a world that overlaps with Anne of Green Gables, then the story is almost certainly bad.

Likewise, if you have too many fanon elements, it becomes more and more likely it's too tedious to read.

** I don't mind one or two fanon things in fanfiction. The concepts of "wards" was never a canon element, but I like them, as long as they're explored well and not OP.

I only have a problem with (and drop stories) if they completely run on fanon, and there's nothing of the original HP style or universe left. By that point, the story has become a Self Insert Gamer fic, where Indie!Harry treats everyone else like NPC's while he collects a harem. That's not why I like Harry Potter. That's not what I want to see in Harry Potter fanfiction.

I made a [[https://i.imgur.com/2xMtG9x.jpg][*HP fanfic cliche bingo card*]] that lists all my least favorite fanon tropes just so I could tell when it was time to drop a fic. Note: These apply mostly to Indie!Harry fics, which are an incredibly popular subgenre on FFN and here.

Though I will insta-drop if I see "Mother Magick" or "So Mote it Be" anywhere in a fic. I can't stand that shit.

yes and no... wards were never called such in the series. But the general concept of "magical defences that are tied to a location on a semi-permanent basis" certainly is canon. Hogwarts has magical defences that are basically wards in all but name.

**** By "concept of wards", I meant the fanon use of the word itself, and all the extra details that are commonly associated with them. That's the use of ancient runes in casting wards, runestones, leylines, pagan rituals, spilling literal blood on a magical site to set the location, and tying them into charmed objects so that Dumbledore can look at the doodads on his desk and yell "The Blood Wards are falling!" when Harry leaves Number Four to go on indie adventures.

The book version of wards calls them "enchantments" or "defenses" and has nowhere near as much detail as fanon has.

***** To be fair, the books suffer a lot from the "Harry is an unreliable narrator (as well as an idiot)" problem.

Magic is never explained in the books, like ever. We don't know how anything related to magic works because the books never tell us.

- We know that wand movements and pronunciation is important (until they aren't in the later books)
- We know enchanted items exist, but not how they are made because Harry never bothered to find out.
- We know some wizards can turn into animals but we never learn how being an animagus works because Harry couldn't be bothered with it.
- Potions is little more than following directions from a cookbook where a single counterclockwise stir instead of a clockwise one can destroy everything. Unless you are Snape, then just change the entire recipe without consequences. We also don't know how this works or why.
- ...

This works great when you are writing a mystery novel fairy tale where the magic is merely a backdrop setting, but in a more adult setting where you need some hard fantasy you need to either extrapolate on what we do know or borrow from other works.

  He had suspected the lying since his 2nd year, though always dismissing it as paranoia, but now he had be told by them man himself, Dumble-fuck had confirmed his worries and still asked him “Can you still trust me?” in his most grandfatherly, and sickeningly "kind" voice.

Its stated in the books, he had a catflap that a single can of soup was passed through, that as a child he was frequently sent to his "room" without food, and that petunia hit him with a frying pan.

Children were often sent to bed without food, and it's actually quite difficult to develop severe malnutrition unless you're being very, very badly mistreated or regularly lacking specific nutrients in your diet.

Petunia did once swat him with a flying pan (also during his second year) but there's no indication that beatings were a regular occurrence.

Secondly, the fact that the Dursleys abuse Harry is unquestionable. Even Dumbledore admits that Harry was malnutritioned when he came to Hogwarts in the OotP confrontation. And Harry is intoduced as shorter than anyone his age.

And lastly, you can easily bash someone to death with a frying pan. There are countless cases if you google something like "frying pan murder". All it takes is one solid hit. So Petunia's attempt easily counts as attempted assault and child abuse.

This one depends for me, Harry was completely stupid, he was a teenager and teenagers do tend to be rather stupid, but he's a part of the reason why Voldemort has to go down, if Dumbledore was slightly (Not overly so; but slightly) more open with Harry with some things, he (might) not have done so many stupid things outside of not knowing things.

I personally really like certain ideas, depending on how they're written. The whole idea of fanon is using canon ideas and expanding them, or using a quote or something and bringing forward a new idea, or the like.

Stuff like Children politics and the like are definitely irksome and unbelievable, but there are good stories out there that utilize something from canon, and make it their own fanon thing quite well. (IMO).

Horcruxes are particularly hard to find, and they're meant to be. If goblins could easily find them, then Voldemort would never have given one to them, and if they could be easily removed without damaging Harry, then Dumbledore would have found a way.

I'd thought Malfoy Manor was made up by fanon, and it was, but apparently JK Rowling did use it afterwards. All the other '[Wealthy Pureblood] Manor's are apparently made up though.

In fanon, 'Champion of the Light', and such are tossed about, even though that's not done in canon, to say nothing of what that would say about the opinions of society.

Dumbledore certainly stopped spouting that slogan, and was certainly quite remorseful about the things that he felt he still had to do.

Yeah, all of that is ridiculous, though the having Sirius be set free isn't. I don't know if Rowling never thought of this or what, but why didn't Harry and co use a Pensive and stuff to show that hey Pettigrew is alive and Sirius is innocent?

It definitely /is/ documented that being malnourished can lead to stunted growth, so I'm not arguing with you. The continuing short thing comes from Daniel Radcliffe, I think, since in the books it is mentioned that Harry is an average/bit tall height by book 5 or 6.

I'd have to double-check, but I believe he's described as being rather small and skinny for his age at least once in the first couple of books. Whether or not this is attributable to having been forced to live and sleep in a closet for the better part of ten years is ambiguous.

*** I was more talking about seats on the Wizengamot being inherited, not them being talked about.

Animal description isn't a bad thing, it's just that Gryffindors keep getting called 'lions', Slytherins 'Snakes', etc. by almost everyone when nobody does it in canon.

Nowhere is called 'Malfoy Manor' or 'Potter Manor' or 'Black Manor' in the books, and nowhere is suggested that old pureblood families all have mansions.

I don't mind the factions themselves as much as them being explicitly called Light and Dark.

The Goblet of Fire thing wouldn't have been so bad if so many people hadn't done it. But it raises questions too, like: "If you can strip people of their magic, why don't they do that to literally anyone, including criminals?"

In so many stories do we find out that Harry's huge pile of gold is a 'trust fund', and in actuality he has a family one, the Black one (nevermind he never inherited anything Black in the books until Sirius died), the Riddle one...

Merlin's expressions are often of a different nature in fanfiction though, you get things like "Merlin only knows" which sets him up as kind of a god figure despite him having been a student at the school they are currently attending. 'Merlin's Beard' is the kind of old-timey expression that they might have used for great heroes, and Merlin's pants was a Hermione-original.

In the original the threat is intentionally kept vague and ultimately relies on people believing there to be a threat to work (and on children trusting adults to know what they're talking about and be telling the truth). Fanfiction like to throw out all that in favour of any spurious claim to be taken as a fact set in stone because it would take too much forethought from the author to make their "idea" work without such railroading.

Exhaustion, if it's a thing, would preferably be something to do with the strain of having to use that much. Though the books are ambiguous on that topic, and there are many possible interpretations.

It's just one, fairly bland, interpretation that's taken as a given, and mainly used to either shoehorn in an explanation to why things are happening the way they should be happening (mainly solving conflicts rather than creating them, which reeks of deus ex machina) or bragging about/using as a way to big up a character.

** Interesting discussion here. I think some of the things you mentioned are interesting, some are annoying. I've seen some of these used very well.

So, to trail off on a sidebar, I used to be very into FanFiction during the long summer before OotP when almost none of these things were things, and now, as I've rediscovered fanfic in the last few years, I'm noticing a lot of these things - ie, Lord Potter, Lord Black, Harry/Daphne, manipulative Dumbledore, Wizengamot politics....

I think it's very interesting how lots and lots of different authors use these same concepts across their stories. Wizengamot politics is particularly interesting, if well done. Actually a lot of these are interesting, if well done, and you don't come across them in story, after story, after story.

Abusive Dursleys... that one was always popular and I don't even know that that is so much fanon, considering they practically starved Harry in CoS. Interestingly, rereading HP as an adult now they seem a hell of a lot more canon abusive than they did 15 years ago when I was like, “Oh he lives in a cupboard. That sucks.” Now I'm like, “He lived in a cupboard? WTF??” I mean that is seriously child abuse, how they treated him.

As mentioned above, JKR didn't give us a lot of info on how a lot of things in her world worked. Probably that was intentional. It leaves a lot of holes, and it's fun for us now to fill them in. I think it's OK to do that.

But yes, I do get really annoyed by some of these elements if they are not done well!

Yeah, good point. Harry's treatment is filtered through the eyes of a child, they're not likely to get that angry if they haven't known any better.

It is child abuse, no matter which way you look at it. But it's taken for granted in a lot of stories that he was regularly getting beaten and was malnourished, and such, when that's not /quite/ true.

**** True, I suppose. I don't know where the inherited seats idea came from at all - I would actually hope you get elected to the Wizengamot or some such. Though I can see why this may be a thing, with so much importance still placed in pure blood mania.

Back to the Dursleys for a minute - I think the starving might be getting picked out from comments like, say, Molly constantly telling Harry he looks skinny or underfed when he comes over. And again, what happened in CoS, the diet in GoF. And I did get the impression that they were hitting him occasionally at least - like in CoS I believe he said he had to “duck Petunia's soapy frying pan” or something like that. Which she would do so casually? Just for him pretending to do magic? That implies a familiarity with doing so. And in OotP, Vernon did grab Harry around the neck in the beginning. Now I wouldn't say they were just constantly beating the crap out of him nonstop, but I can definitely see where that idea would come from, and I don't even think it's a big stretch of the canon. In fact, I think JKR kind of introduces it and skates over it and by the end of DH, the Dursleys become a bit of a joke - like compared to Voldemort, what are they, really? They're silly! I don't think they're silly at all! I think they're terrible, abusive caregivers!

I suppose people are spending a lot of time reading fanfics and getting inspiration from that for their own. I guess it's understandable. I haven't actually used any of these things in my stories, I don't think, except the use of “wards” which I realized after I read your initial post. But I'm not actually sure why I used that word, I think it's just a word that sounds cool, and also, I've been reading a lot of Dresden Files, must have borrowed it. XD

If you want to point out what terrible human beings the Dursleys are, it's just lazy to make out that it was even worse than it actually was.

Petunia may not have meant to actually hit him, though if it did I doubt she would have hit him hard, otherwise it would have come up before. In OotP there's just been a noise like a gunshot, and Vernon's getting him back inside to hide him from the neighbours.

But yeah, fair enough comment all round. It's not a stretch by any means to imagine the Dursleys giving him the occasional session of physical abuse.

  Merlin being used as blasphemy beyond things like 'Merlin's Beard'
#+end_quote

The worst fics have muggle-borns (like Hermione) using "Merlin" as an expletive immediately after they enter the magical world. That's not how it works. Nobody replaces familiar expletives (like "Oh God") they have used for /years/ with different ones from a new culture they haven't even heard about before. Often "Merlin" is used in places where it would not be natural to use an expletive.

  Harry had his wand out ready to do something drastic when he noticed Hermione worming her way into the space beneath the stands.

  "Merlin," he muttered, "she's too clever for her own good."
#+end_quote

(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes by sunmoonandstars)

First of all, Harry had been in the magical world for just a few months. He wouldn't have used "Merlin" as an expletive. Second, it's not a good place to have an expletive at all. It feels forced. It feels as if the author is just reminding everyone that it's a different world than we're used to.

Another unnecessary fanon element is /spinning portkeys/. It was used /once/ by Bobmin as a plot device, and afterwards it turned up everywhere by authors that obviously had read Bobmin's fic. Floo spins, portkeys pull, apparition squeezes.

Even Rowling messed that one up. Draco Malfoy, pureblood that he is, uses God rather than Merlin at least once (off the top of my head, when he's making fun of Ron for not knowing about the Triwizard Tournament). Are we expected to believe that Draco or any of his pureblood friends are church-going Christians, or even 'cultural' Christians? Probably not, so where did this come from?

** One piece of fanon I really hate is "House-elves aren't (really) slaves".

In the books, everyone calls them enslaved - even Dumbledore. No one claims they aren't slaves - even Ron, speaking for the average wizard, says "they like being enslaved". Their masters are called "owners". They are inherited like every other piece of property and magically bound.

And yet people keep making up shit about "symbiotic relationship" and "voluntarily serving" just because they cannot accept that Hermione is right about it being slavery.

  Light-Dark factions
#+end_quote

Oof. This one bothers me more than most. I recently read a story where the baddies refer to themselves as the 'Dark faction' all the time, like they know they're the designated villains in the story.

That's not how reality works! People like Voldemort and his Death Eaters think they're the *heroes* of their story, not the villains! They're preserving their traditions or saving their world from a ruthless Muggleborn invader who threatens to expose them to the Muggles, that sort of thing!

But yes, everything you wrote drives me nuts. I'll read the stories if they have one or two of those and are well-written, but I cringe internally every time I see "Lord Potter-Black" talking to "Heir Malfoy" or "Heir Longbottom" about the Wizengamot or an ancient alliance.

** Character bashing in general annoys me. Or tags like "manipulative!Dumbledore". But that's because character bashing is always bad writing, and anything that talks about manipulative!Dumbledore is almost always just another way of saying braindead!evil!pathetic!Dumbledore. There may be a small number of exceptions, but otherwise...

I don't really get why people look for bashing stories or why authors are happy to write a story with it.

** I love literally all of these except the [family name] Manor one. That's not typically how old English families named their houses, so it always strikes me as a little odd when I see it. It ties into a pet head canon of mine, that the Malfoys are old blood but new money, which is why they do things like name their damn house after themselves instead of “Longleat” or something.

***** You have to really flesh them out individually, usually /on their own/ in order for them to work well in a story. Don't you dislike the fact that you keep running into the same added tropes over and over?

Some of it is just terminology. Why would you want people to call them the 'Golden Trio', or the Hufflepuffs 'the badgers'? Why do you want Dumbledore to be called the Leader of the Light?

If you're going to remove a flaw from the story, like Harry's glasses or scar or something like that, why have it done in a frequently used cop-out way rather than make them happen in a novel and entertaining/interesting way that progresses logically from the divergence point?

If you're going to have a pairing, why make it fated by law or birth rather than come into being in a natural way that endears you to both characters?

Using houses as adjectives just seems like a way to stereotype characters and make you not forget which world you're in.

** So basically what you are saying is fan fiction annoys you. The fact is JKR created a pretty empty world and without many of these tropes it is simply either a) boring or b) still empty. Harry Potter isn't LoTR, as JKR literally does almost nothing in regards to world building and thus it is up to fans to fill in the blanks if they choose to write fan fiction. Heck even where JKR tried world building her math/consistency skills are so poor that it still needs a ton of revision/retconning to work.

Nor am I particularly annoyed about poorly-thought out additions, or biased interpretations, or incorporating aspects of other works.

I don't like these repetitive fanon elements because they've been done too many times, they're not even part of the original work so there's no imperative whatsoever to do homage to them, and they're lazy.

** ITS IN WORDS!!!

I hate these so much! Adding politics to something like Harry Potter is not a good idea. You wanna see why it's not? Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones. 2 garbage films that added politics to a world that did not need any politics. AND WHY ARE 15 YEAR OLDS TALKING ABOUT POLITICS?! AND WHY IS DUMBLEDORE SUDDENLY AN EVIL MASTERMIND?! Honestly, I'd be fine with them if they were rare. I really would. But unfortunately, it's almost like every other fanfiction with decent grammar decided that these tropes are worth writing about!!!
