Been reading/stumbling upon too much marriage fic recently. Anything where it goes horribly wrong or not the way they'd planned it would be perfect.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5886102/1/The-Tattered-Man][The Tattered Man]] by Aurette is a marriage-law-gone-wrong story with a different than the usual angle.

I remember a couple where Hermione ends up cheating on her husband, and one where she ends up with an abusive Snape... but those weren't really worth the read and I don't remember their names. Other than that, can't really think of anything. There are a few with Harry in some form of contract gone wrong, but I'm not sure if that's what you meant.
