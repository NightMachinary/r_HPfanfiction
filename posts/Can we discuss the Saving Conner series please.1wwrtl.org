I see a lot of hype for these stories and I just don't get it. I have tried multiple times to read these stories that everyone says are so good, and I just can't. They're painful to read. Every single person in them is out of character, and they way the characters interact is so unrealistic. What parent would tell one of their children to dedicate their entire life to making their sibling's life easier? What child would go along with that? Why doesn't anyone see this for the emotionally abusive situation that it is?

Basically, what I'm asking is for you guys to explain to me what is so good about this series where no one acts in any way that makes sense.


** SPOILERS!!!

Okay, so you obviously have not gotten past the second book in the series, which for your reasoning I understand. BUT after that second book, Draco and Snape both realize that Harry was abused. That he had been brainwashed, that his magic had also been confined, and that they now had to deal with a child that was not only abused, but magically gifted. NOT to mention a child whose mind had been warped into a soldiers' from an early age. As the books progress we slowly learn what the "training" was that Harry had to under go and Snape eventually decides to bring the Potters and Dumbledor to trial. AND he gains custody over Harry. Draco and Snape then have try to heal the damage done to him.

I have a degree in Human and Family Development and I was really taken aback with how well the author was in showing how certain aspects of the abuse morphed Harry's mind. It was very accurate.

What I also liked about the series was that as the books progressed other things about the magical world was talked about. How houseelves were enslaved, what would have to be done in order to eliminate inequalities in the wizarding world in a peaceful manner etc. They even went into details on werewolves. The series takes off incredibly by the fourth book (not counting the small story maze of light). I want to tell you more, but I already gave you a lot of spoilers. I know someone that felt the exact same way you did, and when I got him to push through and read the books he ended up loving them. So I am telling you now push through ;)

EDIT: Also I should mention that Harry is very much in denial about the abuse.

*** Well. That is certainly convincing. You're right, I only made it through the first few chapters of the first book. I think up until Harry saves Connor from the troll or thereabouts? I don't know if I can slog through two whole books of this before I get to a part that starts making sense.

**** What I really liked about this series, is that in the first two books you see Harry's mind and exactly how messed up it truly is. You as a reader get frustrated, and it allows you to identify more with Draco and Snape in this frustration. Which trust me both Draco and Snape realize that they way Harry is thinking is warped, but they don't know yet why. So there is this long process of them finding out. In the first book as it progresses though, Harry begins to see some holes in his training. He starts to want things. Like a friendship with Draco, and he begins to feel guilty as he begins pursuing that friendship. More stuff does happen in the first and second book. There is more development, trust me.

That's a pretty big problem all by itself right there. If you expect your readers to sit through three whole books of bad to mediocre stories before it starts being good, then you simply wrote a terrible series.

You're supposed to capture my attention from the very start.

******** I never said the ones before were bad. I enjoyed the second book, because Harry's whole life perspective was beginning to be change. I liked seeing how he coped with learning that his brother was not infallible, that what his mother did was not moral, and seeing him choose Draco over his brother a few times. Completely going against his training. It was to me the beginning of something new.

The third book I enjoyed, because it was when his mind was starting to be put back together after it was shattered. (You have to read the ending of the second book to know how that happened) Draco and him became closer, and Snape started becoming involved with him in a more guardian like manner.

There were things that happened in the other books that grip at your attention.

BUT 4th books is when it just takes off. It's more action packed, there is more adult content, more philosophical questioning, more alliances, more Drarry, more things other than Voldermort that Harry faces, and we get to see more Slytherin characters in a flattering light. The whole story begins to really show the other side's trial over the war.

*********** I didn't read this particular story because it's a slash story and I don't like slash stories.

************ I disagree with the three chapter rule and to some extent with the notion of a book needing to capture the audiences attention immediately. Some would argue that the Harry Potter series started out slow with the first book's chapter. All of Jane Austen's books were exceptionally slow at the beginning, and some even past the middle. The Lord of the Rings was slow to start, and was also filled with slow chapters, but all of these books are considered amazing literature. The three chapter rule, could take away a multitude of amazing stories.

************** I feel that this series was interesting from the start. I think that people who have been let down with other fanfics begin reading it and think it is going to have the same flaws like the other ones. So they dismiss it the idea right away.They think it's another super powered Harry, where he can just wave his wand and do anything. Or that it's this super Mary sue Harry with no flaws, when in reality he is the most flawed character in this. So before giving it a chance to see where it goes, they deem it un- interesting, solely based on their perception of other fanfics. Look at the things OP listed as their major faults with the series. Each one is addressed in the story, and it was not at all what OP thought it would turn out to be. The series has thousands of followers and reviews... It's interesting. I have only had one person that I asked to re-read it dislike it at the end. All the others have loved it, and even deemed it one of their favorites.

Yes. I'll give a fic a few chapters to try and entertain me and when it can't do that, I drop it. That's the way I, and many many other people try to wade through the "90% is shit"-rule. You can't seriously expect people to read over 3 million words of a fic before they make up their mind??

If the start doesn't work for me, I won't continue. I really don't care if things make sense in context when that context won't show up for another three books. That's not how good storytelling works.

**************** My whole point was, I saw it as interesting from the start because I did not have other bad fics clouding my judgment on it. It looked like OP disliked it after a few chapters because they had this impression of what the story was going to be about. I was trying to convey that if others did not have the stereotypical bad fics in their head, they may find this one more interesting. Give it more of a chance, before dismissing it as another mary sue Harry fic or something.

I am not saying that you should read this. I have not once advised you to read this fic, because you do not like slash. I am advising people who have stopped reading this fic based on reasons such as judging it by other fics to read it.

I do still feel that three chapters is not a good place to stop reading, but if you want to stop reading books after the first three chapters that is your business, I'm merrily pointing out that by doing so there is the chance that you will miss out on good work. OP wanted to know why this was a big deal to people, so I pointed out why and suggested to OP that based on the reasons they describe they continue reading.

Also, considering you do not like slash and have no intention of reading this why are you on this at all?

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. It's up to the exception to prove otherwise.

** I'm going to say from the start that I haven't read the Sacrifices Arc in 7+ years, so my memory is fuzzy at best about it. What I /can/ say though is that part of the hype is about the sheer length (even if I didn't like the series, I have to respect the dedication to write /three million words/ of fanfiction) and the speed at which they were released. Back when the series was actively updated, you could expect a five to ten thousand word chapter released daily.

That was a huge part of the hype back in the day.

** I read it till about the 4 book I think (it's bean a while) but in the end I had two major problems with it. First, how very much mary-sue Harry was starting to be and second how ooC not just a few but /all/ the characters were. I liked it at first for the interactions between Harry, Draco and Snape but at some point I just couldn't take the ridiculousness anymore.

** Going in a different direction, what I loved about this series and what made me reread it (I rarely reread stories) is how fleshed out the magic in this story really is. Things that JK pretty much hand waved and even terms that are used as if we should already know what they mean are given really deep, well thought explanations that drew me into the world more than familiar characters and story lines ever have.

I would almost suggest that, when you read it, you forget that it is HPFF. In terms of character relationships, the changes to this AU are so drastic as to make the cannon side almost irrelevant. As for the more specific complaints you made. Lily is a sycophant for Dumbledore just as much as Bellatrix is for Voldemort, James is a wet noodle wrapped around Lily's finger, and Harry is a nearly textbook child soldier who has never known another way of life.

** I felt the same way at first, but as explained in [[/u/grace644]]'s post, there are reasons for why people are acting the way they are. I originally only read a couple chapters of Saving Connor before giving up on it. I was convinced to give it another shot and it's good. Don't expect the characters to ever come back to how they were in the originals, though. This is very AU, and even though you learn why things are the way they are, that upbringing shapes Harry into a very different person.

** I managed to read half of the first one. This is taking the selfless hero idea to a mockery of an extreme. I won't go into the OoC characterizations, that is a writer's prerogative, and you can make a case as to why it's that way (Snape doesn't cling to Lily because she didn't die, Dumbledore was always kind of a bastard, the Marauders may have not really matured, etc)... but Harry as the lead is just cringeworthy.

He's completely selfless, super-powered, both brave and cunning, loving, the best flyer, fighter, and whatever in the world. His entire way of thought two-dimensional, his interactions with other characters dull, and most unforgivably, he is uninteresting. This is either building up to a complete Mary Sue, an immature angstfest, or both. In any case, it was enough to make me stop reading it.

*** Hey, I'm not going to say you should read through the series or anything, but if you had gotten past the first books you see that Harry was extremely flawed.

He wasn't loving, that is one of the major issues he faces when he realizes that he had been brainwashed into being this perfect child protector. He starts to wonder if he loves his brother at all, or is just too tied into his duty to him. He has major intimacy issues, which hurt his relationship with everyone around him. He was so used to being so secretive, and everything never being about him that he couldn't talk to others and couldn't think of himself. Then as the story progresses, physical intimacy becomes a subject and he can't even bare to be touched. He shys away from pleasure, because Lilly had trained him too.

He also is too self-sacrificing because of how he was raised. He doesn't even think of himself as a person. Which is another thing he has to struggle through. It also is one of the reasons he thinks so two-dimensional, when he begins to accept more of what happened to him he starts thinking in different ways.

Too sum it all up, as the books progress Harry is basically the extremely messed up one. Everyone sees it, but he maintains denial for the longest time about it.
