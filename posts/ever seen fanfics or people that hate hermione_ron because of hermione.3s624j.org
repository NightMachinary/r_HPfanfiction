we've all seen and heard endlessly different people and thoughts and fanfiction about how people hate ron and don't like him with hermione or think he's not good enough for her.

my question is this, ever see people or stories where people think hermione's not good enough for ron or they hate hermione instead of ron and want him with someone else?


** The fanfiction portayal of Hermione is far, far worse than canon Ron. There are many stories with Hermione that I can't read since the author pretty much just wanks over how awesome she is the whole time, and how Harry can't do anything without her. I can read about Ron just fine when the story isn't an implicit bashfest. Reading about him being a good friend can be quite entertaining, moreso than anything involving Hermione.

So yes, if you're looking for someone who hates Hermione more than Ron, I'm right here.

***** How did Skeeter destroy Hermione or Harry's lives? Hermione received terrible letters (the senders are at fault as well as Skeeter) and a smaller chocolate egg (Mrs. Weasley shares the blame as well). Students teased Harry for his supposed sensitivity (kids bullying each other isn't new). Hagrid was outed as a half-giant, although that should be evident from his large stature. Thankfully he kept his job.

However, none of that adds up to Hermione needing to work outside of the law and committing serious crimes. She kept someone trapped in a jar for at least several days-she imprisoned Skeeter in the hospital and then we still see her in the jar on the train. We don't even know when she was released. Hermione goes on to blackmail her later. That's fucked up. It really is. Although I like Hermione, JKR did /not/ think that through. Jesus, would you want to be forcibly locked up for an unknown period of time with or without food?

As for Marietta, the curse was poorly thought out. A nonpermanent version should have been used. Also, she should have told people about it, either before they signed it or after. That way, it would have been a deterrent as well instead of just a (permanent) punishment and (permanent) branding of the leak's (an adolescent's!) face. Again, why didn't Hermione get in trouble for this? Your kid comes home permanently disfigured and... nothing happens? How would you feel to forever be branded and visibly scarred by a mistake you made as a child? Something you did because you thought it would help your mother. I bet Umbridge (an authority figure) was putting the pressure on Marietta real hard.

Try to put yourself in the recipients' shoes and imagine those things happening to you. I guarantee no one would sign up for that stuff.

Look, I really like Hermione as a character. Doesn't mean I have to think she's perfect. Doesn't mean I should ignore the fucked up things she's done. It rounds her out instead of making her a Mary Sue.

Hermione would be guilty of both false imprisonment and kidnapping, as she not only unlawfully restricted Skeeter's movements, she also abducted her from one place to another. In the Muggle world she would probably be sentenced to at least 8 years in prison.

  R v Saker [2012] 1 Cr.App.R. (S.) 16

  Appellant discovered that her 18-year-old daughter was taking drugs and that property had gone missing. Her daughter told her that she had been obtaining drugs from an older man, who was putting her under pressure to give him sexual favours in exchange for drugs. The appellant and the victim's former boyfriend tied up the victim and detained her in her room for about 25 minutes. The appellant encouraged her co-defendant to hurt the victim. Appellant, of previous good character, pleaded guilty to false imprisonment. Sentence of 12 months imprisonment upheld.
#+end_quote

25 minute imprisonment to stop her daughter taking drugs resulted in a year long prison sentence.

Note that is just false imprisonment, not kidnapping, which is considered more serious.

But Hermione's real problem is that a) the imprisonment was for a relatively long time b) she used the imprisonment to extort Skeeter, which means she comes under the following sentencing guidelines:

#+begin_quote
  At the top of the scale comes the carefully planned abductions where the victim is used as a hostage or where ransom money is demanded. Such offences will seldom be met with less than 8 years' imprisonment or thereabouts. Where violence or firearms are used, there are other exacerbating features such as detention of the victim over a long period of time, then the proper sentence will be very much longer than that. At the other end of the scale are those offences which can perhaps scarcely be classed as kidnapping at all. They very often rise as a sequel to family tiffs or lovers' disputes, and seldom require anything more than 18 months' imprisonment, and sometimes a great deal less.

********** From another thread:

#+begin_quote
  I tend to view the laws of wizarding Britain to be an off-shoot of English law rather than a completely separate legal system. English common law was well-established before the Statute of Secrecy (some cases like the Six Carpenters Case 1610 are still usable precedent), and I think for the vast majority of areas of law the magical world doesn't really need to reinvent the wheel.

  So I would expect, for example, that contracts in magical Britain must have the same essential elements as Muggle contracts: offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to be legally binding, and certain terms. Judgements from Muggle English courts as to the minutiae of contract law would apply in wizard court (as persuasive but not binding precedent, just as Canadian cases can be brought as precedent in English courts).

  But the Wizengamot will have established its own precedents and the Ministry will have passed its own legislation which adds to and adapts the Muggle law to take magic into account - for example, law relating to the use of magically binding contractual terms (for example, since you can't make a contract for your own death in the Muggle world, one imagines by analogy that Unbreakable Vows are considered illegal by the Ministry).

  Similarly, when it comes to criminal law, I expect that the crimes in question are essentially the same: assault, battery, murder, etc. They can have the same definition as the Muggle crimes. It's just that there will be a body of magical law that adds to Muggle criminal law. For example, it's likely that the definition of "grievous bodily harm" is different in the magical world, given the way you can reattach limbs, regrow bones etc. It seems likely that it will be defined in some way relative to permanent injuries/dark magic. And obviously wizards have certain unique crimes such as use of the Unforgiveables on humans.

  I actually think the area of law that will differ most is public law (aka constitutional and administrative law). The wizarding government obviously has a different structure to the Muggle one. It's an interesting question to consider if European Union law applies at all in wizarding Britain.

  I really doubt that there are any lower courts than the Wizengamot, however. The population doesn't seem large enough. Rather, I think most trivial infractions will be dealt with by the executive branch in a hearing by panel. An example of this would be underage magic.

She has also just been informed that Voldemort has returned to life. Hermione must know that she is marked for death due to her friendship with Harry and being a Muggleborn. Under these circumstances, half measures are unacceptable.

** I wonder if there's such a thing as a fic where Hermione gets accused of dosing Ron with love potion. I'd read that. It'd be like a bitter revenge against Hermione eventhough I like canon Hermione.

*** There's a total bash fic where she's setup as the evil post-Voldemort antagonist. In it, she control's everyone via liquid imperious potion she improved upon, until somehow Ron breaks free and goes on a rampage. It's on ffn, but I cannot for the life of me remember the title or author. I'm not sure it was supposed to, but it made me giggle.

*** Although I generally read stories where she is the protagonist, I do ocassionally read fics with other protagonists, and I have seen her bashed quite extensively. From manipulating Harry into a relationship with Ginny in exchange for part of his fortune (without the messy marriage bit for her) to poisoning house elf owners indiscriminately. I've also read several one fic where she became a dark lady and impirius'd Harry and killed Ron for trying to free Harry.

** I once read a fic where Hermione addicted to the Dark Arts, because she was jealous of Harry (or something) after he becomes a wee bit more capable to do more things on his own. Can't remember what it was called, though.

** I have read a few Ron/Pansy stories that were quite good. Most of them start out with the break-up of Ron/Hermione.

That said, most authors who write Ron/Hermione -> Ron/Pansy don't hate Hermione. They just recognise that being boyfriend and girlfriend at 17 is not the same as being a couple at 21 or 22 and that Ron and Hermione have fundamentally different interests.She is an intellectual who will drag him to a ballets show and lectures on philosophy while his idea of cultural education is being able to remember the final results of all the Quidditch World Cup games ever.

*** When has Hermione ever displayed an interest in ballet shows or philosophy? do not mistake "smart" or "scholarly" with "cultured" or "artistic", because Hermione doesn't match these titles. In a way, one can argue that Ron has much more interest in culture than Hermione does.

**** FYI, the above is not my own view of Hermione, this is just how she is usually written in Ron/Pansy stories.

** Yes I hate Hermione, and though I don't care much for Ron as a character, Hermione's nagging, patronizing, and self-righteous tendencies would make any man miserable.
