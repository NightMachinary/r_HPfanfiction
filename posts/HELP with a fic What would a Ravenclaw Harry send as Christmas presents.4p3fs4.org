Need suggestions for - Hermione, Ron, Terry Boot, Draco Malfoy, Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom. Assume he's friends with them all. And its first year Christmas.


** Candy and books. Do not feel the need to spend ages crafting individual gifts and each person's reaction. Remember that Christmas and birthdays are pretty regular things, and unless something is super special and/or plot relevant, you don't need to lavish detail on it.

You don't even have to think of gifts at all. You can literally just say "they exchanged gifts" and be done with it.

** I can't tell you what would be good gifts. But I can tell you that the gifts should be simple. They are /11 years old/ (yes, Hermione is 12, not that big a difference here). It's not going to be super complex, fancy shit in either direction.

** If it's not important to the plot and the story, you don't have to put in too much thought, or even put it in at all.

*** This. It's actually really annoying to read four pages of gift exchange, especially when none of the gifts matter.

** Just make random shit up. They are children, they aren't going to do anything more than take the first random thought that somewhat fits and get that.

** Just make it intentionally vague. Highlight one or two presents if you want but even that will probably be unnecessary

** In order books,cannons merch/quidditch stuff,quill?,dragonhide boots(what I think Draco's a little flamboyant), wand holster, a certificate to ollivander's so he can get a new wand.

Only one that's probs weird is the wand holster for Dean. I literally don't know what to give him because he really wasn't that important canon.
