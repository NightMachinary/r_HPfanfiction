As maybe many of you also, I find the 3 Curses interesting and would like to see other authors interpretations or insight on them as well. And yes, I have read all the wikis, books, etc.

I've read one fic where a girl tries using the killing curse on a terrible person but she partially hesitated, so this meant it didnt kill him but it kind of disfigured his face.

This is kind of like the stuff I'm looking for. Anyone have fic recommendations?


** Well, in Lady Archimedes, Hermione researches some of the Unforgivable Curses from an arithmancy standpoint; breaking down what the arithmantic expression of the curses might be, making mathematical proofs on whether or not they could ever be blocked, what exactly the spell targets when used on a living thing, etc.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

*** I don't think this story works because IIUC using an unforgivable is an instant sentence in Azkaban, unless pre-approved by the Ministry.
