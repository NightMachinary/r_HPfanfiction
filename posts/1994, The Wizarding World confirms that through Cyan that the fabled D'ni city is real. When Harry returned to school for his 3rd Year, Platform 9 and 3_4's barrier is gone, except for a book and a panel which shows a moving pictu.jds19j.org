EDIT: In a more clearer motion of events:

This prompt is a crossover prompt, where (from Uru lore)Atrus contacted the Miller brothers to form Cyan and create Myst and Riven to get people to be aware of D'ni and the Wizarding World gets the attention Atrus wanted to reform D'ni. Also, bonus points when Hogwarts is relocated.

tl;dr is that D'ni is a civilization that can head to other universes/dimensions called Ages by the process of writing books.

*** Myst/Riven crossover, based on Uru lore: Atrus contacted the Miller brothers to form Cyan and create Myst and Riven to get people to be aware of D'ni

Hope that explains more.
