So right now in America it is Harry Potter weekend on Syfy, (Basically just showing all of the movies back to back to back) and after watching the end of PoA I'm kinda depressed.

So I want the very best Harry raised by/taken in by Sirius with Remus of course tagging along so that "the most serious marauder" doesn't kill a child.

Preferred if it has 100k+ words and Noble Houses/Hereditary Wizengamot seats are something wanted but not needed.

The closest thing I have read is Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven by BakenandEggs. Linkffn(11496914). But that only happens later on in the books.


** The Truths Series by Nuerotica and the Dangerverse series by WhyDoYouNeedToKnow are both long series of Harry being raised by Sirius and Remus (Truths) and Sirius and Remus and 2 romantic partner ocs (Dangerverse. They start out a bit flat bc it was the author's first fic, but they develop and grow into their own people really well over time, along with the general quality of the fic.)

Neither have lords type inheritance iirc (but I may very well be wrong, I never finished Truths), but Dangerverse has magical ability inheritence from the founders, both genetically and by being chosen.

Dangerverse is canon to DH in terms of horcrux stuff, Truths was was written pre-DH.

I can't remember the ships in Truths, but in Dangerverse its Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Draco/Luna (trust me it makes sense in context), and Neville/OC (also makes sense in context), Remus/OC and Sirius/OC. For the rest of the characters it's a mix of canon, alternative pairings (such as Tonks/Charlie), and OC/OCs (mostly other years that are given more attention than in canon)

You may be concerned by all the OC's I mentioned, but at their very worst they are bit of a Mary Sue, but every single one ends up with a very developed personality that feels authentic, even very minor characters.

It's kind of Game of Thrones esque in the later books when the war is going, where it really makes an effort to show all sides and perspectives of the "good guys", as well as give them actual purpose and ability and contributions past being death eater fodder.

Both are 100% complete, and there's a multitude of spin offs and aus of the original dangerverse world, by the original author (and one crossover fic between the stories by Nuerotica.

I would highly recommend checking both of them out!

*** I read Dangerverse a couple of years ago, so I don't remember the details, but it was great! Actually, I might just go and reread it :)

** Try Innocent by MarauderLover7 Linkffn(9469064)! Sirius escaped Azkaban, decided to check on Harry (who is like 7 years old) and couldn't leave him with Dursley after that. Then he tries to prove his innocence, meets Remus and other people. It's very well-written, as far as I remember.

There is also Zest by LJ Summers Linkffn(12299853) in my favorites, but I don't remember the plot, unfortunately:( It seems to be a HG/SB time travel, in which they raise Harry

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Winner of multiple awards - THANK YOU! Sirius Orion Black took the charge of raising Harry to heart in every way, becoming a pillar of Wizarding Britain. Somewhere along the way, though, he forgot his Marauder side . . . until he meets his soulmate in a surprising place. AU because I change, oh, a LOT of canon. Please read the Author's Notes!

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.
