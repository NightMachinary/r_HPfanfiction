want to read a fic in wich Harry has adventures out of hogwarts, like Magiks of the arcane, make a wish or bungle in the jungle,

please do not recomend slash fics


** linkffn(5915140) It's been a really long time since I read this, but it fits your prompt. It's a bit old, so the writing isn't the best, but it's not terrible. I remember liking it when I read it years ago.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club) doesn't have Harry as the main character, but he's a main focus of the fic. There's time travel, adventure, and characters from multiple timelines who search for arcane magics and spells to beat Voldemort. It's also really well-written, and a good enough story that I've re read it multiple times.
