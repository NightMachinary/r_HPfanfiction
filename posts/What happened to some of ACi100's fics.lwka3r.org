** He gave up on them and deleted them.

Here, he explained his reasons on why he abandonned Harry Potter and The Dark Lord's Equal: [[https://aci100.com/hpdle-finalstatement/]]

I suppose the Gabrielle/Harry story was deleted for similar reasons since it was written at the same time.

*** Can confirm. He was pretty unhappy with the first half of his Harry/Gabrielle story (Reluctant Champion), and ran into parts where "I would never use this plot point now but I can't get rid of it in this story" so he ended up giving up on rewriting it.

*** Appreciate the update friend. I really enjoyed the premise of HP and the DLE so hopefully he comes back to that idea. As far as HP and the Serpent Chronicles I'm assuming that was also deleted for the same reasons. I'll definitely have to give his new stories a read.
