Those amazing stories that children heard about the defeater of the Dark Lord were slightly true. He isn't the reincarnation of Merlin but he's not a skinny, tentative stick.

Looking for a story with a confidant and talented Harry. Complete please (unless it's really good). Pairings are all fine, no slash. More mature themes are preferred but T ratings are fine too!

Edit: just to clarify. Confident, not pompous.


** Unfortunately, most fic writers tend to forget there's a line between confident and pompous and turn their Harry into a weird mix of Genghis Khan and Gilderoy Lockhart.
