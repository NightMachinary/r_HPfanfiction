Something that includes Slytherin resistances or Death Eater insurgencies that fight against Voldemort, but have to deal with the OotP because neither one will trust the other. A little bit of redemption for the house Rowling loves to hate.

Draco leading a resistance cell and bumping into the Trio or something would definitely be appreciated

Edit: Preferably something larger scale than just a couple of friends. A resistance to rival the DA.


** linkffn(6291747) if you've read any Dramione you've probably bumped into this one, but on the off chance you haven't this is among my favorites in the subgenre

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

*** Unfortunately, Dramione is up there with my top pairings and I've therefore read this one. Despite being a great fic, I'm looking for something a little more larger scale. Like the DA or the OotP.

Thanks for the suggestion, though. Appreciated it.

** Linkffn(Coven by Naidhe) has Pansy Parkinson fight back against her parents and the entire Death Eater movement with the help of Hermione. Dumbledore doesn't trust the two because he thinks that Pansy is a spy to turn Hermione to join Voldemort.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)
