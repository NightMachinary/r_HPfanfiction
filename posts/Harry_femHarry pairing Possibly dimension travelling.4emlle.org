Some of us were talking about it in the IRC, and the idea /really/ intrigues me.

All I really know of is linkffn(2973799; 4040192) and then /maybe/ linkffn(I'm Still Here) if the author decides to pair them together.

Does anyone else have any of the pairing? It would probably have to be a dimension travel story obviously, but by no means does it need to be.


** If you have access to the DLP WBA, I started one there a few weeks back (working title is "single part of two"). It'll eventually get posted to FFN when it's a bit farther along.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I think those are pretty much the only ones. Linkffn(10932567) sort of fits. When Lily sacrificed herself in another universe she merged with Harry and they became a new person Holly. I think this is a side story to another series the author writes (idk as I've never read the series). I started this story and it was ok but all I remember was that it was a fair amount of smut involved. I never finished it but I think it was decent.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

*** I second that, I think it is a very good fic as well! I don't think that will be the pairing though, I'm pretty sure its going to end up [[/spoiler][Harry/Tonks]].
