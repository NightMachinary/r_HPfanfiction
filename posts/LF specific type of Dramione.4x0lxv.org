Hey guys, I'm hoping you can give me some recs. What I'm really looking for is a canon compliant (EWE) Dramione that takes place during Hogwarts, something that deals with Draco and Hermione being in a secret relationship while dealing with Draco being marked, Dumbledore's death, the torture scene at the manner, etc. But really, I'm not super picky and I'm in the mood for some angst and fluff. Must be over 40k words and either complete or recently updated (I prefer complete, I've got to many WIPs I'm trying to keep up with arm). Thanks in advance!


** *I Spy* fits, I think.

*** Thank you! I must admit, I was a bit bummed when my post got downvoted yesterday. I've read one or two with this premise, though I couldn't find them for a re-read, and I know there must be more. I'll go check this one out! :-)
