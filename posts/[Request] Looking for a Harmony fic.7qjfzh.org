Yes, it's me again, but this time, there's enough detail to not be as unreasonable as my last. Once again, I can't remember the title, but read it recently.

It starts off right at the First Task of the Tournament. Though, unlike most stories, it isn't just Ron who doesn'T believe Harry but Hermione as well. Harrynotices something weird about how Hermione acts before she leaves with Ron, but shrugs it off due to the task. During the Task, however, the sight of Harry getting hurt/attacked by the Dragon manages to snap her out of the effect of the potions she's been given by Ron. After knocking him out and getting a flushing draught from Pomfrey, she leaves Hogwarts without telling Harry, out of shame and because the law won't help due to pureblood politics.

Harry, after being informed of her leaving Hogwarts, manages to apparate through Hogwarts' wards in his anger and straight to the Grangers' home. There, he learns from Hermione what ahppened and manages to convince her to come back. Later on they learn they have a soul bond which has been damaged due to Ron's actions and is only half as strong as it could be. They learn of a ritual that can resotr Hermione's virginity and their bond, but it requires a life as a sacrifice, both quickly agreeing with each other that Ron would be that life, and druing, or maybe even close to the end of the story, they do so on the Train Platform, with the Weasleys present, who don't even blame them, except maybe Molly.

Yeah, that's all the details I remember, just can't find the title, despite using all kinds of keywords I remember.....

"Excuse me Mr. Weasley, we're here to sacrifice your son in a Dark ritual."

"/What?/"

"It's to restore our soul bond."

"Oh. In that case, carry on."
