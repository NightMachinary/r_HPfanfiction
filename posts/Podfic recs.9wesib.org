I'm looking to amass a list of podfic recs (also besides AO3 and tumblr, where do you find podfics?)

Particularly interested in plot focused fics (going to be mostly listening at work--- romance and smut might be kind of odd in that setting). But any are ultimately welcome!


** I “make” my own audiobooks using apps. I like Voice Dream.

Step 1: convert the story to an ebook using the FF2Ebook website.

Step 2: open in Voice Dream

Step 3: get used to the computer voice, which is surprisingly tolerable. You also have choices within the app of voices to suit your preferences.

You can also use Apple's built in screen reader on your iPhone if you have one, but this works more smoothly and sounds better.

I admit it's not Audiobook quality. I love my Audible app too. But I'd say the automated voice is better than the bottom 10 percent of narrators of audiobooks, the ones that make books too hard to listen to. And once you're accustomed to it, the robot is just as good as the large number of indifferent narrators. Of course, it's never as good as Tim Gerard Reynolds or Wil Wheaton narrating a good professional book but it's a free way to get your audiobook and fanfic fix.

It does say Hufflepuff funny. Huff-Le-Puff. But you get used to it.

*** It could mean either I guess but what I mean is like an audiobook version of a fic.
