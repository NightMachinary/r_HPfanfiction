** I never quite got the hype around My Immortal. Sure, it's a parody of poor quality fics, but it's one of many. I don't even believe it was known to be a parody at first, so I'm confused why it got so much attention.

**** Yes, but why was it /this/ particular parody that got so much attention? I already stated my knowledge of the fact.

***** It's just horribly bad, more so than the usual parodies, and people thought it was a legit fanfiction for a long time, some still do in fact. I guess it's the confusion that stems from the fact that they can't quite seem to put their finger on whether it's real or not. There's been fanart, and a while back somebody came out to say that they wrote it but it seemed to be a fluke, sadly, and so the plot thickens.

#+begin_quote
  Ever wondered what the events of 'My Immortal' would be like through the eyes of a normal Hogwarts student? 'My Mortal' retells Tara's literary masterpiece through the eyes of Lucy Bonniface, a Slytherin girl in Ebony's dormitory who just wants to get through her final year at Hogwarts smoothly so she can get into the university of her dreams. But that isn't easy when the school is teeming with Mary Sues and bizzare, OOC canon characters having sex in the middle of classrooms all the time.
