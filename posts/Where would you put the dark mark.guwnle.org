I'd put it on the skull where the hair would regrow to hide it, it seems too risky to put it on an arm where it can be exposed.


** Assuming it can't be invisible, I would make it smaller and put it on the inside of the lip (yes, totally lifted from one of the crappy Blade movie sequels...). If it's on the outside of the body, it would be visible to anyone who needs to see your body for whatever reason, which could range from a sexual relationship, to if you're seriously injured and need medical treatment, to a strip-search (ie to make sure azkaban prisoners don't have any contraband).

So putting it somewhere that can be easily shown, yet isn't on the outside of the body, and where people probably wouldn't think to check, seems pretty logical to me. Tongue technically fits that too, but it would be too easy to see it when speaking. Hence, inside of lip. You could also play off the pain of the mark burning as biting your tongue or cheek. I'd imagine, should someone defect, they would be pretty hesitant to cut off their lip, what with it being on their face and all.

**** Malfoys hand flew to his mouth.

'What is it, Lucius?' Cornelius peered at his colligue.

'Ah, Cornelius, I just remembered something terribly important. I am afraid I will have to head home.'

'Is it something to do with your lovely lady?' Minister needled his friend, all in good humor, naturally.

'Narcissa... Yes... Anniversary, you see...' Lucius looked more worried and impatient by the second.

'Of course, of course, go, my friend', Cornelius waved him off. He watched with amusement as Lucius hurried to the fireplace and floo'ed home.

Honestly, sometimes Cornelius was glad he never married.

** The spine seems like a good place. Tramp stamp, maybe? Wixen wear long robes and dress conservatively so it would be well concealed. I've always thought someone truly desperate to be rid of the dark mark could cut off an arm, but that's not an option if it's on the spine.

** If you're worried about it being exposed, don't put it on people. Unfortunately Voldemort doesn't really care if his followers are exposed by their mark, he just wants to have a visible sign of ‚ÄúI own you‚Äù.

** From what canon shows, Voldie needs access to a Mark to be able to call his followers. (Clearly he doesn't have one himself, as it's how he brands his +cattle+ chattel.) Thus, it needs to be somewhere that is easily accessible. And, as another poster has already mentioned, Wizarding conservatism means that the forearms are pretty much always covered except with your intimates (and possibly even with them, who knows?).

What I would have recommended is that it NOT be in the same place on each person. Really, how dumb is it to have a readily-identifiable mark in a predictable place that's easy to check? More than one fanfic has pointed out that simply making everybody expose their left forearm would reveal all of the Marked followers. (But let us not forget that not all who agreed with Voldie were Marked.)

*** My thinking is making each tattoo different might've helped too, along with them being in different spots. Or using something entirely different because tattoos don't seem to be mentioned or used a lot by the general wizarding community.

**** Again though, Voldie WANTS it to be obvious. He uses the same image to "sign" their acts of terrorism, thus he wants that image associated with him. It's large and gaudy, and in a somewhat-inconspicuous-but-easily-revealed location.

I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't required to have their sleeves rolled up during meetings, so he can look around the room and see his visible mark on them. I mean, this is the guy who literally makes them kneel and kiss the hem of his robe every time they approach him.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** It's a gang tattoo as much as it's a communication device, the whole point is to have it in a place that can be easily exposed. Voldemort wanted to brand his followers with a big mark they would have to see every day and be reminded that they belong to him and not even think about backing out, because they have this permanent 'I am a Death Eater' stamp on their arms.
