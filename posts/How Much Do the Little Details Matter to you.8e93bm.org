Like, mentions of small matters or facts about the world that are tangential to the main plot (at least at some point in the story). I quite like it when they're used from time to time. Helps bring the world together if not everything is explicitly pertinent to the current goings-on. "Oh Dumbledore published that paper in Academic Journal X in year Y" or plot lines that are mentioned to be developing in the background that come to the fore later on.


** Given that I spend two hours looking up ferry connections from Britain to the continent, which streets were built along the route Brugge - Prague in 1996 and the local weather at the end of December 1996 just for a single paragraph for my next chapter, I'd say a lot.

Overall I find that these small details vastly improve a story. Not because you put everything you looked up into a story, but because you get a better understanding of what is important for a given subject and can make better choices what you want to include and what not. It makes the surrounding world seem more alive if something not related to the main plot happens (for example students X and Y becoming an item and suddenly there's no other topic in Harry's year for a couple of days).

** Little details help the world seem more real to me. I've gotten some good reactions to small details I've put in my own stories, so I feel like there are definitely those out there that like them.

** Stories without details are junk. Stuff like the canon goblin rebellions might seem like fluff at first but it builds suspense for the final book, readers are subconsciously influenced into expecting betrayal. Not so much that it lacks impact when it occurs but just enough to make the scenes interesting.

The best kind of details though are the kind that form sub-plots as the story progresses. Long fanfics that actually turn every chapter into a story are amazing.

** From a standpoint of pure technique, the little details are /vital/ for worldbuilding, as they contribute to atmosphere in ways that would otherwise demand infodumping, manifesting at its worst in as-you-know-bob speeches.

I think (cbb googling) it was Chekhov who defined realism as 'describing the thumb so well the reader imagines the hand for himself' and /that/ is the function the little details serve.

** Massively, and I think it's important to spend time in your fic building the world with these little embellishments. It helps with immersion and can be helpful in giving a bit of personality to your characters.

** Little details definitely matter a lot to me; I sometimes find myself a little disappointed when an offhand reference earlier in the story turns out to be a plot detail later on, as it shrinks the story's world a bit.

*** That said, multiple comments together could become a plot detail later on, in an interesting way. However, to do this you need links the reader could theoretically make and a different and plausible explanation. For example:

- In book 3, the differences between animagi and werewolves is explained. This introduces the concept of werewolves. In addition, Remus Lupin misses several lessons. Finally, the worst fear of the D.A. professor looks like a white round thing. Thereby, the relevation of him being a werewolf doesn't fall out of the blue.
- Similarly the explanation of Sirius is linked to previous events. For me at least, I didn't see it coming but when I read it a second time I can see the clues.

It feels good to see the links you didn't see beforehand. Therefore, add many little details and make a few of them relevant. However, make at least three clues relevant for everything you want to foreshadow. This increases the moment of revelation when the reader figures it out.
