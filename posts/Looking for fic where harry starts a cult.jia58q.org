:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically Harry was raised by a cult that declared him either a god or a son of a god (I forgot which). When he arrives at Hogwarts, he spreads his religion there and gets some surprising followers, including Lockhart (because he's Lockhart), Lucius (for the political power), and Draco (because he really believes it).

** This isn't it, but there was this one where Harry ended up being raised by Bill Cipher and made a cult at Hogwarts.
