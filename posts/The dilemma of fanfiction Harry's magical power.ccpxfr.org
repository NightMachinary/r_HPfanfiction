The most common way (for obvious reasons) of dealing with Voldemort in fanfiction is having Harry beat Voldemort in a fair duel, which is to say that Harry is as good or better than Voldemort at magic.

This presents a very real and difficult to overcome problem that has to be explained in the narrative - how the hell is Harry as powerful as Voldemort. Now you might, as many authors are, be tempted to instead massively nerf the strength of the death eaters and of Voldemort which allows with a bit of hand waving for a believable Harry victory. I think I speak for everyone when I say that that is a horrible way of going about it that ruins the fic. For example, I read a Harry/Daphne focused story where Harry ended up beating Voldemort by just dodging all his spells until he got tired, then killed him!!!! This was a serious fic, not crack. So let's look at how we could maintain enemy power whilst building up Harry's to that level.

Let us first define what is meant by magical strength and how we are going to quantify it. Magical strength - How good you are at magic. Simple as that; the culmination of how good a duelist you are and how much magic you know and can wield in general. We can look at magical strength in terms of two factors: natural talent and experience/skill. To quantify these we will use comparison for natural talent and time for experience/skill.

This is the power strength tier list as I define it:

1. All-time great Wizard. (Voldemort/Dumbledore level)
2. Magical experts. (Professors, best Death Eaters, best Aurors/order of Phoenix)
3. Talented adults. (generic Aurors and Death eaters)
4. Talented teenagers. (Canon Harry, Hermione)
5. Trash tier. (Average adult wizard and student)

This list isn't linear obviously, the gap between one and the next one down gets smaller as you go down. Thus the gap between 1 and 2 is much greater than between 2 and 3.

​

Lets look at an example first so we can see how this works, canon Harry:

Natural Talent: Canon Harry is an above average talent, he casts the Patronus charm at 13 which impresses everyone.

Experience/Skill: Harry has a decent amount of experience due to being put into life/death situations and is above average skill for his age (his OWL's were above average).

Overall level of magical strength: Talented teenager.

​

Now let's look at the real deal, Canon Voldemort:

Natural Talent: Transcendent, All-time great magical talent.

Experience/Skill: 'The best student Hogwarts had ever seen'. Has spent 40 years trawling the world, refining his skill and learning some of the deepest magics know to Wizardkind.

Overall level of magical strength: All-time great Wizard.

​

To be at the All-time great Wizard tier, Harry must have natural talent and experience comparable to Voldemort. Let us see what we can do.

​

Powerful Harry:

Natural Talent: Transcendent, All-time great magical talent.

Experience/Skill: 7 years of 24/7 studying. This would be the whole of his time at Hogwarts.

Overall level of magical strength: Magical Expert. From what we know of student Dumbledore and Voldemort, they are about this level in canon, maybe a little more. Dumbledore is proclaimed to do magic that hasn't been seen before, he contributed to magical research but wasn't put into the Pantheon of Great wizards until his victory against Grindelwald. Not until they have countless years of experience do they reach the levels they do at the peak of their powers.

​

See the problem now? Even if Harry is as talented as he could possibly be AND spent literally all his time doing magic he could only be a bit better than Voldemort was at the age of 18. Then Voldemort spent another 40 years learning.

The only way to make Harry as good as Voldemort is to make him much more talented than even Voldemort and Dumbledore or give him as much experience by use of time manipulation.

It's hard to take a fic seriously when Harry is that talented, what's the point of reading through the story of someone that goddamn talented? One of the draws with Harry is his growth and it's hard for writers to reconcile that with a godlike Harry. As for time manipulation, that only works for certain premises - say Harry travels back 50 years and stays there for a long time before coming back to save the world from Voldemort.

Ultimately it's not really the fault of fanfiction writers - the 'blame' rests solely on the fact that in the book series Harry was never meant to challenge Voldemort magically. His victory always rested much more in the hands of decisions revolving around certain artefacts - Horcruxes and Hallows.

If any of y'all have any recommendations of fics where you think that the right balance of power has been struck, feel free to recommend!

​

TL/DR: Harry can't be as good as Voldemort because he can't be any more talented and is much less experienced.


** Personally I don't really consider this a problem. For me, Harry beating Voldemort in a straight-up duel is a boring ending - where's the sense of threat if the hero could beat the villain at any time? The hero /should/ be facing steep odds.

For all that a "deus ex machina" ending is derided, I consider it far superior to a conflictless "hero wins because he's stronger" situation.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good powerful!Harry fic. Harry being more powerful than in canon is basically a pre-requisite for me at this point to read a fic. But for me this isn't about resolving the plot, it's about being able to respect Harry as a character. The plot should still be resolved via... well, some kind of plotline.

So the fact that a talented Harry should still fall short of Voldemort is an advantage, I think, not a problem. That advantage being that you can make Harry talented and the story will still possess meaningful conflict.

*** I agree completely with your point and in-fact enjoy Harry most when he's at the Talented Adult and maybe magical expert level. It allows him to believable go toe to toe with the likes of Bellatrix without being able to match wands with Voldemort.

My point was that if you want Harry to beat Voldemort you are going to have a hard time writing it but as you say by that same token it allows us to make a powerful Harry without making the ending trivial.

*** I too enjoy a powerful Harry fic, and I have come up with a variety of ways that it doesn't break the plot.

- No magical cores. Magic is an unlimited thing, and people can cast with wands until their arms fall off. However, the scale/intensity of the effect varies based on affinity (like wands) and each individual (like athletes).
- The adult enemies aren't morons who engage in power clashes. They go for lethal, fast hexes and curses.
- Harry isn't fully grown yet. You don't see first years learn advanced charms for a reason.
- Mentality. Harry isn't as ruthless.

Having Harry grow up as potentially being equal to Voldemort is fine though. I could see him excelling to a degree in the wanded subjects and depending how you view runes and arithmancy, taking those classes.

*** I fondly remember coming across a tabletop rpg for the series a while back where, due to a quirk of how hit chances were calculated, being a quidditch-playing DADA prodigy made Harry nearly invincible because of his sheer skill at dodging. The way the math worked out, you had to have stats on par with a low-ranking auror to even roll against him, otherwise he could just take the standard roll and hit so many successes on his dodge attempt that he may as well have vanished into another plane of reality for the duration of your attack. This was the same game that semi-intentionally made muggleborn students into demigods. They started out with five ranks in muggle studies and gained more at twice the normal speed, which was already tied for the quickest class to study. But it's just muggle studies, right? Turns out that muggle studies is the only skill you use to operate muggle tech of any kind. Want to build a bomb? Fly a helicopter? Weaponize a virus? Create magitech? Roll your Muggle Studies skill. It was amazing. I'm still upset that I never got the opportunity to play it.

Edit: I neglected to mention that this game also used the Power stat to calculate actual physical strength, HP total, AND casting power. Casting power was the sum of Power and Intelligence, so in theory your character could be Hermione-levels of brilliant by becoming a muscle wizard.

It's a Harry who's every bit as experienced and naturally powerful as Voldemort, travelling back in time to deal with him cleaner than he did the first time.

** Two things jumped out in your analysis as I was reading: Your assessment of canon Harry's magical strength and your definition of an upper bound.

I'm starting with the second of these because I think it's the key one. You classify Dumbldore and Voldemort in the same tier, and seem to use that as a hard limit --- it's impossible to be greater than they are. But if you look at how most records are set, you see a performance that seems like it will never be broken/surpassed ... until it is. While it might be unlikely that any given witch/wizard is magically stronger than Voldemort, that doesn't make it impossible.

Then combine that with canon Harry. At 13, he could perform a charm that canonically many adult witches and wizards couldn't do. That's evidence for him being much stronger magically than skilled adults because he did hard magic with less experience. He also fought off Voldemort's Imperius curse a couple years later which is both another sign of magical strength and a sign he might have more magical strength than Voldemort.

I'd argue that for all the Horcruxes and Hallows and wands and whatnot, the possibility that Harry is stronger than Voldemort and that compensates for Voldemort's greater experience can't be ruled out.

*** I agree that Voldemort and Dumbledore aren't necessarily as powerful as it is possible to be - but my argument was that it is unrealistic to be stronger for Harry in particular.

As for your argument on canon Harry's power levels. Yes Harry does show some prodigious talent with the Patronus and also with his natural talent in duelling. Compare that to the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore though - they were doing magic as esoteric as it comes far beyond the scope of a Patronus.

As for the Imperius curse - I've always taken resistance to the Imperius curse to be a mental matter rather than a magical one. Harry is shown to have indomitable will - he stabs a diary at 12 whilst dying an extremely painful death. It's his unshakable spirit that allows him to overcome the Imperius not any sort of magical skill.

In any case I agree that Harry COULD be more powerful. I just don't think it makes for engaging or sensical narrative.

** I like to think there is a certain threshold for wizards to break through to be on relatively even footing in terms of combat. For example, in the books we see Harry and friends going toe to toe with Much older and experienced Death Eaters, so on that line of thought, I think there is a second threshold of magical skill that can be achieved with much hard work that most wizards don't bother achieving, and the rest of Voldemort's esoteric magical knowledge doesn't exponentially increase his “threat level” so to speak in a straight up fight, but rather in terms of how much different magic he is able to use at the expert level. Everything from the dark arts to potion rituals or charms.

Its kind of like how a very high level character in a video game can be an expert in fire magic, bow and arrow, swordfighting, summoning etc when he is max level, but a lower level could challenge him because he has specialized in a certain branch of abilities.

*** That is an interesting look at magical power that I've seen before. I do have some problems with that though - we don't really know what it means to be magically powerful. We DO know that there is a clear correlation between how much magic you know (magical skill) and magical power. Does that mean that being good at rituals makes you better are duelling? We don't know.

Even if we accept that your premise holds true I still think it's unreasonable. Harry starts learning at age 11 and faces Voldemort at age 18. He has 7 years to be as good a duellist as Voldemort and doesn't have to worry about other magics. Is 7 years really long enough to absolutely master a skill as wide and deep as Duelling? Maybe it is if Harry really is that talented but again it suspends disbelief a bit more for me.

**** You are right of course, the gap in skill is quite large, that is why ideally I would like to see Harry able to fight skilled Death Eaters after he reaches 17 but struggling to survive an encounter against Voldemort.

I could imagine a naturally skilled fighter like Harry able to challenge someone like Voldemort when he is closer to 30 or 40 in age. So if the story requires Harry to defeat Voldemort as a teenager/young adult, then I think a “thrilling side adventure” would be a good choice, one where Harry's magical knowledge and skill gets a significant one off boost from said adventure, and putting him on a more even footing with the dark lord. Something that would essentially be a deus ex machina power up from some mystical, old element.

I think JK Rowling confirmed that Hermione could beat Harry in a duel for the first three years, but by fourth year, Harry would win. Harry isn't anywhere near Hermione's level, and in fact during the fourth year he requires her help to train.

Unless you pull some deus ex machina like in canon, introduce the concept of Master of Death that'd make Harry OP in terms of pure magical oomph or come up with some other way that exploits innate Voldy-Harry connection (i remember reading a fic where Harry simply opened the mind link and felt remorse so the soul of Voldy's snapped into one piece and killed him) you can't realistically have Harry have a go at Voldemort and win.

** To be honest, there are so many different ways to have a fight go with magic that having Harry win a fight even if he would lose a 1v1 duel can happen pretty easily. I think the most recent example I have seen would have to be in The Mysteries of Magic by collinsworth, which while he wasn't fighting Voldemort, his performance in the first task shows how big an advantage you could gain by preparing a battlefield. You could also go with a teamwork angle, if Harry can't handle Voldemort alone but instead faces him with a more trained and experienced Ron and Hermione, maybe have Harry throwing the big magic right at Voldemort while Ron throws distraction spells and tries to get spells around his defenses creatively while Hermione does shields and counter curses making up for the lack of raw fighting ability by taking advantage of the fact that Voldemort can only cast so many spells at once.

​

One thing I have always wondered about the potential of is Transfiguration. If you knew you were going to fight Voldemort soon, could you just start transfiguring animals and such and hiding them all over the place, basically giving you access to waves of disposable mooks to make Voldemort waste spells destroying and evening up the playing field a bit? I suppose it has to do with if you are on the Magical Core or Infinite Magic side of things, as that would exhaust someone with limited magic but if there is no personal limit you could transfigure and hide a massive army.

** Magical power isn't the only factor to take into account, Harry's got about the same experience as Hermione and is less talented but is still the better duelist in canon iirc.

Anyway you can always try to have an interesting and asymmetrical battle to have Harry believably win, it'll need a bit of setup but you've got about the entire fic to do that and the magical system in HP is vast enough to allow this. It's harder to write than the usual boring spell ping-pong / "his magical core is 2 stronk 4 me" fight however.

*** Hermione certainly doesn't have the experience that Harry has when it comes to dueling. Harry has been put into much more situations when he needs to focus in extremely trying circumstances. For example having to make active decisions about the diary when he had a basilisk bite wound. The first time Hermione is put in a situation like that has to be probably Order of the Pheonix.

** You don't just put your characters on a scale and the heavier wins, most powerful!harry fics go with the death-star level weak point (which horcruxes already are), or make Voldemort insane/weakened by the resurrection or the horcruxes.

** I always like the fics where Harry assasinates Voldemort somehow because the idea that Harry is going to have a fair duel is foolish in most cases. Or fics that give a good reason on why Harry is able to beat Voldemort like in the linkffn(princess of the blacks) series or the linkffn(the denarian renegade) series. I agree with a previous comment about Voldemort and dumbledore not being the worlds greatest wizards. My headcanon on why Voldemort is so feared is because he is a terrorist. Anyone publicly opposing him weren't risking just themselves, they were putting everyone they care about at risk.

*** Having Harry defeat Voldemort by trickery is certainly a way it could be done I agree.

I disagree that Dumbledore and Voldemort aren't the most powerful wizards in the World. We know that Voldemort and Dumbledore are in the same tier of power - their only duel was fairly even. Dumbledore was called a transcendent student, as was Voldemort (by Dumbledore). We know that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were evenly matched (Dumbledore said so). We know that Grindelwald engaged in wizarding world war and was undefeated, unbeatable. Only when Dumbledore roused himself was Grindelwald defeated.

This suggests the power difference between Voldemort and co and other wizards is very, very large indeed.

** Muggle methods still work tough. I remember one oneshot (I think) where Harry and Hermione activated the Taboo on Voldemort's name in a mined room, then they ran out and activates the mines. The Death Eaters got blown up, they repeated. Eventually, Voldemort came.
