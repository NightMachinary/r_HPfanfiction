This fic has been recommended to me many times, and quite a few on here even put it out as one of their favorites. But so far about 10 percent in I just want to strangle Harry for being such an asshole. Does it get better later?


** If the unsympathetic protagonist is the problem, then I can tell you that Renegade Cause is not a story about sympathetic people. That's not what you read that story for. Harry remains an asshole, but with good reasons to be one. Where RC shines is the complexity of the story.

** There's not a single likable person in the story. Harry is just as painful to read about as Kemester. So no, it doesn't really get better.

** Kind of, and there is a reason for Harry's behaviour that actually gets touched upon later---near the end, that is---and sounds (in my opinion) fairly acceptable. The impression of Harry as an enormous arse does diminish somewhat when a certain character becomes recurring and makes Harry concentrate his arseness on himself by being ... let's just say “unpleasant”. [[/spoiler][Yes Kemester, I am talking about you, you enormous arse.]]

That said, it does remain /gritty/ to the very end.

** My self-note after dropping it has only this:

- too much pointless talking and stupidity 4/10

- this is the one where Harry keeps trying to run and everybody keeps accidentally dying

And I've managed to somehow stick with it till ~ch. 30.

All that I remember from it is that aurors kept dying like retarded flies, and that there was this boring plot arc later on about a vengeful auror whose brother was one of those flies.

*** That's what I'm getting so far. I found it weird that people kept suggesting it. I'm probably just gonna try something else. Notes are a hood idea... I should start that.

**** Yeah, I'm now regretting I haven't been saving Naruto fanfics in the same manner as well. I think there should be 5--10 good Naruto stories like that that I've read before but can't remember now.

*** Yeah, I'm not really sure which is worse, inflating number of combatants (aurors and death eaters) into the many hundreds, or the idea of a "war" where there are really only a few dozen combatants on each side.

** Not really, there is this big plot set up, but it's not well thought out and everybody and their mothers act like idiots for the sake of plot progress. Pacing is slooow, and the ending is a terrible disappointment especially considering this long and overcomplicated set-up.

There are some good things, but they don't really outbalance the bad.
