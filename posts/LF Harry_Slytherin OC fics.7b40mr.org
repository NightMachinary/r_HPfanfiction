*** I get your point, but that's not totally accurate.

Daphne isn't mentioned a lot in the books so we can say that she didn't have much interaction with the golden trio. If you write an OC slytherin you can make them playn any role you wish with regards to them, however.

**** Many Harry/Daphne fics that take place during hogwarts do have her interact a lot with the golden trio though.

** I'm interested in a good Harry/fem!Draco story.

(But please don't name fem!Draco Draconica or something equally silly. A fem!Draco would be named after a constellation, as it was the Black tradition brought over by Narcissa)
