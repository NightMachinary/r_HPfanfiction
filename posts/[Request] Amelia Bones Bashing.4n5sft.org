I just read Hail Odysseus and it got me curious if there were any other good Amelia Bones Bashings.


** I wouldn't say bashing, but the new *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), definitely doesn't paint her in a positive light. [[/spoiler][This Amelia Bones adheres to a strict legalist interpretation of laws, regardless who made them and whether they were moral. As the story stands now, the situation at Hogwarts was even more volatile and dangerous than in Book year 7. A single spark could ignite full scaled civil war among students, and her niece Susan was right in the middle of it]]

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Only Enemies by leave this world) definitely paints her in a negative light, but that's only a subplot.

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.

  Smarter Voldemort launches his conquest of Britain immediately after his resurrection. Smarter Harry, Sirius, and co. are the only ones who can stop him. Unconventional tactics. Begins after Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.
