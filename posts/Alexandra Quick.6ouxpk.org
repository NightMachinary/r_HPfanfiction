** I don't like Alexandra Quick.

The AQ series is not exceptional writing. Is it creative and original? Certainly. But not enough to warrant being on this sub's general recommendations list. Furthermore, you can't explain the plot without including some spoiler, whether they be direct statements about what happens, or implications of what happens.

I can name dozens of other stories more deserving of AQ's spot on the recommendations list.

*** Having only read the first book, I would say that it is absolutely worth of a recommendation when looking for stories in the Harry-Potter-Magic world without Harry Potter. Creativity and originality do carry it in my opinion.

*** Thanks! So it's not as great as some people say, is it? Can you name these recommendations. (No methods of rationality please).

**** I'd personally say it's very good. It's easily the best execution of Magical America, and has some unique OCs and concepts. I'd recommend just diving into it and seeing what you think!

*** It's good, but not exceptional so. The only lasting impression I have of the story is that the author should just take out the last remnants of the connection to the HPverse and just make it an original story.

** There is a land of the dead, Alex visits it temporarily. It includes a bunch of new mythology and examines some of the things that happened to Harry and how a different person would handle them.

Alex is proactive, impulsive, and violent, and she doesn't mature noticeably during the four(?) years of the story. The fifth(?) year is starting as Alex's impulsivity and good intentions result in lots of her fellow students getting attacked, and she faces a punishment because of it that will probably result in some maturity. Her somewhat immutable character's a big reason why some people don't like the story; I personally enjoy a very proactive protagonist with enormous character flaws, but I'll admit she could make different choices in some parts of her life after facing negative consequences again and again.

The antagonist is this series is way better than Voldemort, and his reasons for revolting against the American wizarding world are explored in some depth. Unlike Dumbledore and the U.K. ministry, the US magical government is genuinely engaged in some horrible things to maintain their power. Also his relationship with Alex is complicated, but he wants her on his side, not dead, so Alex's brushes with death come from mostly third parties.

The mythology and American wizarding world is also very different from Hogwarts, and the prejudices are shifted around as well.

*** Thank you very much! But what about that land of the dead? Like, she does see the dead there, right? It doesn't seem to fit that well with the magical world. Thanks again, I'll try to give it a shot :)

**** I don't see how it doesn't fit; the Resurrection Stone shows there /is/ an Afterlife in the HP universe, and Harry was literally at the gates of it in the King's Cross sequence (unless you buy into the idea that was all just a dream and nothing supernatural at all, but that's probably not what JK Rowling meant, what with her being a Christian herself).
