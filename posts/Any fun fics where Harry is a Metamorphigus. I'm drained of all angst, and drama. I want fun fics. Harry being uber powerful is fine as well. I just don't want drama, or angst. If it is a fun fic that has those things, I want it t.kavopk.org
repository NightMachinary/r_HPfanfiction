#+TITLE: Any fun fics where Harry is a Metamorphigus. I'm drained of all angst, and drama. I want fun fics. Harry being uber powerful is fine as well. I just don't want drama, or angst. If it is a fun fic that has those things, I want it to not at least be the story focus. So what have you all got.

Also, Harry being a Metamorph, and using that ability to get up to all kinds of mischeif just make for a fun thought.

Thanks,\\

** Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

Slytherin Fem!Harry where she's a Metamorphmagus. She impersonates McGonagall and Hermione at different points to get out of trouble (being out after curfew, being in the Gryffindor common room).

First year is mostly focused on "normal" magic-school shenanigans, which is also the extent of the angst. Second-year has a different plot around the Chamber of Secrets.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

**** It's just finished second year.

Taure plots his fic out per year if I remember it right, so there might be a bit of time between now and the start of third year, but once third year actually starts updates should come in regularly again.

I'm not sure if this fic needs an explanation, it's a typical wbwl but everyone(almost) is a bit nicer to harry. Also his Metamorph abilities are not really developed yet. So you might want to wait a year or so and then come back to this fic.

Or OP can start reading it. By the time you are done reading 1 million words, harry would've developed his abilities considerably.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** From what I heard, this basically fits none of my parameters. Barely any Metamorph, which was a big key factor, and plenty of angst, which I didn't want. Please understand the Request better in the future please. I got my hopes up a little, and am now just left sad.
