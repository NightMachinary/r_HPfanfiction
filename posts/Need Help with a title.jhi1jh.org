So, someone took on my challenge/request, and they are asking for help with the title for the story. I suck at making these titles, so I am hoping that any of you could help me with that.

I will give you a rundown if that helps.

[/1) Other than giving Harry the ultimate protection by sacrificing her life, she tries to give him the best life possible adding in a little dark magic that makes his pheromones stronger to the opposite sex, which means that they are more likely to protect, love and follow him./

/2) No Dumbledore nor Weasley bashing. Sure, they can take a few jabs, but nothing more serious than that./

/3) Naricssa was friends with Lily Potter and takes care of Harry after she finds where he is located, and is horrified by the treatment that he has been getting from the Dursley's. Her relationship between Lucius and Draco Malfoy is seriously strained.]/

The general idea is that when Voldemort comes to kill him, Lily added a little 'dark' magic to ensure that Harry will live a comfortable life even when herself and James are dead.

What happens is that Harry's pheromones are stronger to the opposite sex, meaning that they are more likely to love him and take care of him (Petunia, Aunt Marge - if necessary).

However, that is the opposite of the males. They will somehow feel 'threatened' by him and will either try to avoid him, or the more prideful ones will try to get rid of him or injure him to try and prove that they are better than him (Dursley and Dudley).

Narcissa was indeed friends with Lily Evans back in Hogwarts as Narcissa wasn't too pureblood heavy, it was only a mask that she had to convey strength and not be ridiculed by her family or the Slytherin house. Only Bellatrix and Andromeda know of this.

Her love life to Lucius Malfoy is non-existent. Meaning that she will gladly find a few stipulations in her marriage contract to be with Harry after finally finding him after many years of searching.

She doesn't care about Lucius and she has very little love for her son, Draco as he took too much from her husband personality wise and even with his views upon the world.

Harry x Yandere / Overprotective Narcissa is the main pairing, and she will be the one who decides on who can also be with Harry. She will be the Alpha for the women.

Narcissa becomes a Professor or even a Healer at Hogwarts to make sure that she stays close to Harry.

In this story, Harry will be a 'light' Wizard, meaning that he fights Deatheaters and Voldemort, but he will know some Dark Magic and curses to better protect himself and his friends and loved ones.

Once Sirius Black has solid evidence to prove that he is innocent, he will be released officially by the Minstry of Magic.

However, Sirius Black will NOT have a love interest, as the woman that he loved dearly died during the war, meaning that he doesn't have an heir. Since Harry is his Godson, he will make him the heir, as he doesn't want someone like Draco to get his hands on the title.

Harry will be the heir of two houses; Potter and Black. No more than that.
