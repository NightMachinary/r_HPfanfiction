HI!

Personally, I don't mind Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Le Fay fics. I know it's cliche, and everybody else hates them, but personally?

Sign me up.

Does anybody have any of these fics? They can include other tropes too, like Azkaban and WBWL.

Thanks in advance for any/all upvotes and comments.


** This one is my own fic I'm making. I'm only on book one but will end up doing more (at lest the first 6 dont know about the 7th yet)

**** Thanks. I was really happy about this series but the more of the "what I hate about fanfictions" the more I'm not to sure that people like it.

***** The people who dislike Lord Potter fics are people who are really outspoken!

There are always quiet fanfic readers who are afraid of sharing their opinion, but they secretly adore Lord Potter, and other so called "cliches".

Ignore the haters! I'm sure I'll love your story!
