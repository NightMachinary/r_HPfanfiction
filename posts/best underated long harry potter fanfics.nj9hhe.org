hello! what are some of the lesser known amazing fics? any pairing and any genre is ok. do you have any recommendations?


** I'll suggest linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help.

Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching.

Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

** I've been following code name: crimson Hare for a while and it's amazing. Harry has a different upbringing and is a gentleman thief. Hermione is a french investigator having gone to beaubatons after the troll incident. It's gone completely bonkers since Voldemort arrived on the scene, at the moment they're in the Egyptian underworld. Holy cow, the amount of worldbuilding and travel they're doing is one of the things that inspired me to write my latest fic. Ongoing but updates relatively frequently, totally underrated imho. Give it a read and review if you enjoy it, I feel like they really deserve more. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13189098/1/][FFN]] linkffn(13189098)

  'Theft. It is an especially sweet vice. More elegant than vandalism and more complex than simple robbery'. Words to live by, and there are few in Europe as talented and driven as the Crimson Hare. A tale of a true gentleman thief and the Police Inspector hell-bent on capturing him.

#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. Seeking answers to his strange predicament, Harry returns to Hogwarts, and causes quite the stir through staff and students - especially when they come to realise he is not the same boy as before.He tries to avoid suspicion, but as his quest for the truth draws more and more attention to him, Harry begins to think that he might not like what he will discover.

  At eighteen years old, James Potter has a lot going on. He's a rising star navigating the politics of professional football, the pitfalls of sudden fame, the fallout from choosing his dream over his father's company... and a serious crush on the red headed new barista at his favourite coffee shop.

** The key is what qualifies as "underrated." I don't suspect I can contribute much as I tend to find stuff by sorting by Kudos / Favorites / Follows and then either specifying Complete status or a Published / Updated in the last 1-3 months etc.

The best long fic IMO is Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. I avoided it for years because of WBWL but it's just wonderful in every regard.

** linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure)

Just very well written overall, with the best AU magic system I've ever read. Also an amazing characterization of Dumbledore.

linkao3(a dealer, not a Death Eater by Jaxon) A very unique take on the snily relationship, in that Snape doesn't become a DE, but is instead an illegal potions dealer for Lucius Malfoy (who he doesn't know is a DE) in a relationship with Lily. You find out how that came to be later on. I love it because it's a rare take on a Snape who isn't bitter and self loathing, he's happy in fact, but he still has a whole lot of issues and trauma, and does some fucked up shit. It's a realistic portrayal of who Snape could have been. Very plotty and unpredictable, though the style is so unlike HP it's hard to get into at first. It also has one of the best marauder characterizations I've seen. While I've seen better characterization of the marauders individually in other stories, none have gotten their dynamic as perfect as in this story. The only real flaw is that Wormtail is sanitized imo, but oh well. Still miles better than average.

  Lily Evans doesn't marry James Potter.Severus Snape doesn't become a Death Eater. A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?
