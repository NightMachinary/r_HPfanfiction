In HBP, remus mentions being a spy in a sort of werewolf colony. What would you expect/want to see in a fanfic portrayal of this?


** While others have said things about pack dynamics and a hierarchy/caste system, I'd think it was much more anarchistic. No one cares about them, I think that would get a lot of werewolves not to care about other werewolves either.

I imagine a settlement where everyone can just build a hut, from all sorts of materials, some closer to each other, some more seperate from the rest, no infrastructure, no "common room" or communal areas.

Greyback might be living in a somewhat more prestigious hut, with some likeminded people, his cronies if you will, closeby. Maybe there's some "nice" werewolves (like Remus) living in 2 or 3 huts together as far away from Greyback as possible but I feel like they would be afraid of banding together too much. One, because of Greyback, two, because they've grown accustomed to not being trusted, so even trusting other werewolves would be hard.

I think when Remus tells Harry about his spying he also talks about how they don't trust him because of his appearance. I think it would be that, plus general distrust.

** Northumbrian has a story featuring a werewolf colony that might be worth checking out just for a comparison. I would suspect that they are rather isolated, almost completely independent of the rest of the world. Those that band together would be trying to manage the curse not spread it. The question really is families? Remus was worried about it but can it be passed down to children? If they have families then they either will have ways to keep themselves contained or they would have to send children away.

For the most part I see pack dynamics more a thing in those who have embraced the wolf, Greyback etc whereas a colony to me suggests they are trying to live normal lives away from the prejudice and restrictions. Anywhere they can set up has to either be disputed or near-inhospitable land that nobody else wants unless you want to go for the slightly cringy super progessive foreign nations that help their werewolves but then why would they need colonies and why wouldn't all werewolves move there?

Are all werewolves magical? What is the ratio of bitten as a child vs adult, this is important with regards to education. Remus is the only bitten child to have gone to Hogwarts. Without proof of other schools in the UK then any magical child bitten receives no proper education so a colony might centre itself around a school. Magic solves so many problems so any trained magicians will be highly valued in their community.

  but can it be passed down to children?
#+end_quote

Canon says no (See: Ted Lupin-Tonks), and pottermore [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/werewolves][says even more]].

#+begin_quote
  Werewolves generally reproduce by attacking non-werewolves. The stigma surrounding werewolves has been so extreme for centuries that very few have married and had children. However, where werewolves have married human partners, there has been no sign of their lycanthropy being passed to their offspring.

  One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence.

**** That definitely fits the isolated aspect. I've never read any of your stuff (I don't like Hermione) but you seem like a popular talented writer in the eyes of others so you can probably make anything work. I think you could look for a balance between refugee camp, those fleeing the persecution of people like Umbridge and a small farming community that's doing their very best to go their own way.

To me the question is where to they stand on the wolf vs human aspect. We have greyback etc who thrive on the wolf, Remus almost drowns in self loathing at times. He tries to be a normal wizard who is out of commission once a month. Where are your community going to be, they are what they are and I doubt willingly so but do they accept that? Is there conflict amongst the inhabitants with regards to their very identities. Is the the colony to shelter werewolves or is it a new nation? Do ministries have anti-werewolf purges where they try to get them to move on or is this a permanent camp?

***** Hermione? Do you mean Ginny? I've never written a fic where Hermione features heavily.

At the moment I have written it as this random gang of werewolves that mostly gather at full moon, but some live with the pack permanently. But it occurred to me that perhaps I was being a bit simplistic and I was interested to see if anyone had any themes/ideas I might have missed. There's definitely going to be conflict over identity and acceptance, and I like your idea about the ministry trying to move them on, it actually fits really well with a character I've established so far.

** I don't see "pack dynamics" being as much of a factor as they are in many fics. They are human beings, first and foremost, regardless of how much wizarding society tries to make them into animals. I see it as an impoverished community, like Hoovervilles of the Great Depression, or modern impoverished Native American Reservations (sorry I don't have more U.K.-centric examples). There are likely leaders who subscribe to the same moral code that band together, probably under a leader (i.e. Greyback). But I don't see there being very clear Alpha/Beta distinctions as there are in a lot of fics that tackle Lupin's time with the werewolf colonies.

I suspect drugs and alcohol are rampant, and medical care is highly lacking- they most likely don't have access to many important potions ingredients. All the typical signs of a oppressed group. Very wary of outsiders, like Lupin describes in HBP, he has all the marks of a werewolf who has tried to integrate with larger wizarding society, and no one trusts him because of it.

According to Pottermore, most werewolves target wizards, and muggles rarely survive werewolf attacks, but there are likely a rare few Muggle werewolves around. Since most werewolves don't attend Hogwarts when bit young, many have skills in magic that are rudimentary, or highly specialized if they're lucky to have a trade passed down from family. The most skilled are those bitten much later in life, but I don't expect anyone to be much older than 50s at best. Werewolf life expectancy is probably quite short.

With Greyback doing what he does, I would think there are a lot of children and teens abandoned by their families after he bites them. Luck determines whether they fall into Greyback's hands and support his cause, or if they're taken in by the kinder, more understanding members of the werewolf colonies.

** - Pack dynamics: Alpha, Omega etc

- Conflict between those werewolves who view it as a curse needing to me managed and those who want to embrace and spread it. Perhaps every "werewolf colony" is truly a rather divided camp when you get an inside look? Or separate colonies having their own stance on this

- moon worship or moon phobia as appropriate to the above. Perhaps colonies that are pro-lycanthropy are permanently nocturnal, anti-lycanthropy firmly avoid the dark

- magic specific to werewolves. Beyond basic stuff like "even in human form, lycanthropes and certain animagus have an improved sense of smell" there could be spells and rituals that only werewolves can do, or researchers trying to develop them

- diplomatic connections to other intelligent magical non humans, like the Veela, vampires, merpeople, giants, etc. What would a werewolf giant be like I wonder? What if full blooded Veela were the only "women" brave enough to be a proud lycanthrope's bride, what would the hybrid kids be like?

- edit, stolen from [[/u/fflai]] below this is from pottermore: /"One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence."/ So obviously in a community that embraces lycanthropy, there will be some of these human intelligence true wolves... possibly even as a ruling caste, interbreeding only with each other?

This is specific to wolf packs in captivity. In the wild, you commonly get a pack structure of mom, dad, last year's litter, this year's litter. Maybe a few of those groups working together. And they're relatively cooperative.

This isn't universal, of course. I've heard of a group of wolves in Yellowstone. They were led by a wolf who led with an iron fist, fought everyone who raised their eyes to her, and was generally a violent asshole to everyone. One of the wolves in the group sneaked off and had a litter in private. The leader found out, killed some of the cubs, and beat up the defector with a level of violence even she had not demonstrated before.

Not long after, the entire pack rose in rebellion, killed the leader, and welcomed the defector back.

Subsequently, they lived a pretty chill lifestyle.

Improbable. Human Werewolfs can use magic most days. They can apparate (get away at any time), throw out the killing curse, and do other stuff. They'd never submit to these wolves.

** I think you should consider carefully how werewolves react to magic.

Some werewolves that were bitten when they were adults would have been to Hogwarts and learned magic, but Greyback bites lots of children when they are young. As far as I know Remus is the only werewolf to have been allowed to go to Hogwarts, so there must be quite a few who can't do magic, and probably dislike Remus and the others who can.

You probably need to decide whether magic is banned, or just discouraged, or if they try to teach magic to those who can't do it. I could imagine that some might want all werewolves to completely stop using magic, but we really don't know that much about werewolves, since there are only two in the books. It's also possible that some of them steal wands and try to learn magic from the ones that can, either in secret or not.

I think which route you go for depends on what proportion of the werewolves can do magic. So it really could go either way. Maybe more adults survive being bitten so lots can do magic, or maybe Greyback likes to bite young children so more can't do magic.

Hope this helps, and sorry it's a bit late!

** lupin can use wandless magic, maybe thats a werewolf trait. Lupin also didn't know that lycanthropy isn't inheritable so you have to treat everyone like a former wizard or muggle. Many were children turned by Greyback to serve as his future army, so porbably a lot of anti wizard government and pro Voldemort propaganda. Because he raises many of them there are probably several werewolf like Greyback who enjoy cannibalism even in human form and probably rape. They would blame normal wizards for them not being able to have any form of real work and being poor. so many of them would probably engage in illegal activities. For combat we know that Greyback uses his body even though he has magic, i assume they would have developed some form of martial arts and that they are really fast since he was described as a blur. They would probably look down on muggleborns if we go by Greyback. I think there would be quite a few ex blood purists who would consider suicide

I'm not sure you can cast lumos and another spell at the same time; either your new spell wouldn't work or the lumos spell would end leaving you to fight in the dark. By casting another light source you have your wand free.

Edit: just to quickly say, I'm not against people interpreting it this way I just want to establish whether this is a commonly held belief/headcanon. I'm trying to keep my fic as canon compliant as possible and don't want to take people by surprise. Certainly I've never read it that way but perhaps I was being dense.

******** I don't think wandless magic is as rare a trait as the fandom likes to make it out to be. Lupin(via implication), Dumbledore, Voldemort, Harry and Quirrel all showed the use of wandless magic. Quirrel actually showed the most competent use, with his actions at end of book one, and some debate over whether his jinxing the broom counts. Which would then put Snape into the list, with his counterjinx.
