In some cases, it is shown to propel it's target forwards, and as a result making them lose their wand,(Which is another debate entirely on the name then, seeking as following that logic, Killing Curse and Cruciatus could also be considered Disarming Charm/Curse) and in other cases it's simply shown to disarm the opponent. It is shown in book three that multiple Disarming charms do the Former Variant, while also "duel" between Snape and Lockhart did the exact same thing. Every-time Harry uses it it does the former, someone else - the latter. (This part may not be true.)

Is it dependent on Power? Intent? Any Canon explanation? Then again, it's now canon that Disarming Charm rebounds spells, which was Harry/Voldemort thing. I quote:

"The Disarming Charm lies at the heart of a good duelling technique. It allows the duelist to rebound an opponent's spell in the hope that the rebounded spell will strike the opponent and leave him or her vulnerable to further attack." ---Miranda Goshawk

(EDIT: Checked sources on the wiki. It's not canon(the quote))

Any thoughts are welcome. Debates are entirely appreciated.


** From OOTP, when Harry is teaching the Disarming Charm to the DA:

#+begin_quote
  many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them.
#+end_quote

Some folks may not like me getting science-y about this, but to me this suggests a certain push-pull effect going on with the spell -- that it works by exerting a pulling force on the person's wand /and/ a pushing force on the person themself, the obvious aim being to part person from wand. When casting, the intent of push vs. pull affects the outcome - if you focus on just getting the wand away (the pull force) instead of knocking them over (the push force) then victim will remain standing and just lose their wand.

(It actually seems possible to me that [though this is pure theory; we don't see it happen at all in the books] if the caster's intent is too much on the push force then the victim may be able to hold onto their wand even if they're blown off their feet.)

So, from that, the overall effect of the Disarming Charm is dependant on (a) the spell being cast correctly; (b) the power of the spell; and (c) the intent of the spell caster.

Snape vs. Lockhart: Snape is powerful and dislikes Lockhart, so probably wants to hurt and humiliate him. Accordingly, he puts enough power into it to send Lockhart flying backwards, whilst also making him lose his wand.

Trio vs. Snape: Power of three vs. one, plus an intent to stop Snape approaching (particularly form Harry), plus a desire to disarm (particularly Hermione, who doesn't want to actually hurt him), resulting in enough force to knock Snape back and send his wand flying across the room.

Harry vs. Neville (during DA): No malicious or powerful intent; the spell only takes Neville's wand from his hand. Likewise happens when Neville casts the spell on Harry, but it's noted that Harry's not paying attention and holding his wand loosely, thus a weak spell would be ineffective against a strong wizard.

As for Harry vs. Voldemort, the effects of that are independant of the Disarming Charm. Their final battle was about wand vs. wand, not spell vs. spell.

(Also, that quote you mention apparently came from a video game [and an old one, at that] and can hardly be classified as canon.)

I feel like if the spell has enough force to propel you forwards, your unlikely gonna be able to hold anything. It /may/ even be painful.

**** The wikia has always been liberal with it's sources. It takes information from anywhere so you always have to be careful about; the lexicon is far better about that.

I do think it'd be a very minor possibility, but if the caster's intent on pull-force is sufficently weak and the victim's physical strength is enough that they can maintain their grip even when being thrown about then there's the tiniest possibility of it happening.

******* Considering that they classified Cursed Child as coming from Madame Rowling herself, I will dare say that their list of canonicity is laughable and not in a good way.

I don't care whether or not someone accepts this ... piece of thing, as canon, but for fuck's sake, attributing it to Madame Rowling is a mockery and a massive lie.

And yes, I do get that the section says that anything she says she considers canon is put there. It's still a stupid decision on so many levels to put it there and not have it be marked in some way so that there would be an actual distinction or something.

A convenient plot device that can stun your opponent (HP stuns Snape), or kill you opponent (only if you are chosen one and fighting against darkest of the dark lords). Usually it just disarms people and let you win witches who giggle after you finally do this spell successfully at age 16 when you should have mastered this spell at age 11 (Yes Neville!

** Maybe every spell is bullshit. There's wandless magic, there's wordless magic, there's accidental magic.. All the rules are self imposed on themselves- there is no spoon.

But I'd say it's a matter of a flexible spell that depends on intent and/or the amount of power put into it.

That or there's some minor wand movement or some change in how they say it that does it, and they mapped that spell's nuances particularly well.

Small changes in castings for big effects as proven in the books:

"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too --- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." ---Filius Flitwick

** The disarming spell is the single most ridiculous plot device I've ever had the misfortune of having to read. Though I suppose it's the result of the caster's secondary intent(incapacitating the opponent), in addition to the primary intent(disarming the opponent, leaving him/her bereft of their wand). This is one of the more impactful areas of HP that JK hasn't delved very deeply into the mechanics of.

If we looked at the incidences in which the disarming charm saved Harry's ass, without knowing that said events occurred, I'd be inclined to call bullshit on every single instance the charm saved him from death or capture. There is no way a charm that, in a perfect world, should be a first year spell, be used to defeat wizards/witches who are hardened killers with decades of experience. Harry should have gotten himself blown up into a shower of guts and gore in his first year, if one looks at it from an outsiders' prospective. I'm pretty sure canon Harry had luck potion dumped on him by Snape every night after he went to sleep.

So yeah. In my opinion, the disarming charm is a bullshit plot device used to prevent Harry from getting himself nuked every time he faced an adult. In the story idea I'm swirling around in my head right now (and soon to begin writing), I'm not going to have Light-sided people casting wimp spells when there are Death Eaters and Grindelwald followers trying to kill them. For people who believe in doing what is right, as opposed to what is easy, Dumbledore and Co are a bunch of hypocrites. Just stunning the person who is trying to kill you /is not/ doing what is right. It's doing what is easy, so you don't have to face the reality of the world. Not everyone is good, nor can everyone be "saved".

But I'm assuming since you're doing something with pure magical force, you can give it an added effect with a little more power and an extra intent added. It's definitely not scientific.

Everything you see is a modification of those three things. Wands are a power magnifier. Words help you focus. Movement enhances your intent.

Then to explain why some spells seem to work without peoples knowledge of a whole spell, I assume that magic itself is somewhat intelligent and capable of learning. The caster may not know what they are doing but the magic they are using knows what other wizards were trying to do and follows along.

If threads were meant to die after just a few days, reddit's "Only archive after 6 months" rule wouldn't be in place.

***** I'm not saying necroposting is bad, but many dislike it. I personally don't care. Video games are not considered canon. Wiki believes anything is canon as long as no one says otherwise. There was this huge argument about this in this thread.

****** Oh. As I said, I am completely on board with the wiki's position --- every fact officially published is canon unless it glaringly contradicts the "core" canon of the books. So while the events of the video games themselves aren't canon (since we clearly know that's not exactly what Harry did and such), I see no reason for worldbuilding introduced therein not to be canon. It makes the lore of Harry Potter that much richer, for one.

******* In that game and in that quote Disarming Charm is said to work as a Disarming Charm and a Shield Charm. The only time it did that in the books(Agreed source of canon) is in HP vs DL fight at Hogwarts. And that had reasons for being special. Which was stated in this thread.

******** Ah. I see. Then yes, that's a case where I would agree that that particular quote cannot be considered canon.
