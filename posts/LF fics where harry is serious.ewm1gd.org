are there any more fics where harry is more mature? after his "childhood" he ends up fairly well adjusted kid but the kid grew up living in a cupboard

or even if its not his childhood maybe killing quirrel or facing the basilisk or his ostracization during second year

basically he grows up without becoming an ass best example I can think off is Barefoot

preferably no bashing no slash no fem!harry


** The international Triwizard tournament by salient causality is pretty good with a maturing Harry.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  Harry Potter has been training himself and his friends for months, in preparation for this day. Today, his war begins when Voldemort plans a trap for him at the Department of Mysteries - only it's Harry who has the upper hand, until a trio of faces from his past make a very unwelcome return. Grey!Harry, Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** Obligatory, “Harry's not Sirius, Sirius is Sirius pun”, etc, etc.

Have you read The Sum of Their Parts? Post-Hogwarts story that acts as though the epilogue is not real. No bashing which is very refreshing.

In case the bot doesn't work: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]

Or, if you want school aged Harry, A Cadmean Victory could fit the bill. It's got it's flaws but it is complete and has an optional separate ending chapter as a separate story

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
