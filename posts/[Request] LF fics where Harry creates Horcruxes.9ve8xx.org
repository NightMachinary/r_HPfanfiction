Yes, committing the absolutely cold blooded murder required for a Horcrux, plus whatever dark spell or ritual is needed to complete it will tend to get you mistaken for an evil person.

*** Nobody said you had to murder an innocent. He could walk into Azkaban and make a horcrux with the absolutely cold-blooded murder of a maximum-security Death Eater and it wouldn't be anything more than morally grey. Of course, this is assuming that the horcrux ritual itself isn't all that repugnant, which I find likely, because I have no faith in Rowling's ability to imagine anything worse than Dementors.

**** Yes, nobody said you had to murder an innocent. We are in agreement; because I never said that myself. You are clearly under the mistaken assumption that I would agree with you that executing criminals and prisoners is acceptable simply because they are criminals and prisoners. I do not agree with you about that. A person committing one crime does not give another the right to commit a crime against them, just for that. That is why prison rape jokes are disgusting, and why we do NOT just execute anyone who commits crimes. Harry would not be "just morally grey". He would be a sick, disgusting person himself for executing someone in cold blood. You cannot justify it.

***** I wasn't under the assumption that you would agree that extrajudicial execution is "acceptable" without qualification. I thought you might see it in terms slightly less absolute, though, which was my mistake.

Given an ideal justice system, extrajudicial execution is typically evil. Given a justice system that aspires to be ideal without achieving it, it is likewise typically evil, but less so, or less typically. Given a positively medieval justice system that puts innocent people in horrific conditions without a trial while simultaneously taking bribes to let off hardened torturers and murderers and rapists without so much as a slap on the wrist, it's essentially fine, and bonus points if it ends up saving innocent lives.

To anticipate possible legalistic objections: The law is an arbitrary set of mandates established by those in power for their own purposes, both in our fluffy modern world and in Harry Potter's crapsack magical one. Vigilante justice is frowned upon by those in power because it threatens that power, and by others because it is easy for a vigilante justice to be worse than "legitimate" justice. That doesn't mean that vigilante justice is always wrong. If someone has the means to exact justice, and their justice is fairer than the law's justice, it is right for them to do so.

****** There is no qualification that can make something so horribly wrong into something right. Those are called justifications. We do not do that.

******* Anything can be justified if it's balanced against a sufficiently horrible alternative. Genocide, for instance, is one of the most utterly revolting things humanity has yet been able to conceive, and yet genocide would be acceptable, even the right thing to do, if it was the only way to prevent total human extinction. If you want to flinch away from such calculations, that's your prerogative, but if so, the only point of discussion we can really fall back on is your idea that extrajudicial execution is a horrible thing compared to execution by the lawful authorities. I've already explained how the law is fundamentally arbitrary, and in the magical world it's even less worthy of respect. What is so terrible about illegal vigilante justice if it's qualitatively better than the "legitimate" alternative?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] has this in the last update in Jan of 2017. It actually made me less excited for the story, TBH. It's not exactly the same situation as you described, but he did do it.
