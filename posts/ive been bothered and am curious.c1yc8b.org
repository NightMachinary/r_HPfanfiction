** Though I've never read any or just can't remember any myself, I'm pretty sure they're in the fics with cliche op dark lord Harry. I'd guess those are written by 12-16 year olds who have less qualms about writing about a younger character. Still seriously disturbing, though.

** Think there was a purge on ff.net a while back, but I do still sometimes come across fics where 11 year olds talk about how sexy someone is and how a girl has "curves in all the right places", can't close those fics fast enough.

** Just to have a reality check: [[https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/united-kingdom][age of consent in UK]] is 16 (i.e., that's the age people are capable of giving consent, so anything less is a statutory rape), teenage pregnancy is a problem in many states (UK included). Yes, that's among Muggles, but still anything less is more or less disgusting to most at least mostly sane readers. So,

- when linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs) has Ginny having a baby as fourteen and sentence “Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.” (and she did), it is just disgusting.
- when Hermione in linkffn(Reluctant Ally by Harry50) says about planning to have sex very soon: “We're not so young, really. You're going to be twelve in a month and I'll reach thirteen in less than three months.” ... WHAT THE HELL?!

BTW, except for the authors' inability to keep their characters' zips up both of these are reasonably sweet stories certainly well in the standard of the soul-bond and kind-of-sould-bond stories, so it is not like I would like to bash these too much and claim these are the worst fanfics of all.

  At age seven, Harry wants to control his "freakishness". A book in the library calls to him. He finds that he needs to get stronger in order to control what is probably magic that causes all those unexplained events near him. That brings some unexpected changes to his life.
