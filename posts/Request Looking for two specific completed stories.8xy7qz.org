One had James Potter didn't die, but was trapped in some sort of bottle or vase on a shelf. Pettigrew, I believe, knocked the bottle down and it broke, releasing James.

The other is where Harry goes back in time as an adult and winds up at Hogwarts. He refers to the younger Harry as stuff like "Mini Me" and says something like "I had a black dog once. Loved him to bits. He died one night because I didn't think things through" or something like that.


** Is the second "A Jaunt Through Time"?

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
