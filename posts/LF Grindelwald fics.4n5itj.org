any good fics with this dark lord being the main character if not one of the main characters. Preferred plot is flexible, as long as the story is about him so could be his life before/during/after durmstrang or even the war he started. I don't really care about romance, as long as it isn't a slash(unrequited love is fine) or Gellert is paired up with someone from the future. If he's the main antagonist in the fic, i'd like for him to be active i.e not sitting around and ordering his minions, i'd like to see him actually fight and be in action.

Bonus points if the authot portrays/interprets gellert as a badass or powerful.

I don't remember there being much romance, but I could be mistaken. I do remember enjoying it immensely, however.

Edit: Yeah, not the bot fic, obviously...
