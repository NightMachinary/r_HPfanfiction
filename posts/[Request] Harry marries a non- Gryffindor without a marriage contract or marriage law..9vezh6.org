Looking for any fics that have Harry going through the awkwardness of crushing, dating and all that entails of anyone not Hermione or Ginny and of a different house. So many of him marrying Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones are because of a marriage contract or marriage law. Not looking for Harry or any Slytherin boys.


** Okay its not quite arkward dating but "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12300252/7/From-Southampton-to-New-York-and-Beyond]]" could be what youre looking for.

** What if Harry married /w as in a open relationship with either Molly, Luna, or a genderbent Collin McCreedy? I've read a few of that variety that generally pretty tame.

All the best,\\

*** I can't see him with Molly (yuck) but it would be interesting to see him in a relationship with Daphne, Pansy, Susan ect where the author skipped over the romance part and just went to the marriage with a marriage contract created by some one or other as a prank or an ancester generations ago. I know there was a multi fic series with Harry and Daphne, so that is kind of what I am looking for.
