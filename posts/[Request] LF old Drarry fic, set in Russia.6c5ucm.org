I've been looking for this fic for ages and just can't seem to find it, so I'm hoping someone recognizes the premise and can help me out. It was a fairly dark fic with plenty of smutty scenes. It was set in Russia and Harry and Draco were working on a case (can't recall if they were aurors or not), and I believe Luna may have been on the team as well? Harry and Draco are an established couple. The first scene, I think, opens with Harry finding Draco in his apartment unexpectedly, and smut ensues. I know they go to the opera or ballet at some point. I'm positive the song "Agnus Dei" by Samuel Barber played a role too... It's not much but hopefully it rings some bells for someone! I loved this fic years ago and would love to go back to it.


** Why are slash fics so downvoted? It's still a fic request

**** I'm pretty sure the reason has less to do with the fact that it's drarry and more to do with the fact that it's slash, period.

***** I dunno the recent femmeslash thread didn't get quite the negative response.

*** It really bothers me that people downvote requests they don't like. Why can't downvotes be disabled for requests? Ugh.
