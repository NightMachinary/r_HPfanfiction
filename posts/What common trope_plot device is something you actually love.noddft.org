I love it when something kills all the Death Eaters and every Horcrux at the same time, This is usually some OP ritual thay only Harry can use. The Death Eaters all dying with Voldemort is also very satisfying.


** I don't really mind the manipulative Dumbledore. I just don't like the fact that in most stories showing him as such, his character goes against pretty much everything we're told about him. If he were a force to reckon with, I would thoroughly enjoy the story. However so far I've only seen a few where he is a real threat and Harry escapes him by the skin of his teeth.

*** So many manipulative Dumbledore stories have him as a moron who can barely breathe and walk at the same time. If you are going to have this trope then go all in with a complex brilliant man who has held control over wizarding Britain for decades.

** Ooh I like that trope. I don't think I've seen it very often, but I like it.

I also like Harry being super-powerful (equal to Voldemort!) but not knowing it. He's not arrogant about it because he assumes it's common to be able to wield that amount of power/cast spells that easily and doesn't get he's exceptional - but we get to watch everyone else being awed.

**** I mean, they were both indoctrinated, were both tasked with killing someone extremely important to the enemy faction, both showed some type of hesitation/unwillingness to follow through and ultimately both failed.

Honestly, they're kind of the same character.

One could argue that Draco suffered even more than Zuko. Zuko's suffering was more a familial betrayal than anything. Draco's dad basically signed away Draco's life and then lived in hell for a year.

***** I'm a pretty huge Draco fan, but nahhhh. Zuko suffered more. From a small age his sister emotionally manipulated him and somewhat emotionally abused him. At 13 his father physically scarred him and shunned him from his entire country with a quest that was thought to be impossible. And when the chips were down to do the right thing he did, after backsliding.

When the chips were down Draco ran every single time, except the single time he covered for Harry at the manor. His parents, in canon, pampered him. It's abuse in the way Dudley was abused not the way Zuko was. It's hard for any character to live up to Zuko, though. Haha.

That said, I adore stories that redeem Draco and have him go the more Zuko way with his parents being a little bit worse. Fanon Lucius who crucios pets and forces Draco to live up to exacting standards makes for an really interesting Draco. I also hardcore ship Drarry so I see a lot of those stories and it's easy to forget that Lucius wasn't the brand of asshole that fanon makes him out to be.

****** You're right, I may have put the cart before the horse with my last paragraph.

Regardless, though, I think canon Draco is a totally redeemable character. It's difficult blaming him for his racist views when that's how he was raised. He's a young adult by the end of the series and clearly having some kind of doubts about the more radical parts of the movement he's involved in. What we see in the epilogue doesn't give any kind of insight into his new character other than Harry can, at least, tolerate him.

I'd still argue that there are a lot of parallels between Zuko and Draco and regardless of which suffered more, both are redeemable for the same reasons. The only significant difference is that ATLA /includes/ the character arc for Zuko where he's /already/ redeemed. It's unfair to not separate that aspect of his character, when Draco wasn't given the opportunity to go through his own similar arc.

Comparing Zuko's character around the first time we see him have doubts about his place in the world is much more anogalous to Draco at the end of the story, sans the epilogue.

** Harry learning Bellatrix is under some kind of spell that bonds her and her will/mind to Riddle, and him breaking her free.

Harry using his influence as Head of House Black to break apart Narcissa and Lucius. Narcissa realizes the old ways are leading them to ruin, and decides to help Harry build a better, more sustainable future for Magical Britain. And she's tired of being a trophy wife.

Powerful/independent/smart/confident/physical transformation Harry who isn't an all round unpleasant person. And he's young, he lacks experience, so he'll make mistakes.

Harry as a pupil of Godric Gryffindor. Why are there so few of those? Why is it always Slytherin? Also, I very much like the idea of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff being lovers.

Fleur's Veela being a kind of separate consciousness living within her, and causes Fleur problems with suppressing her baser instincts and desires.

Harry actually being a /Chosen one/. Who has chosen him and why?

Hermione on the Wizengamot, under the tutelage of Narcissa Black.

I've pretty much given up on it, because they're usually just porn, but since I used to like Harry/Multi, I'd love to see a fic where it's not just a smutfest, and the author actually takes the time to give each woman a distinct personality and a proper role in the story. Preferably no smut at all. It means needing to write a rather long story, but I think it can be done, even if the forming of the /harem/ (hate that definition) will always be silly.

These are some of the tropes I like, and I incorporated all of them in my fic. There are more, but I'm too lazy to write them down. I looked very hard for exactly this kind fic but couldn't find one. Unsurprising. It /is/ a very specific criteria. So I decided to take a crack at writing it, myself 😁
