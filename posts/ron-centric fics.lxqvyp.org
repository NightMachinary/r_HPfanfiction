what it says on the tin, looking for ron-centric fics; the tags on AO3 are abysmal.

preferably slash or gen, definitely not Romione, and not set after the Battle of Hogwarts/adult life

  There wasn't any sort of fanfare for Ron Weasley about to board the Hogwarts Express for the first time. Ron Weasley's family is acting weirdly, some very unexpected people are making friends with him, and altogether a ride on the Hogwarts Express goes very differently to the way it happened the first time around. A sequel/continuation that also works as a stand-alone fic.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
