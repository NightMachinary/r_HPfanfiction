I made a discord server (because I'm hip with the times, yo) for Harry Potter fanfiction writers and fellow magical debate enthusiasts.

The server is 18+, and is intended to foster fun, nerdy, /mature/ discussion and to t/ruly help writers/ and share ideas without focusing on ships 10,000% percent of the time.

It's themed like a post-secondary institution for magic.

I'm also hoping to start a database that logs info on high-quality fics (most recommended on here, for example) that can be shared in the discord for reference.
