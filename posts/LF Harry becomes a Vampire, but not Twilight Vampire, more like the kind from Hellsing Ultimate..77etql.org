** Great, I'm now imagining Harry as Abridged Alucard, with Dumbledore as the target of his pedophile jokes. "Hey Dumbles, you know what works great to get cum stains out of Hogwarts robes? The elder wand!"

...

I almost want to write this myself now.

** The writer of this apparently wanted to write a Hellsing Fanfic but didn't know enough about that universe so decide to go with a Harry Potter variant. More related to the silly parts of Hellsing than anything but it still qualifies I think.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

  Harry Potter becomes a vampire. Which struggle will be the most difficult? The war with Voldemort, or the struggle to hold onto his own failing humanity? Takes place right after HBP and makes an immediate detour into the Twilight Zone. Beware a HHr story.

  Abused and treated like a slave by his relatives, avoided by everyone else, Harry James Potter grows up hating Humans for treating him like a Freak. Knowing just how horrible people can be, is it a surprise that when he is given the opportunity to take his revenge, he takes it? Rated M for mature content such as gore (it's Hellsing after all), as well as abuse and child rape.
