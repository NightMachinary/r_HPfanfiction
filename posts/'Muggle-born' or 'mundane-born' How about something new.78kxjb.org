I used to think that 'mundane' was better than 'muggle', but recently I have reconsidered my opinion. Now that I think about it, 'mundane' does imply dullness and being boring. However, 'muggle' still sounds really offensive.

Therefore, why not something new? Instead of 'muggle-born' or 'mundane-born', a witch/wizard would call themselves 'great-born'. The new term basically tells the traditionalist purebloods where those of non-magical lineage come from. 'Great-born' would inspire these witches/wizards to rise above their bigoted suppressors and significantly improve the Wizarding World.

Well, that's my opinion, anyway? What do you think? Is there a fic with a similar concept?


** There was a trend in fics for a while calling muggleborns 'newblood' instead as it falls in the 'pureblood' 'halfblood' naming pattern better.

Personally I'd like to imagine that by the time the next gen go to school identifying what kind of blood you have is met with an eyeroll or a comment about vampires.

*** In canon, it's not like characters went around announcing whether their halfblood or pureblood or muggleborn in particular, did they? The tendency for characters to introduce themselves by what kind of blood they are seems to be a fanon invention. In canon, the only people who did it came of as pompous, like Ernie Macmillan, and even then, Ernie only did it because of the whole Heir of Slytherin thing.

I'm not entirely sure, though, it's been a while since I've read the books.

***** Fair point. They don't necessarily identify between pureblood and half-blood, though. More like figuring out who's muggle-raised and magic-raised, which isn't focused specifically on blood. Feels more like a 'hey, where are you from?' type of thing.

**** Muggle sounds pretty offensive. Especially Muggleborn. It's like Muggleborns are not even considered wizards. Completly different species.

***** How on earth does Muggle sound offensive? It doesn't rhyme with anything offensive, has no offensive normal counterpart, and no one is offended by it in the books. There's no reason to think it's offensive at all. And not one Muggleborn is offended by that term in the books either - it's descriptive, not offensive, and often precedes the term wizard anyway.

The idea behind nuggleborns being a different species doesn't come from the term, but from the racist wizards who tout the idea.

******* Pure blood /wizard/, halfblood /wizard/, muggleborn /wizard/. How is that a different race?

It has way more in line with British class-based social undertones than racism...

** "Muggle" has a sort of endearing quality to it.

"Mundane" implied dullness.

"No-Maj" has roots in the fear caused by witch hunts. Turning it into an us-versus-them situation.
