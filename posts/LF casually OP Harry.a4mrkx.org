Not sure how to explain what I'm looking for properly...

You know when Harry is older or a reincarnation or in another universe and he's just... "just Harry" and denies having Power or, quite in-character-ly, is oblivious to said Power? But it's quite obvious (maybe not all the time, and maybe not to everyone) he's ridiculously overpowered.

Like

(That's a thing, right? Or am I imagining patterns where there aren't any??)

#+begin_quote
  Harry: ((does something OP))

  Everyone else: how the f did you???

  Harry: ...what do you mean, can't everyone do that? / I didn't do anything, what are you talking about? I'm just a regular wizard, same as you, nothing special about me
#+end_quote

But like... /casually/. (Arrgghh am I making any sense?)

I can't even tell if this is an oddly specific request or too broad lol

Just link me any stories you think have that feel

*Edit:* wow, that's much more than I'd hope for! (guess my fear that his was too specific was unfounded, hehe) Y'all are awesome.

He is very casual about it in the same way a paratrooper would be casual about jumping out of airplanes while taking to a leg, but if you put them both on the ground they probably perform in a fairly similar manner.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Okay, I've seen this fic being rec'd before but I've never read it because I prefer to have a basis in that FNDM. It's why I haven't read any of the thousands of naruto crossovers with the main FNDM's that I read beside a random crossover with SAO that I was promptly confused by.

I knew who Kakashi was, and despite not wanting to I knew who Naruto was as well, since a youtuber I used to watch uses a skin of him.

Anyway, back to my point. Do I need a good grounding with Firefly? And If so can you point me to somewhere I could watch it easily?

*** You know what would be cool? A fic in which magic has no limits but society purposefully grooms every child to fundamentally believe there are limits. In fact, the whole concept of spells evolves out of limiting magic to do something extremely specific in a limited fashion.

Society does this because any time someone discovers that magic does not have limits, and they truly /believe/ it, the world inevitably goes to shit.

As such, a cool AU might be:

- There would be no magical cores, just perceptions on limits
- First years would be ridiculously powerful but not know it. Would be hilarious - they'd do stuff that would make Dumbledore balk and casually not notice
- Wizards who have traveled and explored would naturally find themselves more powerful as they examine more possibilities to reality
- You could have a system in which one person's perception of a magical limit is strong enough to overwhelm reality and prevent someone else from doing something
- The whole purpose of Hogwarts is to create these limits. Spells would be designed to become more flashier and thunderous and more uniquely useful as the years pass but would actually be less powerful and more limited than ever before. A first-year might just be able to wish a Triwizard Tournament dragon away, while a seventh-year results to flashy explosive curses and /seems/ more powerful to accomplish the same effect

Examples:

- Magic seems to stop working around Hermione and ghosts flicker out of existence because she just has such a hard time believing it exists at first.
- Neville created a whole forest from scratch as a kid and Augusta got scared and went overboard with teaching him limits before school, hence his incompetence
- Draco's father is rich and powerful because Draco believes his father is rich and powerful
- Phoenix tears heal because someone wrote it in every book and wanted a convenient out to any possible medical situation for future humans
- Lockhart /is/ actually ridiculously powerful, simply because he's mastered the art of obliviating his knowledge of magical limits away. This is why his books are contradictory nonsense, but he's actually done all of those things.

Um... don't hate me for saying this but I have some very serious recollection of this story existing. Where there are rules in place when teaching magic to basically keep kids from breaking the world. And if I remember what it is... I'll come tell u. (this is a placeholder).

[spoiler stuff] It's a post epilogue fic where Harry has gone into furniture creation rather than become an Auror. Ginny is murdered, and we quickly learn that she and Harry had been planning to divorce and she was seeing Draco Malfoy. Draco is arrested for the murder and confesses, so Harry asks Snape to take a look at Malfoy's memories, as he believes they have been tampered with. Snape and Kingsley Shacklebolt are in a relationship, and Kingsley left his position as acting minister due to the homophobia in Wizarding society. Snape continued to let them think he was dead and the two set up a home together. Until Harry arrives they hadn't even realized anyone knew he was alive. Something in Draco's memories tips them off that the murder may be related to a case that Kingsley is investigating, and from there a conspiracy unravels. Through spending time with Snape and Kingsley, Harry begins to question his own sexuality and has to go through the journey of rediscovering what he wants in life, since the last 20 years he has been living according to his children's best interests. The fic ends up being Severus/Kingsley/Harry, though they take a while getting there, paired with a lot of courtroom drama, murder attempts, a character dying, epic magic, etc (/spoiler)

That's probably a weak summary (the fic /is/ 525,000 words) but I tried to touch on the general themes. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like more information about.

***** Thank you. I'm glad I asked you because it looks like it's not my cup of tea.

As for formatting spoiler just remove the space between the >! !< and the text

******* Well apparently it didn't work but I don't know why. Maybe it can't be post edited? I tested and it worked on my side. I'm confused.

******** I think I got it this time! I just had to completely delete it and rewrite, instead of just erasing the space. I have no idea why, but it looks like it worked from my end.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
