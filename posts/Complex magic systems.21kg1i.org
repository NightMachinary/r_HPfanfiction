I'm a bit of a nerd for magic systems and just finished the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]], which had probably the most in-depth magic system I've seen in HP fanfiction.

I was wondering if there were any more stories that took this kind of liberties with magic. Not necessarily to the same end, but the idea of shifting away from the barely-described system in canon.


** Okay, so my first suggestions was Sacrifices :P but seeing as you've read that one, then my next suggestion would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]. While it's often recommended, it definitely deserves that right and fits what you're looking for. It is very long, very detailed look at a world where Voldemort won. Voldemort becomes Harry's mentor and uses his extreme intelligence to teach Harry lots and lots about magic.

Only caveat to this suggestion could be considered a spoiler, but it ends at the end of chapter one and it has made many a people (including myself) quit or almost quit. The very beginning has Heinrich-Harry. It's honestly just Harry trolling his family. It won't go past the first chapter. There are reasons, they are explained.

Sorry if this is ramble-ly or not clear, its late and I'm not thinking as clearly as I should. Just wanted to get this posted before I forget about it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope][Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]] was already mentioned, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8545947/1/Fractal][author is doing a rewrite, here.]]

I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] had a decently interesting magic system, though it is so far removed from canon is might as well have been its own book.

Shezza's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian series]] is one of my all-time favorites, and the magic system definitely gets interesting later on. It borrows heavily from the Dresden Files' magic system, but no prior knowledge is really necessary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][The Firebird series by Darth Marrs]] both does and doesn't fit your criteria. Magic is definitely changed in a different direction, though I haven't seen any actual, in-depth explanations.

Actually, now that I think about it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe]] fits a lot of your criteria. The magic in it definitely changes from canon, and it was in general very satisfying to read and see the rather unique ideas. It might be abandoned though, or the updates are just very slow.

I'll let you know if I remember any more, OP.

**** Heh, I was worried you would have already read most of the things I had posted.

In case you haven't read it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Joe's The Wasteland's of Time]] is considered one of the best fics out there, and for good reason. The magic system in that is clever, engaging, and fractured. That isn't to say it is missing in places like in canon, it is elaborated on and consistent, just not told all at once.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][Miranda Flairgold's series]] is a bit dated, but the magic system in it is still incredibly different and well put together. There's a whole new magic school, as well.

Sadly, it is most definitely abandoned, and it is so far removed from canon it could probably be reboxed and sold easily. Two books in the series were completed before it got abandoned.

Check out the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter Library]] by the way. The fics in there that get featured are well written, and quite a few have in depth magic systems.

****** I found a lot of the early chapters to be almost entirely exposition. McGonagall literally sits down the parents - along with the audience - and explains aspects of the magical world.

After that though, it does get much better. In my opinion, it drags in places, but the plot is in general pretty solid. The world building was definitely the best part.

I bloody hated the Quidditch though. It was probably the best written Quidditch I've read, but jeez there were so many games of it.

****** Yeah, I think the same. I read the whole thing recently, as far as updated to in Book 2, and it really feels too OOC / OC for me. Obviously a lot of the characters are going to be different if a lot more of them are girls, but even so, it just feels like fanservice most of the time. And it's fic- by definition, it's already fanservice. I don't know. It might be that it's just not my thing. :)

However, in 100k words it managed to just barely make it to Halloween, first year, before being abandoned. Thus, the plot doesn't really go anywhere.

** Can you say more about what you want to read about?

Do you like people talking about runes? Linguistics of magic? Will to power stuff? Spell building? Discovering old magic over again?

Magical cores (by any other name) are a big point of contention, as they suggest a lot about how magic works. It boils down to, can you cast forever, until you run out of energy to talk and wave a wand? Or are there, for lack of a better term, "magic points?"

Systems exist in the middle, including: it uses up mental energy to cast, so it is like doing really hard math problems in your head to do magical spells correctly. And you simply stop being able to concentrate after a while. But that means people like Dumbledore and Hermione, who are mentally head and shoulders over others, and Harry, who gets...intense sometimes, still have an advantage.

Some people don't like the idea that magic isn't perfectly egalitarian. They will fight violently against any system that tries to limit or power-categorize magic. So what's your expectation?

I've seen it all, but it sounds like you're looking for something specific, where the plot revolves around learning about magic. I'll look through my lists and see what I can find. But most magic-focused stories seem to not be very long, and often aren't complete.

*** Anything with "harder" rules than the canon was what I was looking for. Something with internal consistency. Incorporating runes or some other new form to the magic is absolutely alright with me, as is their absence. I just want it to make more sense.

I'm sort of the opposite of those people you talked about. I don't really want or need everyone equal. They're all clearly not. Tom Riddle was doing things as a self-taught 11 year old that wouldn't be possible to a lot of older wizards. Hell, he wouldn't be such a threat if he wasn't better in some way. So what I'm trying to say is, I think I'd prefer a system where everyone /isn't/ equal.

And the plot doesn't really need to center on learning magic, but I'd prefer it if the magic stood out as more...finished than canon, if that makes sense. And yeah, I've been looking, but it seems most people have a cool idea, then burn out relatively quickly.

Thank you so much for all your help.

**** /Spent an hour looking around my follows and favs list and found these. Take a look and see what you think./

--------------

One of the best examples I have of a totally new magic system is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]]. This fic also does some moderately heavy technomagic.

Be warned though, this a crossover. Also, I hate it.

It went off the rails later on and simply lost me. The author seems to be obsessed with her OCs (which aren't even from either HP or the crossover world), and she seems to get some personal issues involved, including religion. Also, /maybe/ some minor and passive homophobia in the world building. Yuck.

But still worth a read until it goes to shit if, for nothing else, to see the unique use of magic in it. And for Sherlock Holmes solving every Hogwarts year's problem in like thirty seconds, once he actually learns about it.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/12/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] is an oddly spelled example of a character getting early information and then trying harder. Has some stuff on what that might be like, and some good magical gadget use too. Worth a go, but right on the edge of what I'd recommend, quality wise.

--------------

Ultra long, ultra sappy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] sets the bar for both fuzzy and innocent Snape and Harry Feels, but also nails Super Healer Harry perfectly. Lots of healing magic, mostly "Parselmagic" style stuff. Good enough writing, but nine-out-of-ten dentists suggest brushing and flossing after reading.

--------------

Speaking of Snape: nothing like a good Slytherin Hermione with Mean Mentor Snape fic. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]], she has to learn about magic quick to survive, and this leads to some interesting moments of discovery. Not super-heavy on the magic, but a lot more than canon.

--------------

Harry has an odd time travel accident and does some magical training to fight Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. The time travel mechanism is well done and logically consistent, and the world is well worked out. A well-done, strong Voldemort counters a powerful Harry in the pre-Hogwrats days ('91) setting. Some new magic and how it might work to actually train to fight with magic is the main reason I include this one on the list. Also, it is a good story.

--------------

A serious take on goblin magic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] makes it one of the most unique fics out there. Doesn't make goblins simpering morons or heroic underclass superheroes like some lesser (/cough/HarryCrow/cough/) fics. Unfortunately, likely abandoned by now. Sad. Still, a good read.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] is a D&D crossover fic (Hey wait! Where are you going?!) where two different magical systems are explored in detail. Painful, powergaming detail. Not quite a crackfic, as it has some very, very serious moments, but not exactly sober either.

--------------

I'm not sure if I want to recommend this one. But then, I always think that. And I also end up recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evens and the Spiral Path]]. This fic is /dark/. Not silly-power-fantasy "dark," like the kids write nowadays. Really black.

The world is not a friendly place, evil things happen to normal people for no reason -- or worse, cold, unfeeling reasons -- and everyone is screwed no matter what the hero does. Rape, abuse, and body horror are the bread and butter of this fic. And again, it is ultra-mature (almost more so than you'd think FFN would allow) but it is done professionally. King, Romero, or Craven would be fitting comparisons to Wordhammer's style, but also Hitchcock. Apparently, I want Wordhammer to have my creative fiction bab- OH GOD NO, THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!

Original (and horrible) use of common canon spells, and also some new bio-magical stuff that just...ugh. You were warned, but also recommended.

--------------

On a slightly lighter note, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], Hermione plays with time magic. Original use of runes. Fun. Not ever likely to be completed, but interesting still. My vote for best use of rational time travel in a fanfic.

--------------

Still keeping it light, next comes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage]] -- a total crackfic. But it is still fun. A comic book approach to magic, because it is a crossover with Marvel, specifically Ironman. A fun little fic, and still updating.

--------------

Look. If you know about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] and hate it, say no more. If you haven't heard of it before, you really should read it and form your own opinion. It has, unsurprisingly, the most rational treatment of magic out there, including an original take on Transfigurations. Hate it or love it, MOR is the most popular currently updating HP fanfic out there, and arguably the most widely popular fanfic /ever/.

--------------

/And that ends my list. I'm sure I missed some obvious ones, even ones I've got on my favs list on FFN, but that should do to start. Lots of authors have in/ their /favorites lists fics like the ones they write, so that would be a good place to expand on from here. Good luck./

#+begin_quote
  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
#+end_quote

Focuses heavily on Alchemy and the Magnum Opus. Pretty interesting.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/59676?view_adult=true][Transfigurations]]

#+begin_quote
  Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry returns to England to help re-open Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Written before Order of the Phoenix. Includes a bit of Latin American and Native American magic. It also introduces Calligromancy, which works kiiiind of like a computer language, and the concept of magical mines.

Both are Harry/Draco.
