:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It had Harry and Voldemort as the last survivors of the war trying to kill each other. But they are both so damn powerful they just kinda stalemate. Eventually they have an amicable relationship built around meeting, trying to kill each other. Have lunch at McDonald's or Burger King, then they blow it up. Tom discovers a ritual where they both get sent to different alternate universes. It's a crack fic to be certain, but the idea of Harry and the dark lord meeting at a fast food chain and then blowing it up is hilarious
