I'm pretty sure it was a Bella/Harry but It might not be a Bella/harry fic so if there is another fic that matches this, still link it.but it's in the marauders era, but the only part I remember is that there was a dueling tournament and Harry's first duel was against one of the Lestrange brothers(which he takes out quite easily), then the prize of winning the tournament is a duel against Dumbledore, then goes onto to describe an amazing duel. I also think it has a part where harry saves andromeda in Diagon Alley. I'm pretty sure he has a little duel at Diagon Alley aswell but I'm not 100% sure though
