I'm looking for good fics that include a well-done life debt tradition. Preferably life debts that are based on honor or demand political favors, protection and sponsorship, etc. rather than ones that bind the debtor to slavery or similar. And suggestions?

The day that Harry stops Draco Malfoy and his son from being bothered in the middle of Diagon Alley starts a strange series of interactions between him and Malfoy. Who knew there was a pure-blood custom for every situation?

*** In "Patron", life debts can be "paid back" in various ways, depending on the people involved. Sponsorship, protection, saving someone's life, etc.

And they are not a good thing to have hanging over one's head.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
