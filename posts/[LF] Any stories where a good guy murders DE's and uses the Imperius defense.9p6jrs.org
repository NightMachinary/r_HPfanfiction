I was wondering if anyone had done a story where someone obviously and blytantly murders Death Eaters and during their trial uses the Imperius defense, like Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and the rest did the first time around?


** He doesn't use the Imperius defense, but he does kill death eaters here: Linkffn(106100761)

*** Considering the death toll that Voldemort and co managed to rack up and the fact that the vast majority of them walked away with no consequences i'd argue that yes.. it is.. (and to be fair the point i was trying to convey was that i wanted someone sided on the "light side" as opposed to "gray" or "black" to use clichéed terms)

I would rephrase it into “Revenge happens when the legal authority fails”.

**** Well thats the thing. People do the most horrible things when they think they are doing the right thing. That is basically what leads the biggest wrongs in the world.

Revenge is justice done wrong.

***** But when justice fails revenge may be the only option left.. Which is what i am after here.. Because the odds of /someone/ having an axe to grind in post 1981 Magical Britain is pretty damn high, and i thought that them getting the justice that the courts failed to provide and then using the very same defense is delicious irony..

********* You seem to be really hung up on that word.. And i will reiterate.. My use of the words Good guys in the title was simply because it was two convenient words to get across what i was looking for here.. e.g. Not death eaters or neutrals.. That is also why i only use the words Good Guys in the title and not the main text of the post..

************* Looks pretty clear to me. The world exists in more shades than just black and white. Sometimes murdering war criminals is the only way to punish them. Sometimes, despite the truth everyone knows, the government does nothing.

************** Indeed. I couldnt agree more. But there is a difference between justice and revenge. Revenge ultimately only empoweres the arugments of the other side
