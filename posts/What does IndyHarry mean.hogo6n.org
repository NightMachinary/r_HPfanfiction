I could probably look this up but I'm too lazy to do that so instead I'll ask Reddit. I've seen this tag a lot but I have no clue what it means.


** Independent Harry, I believe. Afaik it usually means a Harry who dislikes both Voldemort & Dumbledore and becomes independent. As a trope it's usually associated with being pretty edgy - like having teen Harry angry at everyone trying to control him and being OP and super smart and forming his own (often Grey) side in the war.

** It means "Independent Harry", which seems to usually be code for "Harry In Name Only Dumbledore Bashing Power Fantasy".

Whenever I see it, though, I think "Indiana Jones Harry". Which would be much more awesome.

** For me, an Indy!Harry is an independent Harry, meaning a Harry that stands up for himself. He doesn't have to be anti Dumbledore or a Lord, but just someone with a backbone, unlike the Harry from Canon. For example, if McGonagal won't help him regarding Snapes bullying, he just stops attending Potions, and explains that he would only go back if the Professor promises to actually teach, and stop bullying him. Another would be where he actually cracks down and is actually serious about his studying, over the objections of Ron.
