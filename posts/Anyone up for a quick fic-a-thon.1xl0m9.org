Albus shivered and immediately regretted sending away the Phoenix. The blowing wind and rain cut through his fur-lined cloak and gloves, penetrating to his very core. Before him stood the grim fortress, the terrible message carved above it's doors:

"For the Greater Good."

Albus shivered; a different chill entirely. He hated this place, and so did Fawkes. That was why he'd sent her away. She'd return shortly, however, once this final task was complete.

He stepped up to the doors which opened to admit him, and he stepped out of the rain, though the cold remained.

The Aurors were deferential, of course, all but genuflecting to the Supreme Mugwump.

"A pleasure, Sir!"

"An honor to have you here, Sir."

"Allow me to take your coat, Sir."

Albus took this in stride. The youngest ones were the worst, the ones who rotated in and out of this dismal station on an annual basis. This visit was, in actuality, one of the few things of note to happen in this place. Somehow, this made their groveling even worse.

There was one guard, however, who did not rotate. He had been stationed here for over fifty years, refusing other postings outright. He never spoke of it to the young ones, the ones who changed with the seasons. He'd fought in the war. He knew who was held here, and the cost to make it so.

This old guard simply nodded to Albus. It was the 51st nod he'd given the aged wizard. Albus returned it in kind.

Their deference, of course, did not translate to a lack of security precautions. He'd be searched, his wand would be held, his trinkets deposited.

"Terribly sorry for this, Sir."

"Protocol is protocol, Sir."

"I hope you understand, Sir."

The old guard merely nodded, and Albus handed him his wand. A small smile crept up on Albus. After all these years, the irony never escaped him.

How much had gone into acquiring that wand? The lives lost? Things destroyed? So much done to get it into Albus' hands, only to hand it over in /here/, so close to /him/.

This was /his/ place, Albus knew. Built by him, to hold his worst enemies.

In a way, it had fulfilled its mission.

"Your ambition nearly destroyed us all, Gellert," Albus whispered, not unkindly. "Even yourself..."

Dispossessed of his wand, deluminator, small bag of Phoenix kibble, tin of lemon drops, and a small assortment of baubles, he stepped past the guard station.

Albus waved off the proffered escort. Such was his /grande and moste honoured/ privilege as Supreme Mugwump. And besides, he knew the way.

Another benefit of his station: freedom to visit this place with neither inquiry nor suspicion whenever the urge took him, which was once a year. In truth, this perk was one of the reason why he bothered to retain the office, though he'd never admit as much to his 'most esteemed colleagues of the ICW.'

"Hundreds of the world's most powerful and accomplished witches and wizards," He thought sardonically as he made his way up the winding stair to its zenith, "Put them together, and they struggle to agree on what color wallpaper should adorn their headquarters."

Such was the terrible, most ancient power of committee. The second most powerful force in the Magical world.

Albus had reached the top of the stair and reached out for the dull iron handle on the oaken door.

But it was that /first/ power that brought him here today, and compelled him to return every year.

He turned the knob and stepped through.

The room was not overly large, though it's space was further halved, bisected by the row of goblin-wrought silver bars at intervals of 6 inches. The walls were cold stone and, thought it held the highest perch in this fell fortress, little light reached the interior.

Through the bars, on the far side of the room, a bundle of rags stirred itself.

The rags spoke, "You came early this year. Though... perhaps time has finally escaped me..."

Albus shook his head, "No, you have the right of it, Gellert. Allow me, then, to wish you an anticipatory 'Happy Birthday'."

"How thoughtful..." The rags whispered. "Did you, by chance remember my gift?"

"Every year," Albus said softly, "you ask."

The rags coughed. "Ja."

"Before I enter, they dispossess me of everything save the clothes on my back."

The rags chuckled dryly, "And I always hope that their policy will change..." He looked up to meet Albus' eyes, "...One way or the other."

Albus could not help the smile that quirked the corner of his mouth.

They chatted for a while, about the good times: the adventures shared, the great quest endeavored, and of the nights. Only the good times, that was the unspoken rule. And those times, short as they had been, /had/ been good enough to endure.

But as the conversation drew on, the prisoner began to eye Albus curiously, near suspiciously. At last, the reverie of things remembered was broken with a question.

**** "You came early this year. Why?"

Albus stilled, "Is it so obvious?"

"There's a reason for everything you do. What was your reason in this?"

Albus responded hesitantly, "A question..."

The prisoner stiffened, and moved back from the bars slightly.

After a moment, Albus asked, "How does one beat an unbeatable foe?"

The prisoner grimaced, "Do you mock me? /YOU/ of all people?"

"No, Gellert. I-"

"Has it finally come to this? You've come to flaunt your victory at last?"

Albus' eyes widened, "Never. You know-"

The prisoner cut him off with a bark of bitter laughter, "What do /I/ know of beating unbeatable foes, Albus? The world has made /you/ the authority on such matters. Here is the proof!" He spread his arms wide. "Do you not see it? Maybe the world has forgotten. Only you and the gaolers travel this high anymore!"

There was silence, and neither man responded. The prisoner glared in fury at his old foe, and his older friend. But perhaps that was gone to him as well, and then he would have nothing.

"I never asked you," Albus said, "about how it happened."

The prisoner spat back, "Because I /told/ you never to ask!"

"You had the wand," Albus whispered, "and yet..."

"Oh? Is that it then? Have you finally met your match with Old Tom? You fear that wand shall fail you, as you believe it failed me? Well, rest assured /old friend/, you have nothing to fear on that count. You are far too /ambitious./ You never move without a purpose."

Albus recoiled, as if struck.

"Well?" the prisoner prompted. "Is that it then? Would you cash in your final coin for an answer? I shall give it if you ask, and then you must /never/ return here again."

Albus stood silent, as if lost in thought.

The prisoner let out a mirthless chuckle. "You deliberate." His voice was cold. "You play your games, move your pawns, and wonder if this pathetic piece is finally worth the sacrifice. Well, take me off the board then. I grow weary..."

Albus' looked up at his friend, "No. Never. Not you..." He stepped forward and lifted his hands, still bound in fur gloves, towards the silver bars. He began to reach through them.

The prisoner's eyes widened, "No, Albus! Don't!"

Albus' hands passed through the bars and reached into the cell.

The prisoner gaped. That should not have been possible; /nothing/ passed the plane of the bars and survived. He should know; they were of his design, after all.

Albus stood there, arms outstretched, and waited.

Slowly, like a startled animal, the prisoner made his approach. "H-how..."

Albus smiled sadly, "It wouldn't be magic if I revealed all my tricks." The prisoner stared. "Though, I was saving this one, for when the time was right..."

The prisoner, so long without human contact, reached out his own unbelieving hands. Slowly, he entwined them into that of his old friend.

And then he recoiled.

"Albus! Your hand..."

Albus did not move, his sad smile did not waver. The prisoner reached out tentatively, and removed the glove from the old wizard's left hand.

For all the horrors the prisoner had seen, and those he committed, he still shivered at the sight of the blackened, withered thing before him.

His eyes darted between the hand and his friend's eyes, calculating and figuring in a way he'd not done in half a century. His gaze finally settled on the blue eyes. "This is it, then?"

Albus nodded, and reached his unmarred hand out to take his friend's, and squeezed it gently. "Alas, I saved by best trick for last."

***** "Then, the unbeatable foe..." the prisoner whispered.

"Must Not be Named."

"You still posses it? The wand?"

Albus nodded, "Thus, should I perish to /his/ curse..."

Nothing more need be said on that matter. Both knew who the wand would choose as its next master should such a thing come to pass.

"Is there time then?" The prisoner asked. "Can he be beaten before the end?"

"Come now, Gellert," Albus smiled wryly, "Were that the case, I would not have asked such an impertinent question."

The prisoner squeezed his hand and then, after a moment, took the maimed one as well. His expression grew serious. "You wish to know then, how one who possessed the wand could be beaten?"

"It was never my intent to ask, nor to ask why I mustn't ask. But yes."

The prisoner nodded and paused, looking into Albus' eyes. "I was selfish."

"Gellert, your reasons for not discussing this were your own. It wasn't selfish to refuse to dredge up-"

"No," the prisoner cut in. "Not selfish to withhold my knowledge." He swallowed dryly. "Selfishness is what lead to my defeat. My selfishness was my downfall..."

Albus did not speak, prompting the prisoner to continue.

"You were there, Albus, from the beginning. You shared my ambition..." The prisoner scowled, "/For the greater good./ Bah! So much evil done for four cursed words. And yet I persisted, waded through a sea of blood in search of green pastures.."

"That is passed us now..." Albus soothed.

"Ambition... it reared its head in those four words, and it surely would have consumed me."

Albus did not argue this fact, "And yet it did not consume you in the end. Why, old friend?"

"Because I was selfish, Albus! I stood across from you at the end, in a field of fire and destruction that we had wrought! You had the phoenix, but /I/? I had the /wand/! Unbeatable! Invincible! All it asks for is the ambition- the will to power."

There were tears in the prisoner's eyes, foreign things to him like the warmth of the sun, like anything but cold stone beneath his feet.

"But then I looked at you Albus, /truly/ looked. I saw the ferocity in you, the passion. You would stand before me, ready to die, like in all those childish vows we made in our quest for the Hallows. We swore we'd give our lives... for the greater good..."

The prisoner sagged. "But there, in that field, I saw you. And I remembered... I'd thought myself the deliverer of the wizarding world, a Magical Moses. But I saw you, and knew that you would perish before you laid aside your wand. I would lose you at the last..."

"Gellert..." Albus whispered, eyes glistening.

"And I asked myself, 'What is the use of the 'greater good' if, at the end, there was nothing /good/ left for me?" He smiled sadly. "You see? I was selfish. I was spent. In that moment, my ambition left me, and so too did the power of the wand."

"Oh, Gellert..." Albus said softly, and he raised his hand to the prisoner's cheek. "Gellert... why didn't you tell me?"

"I... I was ashamed. All the things done in the name of my ambition, tossed aside because I could not get what /I/ wanted. Hypocritical. /Weak./"

"It wasn't weakness, Gellert. Nor hypocrisy, nor selfishness."

Gellert looked at him, a mixture of hope and doubt carved into his face. "What was it, then?"

Albus smiled, "A force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. The same force that brings me here, to you."

The two old friends stood there for a long time, neither speaking. Albus knew this admission had taken much from his old friend, and he lamented now that they would not have the time to heal this, the final wound. Even after all this time, it seemed that there was so much left unsaid.

And so Albus, never one for half measures, decided to say nothing more on the matter. Instead, he spoke with a surprising levity. "Oh! I almost forgot. I found something that you simply /must/ see."

The prisoner eyed his friend quizzically. Albus lifted his maimed hand, and turned it so that the back faced his friend.

The prisoner had not noticed the ring worn there, the metal had been scored by curse until its tarnished surface all but blended into the darkened flesh. The reverse side however, had been set with a black gem. A series of small scratches had been worked into the stone and, as the prisoner leaned closer to examine it, his eyes expanded.

"Mein Gott... Albus, is that...?"

"Finding it once meant the world to us, Gellert. Well, one third of the world really, if one goes by the arithmancy of it. I thought you should see it, to know that we didn't quest after fairy tales."

The prisoners eyes were filled with a childlike wonderment, and his face seemed to shed years. He clapped his hands and nearly jumped for joy, his previous laments all but forgotten.

"Baba Yaga's tits! You found it. And you snuck it in here? How?"

Albus gave him a withering look, "Really now, Gellert. I am the Supreme Mugwump and a wizard of advanced years. What guard would dare deny such a man his /gloves/ on such an abysmally cold day?"

The prisoner laughed. "And tell me, what great power has the stone granted you?"

Albus chuckled, "Why, it's going to kill me, of course!"

"Of course!"

Both men continued laughing, and in that moment they felt young again.

They conversed for another hour about the old days, and the bloody damned Hallows that, in the end, would be the end of them both. There was no bitterness, nor remorse, at least not for the time they had shared, as short as it had been.

In the end, the conversation wound down slowly, as such conversations were want to do. Albus made a gift of his fur-lined gloves to the prisoner, along with a heartfelt apology that such a small thing was unworthy of their friendship. The prisoner did not hear this, as he was raptly focused on sliding the gloves over his long-chilled, arthritic hands. He smiled at himself as he flexed his fingers, like a child at Christmas. Albus had offered to let him hold the ring, but this was waved off casually. Such things were inconsequential now.

They said their goodbyes, choosing to run with their long-practiced script, neither mentioning that this would be their last meeting.

Albus turned to leave and had is hand on the door when Gellert called out from behind.

"That ring, it was Riddle's wasn't it? He had the stone all along."

"Assuredly. Turned it into a /Horcrux/ of all things. Can you imagine?"

Gellert let out a disgusted huff, "Impudent little whelp. You think he even knew what he had?"

"I am unsure, though I hope he did. Let him try his hand at the quest; see if he fares any better than /us./"

Gellert laughed. "Oh, I suspect he knows. For all his madness, he /is/ clever. No doubt he is following the trail of the wand as we speak. Imagine his surprise when it leads back to you!"

Albus did not smile at this, as the revelation struck him, "Gellert... If he is following the trail of the wand..."

"He will find Gregorovitch, if he has not already. That old man could never keep his mouth shut. And that will lead him to me!"

Albus saw that Gellert was smiling. "Voldemort will find a way in here. His power of incursion and ward-breaking exceeds even my own. You won't be safe here. I could have you transferred-"

Gellert waved this off. "Please, and miss an opportunity to tell Tom, 'Du kannst mich mal?' Nein. Whichever of us first sets off on the next great journey, let the other not be far behind."

"That is your wish?"

"I look forward to it," Gellert grinned, revealing stained and broken teeth. "And may our /next/ adventure be more fortuitous than the last."

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was smiling as he collected his possessions from the security station at the base of Nurmengaard, being sure to conceal his ungloved hands in his pockets as much as possible, like a child feigning innocence in a sweets shop.

He was handed his deluminator.

"A pleasure to have you here, Sir!"

Phoenix kibble.

"We hope you visit again soon, Sir!"

Lemon Drops and baubles.

"It's been an honor, Sir. Truly an honor!"

Finally, the old guard stood at silent attention and held out, unbeknownst to him, a wooden stick of incalculable power. Albus pocket the wand and, after the briefest pause, took the old guard's hand and shook it firmly.

If the guard took note of this unusual gesture, or that the old wizard was missing his gloves, he said nothing. He met Albus' eyes and nodded once. Albus smiled, and nodded back, and then walked out the doors.

The rain and wind were still blowing, but the cold did not bite as deep as it had before, even without his gloves. His question had been answered, far truer than even Gellert realized, and a long-held suspicion had been confirmed.

Fawks appeared on cue and squawked at his master. This meeting had taken longer than expected, and Albus had another appointment to keep, with yet another adventurer. That young man's quest would be terrible indeed, but now there was hope that he could succeed, that he would meet a more fortuitous end than two, broken old men.

How does one beat an unbeatable foe?

"With love." He whispered.

Man and bird vanished in a flash of orange light.

*

It's like being watched. This nagging sort of up-all-night, over-your-shoulder watched. Sometimes it creeps up like a long night: darkness, the whisper of a touch. Other times it is a full-body heave, or a lightning strike. Just when he thinks there is nothing but himself, that he is alone, he feels it, like a lick on the nape of his neck, or a finger tracing up to the crown of his skull. Not his head, but his skull. It is inside him, a very part of him, skulking in his bones, a gathering storm. It wakes him in the middle of the night. His body is quick to consciousness, a jolt, all tension. His eyes are slower to that point, his mind further behind. When he opens his eyes he isn't quite sure of his surroundings, the darkness is familiar but he can't trust it - like déjà vu.

It takes more nights like this, sudden thrusts into wakefulness, his heart pounding, this feeling of eyes in the darkness, both trained on him, before the ache begins.

"Are you paying attention, Harry?"

"Hm?"

"Did you hear what I just said?"

Ginny is sprawled on the grass by the lake. The day is hot and calm, her ankle socks are disposed of near her school bag. The air stirs in brief intervals, like quick, slow exhales. Steady. But still, it is hot, the first really warm day of the year. /Unbearably so,/ Harry feels, yet doesn't quite feel at all.

It's happening more and more often, these feelings he can't quite reconcile as his own. Yet they exist in him fully formed, reflexive, instant responses.

"Of course I did. You were telling me about Potions?"

"Well, five minutes ago I was!" She throws her head back, letting it fall behind her in a stretch. A single drop of sweat rolls down her skin, down her throat and to her décolletage, down further, lost between her breasts.

Something stirs inside Harry, a conflict, a longing. Open-mouthed, gazing, he gets lost in her skin. He feels the way he thinks he must have always felt while gazing at this creature. The way she lies - she is all at once this woman, barefoot in the grass, and the pale girl, close to death, he rescued from a chamber. She relaxes into her pose, limp in the sun. He is both watching her and watching himself watch her, his mind drifts to the question he once had of what would happen if you faced a mirror before another mirror, and what if one of those mirrors was the one of Erised? What would you see? What would eternity look like, magnified by desire? Is that a sight of which humans are capable?

He imagines it would look like this.

Ginny opens one eye and holds Harry in her squinted gaze.

"Potter. You're drooling."

And it isn't that he wants to, but more that he has to, in fact all of his mind screams and rails at his tensing muscles, but their momentum builds and grows and carries him, there is jealousy burning through his skin and boring into his very marrow. It happens both in slow motion and quicker than he thought he was capable of moving, over and over again in replay. He pounces, teeth bared. His hand catches her throat and she splutters incoherently, the breath trapped inside her lungs. Her arms flail and move to throw him off of her but he is consumed by something inhuman, his one hand driving her closer to the ground and the other coming down on her arm, his knee coming up to pin her entirely.

Her face loses color, her eyes flash at him, frightened, but then soften.

It is not the first time she has been held this way. To her, Harry is both the boy who carried her away on phoenix-back from an underground cavern, and the boy who once kept her there.
