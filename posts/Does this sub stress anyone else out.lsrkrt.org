Like, I'm a few chapters into posting my canon divergence fic. It's plot-focused but obviously people like to read romance and it's a fun subplot to write --- I was planning to write romance into it anyway. But what I didn't realize was that people hate a lot of ships (other than Haphne, it appears) with a burning passion. People on here also seem to hate a lot of ships where the two characters are the same gender (M/M, especially).

It's honestly beginning to stress me out. Are people going to stop reading halfway through even though they ostensibly liked the plot to get that far just because of a NOTP? Am I going to alienate readers by writing an unpopular ship, even if I feel that the character dynamics are worth writing about?

I write mostly for myself and I will stick to what pairings work best for the plot, but I wouldn't be posting my work if I didn't want people to read it and enjoy it.

For context, I don't care about pairings when I read. There are some I like more than others, but I don't have NOTPs and thus wasn't aware that they were so prevalent.

Obviously, everyone is entitled to like/dislike whatever, just in case people think I'm criticizing them for having NOTPs. This is just me overthinking stuff, okay?


** I think you shouldn't worry about this sub and write what you want. This sub's tastes, criticisms, etc are almost in sharp contrast to the majority of fan fiction readers, writers, and the fandom as a whole.

HP/ DM, HP/HG, & HG/DM are still fan fiction favs. SS/HP, SS/HG, HP/TMR, and RL/SB is still vv popular. I won't get into individual characters, but you get the gist.

Those of us who have you stressed are a vocal minority, probably even on this sub.

And if you're after slash fic advice, I'm sure [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] would be happy to help.

I guess it's just surprising to hear that ships are so divisive, since I don't usually spend that much time in reader-focused spaces. Even outside of this sub, people still tend strongly prefer certain ships.

And I'm legitimately curious why ships are such a big deal in general, since I spend so much time messing with my draft and outline, but mostly left ships to the side as something to add later because they wouldn't affect the plot that much. To me, it was an afterthought.

But yeah, it does not take much to send me into an overthinking spiral. üå™

There will, of course, be people who drop your story because of the ship, but speaking as someone who is anti-Harmony, I willing read a story that included it because I enjoyed the main plot and the ship remained a subplot.

#+end_quote

People view Harry (or whichever character they identify with) as their avatar in the HP world; the decision of who to pair that character with is nothing less than the decision of who the reader themselves would want as their romantic partner.

So encountering a pairing you dislike is like having an unwanted romantic partner thrust upon you. If I read Draco Malfoy and Harry kissing, I am not observing this as a third party. Rather, the reading experience is one of Draco Malfoy kissing /me/. Which, since I am not gay, I do not like.

This is not limited to romance, of course. You will find that you alienate readers any time your main character does something that the reader would not aspire to do themselves.

** I wouldn't worry. This sub can feel like an authority but it isn't - there are some people with very strong opinions and some stories that are seen as the ideal, but the sub itself is it's own niche audience. For example, this sub skews quite heavily male when fanfic in general skews female.

I do empathise with you. I had a similar issue a few years ago and ended up drifting away from this sub and the discord channel, now I only lurk here and comment occasionally. I'm a canon compliant author who prefers to receive constructive criticism when I solicit it from people I trust, and I prefer character work to massive epics. None of that exactly makes me an outcast here in itself, but I'm definitely in the minority, and the way some people spoke about things I liked and even my own stories sometimes ended up making me feel pretty miserable. I moved to other, smaller communities and felt a bit more secure in my work.

I found that there is always an audience, even if it's not a mass one. Likewise, there is always some arsehole with an opinion.

**** I would recommend this. I recently found this sub and started dabbling in it, and I'm shocked at how little it represents ‚Äúmy‚Äù corner of the HP fandom, which dates back to a very active livejournal community in the early ‚Äò00s, very very heavily dominated by women and heavily slash positive; there was also a strong contingent of academics. My strong belief is that the reader-as-character-avatar approach described in comments here did/does not resonate at all with that community, for example. I'm also shocked by the profound lack of tolerance or understanding of slash, the absolutist approach toward characters, and various other attitudes that are entirely foreign to my experience.

I don't say this to claim that my tastes or experience represents ‚Äútrue‚Äù HP fandom - just to illustrate that there's a whole world of HP fandom out there that isn't this sub. But do take a look at the most popular HP stories on AO3 - the ones with the most kudos or bookmarks over the past year or two. Most of these certainly don't reflect the tastes of this sub.

All of which is to say, write what you want, and don't look to this sub as if it reflects the views or tastes of the majority of the audience for your work.

The safest pairings (or harems) here seem to be Harry or Neville paired off with most female characters. Hermione getting paired off with anyone seems to get downvoted too since it's not from a guy's perspective.

*** I've noticed that too, and yet a large majority of stories that make up HP fanfiction world are generally written by women, but they are all still wildly popular (if you go by favs/kudos/comments and follows).

I always see the same stories being recommended here (like Prince of Slytherin, Methods of Rationality(??) etc) which I don't quite understand, cause there are literally thousands of other stories that are as good, or better, but rarely get the same attention.

So, I guess regardless that this sub may majorly be comprised of a certain demographic, OP should just write what they want because chances are, it'll probably do well regardless of ship.

#+end_quote

Yes to both. People are also going to stop reading (or disregard it before reading) for a whole variety of other reasons. But you're not going to alienate /all/ readers.

It's impossible to write something that will appeal to everyone, and very difficult to write something that appeals to the majority. But you can still get a lot of readers who will enjoy your work.

If you try to please everyone, you'll end up pleasing no one. And the quality of the work will go tremendously downhill. Just do your best to write your vision for your story. You can listen to feedback and constructive criticism, of course, but use your own judgement on whether to actually implement it: Would it really improve the story you want to tell, or is it trying to change the story to something else? Would implementing it reduce/destroy your own enjoyment in writing the story (which is the most important thing in terms of writing quality and actually completing the fic)? Things like that.

And remember that even if one review is all you get, it's still only one person's opinion. It's not 100% of opinions. You don't have to take what it says as any more important than if it were surrounded by 100 other opinions. For a hobby like fanfiction (something you do for enjoyment), your own opinion is very much the most important thing.

Yeah, if I really cared that much about appealing to the masses, I wouldn't have an OC as one of the three main characters. I do take concrit but if people try to tell me what pairings they want there is a 99.9% chance of me completely ignoring them.

I had just never really considered a pairing (especially if it's a subplot) one of the most divisive things in a fic. So this sub is a bit of a culture shock for me.

  Are people going to stop reading halfway through even though they ostensibly liked the plot to get that far just because of a NOTP? Am I going to alienate readers by writing an unpopular ship, even if I feel that the character dynamics are worth writing about?
#+end_quote

Yes, and Yes.

You're not overthinking it. Harry Potter is a blank slate with the minimum characterization necessary for the plot, to make it easy for young readers to project themselves onto him. You aren't shipping Harry Potter, you're shipping whoever the reader projected onto Harry Potter (usually themselves) with your romantic partner.

*** Interesting! I never saw Harry as a blank slate character, tbh. To me, at least, he has a pretty defined sense of morality, motivations, and personality, although I see what you mean about him being relatable.

** There is a lot of reasons why I (or someone else in this sub) would nope out of a fic, then there is a lot of reasons why someone will stick to it. It does not worth getting riled up about it, write what you feel... and I think for most of us it's not just a yes/no. For example I'm not particualrly fond of M/M as a main pairing, but I dont mind sidecharacters being that... unless it starts to take over the plot. Just like with pretty much everything the delivery is the key. (But don't get anxious about that either, as long as you reread the story and feel content with it, you have accomplished what you had to accomplish and the love of the fandom will hopefully follow ;) )

** You will write Harry/Fleur exclusively and marry Loras Tyrell and that will be the end of it.

*** Haha. I have nothing against the ship, it just never captured my imagination enough to write about.
