Basically, I'm looking for fics where Harry travels back in time, not to the Marauders' era, or Tom Riddle's time. But, actually, before that like 1910s or you know before that. Maybe be posed as his great-grandfather's, Henry, brother or something, Dumbledore's Hogwarts years... I mean, there are so many fics about traveling to the his parents time, or Riddle's, I just need some change.


** linkffn(A Long Journey Home; The Wizard From Earth) are good ones.

** This is my favourite young Dumbledore fic /and/ one of my favourite time travel fics. There's slash obviously (Dumbledore is gay, as we all know), but nothing explicit whatsoever.

*** So it kinda flows like Arrow. That's interesting. Do the flashback chapters also coincide with the arcs similar to how Slade, constantine, and even the Russian were introduced during the flashbacks, but obviously less with people(considering how long ago it was), and maybe more skills, techniques, and maybe even just insight.

** There was a series where Harry and his friends end up in 3 or 4 different times. First, founders. Then, Voldemort then marauders (I think). Might have been on ffa.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13066026/1/Weeping-Angel][Weaping Angle]] by impossibleleaf is a good one with harry traveling into dumbledore years at Hogwarts. Has my favorite interpretation of divination, with it being 80% just bluffing (those who can see the future, don't really know what the heck it is that they are seeing)
