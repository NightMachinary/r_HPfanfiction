Where is the best place to post HP Fan Fiction? FanFictionNet, AO3, FicWad, Other? Generally, I'm happy with FFN but I was wondering how others felt about the sites. Is the tagging system better for searching than FFNs filtering? Just looking for opinions and trying to start a discussion. Still have about 2 weeks for my AO3 invite.


** Well, you probably have the largest reach at FFN. I know for a fact I've never read a FicWad fic. Some people like AO3's tagging system, but I find it is so abused by authors that it is actually harmful. Nothing stops you from posting simultaneously to multiple sites if you want.

*** yeah, I was thinking about multiple sites if only because of Portkey. When I first started reading, there were so many sites, but now it seems like it's dropped down to a handful. I love the idea of the tagging system, but you're right it doesn't seem like it's used properly. I think my biggest grip with FFN is you can't do a >=T Rating search.

**** I'm not /entirely/ certain if [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]] searches AO3, FFN or both, but it might help you when it comes to more specific search filters~

*** You can download on ff.net's own app (only mobile as far as I'm aware)

*** Thanks. This is kinda the information I was looking for. I forgot about the forums. Of course, I've never used the forums on FFN, so there's that.

** When I started posting again, I looked first at FF.net, but I was put off by the restrictions WRT sexytimes, so I went with AO3 instead. Reading on this sub, I've observed that there is a fair bit of racy stuff on FF.net, so I've been posting there as well. If it gets purged, then I still have a home on AO3.

Some people feel that AO3s tag system is needlessly complicated, but I don't think it's too bad. I like the kudo system for letting an author know you like the fic if you think care enough to leave an actual review. I find that in general, readership is lower on AO3, but it seems like maybe readers there are a bit more responsive, but your experience may differ.

** Know your audience.

Harems, edgy indy!Harry, power fantasies, and bashing: post on FFN.

Smut, slash, and artsy pieces with all-lowercase titles: post on AO3.

** There are a few other decent-sized archive sites out there. I'll highlight two:

harrypotterfanfiction.net

Pros: - Been around forever, established readership - Relative consistency of product Cons: - Probably the most restrictive content rules of any archive site - Minimal interactivity between authors and readers - Site owner is a raging narcissist who's constantly threatening to shut the whole thing if he doesn't feel respected enough

HPfanfictalk.com

Pros: - New, author-driven community - Good opportunities for interaction between authors and readers, e.g. comment and reply system in archive, forums tied to archive - Readers tend to be supportive of new authors; minimal trolling - Nice selection of content-formatting options Cons: - Small community with relatively low profile. You're not going to get famous overnight - Moderation of content will seem heavy-handed compared to AO3 (this may be a good thing, depending on your point of view) - Community as a whole can be somewhat tumblr-ish. Expect drama if you don't respect people's pronouns, etc.

*** I think harrypotterfanfiction.net was the first site I used. I haven't been to HPfanfictiontalk. But I am aware that there others. I personally used to use Yahoo Groups(various), but given yahoo's current reputation no way I'm touching it now. And groups such as AFF and HPfanfiction which seem more dedicated to smut. Not to mention the numerous shipping sites like Flaming Nargles and Simmering Cauldrons , but these are the ones that mostly seem to disappearing the fastest. And thank you for the sites, I'll go check them out right away.

** As a reader I much prefer fanfiction.net for four main reasons: you can search by story length, search for main character, you can exclude characters from your search and using the dark background makes reading on your laptop a lot easier on the eyes.

On AO3 the tags often get ridiculous and when you search by character you get every fic that the character is in, but they're not necessarily the main character. It is helpful that you can get the whole story on one page and even download it in mobi format. I do find the site a bit clumsy and unorganised.

I don't know what would be useful to you as writer though. I've never read on FicWad, but FFN and AO3 are both pretty big, so if you want as many readers as possible I think it's useful to post on both sites.
