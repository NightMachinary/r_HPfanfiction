** To pile on, forced marriages really make no sense within the setting.

For it to be even concievable, you need to set up a major cultural change, far more than just "our population is low".

If you look at historical institutionally forced marriages (that is, not family culturally or family enforced), they are generally based out of religious feavor (god requires it), collectivist or authoritarian state theory (state is mother, state is father), or involuntary status (slavery/POW/kidnapping)

None of that is really shown in the HPverse, and things like gender equality are present, which isn't really compatible with the concept.

If you really wanted to do it, I would think you would want to show a LOT more of a cultural shift than just the marriage law (usually fics leave everything the same). For example, Magical Britain being conquested by a foreign power with a different culture or the villians trying to reimpose feudalism (serfs owned by nobels). Or maybe Voldemorte being crowned king.

Of course, then it would be a massive departure from cannon.

Or alternatively, have some of the protagonists kidnapped from Britain into another society. For all we know merpeople have a long history of kidnapping mates and carrying them off

**** I actually shortened my post that originally had a point on this: Forced breeding would be a bit more believable, especially considering the death munchers are basically characterachured magic nazis and they did do some experiments with that.

Of course, any fic going down that road would have to grapple with a couple of major problems, and it still wouldn't really fit with 'government pre- or post- war doing this for population reasons.

Plus that systematic policies like that would basically be a crime against humanity, and would have to be dealt as such to feel reasonable. But that may not be that big of a problem for fitting into cannon given that cannon had basically concentration camps for mughleborn that didn't result in 'muggleborn relocation camps?

*** The thing is, if you want to pair off two people who don't like each so they can follow the "grow to love each other after an arranged marriage" trope, using arranged marriages or marriages of convenience would be a better option. However, it still wouldn't work for most characters who have modern values and won't let their parents marry them off, or for characters who won't marry for money or advantages (such as marrying so one character can inherit a fortune or such), so it wouldn't work for either Harry or Hermione.

**** I know why it is done. But it simply doesn't fit realistically in cannon, without some major additional world building (which often times isn't desired if it is simply a ship/character piece).

Honestly, if the goal is just to ship, the 'soul bond' template fits better into the world. You can handwave it away as plot-driven magic, and it wouldn't be out of place with the world. (Or other magic-based plot device: potions accident causes everyone in the class to become attached to this potions partner, xanth-like love springs causing everyone to violate the adult conspiracy...)

Now if you do want to play with world building, I can totally see 'marriage law' concepts being superior, as it sets up inter-character conflict. But you got to do some serious work if you want it to be believable: address freedom of movement and cultural expectations at a minimum.

***** I think moving the story into another epoch would be easier than creating a world where marriage laws are a thing in Wizarding Britain, yet the muggle world is unchanged and offers an easy refuge (in case the rest of the Magical World isn't offering other alternatives). It's not as if the characters people are generally pairing off are acting in character anyway, so might as well shift everyone back a few hundred years or so.

If I had to pair off two people who hate each other, I'd do it by pitting them in a situation where they have to work together and rely on each other against a bigger threat, and so grow closer and come to an understanding. Although that's not easy with HP magic - you have to either expand it (dimension travel or time travel) or nerf it to prevent them from simply going back to their friends and allies with Apparition, brooms, floo travel, portkeys or muggle travel.

#+end_quote

Eh? I just tried reading it, and...

#+begin_quote
  So softly that Hermione and Ron had to strain to hear it, Harry said, "I didn't fight him for this. I fought and defeated him so my friends could enjoy life, but I not do it for something like this."

  "Harry," Hermione called sadly, "even though we all know it's a power-grab, it's the law now. We don't have a choice."
#+end_quote

"Remember how Buckbeak was sentenced to be executed despite my best efforts at legal defence? We had no choice but to obey the law and let it happen. And then, remember how I found out about House-Elves and their enslavement? I didn't like it at all, but it was the law, so I did nothing. Oh, and then there was our fifth year, when Ministry passed all those educational decrees. We had no choice but to disband DA. As recently as last year, when Umbridge started up the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, I had no choice but to dutifully report in," Hermione continued. "The law is sacred."

Oh, and then, immediately after, we get:

#+begin_quote
  He continued to hold his girlfriend tightly and rock her gently. "An unjust law is no law at all."

  "Harry..."

  "Hermione, not now. I need to think." He closed his eyes to concentrate better, and to hide what he really felt.
#+end_quote

Because Harry is totally the thinker and the planner of the group.

And the sad thing is, I am quite certain that the author was not out to bash or degrade Hermione. They just absorbed a lot of Authority-Worship fanon.

** I'm firmly on the side that unless you did a major world building rewirte (aka stuff like forced marriages still a thing on the muggle side), timeshift and so on a marriage law that is obeyed by certain characters makes no sense at all.

The Marriage Law Reveoloution was already mentioned. But also a nice varriant of useing the influence the muggle side is bound to have (the wizarding world is tiny and dwarfed by the muggle economy and such) is used to stop it. Chapter 3 of Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue linkffn(11961978)

Also very good points why from a muggle and muggleborn pov such laws and some other plots (chapter 1 Goblin Justice) will just not fly.

Instead of going through with the Ministry's plan (which is for Hermione to marry Malfoy) or Dumbledore's Plan (which is for Hermione to marry Snape), Hermione takes Harry and flees while guiding the Hogwarts professors who aren't idiots on a path towards defeating Voldemort. It's good, but Hermione is like uber smart in it, so much so that she's kind of OP in my opinion.

** I generally don't like ML fics, but I recently read the old fic Chaos is Come Again (HG/SS). Chaos is a study of Hermione's and Snape's personalities interacting and miscommunicating with each other. It feels realistic in the sense that these miscommunications don't really resolve themselves, much like they can in real life, when it comes to two emotionally damaged people.

The relationship is also the backdrop to the intrigue and political scandal in the story, which drives the main plot.

Perhaps this is also part of its allure, but its not on FF or another other archive, and its mentioned on several lists of classic OotP SSHG fics , so I had to read it via this pdf linked by this review (also, this reviewer better summarizes why I like this fic so much): [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/chaos-is-come-again-by-aashby-theatersm/]]
