:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic probably 8+ years ago and I didn't even finish what was written at the time, but what I do know: Harry goes back in time, to I think when Tom was maybe like a third year? I think Harry was a teacher. And I remember that Tom got trapped down a well for like 3+ days pre Hogwarts, submerged in water, and ended up losing a toe (maybe two?). It was incredibly graphic, and I read it on ffn although it may be on other sites as well.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?
