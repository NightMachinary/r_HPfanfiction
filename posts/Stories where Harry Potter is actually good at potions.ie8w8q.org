I've read Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions recently, and I was wondering if there were any other fics where Harry studies his ass off to get good marks on potions. Please and thank you!

Edit: Thanks for all your replies! I've found an older post with a similar premise.

Amazingly witten, extremely well done fic. Even if you don't like fem!Harry I would still definitely say give it a go. I love how all the characters interact, and get along with one another. The way the author portrays potions and potion making is spectacular. It's a world where only purebloods are allowed in hogwarts and instead of Voldemort being a Dark Lord he's created his own political party. Enjoyed this fic so much, I hope you do to.

*** Seconding, with the added notice that the summary does not give you anywhere near the full scope of the fic. It takes a while to pick up (give it until the second half of first year) but is really, really good.

**** I think that the trouble with the summary is that it sounds a bit too pedestrian, like the story will just be canon except with a female Harry in a dorm with Ron and Dean and Neville. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's way off the canon rails, with the author spinning a whole new world that's merely /inspired/ by canon. And although it draws some elements from the crossover, it doesn't slavishly follow that either; it's much more original.

The change from a violent war to a political campaign has shifted the whole landscape. Harriet grew up with both of her parents and all of the Marauders, and she has an actual home to go to each summer - but summer is actually the most challenging part of the year, when she and her cousin have to swap back without getting caught. Except when they have to meet schoolfriends during the summer and swap again. And then she's off laying the groundwork for a backup alibi in case the ruse starts to break down, which brings her to the back alleys beyond Knockturn, where the Court of the Rogue holds sway, and she finds opportunities to relax and be herself around new friends - to an extent. There are still things she can't tell them, after all.

And within school walls, there's quite a different set of challenges to face each year. Tom Riddle is alive and well, not seeking the Philosopher's Stone, but he certainly does meddle at Hogwarts in her first year, in a big way. And Sirius Black is likewise fine, there's no Prisoner of Azkaban, but Harry's third year has her face a truly horrific ordeal that I doubt JKR would have dared to put into her own books, even Deathly Hallows; it's just too grim. The Triwizard Tournament still happens, but it's much bigger, both in its scale and in its ramifications. Canon Harry didn't actually need to win, just compete. "Rigel Black", though, is pinched between a rock and a hard place; she can't afford to win, nor can she afford not to.

It's not just an interesting spin on canon, it's a whole new story.

***** Yeah, I've talked about it on here before, but when reading the summary, you expect some fluffy, humorous stuff about an eleven-year-old girl adjusting to the difficulties of living as a boy. Nothing could even be farther from the truth.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** Yup, never underestimate the power of googling fanfiction. Google is able to get a surprising amount of accurate fanfiction.net works and communities. Ao3 is a bit harder tho, it'll mostly pull up tags if there are any.

I even looked up this exact prompt before and found tons to read.

** He's not studying his ass off for good marks, but I read linkffn(11115934) recently and enjoyed the potions in that. I personally don't think you'd need any knowledge of LotR to read it either, although a little goes a long way.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** I've never really understood why characters find Potions a hard subject. The only theory work they do is for homework, ie a three foot essay on what moonstones are for, and the practical is basically cookery - just follow the instructions!

The reason for the fails isn't the student's being bad at it - it's that Snape is a crap teacher! All he does is put the instructions on the board, and never explains them, or the consequences of not following them. For example, in the very first lesson, would Neville have given himself boils and melted his cauldron if Snape had taken thirty seconds to say "if you do NOT take your cauldron off the fire before adding the porcupine quills, your potion will EXPLODE over you."?
