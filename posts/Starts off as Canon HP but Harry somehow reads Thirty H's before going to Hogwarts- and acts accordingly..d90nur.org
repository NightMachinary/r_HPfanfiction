For anyone wondering, here's a link to Thirty H's:

linkffn(HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)

This is going to be madness like none have ever comprehended before. Perhaps it will affect how he uses magic, or changes how his magic works? I don't know, I just want to see it.

** How is this not listed as crack. Is this as egregious as HPMoR and FTLoM?

*** You think HPMoR and FTLoM are egregious? If you were to call that a crackfic, then Thirty H's would be a methfic, or perhaps a carfentanylfic.

**** MoR had that one teacher who was a mix of freaking yoda and mr miyagi or whatever. The other one had this kid having sex with any woman who moves, down to someone's mom, and lusting after his stepmom. I held on, hoping it gets less cringey, but no luck.
