No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Would rather NOT have Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing, but if there is have it be believable. No For the Greater Good Dumbledore, and no stories where the Weasley's are using Harry.

No Lord Potter-Malfoy-Weasley-Gryffindor Stories

Would rather have Harry be on the Light Side, but he can be Dark, as long as he's not "evil"

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** When I read your request this is the first story that popped up in my mind...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141607]]

Summary: “Albus Dumbledore is dead, Severus Snape is the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, Minerva is the spy inside the castle, and the war wages on. When the Boy Who Lived, who died in an accident before he was old enough to go to Hogwarts, is found going about his business in the Muggle World, everything changes -- for the Order, for the Wizarding world and especially for Severus Snape. As Severus tries to discover why Albus hid Harry Potter, Harry Potter discovers magic, friends and a godfather, but nothing interests him more than Severus. A retelling of the final destruction of Voldemort, by the Boy Who Lived for quite a different reason.”

It's slash, though, so I'm not sure if it's your cup of tea...
