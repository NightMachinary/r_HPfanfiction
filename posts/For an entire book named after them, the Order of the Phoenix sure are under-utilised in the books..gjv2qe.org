Think about it, the entire concept is extremely cool. We have this secret vigilante group, with an assortment of all kinds of people - a metamorphmagus, a werewolf, aurors, curse-breakers, international members, etc. and yet we never see them doing something actually, how do I put this, proactive? Their leader is none other than Albus Dumbledore, the most magically powerful wizard in the world, defeater of Grindelwald. He technically brought down an entire war, single-handedly.

Tonks alone could've been so much more than a hopelessly-in-love klutz. She is the perfect candidate for a spy, what with being a shapeshifting menace /and/ the youngest auror in the department. But what do we get? A Tonks who is amongst the first to take the fall in the Department of Mysteries (and the auror programme is supposed to be /hard to get into/), a depressed youngster in love with a werewolf, who then falls pregnant and dies. Oh, she can also sport a pig snout, make of that what you will. Scratch that, I could make an entire rant post on how all aurors in the series are useless (John Dawlish alone is a crime to the books). They were supposed to be the elite, the wizards everyone is in awe of after Dumbledore. Granted, I'm not complaining because I love Barty Crouch Jr. but it could've been extremely fun seeing the actual Moody, grizzled war veteran. Kingsley Shacklebolt also springs to mind. It was very good of him to make others believe Sirius was in Tibet and being a cool wizard with an earring, but come on, I need more.

I do realise that Harry and co. couldn't possibly know everything they did, but they just seemed to be on the lookout for Death Eaters (as per Pottermore, Tonks and Lupin observing a well-known Death Eater's house), and guarding the prophecy. Sturgis Podmore even managed to land himself six month vacation in Azkaban because he was imperiused by Malfoy, which means that he wasn't discreet enough. Why the hell does Malfoy know he is standing guard around these parts, under Moody's invisibility cloak, presumably?

If the Order was badass, then Harry, Ron and Hermione could have even been inspired by their organisation to make Dumbledore's Army, but they weren't proactive enough in the book. I know that for plot purposes, they had to be nerfed, as did the Death Eaters and the Department of Mysteries being very low on security purposes (might have been Augustus Rookwood that weakened the system, come to think of it). And I know that plot dictated that Dumbledore be deprived of his chair as Chief Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, etc.

But part of me also feels that during the First War, the Order could've been so much better than what we were given in the book. So, if there are any fanfictions that concentrate on this group, they'd be welcome!


** Regarding the book title: originally the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army had their names reversed, as it can be seen [[http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JK-Rowlings-Phoenix-Plot-Outline.jpg][in this early plot sketch by Rowling]]. That way it made sense for the book title to be OotP as it was one of Harry's main preoccupations during the year. I presume she thought it was too cheesy to have Dumbledore name his own army Dumbledore's Army, and of course it was gallant for Harry's army to be called as such so she switched the names, but the title stuck. I know she first revealed the title to a boy who asked her very nicely, and it could have been before she made the decision to switch the names so that's why she got stuck with the title (this is pure speculation, of course).

** It's just another example of how the world of Harry Potter is very, very shallow in terms of depth. So much of the world's most critical events in a span of nearly a decade is entirely driven by one group of schoolkids.

For example why would you hide a fountain of youth in a school when everyone knows it's in the school? Why is Azkhaban seemingly rather easy to escape from when necessary? Why doesn't Harry just simply not participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament by entering and then just forfeiting every task, or better yet Barty Crouch Jr just go "here Harry, mind sharing a drink" and then portkeying him straight to the graveyard on Day One of the new term?

Nothing in the universe makes sense if you think about it for more than maybe two minutes, hence why people have had to fill in the gaps to the point that canon and fanon have become incredibly hard to separate now.

*** Magic in HP is driven by intention and will so it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that the tournament itself could police the intentions of its participants and so force all participants to make a serious effort to compete.

The portkey thing you mentioned is true (annoying as it is). The magic of transportation is too powerful in HP (it got a little bit away from JK Rowling I think).

Azkaban was escaped by Sirius due to his obscure ability to become a dog. The only reason it was possible was because no one knew so I wouldnt call it plot-conveniant easy for him. Voldemort is Voldemort so his breaking of Azkaban is fine.

The Stone is obviously a strange one. Can only be explained by way of analysing Dumbledores plans but it is weird I'll give you.

I agree overall but I do think people give the sentience of magic too little thought. Magic doesent have to be something that can be escaped by clever lawyering - it can be a mysterious force that isn't necassarily moral or fair to Harry.

They did it that way to make it seem like Harry died in the tournament, allowing Voldemort's return to stay a secret from everyone but the DEs . This would've given him time to plot without the whole world plotting against him.

I presume that's why the cup was a two way portkey too, so they could just send back his body with no one the wiser about how it happened. Maybe they'd use Nagini to fuck up the body a bit and make it look like an acromantula, or maybe they'd planned to pin it on Krum cursing people in the maze.

** If I'm being generous to JKR, this might be an example in canon of the irony of Dumbledore spending decades playing chessmaster only to be scuppered by the fact that canon Harry is not a particularly strategic player, or one who will make the moves Dumbledore predicts.

Arguably, a lot of the tools Dumbledore set up for Harry to use - the Cloak, the Sword of Gryffindor, arguably Hermione and her Time-Turner, potentially the Marauder's Map - were really quite poorly utilized by Harry until he was nudged into making better use of them, or directly reminded. There's definitely a reading there that Dumbledore sent Harry the Order directly in book 5 with the intention that he would build relationships and friendships, and that he would come to use them as an army of sorts, or as assistance, in later years when things became serious. (perhaps the DA, too)

Unfortunately, /also/ due to Dumbledore's machinations, Harry has grown up neglected and unable to easily trust or rely on others, and so he does not think of playing that way, in a way that by this point is almost second-nature to Dumbledore himself.

It's a reading I like, anyway, and it plays into other moments in the books where Harry commits a fatal error due to recklessness or carelessness.

*** The Aurors aren't much better. You've got competent operatives like Kingsley who's capable of fighting multiple opponents and then Dawlish who let an unarmed Dirk Cresswell escape from him. Hagrid mentioned that the 4 Aurors that stunned McGonagall couldn't have beaten her without the element of surprise.

So what's the point of having magical SOF if some of them are seen as not special? McGonagall says Auror training is super selective and they only take the best, but they sure don't live up to expectations.

***** Fair point on Dawlish on the Confundus Charm. I'm still confused at how the Aurors are shown in canon. They're hyped up to be elite dark wizard catchers but rarely do they ever perform. I don't see the point of creating magical special forces when they're not shown to be exceptional. McGonagall said to Harry that they only take the best and that Tonks was the only accepted candidate in years. So why is Kingsley able to fight multiple combatants in DH on a Thestral protecting Hermione and held his own against 2 opponents in the Department of Mysteries before going down against Bellatrix but 4 Aurors without the element of surprise would lose to McGonagall? Or the fact that Dawlish is susceptible to be Confunded over and over. One would think magical SOF would be more consistent.

Of who applies and/or accepts an offer.

Kingsley is better than most Aurors, but not as good as Bellatrix. McGonagall is better than most Aurors, including Kingsley. Snape and Bellatrix are probably on equal footing, but I'll give the edge to Snape.

Dawlish was only confunded once to my understanding and it appeared to be a very good one.

The Aurors are good to very good, but there are Death Eaters and Order members who are just as good.

******* Dawlish was confounded by Dumbledore in HPB when Scrimgeour tasked him with finding out what he was trying to do. No shame in Dumbledore doing that. But he also gets confounded again as Snape said to Yaxley when discussing the Death Eaters plans for Harry in the beginning of DH, where Snape comments that Dawlish is susceptible to the Confundus Charm. Which leads to Dawlish losing an unarmed Dirk Cresswell and taken down by Neville's grandma who failed her Charms OWL.

Really not a good look for magical special forces. Ineffective Aurors is a pet peeve of mine with the series given how Harry was captivated of becoming an Auror because of fake Moody's suggestion and it was an interesting piece of worldbuilding in OOTP.

******** No, Dumbledore says he jinxed Dawlish twice. The Confundus is a charm.

Arthur, Kingsley, and Tonks have access to Dawlish. We also know Arthur is good with Charms. It's not a stretch to imagine any of the three pulled him aside then confunded him with his guard down.

And I can't find anything that says Cresswell was unarmed. He says he stunned Dawlish and even remarks he got away because "Dawlish wasn't quite right. Might be Confunded."

** Guys, not every choice an author doesn't make is a mistake. Yo have to judge the book they wrote , not the book they could have. The book follows Harry's p.o,v exclusively (except for the quidditch match chapter in book one and some horcrux visions/dreams). This is overall a good choice for the series. It does however mean that not everything that is happening can be on screen (and often books are worse off for everything happening on screen.) As Harry is not old enough to join the Order, its activites are instead implied.

Also, can you imagine if Rowling had added more Order to the books? OotP is already over long and under-edited as are the last three books (that's not to say they aren't excellent> Rowling herself has said she wishes she could do a new director's cut of those three books.

Harry Potter is the coming of age story of Harry Potter. As such we get an intimate portrayal of his life, struggles, and triumphs. Anything more in the actual books would dilute that and lead to a lesser experience.

Also, this idea that if world building isn't on the page it is shallow is ridiculous and a result of over written high fantasy books, which seem to be popular right now.

The great thing about fanfiction is that it allows us to explore parts of the world and stories that weren't central to the plot. But, just because something can make a great fanfiction doesn't mean it belongs in the books.

** I think we have to assume the Order was carrying out duties of protection throughout the land. What does Tonks do in her spare time? Lupin? Mad-Eye? What does the Order plan, what are their goals? Why couldn't Harry enlist their help when looking for Horcruxes? They operate in secret anyway. We know Kingsley protects the muggle Prime Minister.

The Order of the Phoenix is such a meaty book and yet so much of the content is just interaction that happens at school. That is the way that the books are written, and we see everything from only Harry's perspective. But wouldn't he have wanted to know what was going on? We know he is curious. We know he questions everything. We don't even know what the Ministry is doing.

I think all we can say is that Rowling chose to ignore much of the background and focus on her protagonists. As other commenters said, this does add to the mystery, and all the extra content that came after the books were published serves to uncover bits of the mystery. We just want more content.

While we can ignore not having enough background on the Order, I think the real problem is that they didn't do more to help Harry's mission. His mission was critical to the defeat of Voldemort, which was the very reason the Order existed--- to fight Voldy!

** A large part can be attributed, I think, to something I realized the other day. YA and teen fiction with very young protagonists only tends to let a kid save the day when the surrounding adult population is either oblivious or incompetent. They can be well-meaning as fuckall, but if the adults actually get proactive, they'll never let the eleven-year-old put themselves in actual danger. If my parents or teachers had found out I got up to a quarter of what Harry did at that age I'd have been grounded for the rest of my life, most likely. Thus, Dursleys, ineffective or incompetent authority figures, and outright malevolent ones as well. If the adults can smart, there's no need for a child to fix the world.
