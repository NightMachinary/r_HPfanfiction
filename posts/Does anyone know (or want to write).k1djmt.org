Looking for a story, where at the end of year 5 at the D.O.M. in the time chamber Harry is sent back to the dementor attack at the summer before fifth year. Where his past self get kissed, and he absorbs the body Increasing his strength, durability, etc. I read it years ago it was unfinished and I don't know title or author or even the site it was on. I can't find it. Probably removed. Does someone know or can write?
