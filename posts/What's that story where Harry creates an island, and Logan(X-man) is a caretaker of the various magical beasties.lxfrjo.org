I can't remember what story it was. Harry was OP, and it was a complete story. There was a bar, and pool on the island as well.

Thanks,\\

** linkffn(13326497) - Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe

Harry ends up on Marvel Earth after defeating Voldemort.

(I edited as I had a brain fart and summarized another Harry/Marvel crossover fic. I R SMRT.)

*** So uhh.. what was the other one you summarized? Because I quite like these crossovers and there aren't many that are decently written.

**** Oh, I summarized A Third Path to the Future, by Vimesenthusiast. It's a very similar concept, handled quite differently and I swapped the lead-in to that with the lead-in to Post-Apoc for some reason.

Both have very OP Harrys.

***** Ah shame, already familiar with Third Path (actually on my third reread).. was hoping you described a somehow unknown masterpiece. Anywho, thanks for the reply.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.
