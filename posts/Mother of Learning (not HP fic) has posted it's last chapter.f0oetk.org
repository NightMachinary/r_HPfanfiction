** Maybe I'll finally read it now. I still haven't picked up A Hero's War in a while though. That's the most enjoyable story on fictionpress for me.

*** Any idea how close it is to complete? If it's like halfway I'll start it next but if it's only like 6 months from the end I'd prefer to wait

**** Sorry, I'm not caught up so can't say how much is left. I haven't heard anything about it being close to completion so there's probably still a decent chunk left. Still what I can say, from how much I have read, is that it has very clear arcs with me having read the first two arcs so it will definitely be satisfying whether it's finished anytime soon or not.

For anyone interested, linkfp(A Hero's War)

Edit: I swear it used to work with linkffn

  Morey is summoned to a fantasy world under siege by the forces of darkness, called a Hero by the natives. Unknown to them, they got two 'Heroes' for the price of one. Dumped into a strange and dangerous fantasy world, Cato struggles to find out what happened to him and where he is. And perhaps there are advantages to not being a Hero. And perhaps not all the legends are true...

  Ampeels, a species of 'inquisitive' predators. To be inquisitive, they must have some intelligence. It turns out they have quite a bit of intelligence indeed.
