At first it was just McG and Hat, the Hat talking about Harry and McG thinking they were talking about TMR (or vice versa). then HP shows up and HP and Hat go back and forth about why HP had to be sorted into Gryffindor to let his Slytherinness grow and at the end HP remarks that the Hat is disgruntled because now it's thinking that Ravenclaw might have worked, too.

Basically I remember everything from the fic except the name.

  One shot: McGonagall asks the sorting hat it's regrets after the war, and it admits it regrets one surprising choice between Slytherin and Gryffindor. JKR owns all the world in which I play.

*** That's an interesting little fic, but I feel like it's really not describing canon Harry.
