Anything from the last three or so months. And anything that focuses on Harry, really.

Thanks!


** What you leave behind by Lane Anasazi. AU. Very good read. :) Author just updated recently too!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/][What You Leave Behind]]

I also wrote a chapter-by-chapter summary for those who're coming back to the fic after the month between updates. I realized that it's something that kind of annoys me, having to skim previous chapters and remind myself of important plot points. I stuck the recap on the bottom of my (admittedly long) profile, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4727972/Lane-Anasazi][here.]]

*** Oh yes, Steelbadger has been churning out glorious HP/LOtR fics lately. I strongly recommend, moreso than his more serious fics personally, [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28139][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]].

I don't think the author has posted it anywhere but DLP yet, but it's amazing. Very enjoyable humour.

***** So after getting a few messages on FFN asking for this (and discovering this post) I've made all the current chapters available [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][there]]. DLP still gets updates first (as it's a good place for sanity- and spell-checking). DLP is much recommended.

**** More a side effect of the popularity of the Sherlock fandom I'd expect.

Also the earlier potter books do follow a mystery format, a genre we know JKR likes, with the kids trying to discover a big secret (What's hidden in the third floor corridor? What's petrifying students? What's the deal with Sirius Black?) See A.J. Hall on [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/ajhall-mystery.html][JKR as mystery writer]].

***** Yes, definitely. Even in elementary school when I was beginning to read the HP books, I was aware of the mystery element. I thought they were primarily mysteries, actually, until the 5th book.

*** If anyone is considering this but is put off by the H/Hr, which I was, give it a chance! By far the best H/Hr I've ever read, in that the relationship is incredibly realistic and doesn't dismiss their canon feelings for Ginny and Ron. I normally hate that pairing because I quite like the canon relationships, but it feels very natural in The Hogwarts Strike Team.

***** Haha yeah, I noticed it was last updated a few days ago on the 18th. I was definitely surprised at the length of the chapters, too (in a good way!)

I started reading this like two or three days after you posted it :P

Thanks though, for posting it in the first place. After seeing how siye.co started stagnating post-post-DH I'm glad there seems to still be a resurgence of activity on ff.net and shit lol
