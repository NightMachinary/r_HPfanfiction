Hey guys! So I was looking for a fic where Harry is friends with more people than Ron and Hermione that is a Harry/Ginny pairing. I know that is oddly specific and not a lot of detail to go off of, but any recommendation will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!


** Are you looking for recommendations or for a specific fic?
