Hi everyone. I was hoping I could get some recommendations for fics where Harry and his friends actually talk about how the Dursleys treat Harry. It doesn't really get talked about much in the book, outside of a vague understanding among his friends that his family is unpleasant.

One fic that comes to mind as an example, which I forgot the name of, is a story where Harry mentions the cupboard under the stairs, and Hermione and Ron ask about it, with increasing horror as Harry explains it nonchalantly.

I'm not really looking for fix-it fics? I don't mind if Harry and his friends scheme up a way to avoid Harry staying at the Dursleys, but I'm hoping to avoid overpowered Harry or "Secretly a Lord who owns half of Britan," stories. I'm hoping more for a story where they're as supportive as they can be as and Harry feeling a bit less lonely as a result. Stories where they discuss it post-Hogwarts would also be good.

If anyone has any recommendations, I'd be interested in reading them. Thank you in advance :)

This is Stargon's The Cupboard Series. I don't remember how much they discuss Harry's Dursley experiences, but they certainly affect even the very beginning of the story.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic. Book 1 of The Cupboard Series

Rita Skeeter writes books about Harry's life that are INCREDIBLY inaccurate. But they do have kernels of truth in them. It is after the war, EVERYTHING before the start of the story is same as canon. A plot point is how Rita makes the dursleys way more abusive than canon. Like broken bones bad. So Harry has to, reluctantly, set the record straight

  All was well. Truly, it was. Harry Potter was so happy that not even Rita Skeeter's newest biography could spoil things. Okay, fine, so maybe he'd 'forgotten' to mention parts of his past to his loved ones. It wasn't like this disaster could end in Azkaban sentences or pygmy puff invasions, right? Right. He was worrying about nothing. --- Pre-Epilogue, canon ships.

  Harry supposes he'll never know how they learned about the cupboard under the stairs. He also supposes he'll never know how they managed to make him so afraid of it, all these years later.
