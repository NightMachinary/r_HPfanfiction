From the first one, I remember a scene where Harry, Remus and Sirius are Christmas shopping in a muggle world. Sirius is overwhelmed by muggle technology so he kind of runs around the store and Remus explains that to the clerk by saying Sirius is a bit... special, you know? or something similar, I don't remember the exact phrase.

As for the second one, I only remember that Harry and company found Salazar Slytherin's library (80% sure it was in the Chamber of Secrets), they bring it all to Hogwarts and it's one big hullabaloo of attention from press and all that.

Thanks!
