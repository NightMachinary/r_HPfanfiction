I've seen plenty of fics with Harry's success in the muggle world, but I couldn't really find any where Harry was famous in the muggle world as a child and his Hogwarts schoolmates found out. Has anyone found something like this?

If not, I also love fics where any of Harry's secrets are revealed to the Wizarding world.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

*** I'm only 5 chapters at the moment, but so far this is a fantastic read. The way the author wrote Hufflepuff social dynamics both makes sense and completely changes my outlook on the house. Thanks for the rec. If you know of any other fics with this kind of tone, especially regarding social interactions, please send some this way!

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
