** This story is certainly different. It's a bit difficult to talk about it without revealing the plot. Something is different with the magical world because certain events that should have happened in 1981 didn't happen. We, along with Harry, try to discover what went wrong.

This story is refreshingly devoid of the usual tropes. What's going for it is its air of *mystery*. It's well written and worth a try.

  Looking for something different? Something compelling, with a plot that isn't cookie-cutter and predictable? This is the epic for you. 1981 didn't go as it was fated, leaving the world of 1994 a crumbling, fractured apocalypse. Between runes that promise the end of the world and the possibility of magic dying entirely, Harry has a difficult path ahead of him. COMPLETE

** Lomonaaeren's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1423924][Realm of Song]] series is being updated with the second half of year four, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27792526/chapters/68039044][Harmonies Unconquerable.]] Note: not a "Harmony" ship, despite this part's name. Realm of Song is the only "Harry was raised by goblins" story I've found that I actually like. He's just so forthright, and viewing things through that lense leads to fantastic failures of manipulation. I'm very happy this is back.

Also happily updated is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.771298/][Felix Fortuna,]] a Worm crossover. Contessa (from Worm) de-ages herself and blocks much of her memory, before dumping herself into Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's a fun, light story full of OCs and Fortuna just trying to be a kid in a magical school.

I've also been trying and failing to find a good mystery fic. Everything I've seen has either been incomplete (the reveal of the real killer is the most important part!), badly edited, or has been "it was Harry all along, after he turned evil because reasons!" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] was really good (summary: what happened to her after the sorting?), but other than that? Very little. I'm trying to make it through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/][The Aurors]] (post canon, Harry has a new Auror trainee), but the lack of scene transitions (give me a dash or an ellipsis between paragraphs, anything to indicate a scene change) and the weird single quote dialog indicators have not stopped bugging me.

*** I second Realm of Song. It's really well-written. I was afraid there would be one of those awful Lord Hadrian Paravell super bashing fics and while there is conflict between the characters, it's not at all cringe worthy. I especially love how Harry challenges everyone to a duel to the death and Dumbledore's exasperation with that particular habit.

The first 21 chapters were not bad. If you like your HP fanfic getting really dark with a super evil nasty character and horrific scenes, you'll like this story. The premise is nicely original, characters are mostly well done and the writing is pretty good (at least up to where I stopped).

** The scariest Tom Riddle I've ever read:

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19042240/chapters/45228508]])

This fic up there with Pygmalion in terms of darkness. It's a pretty grim portrayal of an emotionally/mentally abusive relationship and antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy/sociopathy).

Harry goes back in time and adopts Tom Riddle. Tom becomes super possessive as a child (to the point of murder), which morphs into a really fucked up obsession as he grows older. It's one of those rare fics that actually portrays Tom as someone with antisocial personality disorder instead of a sexy dark lord.

He really has zero qualms about killing anyone. Harry works out a reward system where anytime Tom feels like he might snap, he gets Harry and explains the situation instead of going through with the impulse. At one point, Harry rescues a baby from the London bombings and Tom wakes him up in the middle of the night and says “he has to go right now or I'm going to kill him.” It legit sent chills through me. Maybe it's because I listen to too many true crime podcasts, but it's horrifying to know that there really are people out there in the world like that.

This fic is Tom/Harry, but I don't consider it a romance. It's like a train wreck you can't look away from. Harry's thought process is “if he's with me he won't turn into Voldemort” and Tom absolutely takes advantage of it. As you read it, you feel sad for Harry and the burden he bears. He genuinely loves Tom as a son and friend and it's heartbreaking to watch it be warped into something awful. On the other hand, I still feel bad for Tom even though he's an abusive monster. He's simply incapable of feeling anything for anyone other than Harry and therefore doesn't understand what he feels and is incapable of recognizing their relationship for what it's supposed to be.

It's heartbreaking and probably won't have a happy ending, but it's atmospheric and really sucks you in to the story.

My issue is that Harry has lost all of his agency. He flips out at some choice words in Gringotts but nothing else affects him (I stopped after the beach cause it seemed like forgiveness for what Tom did). The “Christmas Present” was shocking but I mostly wish that Harry could have prevented it by doing anything. It's a big misunderstanding and I hate those situations. I appreciate what the fic is doing but I stumbled into Tomarry with a time travel to 6th year on equal terms and Tom changed very quickly. Sure it's not in character but I enjoyed it, and this fic is the complete opposite of that.

Even better, there's regular updates (and idk about this fic, but in his other one, Charlus and Dorea are James's parent, so that makes the guy good in my books).

** Re-reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Wish it would update more often.

Also keeping up with the ones I have followed-

linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) - Slytherin!Hermione, rather interesting take on it.

linkffn(Knowledge is Power by Sectemus Prince) - Crossover with Percy Jackson. Kendra Potter (fem!harry) is a daughter of Zeus. Kinda OP Kendra, but not that much.

Edit: Apparently the bot doesn't like this story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13603037/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Here's]] a link

linkffn(Flight of the Stars by DarkLadySwan) - Hermione gets sent 60 years back in time, and decides to join with Voldemort and take over the Ministry.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Inquisitor of Hogwarts by Ian Hycrest) This one's part 3 in a series, looks like it'll cover all seven years. Harry is caught between a manipulative!Dumbledore and the Malfoy-controlled Ministry. One of the few manipulative!Dumbledore stories that have Voldemort as a serious problem as well.

** Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force is a crossover with the anime/manga Oh my Goddess.

People who haven't seen the anime or read the manga might still appreciate this fic. The author did try to explain things from the manga that I just found out when I read this fic. I, myself, have only seen a few episodes of the anime when I was a kid so I just have a very basic understanding of the main characters' personalities. That knowledge was enough for me to read the fic.

Basic things to know:

The Sister Goddesses: Urd, Belldandy and Skuld are loosely based on Norse mythology characters.

Urd, the eldest, is a half-demon, half-goddess. She shares the same dad as her siblings but her mom is a demon. She is very mischievous.

Belldandy is the highest ranked goddess among the three. She is very kind, patient and responsible.

Skuld is the youngest. Though not as adept in magic as her older siblings, she is a very skilled computer programmer. She is childish. She and Belldandy have the same mother.

The human in the group: Keichi is Belldandy's fiance. He is bound to her because of a wish he jokingly made to have her by his side forever. He likes motorbikes.

These four are sent to investigate a prophecy on the verge of going wrong and somehow end up making things right for one Harry Potter.

At the end of the day, this is a typical /"what if someone gets Harry away from the Dursleys and is raised by someone magical"/ story. It's full of cliches but it's still a guilty pleasure of mine to read these kinds of fics.

** linkao3(More Than One Way to Skin a Cat) is a curious spin on a Peggy Sue story. Harry and Severus have both gone back in time from when they died, but they aren't in their own bodies - and having a soul fragment forcibly separated from him has left Harry's mind damaged and his memories incomplete. In the main, though, it's a wholesome redo, with the changed circumstances softening the Dursleys' attitude.

  Betad by Eider Down.Severus remembered dying, bleeding out, his consciousness barely there. He remembered pain. He remembered his one last look into those green eyes, doomed as they were to join him soon in death. His heart ached, as his neck ached, as his body ached.He greeted death as a friend.Severus didn't expect to wake up. It was rather disconcerting, really. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like. Which is to say, fucking awful.Hell would have been preferable, instead he's now back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. What should he do? Can he change events for the better? Whom can he trust?Meanwhile, there's something slightly...off about his cousin Dudley. Only time will tell, but at least that's something he has plenty of now.Severus is about to find out why they say you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.

**** I read this last week too. I liked the concept and the characters. There's a cheerful camaraderie and genuine affection. I found enjoyment in Snape being Snape but changed by being a brother to Harry.

I also appreciate some things it's not. I like the brisk pace through canon. It's probably a sign I've read too much HP fan fiction, but I really don't need to read about every Hogwarts train ride, every year's sorting and so on. Harry's incomplete memories are, I think, mainly a device to allow Snape to be more of a mentor and protector than otherwise, but that's okay. It's better than a story about a constantly anguished character with a fractured mental state. I can find that sort of thing done much better in literature. This Harry is more Luna than tortured soul, but still enough Harry to earn Snape's exasperation---but it's affectionate exasperation given what they've been through.

Worthwhile.

** Just finished Alastor Moody and the Methods of Engineering By joshudson linkffn(12810590). Pros: Nice nerdy fan fic, lots of nerdy elements that are well done. A continuation of HPMOR (one of my favs). Plot moves along nicely and the writing is compact and direct without a lot of unnecessary exposition. Cons: This is one of those stories where the author often hides the reasons for why things are happening. So I'm reading and the plot is twisting and turning and I have very little idea why. Maybe the author is leaving clues for why things happen the way they do, but they're too subtle for me. Warning: Brush up on your genetic biotech knowledge before reading this. Summary: A nice story if you like nerdy writing and enjoyed HPMOR and similar stories. This was a nice break from some of the more emo hp fanfics I read.

*** outstanding so far! I'm so tired of reading mentor!Snape fics where his only character is being sarcastic and bitter. He still is in this fic, but He actually does things with a consistent logic. Also harry is neither an infantilized caricature of cuteness like so many other fics. I swear, half of them feel like the all the author wants to do is have harry get spanked by Snape or something, I can't understand it.

​

Both of them are still antagonistic. Snape is not coddling, Harry is not timid. They hate eachother at the start and both are stubborn characters, they don't just trust each other. What common ground they find is something neither admit to, despite both knowing it.

**** Yes, I felt exactly the same before finding this fic! Sure, it's fanfic and Snape can be whatever, after all, most people write fics and change completely the character's personalities BUT I love it more when he's portrayed as he actually is because it's so rare to find Snape written well in fanfics.\\
Yeahhhh, I don't really like when they make Harry act like a little kid when he's 14, that's really unrealistic, a boy that age wouldn't act that way even with their parents. It's okay if it's portrayed as Harry being starved for affection which I think it's very much canon but yeah, most of the time it's not realistic and it's way exaggerated. Yeah, sometimes those interactions feel a little creepy or inappropriate.

I love that there are few precious emotional moments opposite to the bitterness and hatred that was always the centre of their relationship, The balance is done so well that I felt like I was reading canon material honestly! Even the story was realistic for the most part. I just wished for more Remus, but that's my only 'complaint', I'd say.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

My rating: 3.9/5 (Would definitely recommend if this is your sort of thing)

I am enjoying this very much! It's basically what would happen if Hhr rebelled against the well-known Marriage Law. Very gruesome, very AU. Although I can't imagine Harry acting like he did in the fic, I still like the fic right now.

The reason it's not at least four stars is because the fic is very war-like right now. I do enjoy some angst and war, don't get me wrong, but I feel like there isn't enough sweetbmoments to balance the entire thing out for me. Of course, this fic was probably meant to be like that, but I love my romance scenes with a passsion!

I'm in the middle of it right now, so sorry I'm not able to give a complete review, however I would recommend this to Hhr shippers who want a twist on the common Marriage Law story. If you love war and gruesomeness in your fics, this is a good read so far!

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
