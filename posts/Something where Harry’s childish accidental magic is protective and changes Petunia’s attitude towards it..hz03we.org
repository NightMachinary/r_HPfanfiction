So I was thinking, what if Harry and Dudley were friends as children? What if Harry's magic was geared towards protection and extended to his cousin? What if this protection of Dudley lead Petunia to soften towards magic. Maybe not enough to like it but enough to be thankful for it and not hate Harry. To the point that she is just exasperated by it but also reigns Vernon in.

Like toddlers Dudley and Harry play together even though the Dursley's try to prevent it. And the first burst of accidental magic happens because Dudley loses his balance on the stairs and it keeps him from getting hurt.

Or how when the boys are playing outside, the toys always hit an invisible barrier and bounce away from the road. Or how when toddler Harry kisses booboos better they are healed by the next day. Little things.

And all these little things add up to the point that Petunia is only mildly annoyed about chasing two naked toddlers through the neighborhood after Dudley gets sprayed by a skunk and Harry vanishes the smell and Dudley's clothes. And his own once he sees how much fun Dudley is having running around.

I don't know. Just a childhood friendship fic.


** I mean, those seem like little things that would be disturbing and angering to people like the Dursleys. Sure, if Harry saved Dudley from getting pancaked by a semi, that might be a bit of a wake-up call. But a few bruises, the inconvenience of having to chase toys down, or healing a few minor cuts? I doubt that's anything the Dursleys would appreciate. It's normal for kids to get injured. They were also fine with Harry getting chased up a tree and with Dudley bullying Harry.

I think this prompt would be better served with Harry befriending another muggle kid. The parents of that kid appreciate Harry and the odd coincidences, and Harry starts gravitating to them instead of the Dursleys. They shouldn't find out about magic without getting obliviated though. That veers dangerously close to muggle wank in my opinion.

*** I was thinking mor of keeping them from wandering into the street. Or falling down the entire staircase and breaking a bone or something.

And the healing thing because Dudley is a whiner and they don't like seeing their kid upset.

** I think it could work well if Petunia became pregnant again. If she was tired and sore during her oregnancy I think she might find some relief in Harry being aboe to kiss a whinning Dudley's cut finger and have it heal. Especially when the baby is born and Petunia is very busy the littke ways in which Harry's magic makes life easier would really soften her to him I think. Imagine if the baby only just goes to sleep after a half hour of struggling, she'd be so happy that the boy's were keeping quite only for her to come out of the nursery to chaos and Dudley's friends running around. Any mum would appreciate a way to keep the baby asleep and calm no matter where it came from.

** I really like the idea of Harry being protective of his family, even though they're not that kind to him. But maybe it could set the ball rolling, and they're able to show kindness to him later, especially Dudley, who grew up not understanding why he didn't get hurt when Harry was around. Maybe he realises when Hagrid explains that Harry is a wizard, that (despite his slow brain) Harry has been protecting him all the time. Maybe they're much quicker to accept Harry's explanation after the Dementors in book five too.

PS: There aren't skunks in Britain. They belong to the American continents.
