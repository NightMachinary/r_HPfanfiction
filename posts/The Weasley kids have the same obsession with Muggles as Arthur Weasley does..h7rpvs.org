** Bill and Percy come home at least once a year to help Arthur keep the flying car updated. Bill brings his Muggle motorcycle, and since Charlie can tell the difference between a dragon's natural flying pattern and how a machine works, he is somewhat able to bridge that gap with magic. Molly is obsessed with cooking shows and has a way to watch Muggle television through a portal that either Fred or George set up. Ginny is a huge fan of Muggle sports, among other things, and she plays soccer on the ground just as much as she plays Quidditch in the air. Along that vein, Ron collects Muggle trading cards because even though they don't move, there are more of the Muggles and he likes learning, just at his own pace. He looks for strategists. Maybe he figures out board games someday?

**** Hermione sighed again she had figured introducing ron to muggle board games meant she would finally be able to win growing tired at constantly losing to chess, she figured with her years of experince at the various board games due to playing them since she was a child would give her some advantage but no ron seemed to instantly grasp the board games and then completely decimate her. it reminded her of harry in a way the way harry got on his broom during that first class and flew like an expert
