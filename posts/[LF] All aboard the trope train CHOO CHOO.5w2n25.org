I'm looking for your tropeist fics, those guilty pleasures that are so full of overdone plot points that it actually makes you physically I'll to read.

I want 10000 year old harry in his 7 year old body acting like a 16 year old with the magical power of 17 Merlins and 6 and a half Dumbledores! I want a harem with every female ever mentioned in canon, and 23 other total Mary Sues all fawning over the boy who lived just after he gained access to the secret other Potter family vault which contains the riches of the Egyptian Pharaoh's. I want golden patronus (patroni... patronae?) That kill dementors and make harry the soul Bonded king of Azkaban. Give me time turning trunks with 87 compartments, Quirrelmort, and the memories of the four founders in Harry's head teaching him to do bad ass stuff at the tender age of 4 and five eighths.

Just give me the tropeist fics that you know. Only 2 requirements, please no slash, and even though the plots themselves are probably horrible, I'd like the writing to good enough that it's readable. So I guess I want well written tropey fics.

Thanks! Good luck, ans may the hallows be ever in your favour.

*** Hahaha! Yeah I'm with you on that. Voldemorts daughter with Bella... I mean come on! And don't even get me started on the horrible done time travel and trolley witch scene. I choose to ignore that whole story and think of it as another fanfic, it's not canon to me. I was horrendous and every character was way OC.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

*** That's the story that caused this post! I just finished reading it and while there was soooooooooooo many tropes in it I found that I just couldn't stop reading. It was tropes done just good enough to make it enjoyable, like in a 30 year old man watching the bachelor every week kind of guilty pleasure way.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
