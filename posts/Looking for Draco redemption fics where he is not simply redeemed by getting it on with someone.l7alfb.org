  Draco Malfoy doesn't know what he believes anymore. He doesn't know if he cares about the dealings of mudbloods and half-bloods and blood traitors and blood purity. All he knows is that he once saved his parents from certain death, and now he is determined to save them from the entirety of the Wizarding world. Only this time he is entirely on his own.\\
  ----\\
  In which Draco is an angsty prat, the family feels are strong, the politics are complicated, and Luna Lovegood is basically an angel.

Just recently read this (it's not completed yet) and I found his character development to be really good and believable. I also like that it focuses a lot on his family. One thing to keep in mind though is that it does lead up to a Draco/Luna relationship. I never even considered that ship until reading this, but I feel like the author makes it work.

Could be worth checking it out!

** Mudbloods of the Death Eaters (linkffn: 2407704) has a Draco who, despite not being very fond of Muggles and Muggleborns, doesn't actually want to harm them so he intentionally acts really incompetent in order to maintain his low-ranking position which doesn't involve direct attacks on people. He also has a crush on Hermione but his behavior is not influenced by this crush so make what you will out of it (it's not a Dramione fic anyways).

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13592225/1/Awake][Awake]] is really just fantastic. It's fun and weird and at times unsettling, and Draco owns a Tamagotchi . there's not really a good way to describe Draco's redemption arc without spoilers. Harry and Draco both pass into comas after the final battle, and something is different when they wake up. Draco isn't in a relationship at any point in the fic, but there's hints of something with another character I shan't spoil.
