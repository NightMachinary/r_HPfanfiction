All my old favorite fics I can't access anymore and I'm really in the mood for some snape/hermione with lemons. Downvote away but it's what I like.


** I dont have any links, sorry, but i just want to say that if you like a style or paring, its your choice and you shouldn't feel ashamed, dont let anybody judge you.

Judgey seems to depend on the day over here. I don't mind that people don't like my ship, but it's super annoying to be down voted so that no one can see the post and respond.

Have fun!
