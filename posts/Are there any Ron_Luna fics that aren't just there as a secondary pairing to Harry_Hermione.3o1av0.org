As a shipper, it can be a real struggle when you find yourself in a mood for a particular pairing then struggle to find any that appeals to you. Having that problem now.

** Shadow Walks by Lorien has this. Luna's character voice isn't captured well at all, unfortunately.

EDIT: Oh, you meant it /isn't/ a secondary pairing to Harry/Hermione. For some reason, I read the opposite. But, no. I think a couple of smut fics with the pairing though. Let me see whether I can find them.

** Have you looked through the archives at Portkey for stories listed in the R/L category?
