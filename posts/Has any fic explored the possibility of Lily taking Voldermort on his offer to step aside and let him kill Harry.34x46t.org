  "Step aside, you silly girl!" said Voldemort, brandishing his wand angrily.

  "Okay," Lily said, and she moved to let Voldemort pass. He stepped forward and, a flash of green light later, baby Harry's crying fell silent. Lily fell to the floor, her legs buckling underneath her as she realised what she had done.

  Voldemort laughed, a high-pitched cackle that sent shivers down Lily's spine.

  --------------

  A month later, it was over. Dumbledore was dead, along with most of the Order, and the Ministry had fallen. Voldemort was victorious, an immortal overlord. No one knew how he had made himself immortal; no one ever would. He would rule for thousands of years.

  Out of all the Order, only Lily was left.

  "Hello, Lily," said Severus Snape, sidling up to her greasily. "I arranged to have your husband and son killed, so I could have you to myself. Doesn't that show how noble and brave I am? I'm motivated by love, you see."

  Lily blinked slowly, before turning her dead gaze to Snape's hooked nose and sallow, pale face.

  "Avada Kedavra," she said, and Snape fell to the floor, dead.

  Then she turned her wand on herself, and all was dark.

  ...and then came the light.

  Lily opened her eyes, surprised to find herself in the same dark room. Snape's body was lying a feet few from her, the stench already nauseating.

  POP.

  The familiar sound of Apparation filled the room. Lord Voldemort appeared from nothingness. He glided to Snape's body and leaned over to inspect the foul man.

  "As I suspected," Voldemort whispered. He turned his red eyes to Lily. "You have lived."

  "You couldn't have possibly suspected that," Lily said.

  "I did not know with full certainty that the events would transpire as they did. I had always wondered the depth of Snape's commitment to you. Now, I know. His love protected you even as he died at your hands," Voldemort said as he approached her.

  "That..."

  Lily's mouth gaped as her mind raced through the multitude of reasons she was still alive.

  "...makes no sense."

  Voldemort nodded. "Indeed."

  "Come with me..." He extended a pale appendage that looked more like a claw than a hand. "...if you want to live."

  She hesitantly grasped his cold hand. His arms encircled her body. Lily stood on her tip-toes until her lips grazed his scaly ear. She could feel him shudder against her. Lily whispered something in his ear.

  "What was that?" Voldemort asked, not hearing what she said.

  "I said." Lily licked her lips in anticipation. "Surprise, motherfucker."

  They exploded in a burst of light, the bomb trapping them both. Voldemort shrieked in agony, but Lily said not a word. The Horcuxes had been destroyed. The trap had been set.

  As the fire turned her skin black, Lily smiled.

** If I could hijack this, I think it would be more believable of Voldemort remembered that AK isn't the only spell in the world and hit her with a stupefy.
