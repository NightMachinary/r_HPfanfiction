I started reading a Dramione fic a while back and never finished it. Now it's bugging me to no end as to what this fic was called. I know it's on Wattpad, and was one of the ones about Hermione and Draco being back at Hogwarts for 7th year and they're Head Girl and Boy. I don't think there was much of Harry or Ron but there was a lot of Ginny. I distinctly remember Hermione getting drunk and there was a dance or something and Ginny picked out a dress for Hermione? That's all I remember. Does anyone have any ideas as to what it is?


** There are probably /a lot/ of Dramione fics that fit the description of an eighth year fic with a dance and Hermione having to find a dress

Tricky part is the bit about it being on Wattpad, not a common platform for reading I believe

Do you remember anything else about the fic?

*** Unfortunately, that's all I remember... like I said, it was a while ago, and I don't have the best memory. Thanks, though!
