Psycho!Harry where he blatantly kills people he doesn't like to the point where he does it in front of everybody and they're too scared to actually do anything about it.

  Due to a severe head injury, Harry experiences a rather extreme change in personality - namely, a sudden tendency to kill people he doesn't like. Awesome!Psycho!Harry, Harry/Luna main pairing, Ãœbermanipulative!Dumbles, brain-stem zombies, ham sandwich portkeys, and other misc. insanity.

***** Nah, you're good. You're good, you didn't know. What I had in mind is something where he kills people he doesn't like in front of everyone in the Great Hall to the point that everyone is too scared to actually do anything about it.
