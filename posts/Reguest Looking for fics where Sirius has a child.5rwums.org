  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  It is twelve years since the battle in the Department of Mysteries . . . we know of the Room of Requirement, and of the Mirror of Erised, but Hogwarts castle is a place of many mysteries and infinite possibilities. It should not, therefore, surprise us to learn of other hidden places and other mirrors . . .
