I'm not sure if I tagged this correctly, or what the rule is about putting your own stories on this page, but I figured I'd post first and ask forgiveness later if I went about it the wrong way.

Anyway, so you'll know kind of what you're in for. My story starts just after the Epilogue in the seventh book. It's told mostly from Harry's perspective, but I am in the process of catching up with this one in a separate story from Albus' point of view.

Also, I know that it's not fully canon but I started writing it well before the newest information (I.E. Cursed Child) was released, and decided to just ignore it entirely.

** I'm pretty sure half the people in this reddit, myself included, just pretend Cursed Child never existed.

*** My personal take on CC is this: Interesting details, some should be canon, some should not. Plot? What Plot? There is none...

*** I honestly haven't even read the entire thing, judging by the response I've seen to it on this and the main HP reddit though I'm not yet regretting that decision.

*** I think there's a separate self-promotion flair that you'd want to use in this case? Otherwise there's nothing in the rules about it...

**** Good call, I see a Promotion flair that you can search by so you're probably right.

*** Self-Promotion isn't frowned upon. Everyone here is right to the point when it comes to suggesting improvements.

If HPfanfiction had an anthem, /"...and the land...of the....SAVAGE!!"/ would be part of it.
