  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

*** I remember this one. It was written well, but the author butchered Ron and Ginny's characters giving some some token flimsy justifications, and I put down the story in disgust.

** I've tried a bunch of different things on the scryer and can't seem to find it. Was it on ffnet? About what year was it from? Number of chapters or words? Complete/abandoned/in progress?
