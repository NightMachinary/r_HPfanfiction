Any good Vampire!Harry fics?

And none of the blah-bla-blah type of story where there's an ancient victorian vampire. But more so a Harry becoming a vampire and learning to deal with it without a ton of angst.

If I wanted angsty vampires I'd go to Twilight


** I too have kind of wanted to see something like this.

Surprisingly linkffn(Little Bat) is the closest I've seen - it is not vampire and is mostly cute but this simple thing is even the closest reference I've seen.

I'm guessing we don't see much due to Rowling not even bothering with any vampire details in her work?

*** Okay, not that one.

Lets try this linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11811135/chapters/26646195]])

Again, not an actual vampire fic, just a cute reference.

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
