I've always liked the whole forbidden-romance-with-the-slightly-older-lady angle. Any decent fics based around this kind of pairing?

She cleans up pretty well. [[http://www.imdb.com/media/rm4131098112/nm0000668?ref_=nmmi_mi_all_sf_202#][Especially]] if she had a de-aging potion accident

** Who would he even romance? There's only three female professors who could possibly be conventionally attractive still-Astronomy Professor, Muggle Studies, or Runes. And even then, they might as well be OCs. We know almost nothing about them.

** I've read a couple, a long time ago. Usually, these romances/flirtations are embedded within a more indie, Harry takes charge trope rather than a dedicated romance fic - but they definitely do exist.

  complete: To protect Harry Professor McGonagall relives her teenage years. What seemed like a good idea at first is swiftly becoming a bad one. This is a rather twisted romantic adventure that is sure to please. I think. Read Please:
