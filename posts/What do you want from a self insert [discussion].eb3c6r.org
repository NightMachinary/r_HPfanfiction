I've written a couple thousand words and I'm considering continuing and posting it.


** Implementing actual change in the story, or otherwise having compelling characterization from non-standard characters. If nothing else, I always want a new look at the world, a new perspecting.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11763334/1/]] has a compelling enough relationship (not pairing) that I kept getting excited when it updated.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13063103/1/]] is funny enough for me to enjoy, the degree of separation from the canon focus makes me like it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/]] has an interesting magic system, and the prosecuting of a war is enjoyable.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/]] is, as already known, pretty great as far as it comes to OC insertion.

*** Thanks! I hadn't heard of echoes or dichotomous before.

What do you NOT want from a SI? Mine's not a marauder's era romance btw ðŸ¤£ those kill me.

**** Restricting the friends of the OC to being pretty much canon characters is boring. I would want to hear about more than just the maurauders + lily + snape. Not sure I can help with advice on that front as much, I generally don't read romance fics too heavily.

Also, got reminded of another good SI story, which is heavy on the humor. Not even close to the direction your looking, but still. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12026429/1/]]

** A couple things.

First - no fix fic-ing it. In my opinion fix fics are boring, and with the amount of knowledge SI would hold, 90% of problems would be instantly trivialized. Usually that means that the SI is either uninterested in actively trying to "fix" the world, or is unable to use their knowledge to its full potential.

Second - ability to use magic, and the desire to do so. One of my least favorite tropes in fanfiction is "inserting an unpowered character in the world filled with magic". SI as a squib or a muggle would ruin the work for me. Just like a SI that treats magic as a tool rather than "holy shit it's actual magic, I want to learn everything I can about it".

Third - character interactions mostly happen with canon characters. It's fine to introduce OCs to expand on unexplored areas of canon, but the main reason I read fanfiction is to read about characters I already know. If the story becomes "OCs interact with OCs, while canon happens offscreen" there's really no reason not to make it an original story.

Fourth - don't be afraid of character development for your SI. They start as a copy of you, sure, but going through completely different experiences /will/ change them, in the way you yourself probably never will. The best SI stories in my opinion are those that treat SI as an OC copy of the author, instead of a constant reflection of the author. Copy that will eventually change, and act in the way author themselves never would.

Final one is even more of a personal preference - don't reveal to other characters that you're SI. Don't explain to them that they are fictional, that you are from another world, the works. If you want to openly flaunt your foreknowledge, pretend you're a seer or something. That's another thing that just kinda kills fics for me, I don't even know why.

** I may get some shit for this but... Own up to it. You are writing a SI fic, which literally means inserting yourself into a fictional world of your choice. It's the most blatant form of wish fullfilment in fiction. You want the SI to be super smart? Go for it. You want everyone to like SI? Sure. You want the SI to have a harem? Why the fuck not, honestly.

It's your insert, don't care about pesky things like "quality" if it keeps you from having the most fun. Like, oh your SI is going to have an all-male harem but you want Hermione in there without ruining the dickfest? Change her gender and explain it away by saying it's AU. The established rules of canon or fanon don't matter, your prose doesn't matter, SI-fics are one of the few forms of art where you only need to care about your personal enjoyment. Hell, don't even care about internal consistency if it gets in the way. Masashi Kishimoto didn't and he was supposed to be the professional writer of a world-wide phenomenon.

I always get more enjoyment out of blatantly unapologetic SI-fics than I do with ones that try to be all well-written and meaningful.

*** I agree with everything except the well-written part. The grammar HAS to be at least decent, or I can't enjoy it at all.

*** Five minutes ago, I would have said that those are bullshit excuses but you've convinced me with your unapologetic commentary. Now that I think about it, I too have the most fun reading SI fics where the insert is absolutely unapologetic no-filter about his thoughts and most of his actions. Though I would still say that not having blatant internal world consistency errors and grammar errors just makes a story better for everyone.

** Honestly for me, I would enjoy a fic more if they didn't interact with Harry/Ron/Hermione and did their own thing whether that means another time period or something else entirely.

Magic is magical but we never really explore the way it can change your life. I don't mind SIs being a bit self-indulgent and lacking in plot. Life doesn't really have a plot, you just do the best you can. The biggest objective is to survive then to thrive.

Struggling. We know that magic is more than words and wand waving. It doesn't matter how many spells the SI knows the name of, they've never studied the theory that Hogwarts spells so long on.

** Having change in the story, but not everything working out perfectly. The SI having to actually struggle to do things, rather it's because they decide not to tell anyone, or even if they do, because there's just so much to do.

Have it NOT be about romance, I love romance stories, but so many of them eventually have the SI end up in a relationship, which I wouldn't necessarily mind, but not the reason I want to read SI stories.

Maybe characters still get hurt or even killed, even with the SI trying to help, just because the SI has information, if you start changing so much, it'll create a butterfly affect, to the point where your knowledge might not matter as much, or things start happening differently because the SI is there.

Maybe explore the magical side of the Harry Potter stories, using Charms, Transfiguration and others, more then Harry did.

The SI can interact with Harry/Ron/Hermione, if in Golden Trio Era or the Marauders, if in the Marauder Era, but it'd make it more interesting to me at least, if they were more in the background... or were friends with Ginny, Colin, Dean, Seamus or someone like that instead of the immediate main characters.

Of course, this is your SI more then anyone's, if you want to write your SI having a romance, or interact with Harry/Hermione/Ron, go ahead and go for it.

** The narration. Please don't use First Person or whatever POV most writers use for SI fics. Feels like I'm reading some Diary.

The SI must not try to fix EVERYTHING the author believes is wrong with canon.

The SI must not be an extension of your thoughts and opinions. Let the SI be a character of his own.
