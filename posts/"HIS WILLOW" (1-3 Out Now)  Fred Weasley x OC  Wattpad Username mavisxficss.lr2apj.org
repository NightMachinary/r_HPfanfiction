CONTAINS TRIGGERING THINGS !

Description:

Is Gracie's Frederick long gone or is he inside his alluring self?

"You and I, always and forever." Fred relents.

"Promise?" I ask.

"Promise," he mumbles kissing my hand.

~ ~ ~

"You promised!" I shout, tears falling down my rosy cheeks...

My eyes shift to his shiny ginger hair, to his calming brown eyes that never fail to comfort me.

My Frederick is gone.
