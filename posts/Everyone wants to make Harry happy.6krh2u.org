Yeah, I'm basically looking for stories where everyone wants to make Harry happy, Harry befriends some super powerful force, or Harry's just an adorable little shit who has a ton of overprotective friends.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

******* I'm not saying it's not a valid way of doing it. I'm saying that some of them are actually quite good and it's easy enough to remember their titles because of that in which case you just need to take a look at the chapter list (though, obviously, you can still use Google for that).

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
