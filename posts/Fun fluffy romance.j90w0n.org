I like romcoms a lot. And in the case of Harry Potter I mostly prefer rare ships -involving Harry- lately (never liked ginny, got kind of bored of Hermione, and with exceptions (Cedric or Viktor are fine) not too fond of slash).

But it has been a while since I can find nice ship fics. Most of the fics with pairings these days seem to have a greater plot behind, and while I dont mind it if its well done... Thats not always the case. Also, somehow they always turn out to be:

1) Harems or

2) One pairing but with unending smut

3) Political/independent Harry (Im specially burn out of this ones, because they are everywhere and too simmilar to each other)

4) Too long that I never finish reading them. (I mean, a fic of 100 or even 200k words is fine. But when it gets too 500-1000k. COME ON...!)

Could you recommend me some romance fics with fluffy/funny situations? (I dont mind drama if its not too excesive). I dont mind if they are short or long either.

Some recommendations myself:

Linkffn(Ice Cream) , Linkffn(Twins) , Linkffn(Fair Lady) , Linkffn(To Touch the Stars) , Linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent)

  ‘Hey, is everything..?' Harry began to form the question, but it dissipated into nothingness. Why was he finding this so hard? Luna had been there for him countless times, always with the right words, or lack thereof. He frowned at himself. Luna deserved a better friend. Luna deserved the kind of friend that she was to him.‘Hey, Luna,' he said, more determined this time. Luna looked up at him from where she was putting away the dishes. ‘Wanna go for a ride?'

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

  Harry knew Luna well...didn't he. This is a little oneshot, featuring what could have been on the night of Horace Slughorn's Christmas Party. There are no lemons, but there is a rather intense discussion of more mature themes. Just a little lighthearted snippet, with spades of fluff, along with a bit of humour (I hope?).

** I mostly read slash so I'll recommend some harry/cedric fics I think are absolutely gorgeous and romantic

linkao3(275707) not so much fluffy but very romantic and also heartbreaking.

linkao3(14016627) cute, fluffy and funny. Harry is adorable and Cedric thinks so too, Cedric likes puns and Harry likes Cedric

linkao3(12059778) Harry and Cedric in Italy, there is a some angst with Cedric navigating his muggle grandmother who loves him unequivocally

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

  Years after the war, the last place Harry expected to see Cedric was on a plane headed to Florence.

** If I may humbly submit a recent work of my own... A one-shot post-war fluff based on a notion of SSHG and RLNT double-dating.
