Not sure how to do this but an idea that popped into my head and I'm sure something has been done before. Maybe. That's the beauty of fan fiction, anything can happen.

It got sparked by seeing Harry alone in the forest, possibly struggling with his magic or Obscurus and a Centaur encounters the child, shifting to seeing that Harry was kind to all creatures, even Aragog doesn't mind the presence of the child (even if they're a "pest" in the Acromancula's mind) even allowing the child to ride one of his many children.

One moment had a Harry scowling at their shoes before keeping her feet barefooted. Maybe Harry just like the feel of being connected to the earth.

I kind of like the idea that none of the teachers know that Harry is under their noses until the letter, would make for some interesting Hogwarts legends about the pale feral child that hissed.

As for pairings, I see far too many possibilities so I'll leave that for the writer.

I'm not sure if this is a great prompt but I thought people might like the idea enough to write about it.


** Anyone remember the name of the one where Harry assumes he's a forest elf? Cause that fits pretty well with this.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
