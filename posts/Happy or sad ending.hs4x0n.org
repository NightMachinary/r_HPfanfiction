I know the answer seems obvious; do what feels right or do the happy one. But I just need someone else's opinion, I guess. So, should I give my fic a happy or sad ending? It's a rewrite, actually, and the old version had a happy ending. What do I do? Both endings are almost the same, except in one Harry survives, and in the other, he doesn't.

Edit: I have decided on a sad one, since my fic has Angst as one of its genres anyway.


** Happy ending! I don't read ff for heavy angst and sadness.

*** Ah, well, there's plenty of angst in my fic. It's one of the genres, in fact.

**** I read angst with a happy ending, but if a fic is depressing with no payoff I skip it. Pure fluff is too boring to read for longer than a one shot, just like pure angst for the sake of suffering is too dark. I do consume other media with sadder/bittersweet endings but fanfiction is a happy place. Not sure how popular my viewpoint is though.

Some authors do alternate endings so you could always write both? I've seen it done on ao3 anyway.

** In my opinion... I'd say it depends on your genre, and it depends on what, artistically, it means for that character to die.

You mentioned in another comment that your story is already an angst-like genre, so that's good. As for the second point, you really just have to consider the pros and cons from a story standpoint. Is that death going to mean something? Will that death inspire change in the story/characters? Is that death going to support a central theme of your work? Is it logically feasible for that character to survive that situation, or is it going to read as contrived if you let them survive?

Conversely, if that character lives, will they meaningfully contribute to the message you're trying to convey? Will they influence the story/characters by staying alive? Will they reinforce ideas you have previously introduced?

In my opinion, /nobody/ likes when a main character dies. But moments of tragedy become poignant when they have lasting impact both in universe and out. So it's a matter of artistic integrity and a matter of priorities: would you rather preserve the message of your story as you think it should be told, or would you rather make your audience happy?

I can't really tell you which one to choose - neither is objectively wrong or right. You don't owe your audience a happy ending when it comes to your own work of art, and there's equally nothing wrong with wanting to preserve the original essence of your story as you first wrote it. But it just depends on your preference with how you want to engage with your audience, and, if it comes down to it, what will leave you with the fewest regrets.

** in my PERSONAL opinion I think that there are too many happy ending fics out there or fics where he dies for like 3 seconds and comes back. Sometimes I just like an ending that is sad and hes just dead idk why

** I prefer the happy ending. Especially in romance centric fixes which is what I usually read. Plus I really love for an epilogue that shows harry/? and what happened after the ending ie sending their kids off to hogwarts like in the books or just the couple getting married,find out their pregnant, having the kid and the family getting together knowing who ended up together all that jazz
