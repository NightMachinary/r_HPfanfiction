:END:
I don't remember all the specific details, but I do remember a part where Harry (AKA the SI), intentionally sent a letter to the Daily Prophet, in which he declares war on the Death Eater. He also adds in some lines from Liam Neeson's speech in Taken, the whole "I have a particular set of skills, I will find you and I will kill you" thing.
