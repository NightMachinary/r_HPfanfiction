I really liked this story and was curious if there were anymore like it out there. I cant link the story but if you haven't read it I recommend it.

Never read it, but I figured I'd link it for you anyways.

#+begin_quote
  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.
