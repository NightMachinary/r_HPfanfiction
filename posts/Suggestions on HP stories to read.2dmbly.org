I'm looking for some good HP fics to read. The only qualification I have for fics is that they're good, that is that the plot is good and realistic and the writing is well done with good grammar and spelling. Thanks.

Yes, I'm whoring out my own story to see if more people like it.

**** Well the end of book one shouldn't be too many more chapters, though I'm planning on continuing until Voldemort is completely defeated. Yet that won't take all seven years, so it's not going to be a million words... I hope.

** Browse, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][sort by favourites]]. Caveat: Robst is very popular, but his writing skills are less than perfect.

Here are some of mine:

*** Unfortunately, the largest reason I have to ask for stories to read is because HP fanfiction is full of bad, but popular stories. I usually find stories by searching by favorites, but with HP that doesn't work. Robst is a good example of the fandom in that way.

Thank you for the story recommendations.

**** It's a bit of an eclectic list, but all these authors seem to put quite a bit of work into writing polished prose. To give a quick synopsis:

- nonjon is most notable for his humor writing and has written several of the most beloved stories in the fandom.
- Arsinoe de Blassenville writes very polished prose and doesn't pull punches with respect to flaws in canon characters.
- Perspicacity is all over the map in terms of subject matter, ranging from humor to horror, and though he's a decent writer, most of his stuff is in third person, present tense, which can be offputting to some.
- Inverarity's /Alexandra Quick/ series is exceptionally creative worldbuilding, a multi-novel, entirely separate HP world set in the U.S.
- Voice of the Nephilim is (in my opinion) a highly underrated author who writes edgy work. He's a very accomplished suspense writer.
- Deadwoodpecker is a Harry/Ginny shipper with pro-quality chops.
- Northumbrian also writes about an extensive, canon-consistent, post-Hogwarts world that's oddly compelling.

Being in the middle of The Golden Age at the moment, I'd argue that he exaggerates the characters' flaws until they're caricatures.

** Check out my favorites on fanfiction.net. I promise they are all great stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eflame7926][https://www.fanfiction.net/~flame7926]]

** in general, I'd recommend sifting through the more popular writers' favorites list to find stories you might like. If you set your search terms to all stories (you'll have to change the rating to all instead of k->t or whatever) then sort by reviews or favorites, most of the top authors have hundreds of widely assorted and unique stories and recommendations attached to their profile. Further, I think you should take a look at ARedHair's profile (hint: fanfiction.net/~USERNAME), and if you make judicious use of the hide profile button, you might find quite a few good ones. I have some only profile as well, though you'll have to ignore my pitiful offerings and skip to the favorites tab.

eventually you might find stories from way back in 2003 (post-HBP) or even earlier that stand the test of time and several canon blasts, yet have fallen out of sight and mind due to the sorting methods of FFnet.
