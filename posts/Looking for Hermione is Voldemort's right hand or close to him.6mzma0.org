I am looking for a fic I swear I read but cannot remember what the title is. I just remember that Hermione is close to Voldemort (like right-hand close). Instead of branding her with the Dark Mark he gives her a necklace that outwardly looks inconspicuous but to those who are in Voldemorts Death Eaters they will see the dark mark. The other cool thing is that Hermione can choose who (outside the Death Eaters) gets to see the dark mark and who does not.


** It could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5010568/1/In-Too-Deep][In Too Deep]], linkffn(5010568). Not sure though.

A fic based on [[https://i.redd.it/scttpy8q9ffy.jpg][that picture]] would be hilarious though.

  Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target. HHR
