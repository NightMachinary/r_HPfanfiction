Bonus if it's with extreme reluctance. I just recently read Family by Necessity and I am most the way through Stealing Harry and quite like the idea of Snape being involved in raising Harry.

I've also read The Meaning of Mistletoe and the rest of its series (adoption of sorts from a young age) and it's one of my fave fics of all time.

He doesn't need to be the main parent, I just like it when he has to reevaluate his view on Harry.

** Linkffn(The Best Revenge) has Snape willingly taking a role in raising Harry. It has a sequel, and it's well-written (I'm guilty of re-reading it several times)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

**** Potions and Snitches doesn't have the size of ao3 or ffn (nor the filtering system of the former), but if you're looking for nonromantic Snape & Harry fics, it's definitely worth browsing through. (I'd suggest starting with their "featured stories" list.)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

I took a look, and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/922767]]) is rather worth reading. The series was last updated just over a year ago, but all the parts are complete. Though fair warning, the adoption doesn't happen right away, and the series is 745k words long at present, with each subsequent part being longer than the last. Also it's drarry, which doesn't appeal to everyone.
