I don't have a problem with female protagonists - Lady Archimedes and its prequel are among my favorite stories of all time.

Keeping that in mind, however, I've never been able to get behind fem!Harry stories. Not because of the gender-swap, but because they seem to be poorly written more often than usual for fanfiction.

I'd /really/ like it if someone could honestly put a breath of fresh air into this tag for me!

I like reading stories where the protagonist is intelligent and powerful. Discovering new things, solving problems, /politics~/.

Does anyone have any stories they know of that fit this?

EDIT: I forgot:

I don't mind romance. If a story you want to recommend has it, that's fine. So long as it isn't /too overbearing/. I dislike romance stories in general. <3


** I agree with A Long Journey Home. Absolutely fantastic story.

Murkybluematter's linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is really good too, on book four, but is incomplete.

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). I mean, the character is a female Harry, who is intelligent, powerful, and ruthlessly pragmatic. On the flip side, it is far more about the exploration of absurdism than anything else. Don't let that deter you though, because it is the fic everyone should read.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

**** I wouldn't really classify it as "powerful Harry" though. Sure, Harry(Mel) is working on it but generally she's average. It's very much realistic in that sense, just because Mel decides she needs to be better doesn't mean that she's gonna be a godlike witch through half a year of training.

She's progressing fast but she's just very far behind and I don't expect her to ever be strong enough to beat Voldemort.

So while the fic technically fits OP's requirement, the focus of it is not on Mel being super powerful. It's more about her noticing how fucked up her life is, how much of that is actually partly her fault and what she can do to fix it.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** linkffn(A butterfly effect by SlyGoddess) Still has my favorite Sirius chasing Peter scene I've ever seen. Politics exist but aren't a strong point of the story, but intelligent and powerful fit pretty well.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) Just backing up midasgoldentouch here. Fantastic story.

linkffn(Princess of the blacks by SilentlyWatches) Fairly political at times, underhanded wee bit OP protagonist (although Voldemort seems similarly powered up). Johnsmitish warnings definitely apply.

I could have sworn [[/u/taure]] had a fic with a female protagonist who was learning etiquette from Dumbledore and practiced somnamancy. It might be on DLP or something... Or maybe I finally went insane.

** Princess of the Blacks did it incredibly well, with a bit of romance added in. Powerful fem!Harry, who solved problems not through power but through cunning, and whose family was heavily involved in the political world. I love it.

Just keep in mind, part of the story is that Jen, or fem!Harry, was raised in a bad environment that invovled child prostitution. I'd say don't let that skew your view of the story, since it doesn't come up that often, but since the entire first chapter is literally set in a brothel, just keep it in mind.
