*** Funny - almost all the ones I've come across were Dramione because in canon only Hermione goes back for her 7th year.

Because /obviously/ without Harry and Ron around, Hermione would fall head over heels for Draco. /s

***** Sorry I wasn't at all helpful. You could try that ao3 8th Year tag mentioned in the comment I was replying to though and just filter out the ships you don't like.

****** It's alright! I might give that a go. I've just never had luck finding a good/worth reading fic via filters and such. Much better to get recommendations.
