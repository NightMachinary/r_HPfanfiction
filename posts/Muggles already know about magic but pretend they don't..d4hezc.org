Be a funny crack fic, wizards being the idiots they are never bothered to hide the top of Diagon Alley and it was seen by planes and such. Wizards performing magic in the streets are caught on camera. Muggleborns are discovered by the police when they experience accidental magic etc.

** So we have two groups trying to hide magic, the wizards and the muggle government? If everyone knew about magic then the wizards would find out pretty quickly

*** Wizards don't exactly talk to muggles... And the muggles aren't necessarily trying to hide the fact they know. It could even be that a part of wizards are hiding but a large part of muggleborns are known about and are part of the muggle world still

*** Maybe they're just trying to humor the wizards, because wizards have little to no regard for non-magical individuals, considering them subhuman, and thus normal people just pretend to not know about magic so they don't get mass obliviated/murdered.

**** This made me think of a short fic about the Grangers which takes place after Hermione reveals the whole obliviation scenario. The Granger parents basically live an undercover life, permanently terrified of displeasing their witch daughter who may then decide to... well, obliviate them.

***** I loved that fic because it felt like finally there was a fic that didn't act like obliviating ones parents and making them a whole new life without even speaking to them was completely fine and the parents shouldn't be mad in any way.

** Wouldn't the muggleborns give the game away? Like, not one muggle parent has informed McGonagall that they already know all about magic, and they already know their kid is magical? Muggleborns don't go around casually spilling the beans to classmates and teachers? Muggles don't recognize and resist mass obliviation events? Not one Prime Minister has ever asked a single Minister for Magic why muggles and magicals can't just dispense with the pretending and formally strike the silly, pointless Statute of Secrecy from the lawbooks?

And what about government regulations? If muggles in general know about the wizarding world in general, then is Education Scotland going to be knocking on Hogwarts doors at some point? What about the NHS and all these healers going around prescribing literal witches' brew that might contain toxic flowers and heavy metals? Is the justice system planning on doing anything about house elf slavery?

For all muggles to pretend to not know about the wizarding world would require that a lot of laws have illogical exceptions.

*** Well, they are technically a separate nation, so there might be no Muggle jurisdiction over the magical world. I mean, the British borders might very well match between the worlds, but who do you reckon is responsible for Bohemia, Silesia, Alsace or Belarus? And even in Britain, you have the question of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
