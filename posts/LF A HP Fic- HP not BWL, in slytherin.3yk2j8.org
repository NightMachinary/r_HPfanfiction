Looking for a specific fic that was recommended here a few weeks ago. Harry is not the BWL, Neville is. Lily and James are dead and Harry lives with the Dursely. The fic starts the summer before fifth year. They are at the Order headquarters and Sirius invites Harry to spend the summer.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.
