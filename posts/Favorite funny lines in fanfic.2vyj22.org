  "I'm not a parseltongue," Harry tiredly explained. "I'm a parselmouth. The language I can speak and understand is parseltongue. And if you've ever seen an anaconda you can understand why I sometimes get called a parselcrotch."

*** A Black Comedy is just a treasure trove of little jokes and one-liners. My favorite is this scene from Chapter 18:

#+begin_quote
  "Greetings," Albus loudly said as the two Potters and he approached. "Lord Black and Lord Black. I'm delighted to see you accepted Professor Potter's invitation."

  Harry could feel his mother's approach and tried to pretend there was nothing out of the ordinary. "Please Headmaster, for tonight, I'm Harry and he's Sirius."

  Sirius noticed Harry slinking away and slapped him hard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, while adding, "But unless you count his back, he's not really hairy. And I am rarely serious."

  "Oof," Harry groaned, partly from the smack and partly from Sirius' line. "Can't you not crack a name joke, just once?"

  Albus' eyes were twinkling as he added, "If it makes you feel any better, I've never been more than two-thirds bus. Further proof there really is no truth in advertising."

*** My personal favorite line from that was in Dumbledore and Harry's conversation in chapter 22

#+begin_quote
  "Really?" Albus asked in happy surprise. "I always knew Miss Black was quite powerful but... is that why you wanted to separate her from the Dark Lord?"

  Harry blinked. "Sure, I mean, that and... she's hot."

  "I hardly think being attractive should matter in this."

  "Maybe not," Harry playfully admitted. "But it helps when we loan her out for sex to our guests."

  "Harry," Albus reprimanded.

  "Why do you think Jimmy likes coming over so much?"

  Albus lightly reminded, "With the charm, I can tell when you're lying."

  *"Right," Harry agreed. "And Bellatrix is carrying Remus' illegitimate baby."*

  Albus furrowed his brow in uncertainty. "At least I thought I could."

  Harry's eyes were twinkling merrily.

** Pretty much every other line in Seventh Horcrux:

"Bloody hell, are those brains?" Ron yelped.

"Enough, Ron. We'll get you one on the way out."

** I can't remember which fic this is from but "Shag me silly and call me Nancy" was a good one. Fred said it it regards to Hermione doing something, I think.

** "It's a Polish tea kettle," said George. "You put it on the fire and it freezes."

I don't remember where I saw this one, but I busted a gut for a solid 5 minutes. FYI I'm Polish and my friends and I love to make jokes about it.

** "The closet got too cramped. Me, the fur coats, the fir trees, the magic lion."

And:

“So I'm here, I'm queer, and I'm drinking butterbeer. Lock up your sons.”

Both Justin Flinch-Fletchey, in a Drarry fic I gave up on when ten chapters in there was still no sign of Drarry. But still, some great lines.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20: pretty much anything, especially from Dumbledore.

"My, things /do/ seem to be going wrong today. This isn't a tour group at all, it's the entire assembled Wizengamot!"

And this line from HPMOR:

/If you want a little more detail/, said Harry's Inner Hufflepuff, /The Defence Professor was all like, "Let's go and break Bellatrix out of Azkaban!" and you were all like "Okay!"./

Source is obvious.

#+begin_quote
  "You know," Colin said, reminding Hermione that he was still at her side, "when I heard that Harry had finished the Dark Lord, I thought this might turn out to be a quiet year."

  "I quite agree Colin," Hermione nodded. "It seems we've traded horrifically dangerous for psychotically silly."

Hiding in Plain Sight

There are so many I'm going to wind up reading a dozen stories and forgetting about this thread.
