Are there any? It's something that I would have THOUGHT would exist but I couldn't find a fic like this on FFN so if anyone happens to know one I'd be grateful!


** There are some bur mostly unfinished/abandoned weird slash ships, or MOD superop!harry prancing around. Just to go fanfiction.net and search crossovers HP/IC or on ao3, there you can specify more.

** As far as I'm aware, the only decent quality Inheritance crossover doesn't have Harry as a rider. Not that much of a fandom, Inheritance sadly just isn't that popular.

**** linkffn(9622073)

Only one I'm aware of, at least. It's finished up to the point where the Inheritance Cycle ends, but abandoned further.

** I don't know any crossover fic with the Inheritance Cycle, but I saw that in FF.net there's a page for that crossover. Just search Harry Potter Inheritance Cycle on Google and you should be able to find it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Inheritance-Cycle-Crossovers/224/1992/]]

If you are interested in Dragonrider Harry in general I recommend The Queen who Fell on Earth linkffn(7591040). It's a crossover with the Dragonriders of Pern and it's good. I read it without knowing anything about Dragonriders of Pern and I enjoyed it. It's long and if I'm not mistaken it has 2 sequels.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.
