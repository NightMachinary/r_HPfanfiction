What are those words, names or sentences that make you nope right out of the general vicinity of a fanfiction?

The one thing that makes me skip any fanfiction instantly are the words (manipulative) old coot. In my experience, those fics often have a horribly done Dumbledore, an obnoxious Harry and bashing, all of which I hate to read.

And in your case?

** Grammar or spelling errors. If you can't be bothered to proofread your summary, your fic is likely worse.

Word to chapter ratio of less than 3000-1. If you have 47 chapters and 54,000 words, your fic is likely crap.

Story post date prior to 2014 is a warning flag with a recently updated fic. Long hiatus periods usually means the plot thread has been forgotten and there is no coherency to the narrative.

If the summary includes the words bashing, Dumbles, lordships, mate, creature, or magical core, it probably will be noped by me too.

I find something similar works for fanfiction: assume the worst possible story-writing outcome for each question. To use your questions as examples:

What if the premise of this story happened? Who cares.

How will Harry react? Very OOC probably.

Will his friends still like him? Yes because you can't write a story with tension in it, as this summary was clearly meant to have some yet fails utterly.

**edit: first chapter done. I do not have to read the rest to know how it ends (prota will marry Mikoto and their marriage will be so Perfect rainbows appear wherever they go. Naruto will have a strange and inappropriately close relationship with the prota as the prota saved him from the big bad world). The quintessential wish fulfillment fic.

- "I'm bad at writing summaries"

- Poor capitalization or punctuation. Sure, it's not an expression, but if you don't capitalize the 'H' in 'Harry' you deserve my scorn.

- Anything that makes it seem like it is canon compliant, but then Harry realizes that Hermione is his one true love or some bullshit like that.

- Anything that makes it seem like it is canon compliant, but then talks about Ron 'betraying' Harry with the Horcrux hunt thing. No, I'm not getting into that argument today, so don't even try.

** Some of the main ones off the top of my head:

- Snarry

- Ron / Hermione as the main pairing

- Next-gen

- Wrong boy who lived

- OCs as a main character or in the pairing

- Poor spelling or grammar

- 'X character reads the books'

Otherwise it comes down to whether the premise grabs my interest. I have eclectic tastes and will give most things a shot. The first three on the list are the only hard nos in all circumstances, I could be convinced to read anything else on the list with a good recommendation.

** - Any and every use of the word "bashing." If you hate a character so much you have to put in the fucking SUMMARY that you're going to bash them, that's not going to convince me you're mature enough to write an interesting story.
- On a related note, demeaning nicknames in a summary. Dumbles, Voldy, Mo-Ron, Barbi Sue (I still don't know where that one came from for Ginny). They almost always mean bashing.
- Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, Powerful!Harry, or anything like that. They usually just mean Harry's going to be annoying and self-righteous and go on tiresome rants about everything the author doesn't like about canon.
- Manipulative!Dumbledore. Not only does this usually mean bashing, but his so-called "manipulations" are laughable and transparent like nobody's business.
- Harry/Hermione. I've yet to read a fic where that paring wasn't just BORING. And usually it means Ron-bashing too. No thanks.

And finally, one thing in a summary that doesn't make me skip the story, even if it really should:

- Harem fic. Harem fics are never GOOD. I've yet to read one that wasn't cringeworthy or sexist. (Yes, that includes the Firebird Trilogy,) And yet I keep checking them out, even though I know they're likely going to be awful. It probably has something to do with my old increasingly-less-secret fantasy of being a harem girl...

My one exception to it is minor bashing in a comedy fic, as long as it is all comical and not attacking. (Basically, characters poking fun at each other, not the author slamming a character into oblivion.)

On a similar note, any H/Hr story that has the whole typical "Ron betrayed Harry, Ginny faked a pregnancy, Mrs. Weasley demanded a huge dowry, etc." in the first chapter, I am done. I'm a huge HP/GW fan, but I would like to see one good H/Hr just to see a different perspective and without all the character assassination.

But in the topic of rape, child abuse. It really mentally disturbs more.

That's the point, imho. I mentioned Pasolini's Salo earlier, in this movie, Pasolini uses it to make a strong political statement and to make the viewer think back over his own position as a watcher. The movie's hard to watch, but it's really great.\\
In Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, it ups the tension considerably and makes the story very compelling.
