** This is like the slash version of Harry/Daphne, isn't it? I've seen a Ménage à trois story between Harry, Hermione and Theo, but I can't recall if the boys did anything more than kiss.

** There's linkao3(485605)

Harry ends up with Theo AND Charlie. Creaturefic and Haremfic, which I usually don't like, but put on my to-read list anyway. I've only read some of it, so I can't say whether it has a quality plot, but at least it has good grammar and syntax and a promising beginning.

Also, because Harry/Theo fics are so rare, I figured I'd add a few fics that have Theodore Nott as a main character, even if he's not in the main pairing. Yeah, I know it's not what you asked for, but he's REALLY rare, and I tried. :/ Both of these fics are Drarry, with Theodore as an important side character.

linkao3(1955451)

linkao3(9307985)

The first one is "Fighting the Green" and is a full AU--Neville is the BWL and Harry's parents are alive I think. Theo is Slytherin!Harry's close friend and really an amazing character all around. Great story. A++ It looks abandoned, but the author said she was going to start working on it again.

The second one is another full AU, if Voldemort had taken over Hogwarts and society is divided between Purebloods and non-Purebloods. Theo's a main character and there's a Harry/Draco/Theo triangle vibe. This one's still updating and incredibly addictive once you get over the mediocre first couple chapters.

  Harem!Fic Harry inherits a creature "thing" from both sides of his parents and somehow that leads to weird sleeping habits, conversations with Theodore Nott and finding himself caught up in a world of Dragons, elemental powers and new creatures he's never heard of before. Dragons? Mates? Very AU. Contains all kinds of slash.

  In 1981, Voldemort burned down the old magical world and built his own empire on top of it. A decade later, a scarless but powerful Harry Potter begins his education, determined to prove himself. But chaos and violence rule this new Hogwarts, and making it out alive won't be easy. Especially not for the boy destined to be the Dark Lord's nemesis.
