This started after reading some Harry/Fleur. The idea behind this is that when Fleur choses Harry as her mate as befitting the Veela trope, Harry rejects the bond as he barely knows her and thinks her vain and conceited. A bitter and angry Fleur disappears after the Triwizard Tournament, and ten years later, resurfaces as a nascent Dark Lady. Her goal ? To take what is rightfully hers/kill the man who stole her ability to feel love. Your choice.

If there are already fics in this trend, kindly link them. Otherwise, go ahead. These are the only outlines I have for this prompt. Scenes from Harry rejecting her to her rise as a Dark Lady, all would be appreciated.


** Can somebody please recommend me a fanart of Fleur Delacour after she had created horcruxes? It's kind of hard to imagine a red-eyed, snake faced, noseless Veela.
