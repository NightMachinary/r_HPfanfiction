In the books we never really get a moment where the purebloods go "oh wow muggles might actually be equally or more advanced than us" and them learning about muggle society, modern science, and other muggle achievements. Something where Hermione or Harry schools them would be fantastic!! I would SO love to read something like that. I'm also not a huge fan of HPMOR, although I find the premise really interesting I'm not crazy about how Harry is written.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
