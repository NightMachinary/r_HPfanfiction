It was a humour fic that involved Harry living in a trunk a lot and everyone was trying to tell him it wasn't safe and he shouldn't do it. Can't remember much more than that, but I would like to reread it. Thanks

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
