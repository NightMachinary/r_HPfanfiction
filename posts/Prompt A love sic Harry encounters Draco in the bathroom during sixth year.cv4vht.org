Harry Potter, who has slowly come to terms with his crush on Draco Malfoy and his(Harry's) to do just about anything from Draco. Stumbled across Draco's breakdown in the bathroom during sixth year and must decide what to do. 1) Help Draco kill Dumbledore. 2) Turn Draco against Voldemort. 3) Abandon the Draco for the greater good. Or 4) some other option I haven't thought of that would cause equal amounts of drama.


** Erm, not exactly falling under your options, but I'm working on a fic that literally begins with the bathroom scene. It's call *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20292376][Soul Bound]].*

Summary: /In order to save Draco, Harry agrees to something he knows nothing about. Now the two of them have to figure out how to handle being Soul Bound without driving one another crazy./

/On the other end of the spectrum, Seamus meets a very interesting boy and who knew Snape was in a relationship!/

/Eighth year changes everything./
