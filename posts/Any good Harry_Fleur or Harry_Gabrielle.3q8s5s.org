Any good fics that have Harry/Fleur or Harry/Gabrielle as the pairing


** It's not romance, per se, but if you want an off the wall fic then read linkffn(The Little Veela That Could). Quite an interesting take on veela.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] BY Jeconais is a very good H/GD.

If you are looking for Harry/Veela for fluff then this isn't the story for you. However, if you want a good story that will hit you right in the feels linkffn(10027124) is an great story.

*** I couldn't make it past chapter 9 or 10 of this. It's not the most cliche H/F story out there, but for a brand new story, it is a bit disappointing. It if wasn't for the daily updates, most people probably wouldn't even give it a second glance. But, any story is better than no story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation][The British Reformation]]: After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too. Harry/Fleur.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7045518/1/Not-So-Great-Escape][Not So Great Escape]]: Fleur Delacour hates how people treat her. Bill Weasley is no different and Fleur takes drastic action. She uses the nearest boy to escape from Bill Weasley but the boy, however, is Harry Potter. AU, one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry][Allure Immune Harry]]: Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beauxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously(sic). One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6174426/1/Champions][Champions]]: Harry takes a moment to help another Champion during the Second Task, and the unexpected aftermath forever changes his life. (/Incomplete and abandoned, but still an enjoyable read./)

***** It took me three tries, but I actually enjoyed it. It's Super!Harry without becoming Lord!Harry or some typical power up plot device. It's Harry surviving based on what he experienced in past lives. It's a bit ridiculous but actually tolerable.

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
