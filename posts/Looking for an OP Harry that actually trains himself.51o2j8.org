Looking for a fic where Harry is OP, but doesn't get op from the first chapter. I want him to train, get stronger and stronger, while his enemies do the same. Kinda like Lightning Dragons Roar by Zero Rewind.

Bonus points if he is using lightning magic and or rare magic.

70k+ words!

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

Off the top of my head I would recommend linkffn(Forging the Sword).

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)
