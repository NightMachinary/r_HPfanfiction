Any storys with Harry x Bellatrix, Narcissa, Andromeda or a mix of all three ( obviously this would have to be Harry being older or deal with time travel when they are in Hogwarts still)

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

**** More like "completed" completed. The actual story finished back in May. But at the beginning of the month, the author started posting extra chapters that take place between the end of the story and the epilogue, so it's still updating. They're really more like one shot sequels or something. I honestly got bored reading the first few, so I haven't bothered much since them.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
