I don't really mind what POV it's from, but I'd definitely like it to be either Harry or Hermione's. Either 1930s-50s or Marauders era is best, and I don't really care what pairing there is, as long as it's not completely insane. +50k word count is best.. what can I say, I'm definitely a binge reader. But definitely NO a/b/o dynamics, m-preg, or equally weird fetish stuff. Some I like currently (sorry lol, don't know how to tag, but they're all on Ao3) Give Them Triumph Now, Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat, Yesterday Is Tomorrow (everything is connected), Blood and Gold and Birds Of A Feather. Hopefully my standards aren't too high haha.


** I made this list:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ymqb6/my_hermione_timetravel_compendium_of_the_last/?st=k10jvin3&sh=8be4e072]]

My favorite is probably “one hundred sixty nine”.

Ffbot was weird that day so the links aren't great. There's also the first thread of this type I made linked there. I'm thinking of making a part three when I get a chance. I'm also currently reading the Gates of Azkaban, sequel to the excellent Cactus and the Toad, which has now turned into Hermione going back in time.

Toad: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad]]

*** One hundred sixty nine was enjoyable, but my god does the third act just drag on and on and on...

Also, the "Happy" ending felt a bit downer to me, How they treat the Hermione from the new timeline is just horrible, the Grangers are confounded to think they are the Wilkins and sent to australia. So the Hermione originally from this timeline doesn't get her years at Hogwarts with Harry and Ron, Hermione's daughter gets that honor...

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

** For Hermione's point of view, my favourite is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]]) It also has Ginny's, Sirius's, Luna's and Regulus's pov.

For Harry, definitely linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

These are both Marauders' era and longer than you asked for, although not yet complete. They both update every two months or so, usually with a few chapter at once.

** I remember really enjoying Before the Dawn linkffn(6897584) and One by One linkffn(7265052). Before the Dawn is the first, following a Hermione who time travelled and has circled back round to POA, and One By One has the actual time travel in it, though you should really read Before the Dawn first.
