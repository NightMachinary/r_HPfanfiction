I would love to read any homeless/street kid Harry fics. I don't care what age he is, or if there are any pairings or not. MUST be complete, any rating is fine. The longer the better. Don't care how unrealistic it is or if it's super Harry or anything else like that! Give me your favourites!!!

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or HolzschuhkÃ¤se.

Harry ran away from the Dursleys and due to the odd interaction between electricity and magic, he accidentally removed every single tracking spell on himself by hiding near a 3-phase power transformer*.

Cut to the third year when an Owl finally finds Harry with a Hogwarts Letter and he decides that maybe he should see if it's real and if so, is there anything in it for him.

^{\}Magic at high enough power disrupts electrical items, so the reverse is very plausible too.)

**** Where did you get that? I got them being far to tired to deal with that shit/not even knowing what they were talking about and then tired resignation when severus learned it was about sex. Like, they seemed pretty tired and upset and very not awww ing. Also it was Hermione who said that, not Harry, and she was 15 or maybe 16 where 16 is age of consent in the UK.

Also pretty sure Tom was in disguise as someone of undetermined youth.

Besides that, if it was Harry it wouldn't be pegging, Harry is pretty definitively male.

Like, mildly squicky but not half as squicky as you make it sound, nothing to do with slash at all, and you got all the facts off.

Even worse was that this was after the squicky underage stuff.

Edit: Oh, and iirc the conversation was whispered so the only one who would have heard was Snape who showed himself to very not be with it.

Edit 2: Yeah, double checked and everything. Hell, the extent of Harry's sex life at that point was watching tom and Hermione and all of a single birthday blowjob from Hermione in secret while they were in voldemorts house alone.

Like, dafuq you talking about? Literally nothing you said happened and the only "slash" at that point was a kiss between Harry in Tom

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

He's Seventeen when they find him, but they are in for a shock if they think he'd do what they wanted. Turns out Harry has known Severus for years, he's a metamorphamagus. Dumbledore's manipulations are found out, the world is in for a shock. I want to show a caring side to Dom/Sub so there won't be a rough side to be seen here.
