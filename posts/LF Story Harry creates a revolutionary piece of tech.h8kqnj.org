#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I know I've read that fic, but I can't remember... argh! I'm trying to recall additional details to help narrow it down.

- I think it may have been a time travel fic, I seem to recall Harry doing research in the Hogwarts library and thinking how useful such a device would have been for Hermione.\\
- There were a very limited number made, the first one was special to Harry and made over a period of time, the additional ones may have been duplicates of the original(?)
- I think Remus was given his when he was teaching at Hogwarts
- I think Sirius may have accompanied Harry at the end of the story to see the one placed in the Ministry (and it seems like the device may have been placed where the Fountain of Magical Brethren had been previously?)
- Harry gifted the limited number of devices over a period of time, not all at once.
- In addition to Harry's original, the one given to Remus, the one given to Sirius, and the one in the ministry, I think the twins /might/ have received one, and possibly Snape?

Let me know if any of this seems right or if you remember any other details. I'll keep looking :D
