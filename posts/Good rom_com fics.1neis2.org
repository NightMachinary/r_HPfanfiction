I have no preference in pairings, though femslash would be quite nice.


** A one that I liked, the pairing being Scorose, is called Delicate. Maybe not exactly 'funny' but... Sassy? It's on HPFF, just search Delicate.

** This one's Harry/Ginny, written post-OotP (and therefore not canon-compliant further than that), but it's a really fun read. Enjoy these entries from Ginny Weasley's all-new, totally non-possessing diary. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2214393/1/A-2nd-Round-Of-Journalism]]

** I know this is a fairly well-known fic, so you've probably already heard of it, but my favourite rom/com fic is called 'Commentarius' by 'B.C Daily' ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3323816/1/Commentarius]])

It's an excellently written Jily fic, and it's unbelievably funny in parts. That being said, it's an INSANE time-dump. It's nearly 750,000 words long and it still isn't finished.
