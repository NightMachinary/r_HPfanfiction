I have begun flirting with an idea for a story of epic length. However, it's so heavily AU that I was wondering how comfortable are people (on here at least) in reading a Harry centric story that twists the wizarding world far beyond what JK had initially described. I don't wish to get into extreme detail, however, I was in the mind of a Harry world that attempts to incorporate mythology and religion into the world. Different explanations of magic from different regions based on language and different methods of channeling it - for example; wands are a European method of channeling magic, but other regions channel it through their own methods. Perhaps a more immersive world experience as well, with the explanations beyond that of the books. I haven't completely ironed out the details but I have a really good idea of what I want, along with the direction I wish the story to travel. I don't want to get into further details, as I do not wish to give any of my potential plot away - I personally tend to enjoy a story more when the summary gives only tidbits of information away.

So I ask, how do you feel reading stories where things are different to the books - as far as characters alignments, magical abilities, legends and even history?

I don't want to get anyone's hopes up as of yet! I have yet to put my fingers to work on this story, but daydreaming and making notes for the past week have me eager to get started - which I will... once I hand in my Thesis! (Wish me luck!)


** The only issue with 'Grand Worldbuilding AUs' that I've seen is the tendency to cram a lot of wider-world exposition in the first chapter. This may seem like a good way to use all of your worldbuilding plans, but it's not a good way to introduce a story. Remember, you're writing a story, not a guidebook (unless you are, but that's a whole new genre!).

If you 'show' the big and immediately important bits of your world (think in Harry Potter, we learnt the important basics pretty quickly: Hidden Magical World, Diagon Alley is the main place, Hogwarts is where they all go to school), then tease some of the later ones, that's usually a lot more effective. Give people some questions to ask and promise you'll give them the answers if they keep reading, rather than starting out like you're writing a guidebook to your world. You can still plan it out completely before you even start writing if you want, you just shouldn't tell it all to your reader right out of the gate.

And as a tangential, but related piece of advice - make peace with the fact that a significant portion of your worldbuilding won't directly make it into your narrative. It's there to act as supportive and connective tissue for the stuff that will.

*** Absolutely agree with you here, I too am often off-put by the first chapter explaining every tidbit of difference in the world that it's set in. I always imagined the world-building occurring over a long process, with the reader's knowledge growing with Harry's. I really like the idea of slowly feeding information to a reader, potentially even chapter by chapter, slowly building up the world that the story is set within. I feel that this way, a certain appreciation for the differences can be attained and allows for a smoother transition to separate it from either canon - or other stories that they may be reading at that time.

I have some truly world-bending ideas to add in, something I know many will not like. However, I intend to write this for my own enjoyment as much as the enjoyment of others.

**** Exactly. The building metaphor really is a sound one. I always use a pyramid for this one. You start off with the base - that's the big, broad, heavy and important stuff that'll support everything else in the story - and build up to the pinpoint details at the top. Not only do you get that certain appreciation like you said, you get a deeper understanding of them too. That base foundation works cognitively as well as narratively.

Though my point wasn't so much about slowly feeding information as it was not immediately hitting them with too much of it right out of the gate. You want to slowly lure them into the dark alleyway before you bludgeon them over the head and steal their wallet, right? :)

The slow-feeding works for the rest of the story, but that's up to you. My only nitpick is the intro (and for the record, that intro can stretch out over a few chapters, all the first chapter specifically has to be is attention grabbing and curiosity inducing).

And writing for your own enjoyment is always the best way. This is a hobby after all, and those are supposed to be fun. :)

**** Heh. Indeed. To be fair, it is a hard lesson to learn. I still have to restrain myself in D&D games every now and again and I've been running them for a decade. When you've created something with the intent to show it off to other people, you kinda wanna... show it off to them, y'know? It's a lot harder than it seems to strike that balance between "Let's come on this adventure and explore the world together" and "Come look at this thing I made!" :D

*** I do not disagree with much of what you have said, for me, I also dislike certain stories that go above and beyond to trash the wand or as you said "wank" wandless magic. I do like wands, and don't wish to "one-up" the Harry Potter lore as you say. However, there is something to be admired in exploring different routes for magic. With such a rich history in our own world, where myths and legends depict "magic" in many different ways. I thought it would be interesting to explore how this might have shaped magic in different communities worldwide and add this into a story. For example, European mythology often depicts magic through the usage of staffs - which over time might have evolved into wands. Perhaps the wand allows for a much more refined usage of magic, allowing mundane tasks to be completed - but other parts of the world forgo this ability to use magic in different ways? It's but an idea for now, which may or may not be a huge aspect of the story, but something I would definitely enjoy exploring.

That being said, one of the most advanced pieces of magic depicted throughout the 7 books/movies was Voldemorts wandless fire serpent in book 5 - perhaps he explored more than we have seen, throughout the stories we never got a feel for really advanced magic out there. Something that I expect we will see in Fantastic Beasts!

***** I always took that part as being wandless - I thought the movie's depiction of it also solidified it, but maybe I am wrong?

To reply to the edit that you've made:

I am in complete agreeance! I have a real dislike for blatantly obvious things only being made blatantly obvious to the MC and not to the "specialists" in the story. I haven't come across many of these, but I tend to stay away from stories that depict this. I must apologize, as you perhaps have the wrong idea as to what I meant in my initial post - I did this on purpose as to not potentially give away the plot to anyone who might wish to read it in the future. Your feedback is appreciated, and I thank you for taking the time to communicate your thoughts on this matter.

****** The movies change so much that nothing in them can be taken as confirmation if your base is the books. That's my general take on things, anyway.

*** I always thought wands were just a focus. Sure, it makes spellcasting easier, but they were also adopted because people want to be lazy. MY fic has a character not from earth looking at a wand and saying "Wow, that's a very precise tool/magical focus. I want one, but mostly for when I'm doing 'finicky bits' of magic."

I'm taking the approach of magic being like muscle, the more you use it, the more you get, so if you use the harder to use method of wandless or less exact foci, you'll grow. Also, that precision can balance out power, as in the more precise your use of magic, the less you use for the same effect. My Voldemort is a lot stronger than Albus, but Dumbledore has extremely tightly controlled magic so they end up being about the same level.

** I'm fine with AU, I don't think there's anything special about "canon", and I've read several of the works spawned by HPMOR, that go way far afield from the regular HP universe as you describe. It's just a matter of how well you do it. You might look at Orders of Magnitude, which is the furthest-out of those books as far as I know.

** AU is fine. I would simply recommend that the world building takes second stage to the characters. An interesting world definitely adds flavour to a story, but the meat of it is the people.

** Those extreme AUs are being abandoned at much higher rate than less ambitious fics. Examples:

Emperor

Reign of Serpent

*** I know what you mean. My hope, however, is to flesh out the plot, the differences, characters I will use and their personalities along with the elements I wish to add and remove before I begin writing. I hope that this will give me a solid timeline and allow me to write in a much more free-flowing way, with points of reference to come back to if I ever get stuck. It certainly is ambitious - but exciting!

** I'll at least look at pretty much any AU, but if it's too different and changes characters too much too fast to be completely unrelatable, I do abandon at a higher rate. A lot of fics lose characterization from canon very fast, which is normally fine, but harder when it's also an extreme AU.

** My advice would be not to cram all the world building in one go. But rather spread it out and include each bit a while before its used for the plot. Meaning readers familiarise themselves with your additions and understand how it could effect the AU world. This should avoid the common mistake that makes your additions were only added to further the plot.

Other than that your story idea seems very interesting and you should be fine as long as your additions make sense in the world that you have made.

** I have a fic over 100k words that's an AU of a sort. Essentially, a bunch of dragons from World of Warcraft were fleeing for their lives and appealed to the local friendly diety for a way off the planet. Elune, goddes of the moon looked at them, thought for a moment, then decided to dump them on Harry Potter.

*Elune's Pebble* been pretty well recieved so far, though my exposition dump didn't go over well. Eh, lessons learned an all that.

It's on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], AO3, and hpfanficarchive. FF is cleanish, other sites have adult scenes. I'm working on editing the early chapters for readability, hopefully will update them within a week. (My typing program doesn't quite match up to the sites, turns out I had some minor wall of text problems.)
