I don't feel like getting into a longer work right now, and I thought I'd ask for something I've never read before. I'd prefer harry traveling to the avengers verse but I'll read anything recommended to me.

IMO a one shot should have an ending and tie up everything nicely.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11537017/1/][One Soldier, Two]] is where a FemHarry ends up in an alternate universe in the middle of WW2. Bucky/FemHarry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136/chapters/9358017][Of Wizards and Heroes]] MoD Harry lives long enough to be transported to another dimension where he meets the Avengers and Loki. slash

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
