Hey guys, I am feeling in a romantic adventure mood, and would like to hear from you all. I want to read a fic of80+ words, that features a pairing that is not H/G or H/Hr. Gotta be real with you guys, I loathe those two pairings at this moment. Points will go to those who have suggestions that are complete <3 thanks in advance


** linkffn(2686464) is Harry/Susan Bones, it's fairly good.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

** White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais isn't recommended here alot, but it's one of the few long Harry/Pansy stories and it's complete.
