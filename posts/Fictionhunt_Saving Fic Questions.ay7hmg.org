Hi! I have two questions.

1. Has anyone noticed stories being taken down on FictionHunt? Or is it just me?
2. I am new to this subreddit but I was wondering how people are able to download/save fanfics they like? And if I can't find one online is there a good chance someone might have a copy of it saved? Is that a thing?

Thank you.

** For the first, I've seen stories get removed after an author is notified that their stories are there. They honor authors' requests to have stories removed.

For your second question, I've seen people ask for a copy of a removed fic and have success, and I've also seen people point out that an author specifically requested that not happen. So your mileage may vary depending on what story/author it is. Archive of our own let's you download stories in a few different formats. I use ficsave.xyz to download from ffn website for my Kindle, or just the ffn app itself for general offline reading. I just check the author's profile first to see if they have a note against downloading their stuff before putting it on my Kindle.

** I only notice FictionHunt stories gone because the author deleted them at the source. But I never use the "Read Archive" feature anyway.

- [[http://ficsave.xyz/][Ficsave website]] is your friend for downloading from FFN.

- [[http://www.omnibuser.com/][Omnibuser]] is good too, and it can load Spacebattles/Sufficient Velocity threads if you read forum fanfics and CYOA's.

- [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre app]] is useful if you read fanfics with your regular books on Kindle and eInk readers.

*** I had a quick look - it seems that everything has been nuked off.

*** Thank you for the help! Yeah I was in a mood to read some reading at hogwarts stories (guilty pleasure i know) but they've all been taken down. I think fictionhunt did a sweep of anything with book text... Thank you for those links though!
