Right, so before I begin let me explain.

I've tried and tried, over and over and over again but I can't write.

At least not to my own standards. I'm not sure what it is, if it's my writing style clashing with my preferred writing style to read or what but every time I start writing I end up at a point where I just /can't/ go any further.

I have /so/ many ideas but each time I start writing...

It's goddamn frustrating.

So my proposal is that I provide the major ideas a beta and other things while someone else writes.

Anyway, my latest attempt at writing was based around a character called Lunar Lovegood, Twin brother to Luna Lovegood (Luna's been aged up a year), Slytherin.

If this intrigues any of you then message me on Discord and I can go into further detail.

I just hope my ideas can be realized.

Edit: Just realized I didn't put my Discord profile, Here: Kuro #0882

Edit 2: Link to rough notes of events that I want to happen (Will be updated as more ideas come to me (Or If I actually read the books)): [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2pbast07akYFO7QnDChAUlcB_W2F9SOIoGylkpCnRU/edit]]


** I'm going to be completely honest.

This is easily the scariest title I've ever seen on a post. I am so glad it is about writing, you have no idea.

** Are you also a perfectionist? I struggle to write simply because I consistently re-write everything I've written because I find myself disliking it as it's not 'perfect'. I haven't found much of a solution only to recognise that sometimes writing 'just ok' for a first draft is a good idea-and then slowly editing it over time. I'm still struggling to ever finish anything but I recently wrote more than I have ever written which I think is in of itself progress.

I have thought about doing the same however-being a beta on writing. But I know anytime I get handed something to edit I go through the same process (re-writing it over and over again).

Perhaps write a simple story with the character? Maybe a scene that you would have planned that has a resolution and a beginning (so you can feel you have accomplished something).

I think you might find some takers but you'll likely never be quite as happy as if you wrote it yourself.

  "Nobody tells people who are beginners --- and I really wish somebody had told this to me --- is that all of us who do creative work ... we get into it because we have good taste.

  "But it's like there's a gap, that for the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good, OK? It's not that great. It's really not that great. It's trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it's not quite that good.

  "But your taste --- the thing that got you into the game --- your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you, you know what I mean?

  "A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit. And the thing I would just like say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste and they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be --- they knew it fell short, it didn't have the special thing that we wanted it to have.

  "And the thing I would say to you is everybody goes through that. And for you to go through it, if you're going through it right now, if you're just getting out of that phase --- you gotta know it's totally normal.

  "And the most important possible thing you can do is do a lot of work --- do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week, or every month, you know you're going to finish one story. Because it's only by actually going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions. It takes a while, it's gonna take you a while --- it's normal to take a while. And you just have to fight your way through that, okay?"

Your title scared the pants off of me, by the way.

I've been fighting this same battle with myself for 15 years. There are [[https://examinedexistence.com/the-four-states-of-competence-explained/][stages of competence]], and for those of us who are in the creative game for the long haul, slogging through the gap between conscious incompetence to conscious competence is one of the hardest things we will ever do.

The only way to greatness is through. You can't go around. You can't go over, you can't go back, you can't go under, and you can't stand still. You have to slog through the bad. You have to face your terrible writing, knowing that the story that burns in your chest barely warms the page in its current iteration. You have to cringe over bad cliches, suffer your weak plotlines, carry your flat characters on your back. You have to face the pain of it. You have to you have to you have to...

Because your only other option is standing still, right where you are. You have this good taste and this story to tell and nobody in the world who can tell it the way that you one day will be able to. Right now, not even you can. If you stand still for a day, or a year, or twenty, the story still won't be written, not the way you could have done.

If you stand still for a day, or a year, or twenty, your taste will still be there, waiting for your story to be written /just so/.

And you'll have wasted twenty years not bridging that gap.

So then the question is, how do you face it?

Words on a page. You /have/ to write it anyway. Write it badly, write it verbosely, write run-ons, write walls of text or pages of dialogue, write bad accents, write crappy plotlines, write whiny, argumentative, cliched, asshole characters.

And then write them again. Print your work, take a red pen to it, scrap everything but the second sentence on the fourth page and the middle name of your asshole character.

Write and write and write and write. Use a white font on a white background so that you can't edit what you've written until you're done. Set a goal and put a word counter at the bottom of the page, then write double that number. Write every day, even if all you can think to write is what you ate that day and how annoying you find your roommate. Write about the bright eyed girl you saw on the train or the momentary fear you had of the hooded stranger hanging by the ATM. Write about the sun that shines through the window when you work only to fade to rain as soon as lunchtime comes. Write about your feelings, write about your favorite characters, write about the mundane and the simple and the joyous. Write write write write write.

This post cried for help, but despite your words, you're not really looking for someone to write your story for you. Don't run from this any more. Run towards, no, write towards the crap pile. From the smelliest dung comes the strongest trees.

You can do this. You need to do this. Will you?

** Most writers think they can't write at least some of the time. It's normal. We get stuck in a bubble of looking at our own work - which we know backwards - and not being able to see it the way a reader going in blind would see it.

The only way to get better at it is to write. If you've got a fic you think is terrible, take a step away from it and write something else. Anything else. A description of the room you're in, a limerick about the man on the bus...anything.

After a day or two, when your brain has had a chance to rest and look at something else, you go back to it.

**** I've had the same problem for at least twenty years. It's /that/ common.

Most writers spend at least some time convinced they should just stop because they're no good. I've had one story - not a fanfic, an original novel - that I've been working on for over a decade, and scrapped after several hundred pages (I began again from the start after about six months break) because what I had wasn't what I wanted.

The only way to work through it is to write anyway. Even if it's strictly private and you never show it to anyone or publish it anywhere, even if it's just exercises to see if you can mimic the style of authors you like to read.

What you're talking about is a commission and, fanfiction or not, nobody is going to do it without being paid. So if you're going that route, I hope you have money to spare.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

So don't write to your own standards. Don't /have/ standards. Standards get in the way when you're starting out. Standards are for people who get paid and for people who do the paying. You doing neither, unless you're going for said commission. All that matters when you're an amateur writer *is that you write and that you finish what you write*.

Once you've finished what you wrote, you can edit it, and trust me, editing is so very much easier than writing off the top of your head (which isn't to say it's easy, just easier). When you spill your brain out onto paper/the screen, you've got nothing to compare it against. When you edit, there is actually something there for you to look at and say "Hey! That's not correct!" And then you work at it until it's correct.

The thing to keep in mind is that this is your *rough draft*; It's right there in the name: Rough. It's SUPPOSED to be shit. It's SUPPOSED to be that thing you vomit up after you get plot bunny indigestion. Everything high quality that is published has had someone edit-mop the living shit out of it before they even dared show it to other people.

So yes, your writing is shit. My writing is shit too. In fact, I bet my writing is more shit than yours. If you want, we can compare writings (after I transfer it to google docs, its in my paper notebook right now) and I can show you the kind of crap I spew out just so I can get it out of my brain.
