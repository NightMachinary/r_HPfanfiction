Are there any fics where the scar on Harry's head is actually a rune of some sort that Lily used to protect him? I would hope this causes Harry to be more interested in runes or magic in general or for Riddle to know that it wasn't Harry, but Lily who stopped him - etc.


** Yeah. If you look up Harry Potter Fanfiction and 'Ehwaz' or 'Eihwaz' you should find a bunch of them. That's what his scar rune is called in the fandom, I don't know why.

Really, 'cause I usually see it listed as Sowilo, which is a real rune that looks like a lightning bolt, and one of its meanings is victory or success.

**** *Sowilō*

*Sowilō or *sæwelō is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic language name of the s-rune, meaning "sun". The name is attested for the same rune in all three Rune Poems. It appears as Old Norse sól, Old English sigel, and Gothic sugil.

** I know this exists in To Shape and Change. linkffn(6413108)

Though it only comes very late in the story, serving mostly as a foreshadowed plot device to kill Voldemort with, instead of being a significant part of Harry's growth.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** Linkffn(One World) Harry learns that his scar is a rune while at Flourish and Blotts, and whenever he makes Hex Signs he incorporates it wherever he can, resulting in them being generally more powerful than necessary.

On a side note, it's possible that the rune, which does represent power, was used to seal the protection, and the Horcrux found the only weakness in the protection, the rune that held it all together. (I think there's at least on fic where the protection involved covering Harry with runes, and the Sowilo was the final one placed.)

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
