** Or, how about you don't read M, NC17, or fuck it, with your sad fuck little brain, pretty much anything past PG.

Also, if you are troubled enough to post this because of something that happened when you were 12, go see a fucking counsellor and take some pills

** I don't read smut fanfiction, but I accept that it exists.

If you don't like it, don't read it. The ratings on stories are there for a reason. (Even my son knows enough to filter his fanfiction searches to ensure he doesn't run across stuff he doesn't want to read.) But don't come here on your moralistic high horse and assume that everyone in the fandom is a necessarily a sexual deviant because some objectionable stuff exists somewhere. Your logic is the same as accusing anyone who comes to reddit of being a porn fetishist because of the existence of NSFW subs. It's infantile and offensive.

Seriously, [[/u/marganod]] has the right of it. Go get help.

Edit: Oh, and you made a throwaway user account just to deliver your scold. How very bold of you. Fucktard.
