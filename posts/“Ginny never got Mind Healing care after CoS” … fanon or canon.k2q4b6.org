I know about stories like “More Than a Mug of Hot Chocolate by keeptheotherone” linkffn(7460529), where the main premise of the story is that Ginny was basically left just with a mug of hot chocolate after the ordeal of her first year and no other treatment whatsoever (BTW, the story is very good, and even better is its parallel version linkffn(7685065)).

Is it canonically true? Isn't it possible that reason why Ginny evaporates from Harry Potter story between the end of CoS and OotP was because at least part of that time she was studying remotely and was partially getting Mind Healing treatment in St. Mungo? There is obviously no record of that in canon, but is it possible?


** From Harry's limited 3rd POV, No.

But Weasleys could have very well done that, as they won that lottery and spent all of it. Of course, the kids (Harry and Ron) wouldn't know.

*** I don't think money is the issue that much. I know we Europeans are not trigger-happy stereotypical Americans in terms of litigation, but if Hogwarts has any legal duty to care for children who are for ten months out of a year in their care /in loco parentis/ (and they do ... which is why it spends horrible amount of money on maintaining small hospital on its premises), they are certainly liable for any Mind Healer costs for Ginny, because they completely dropped their ball on taking care of her. They would gladly pay anything to keep whole affair hushed up.

Now, I'm not British so I don't know if NHS do cover therapy after a traumatic events like that.

If muggle NHS do not cover it, then maybe we could think that there is a WNHS, and with all the fucked up thing that happens in the wizarding worlds, that they decided that it was needed.

** Honestly? I really dont think she did, unless it was over the summer.

Consider Harry, who:

- was abused

- Killed his teacher at eleven

- almost died at twelve

-almost died AGAIN at thirteen

- watched someone else get killed in front of him at fourteen

- watched his godfather get killed at fifteen

- watched Dumbledore die at sixteen

lets not even get started on seventeen.

Sure, I doubt the Dursleys would have helped him much, but there wore many chances for him to get even considered for therapy, for even a check in.

unless the Weasleys put her in therapy over the summer, nothing happened

** It would have been mentioned if she were actually gone gone, but that doesn't exclude the possibility she was seeing a mind healer the summer between her first and second year, or going to appointments once a week, or what have you. Still it seems strange not to mention it at all if it happened and it seems out of character for the wizarding world to consider such a thing.

If you want to include her getting therapy I think that is compatible with canon.

***** "Closed" is the same as "secure". Even in the 21st century, people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's are often housed in locked wards. I myself once worked in a MCU (Memory Care Unit) at a nursing home. These people are kept in because they may not have the mental ability or memory to safely navigate an unsecured area; for example, Lockhart couldn't even remember his own name to start with, let alone that magic is supposed to be a secret or how to use the Floo safely.

In Ginny's case, she likely wouldn't be placed in a secure ward. She is not suffering from severe amnesia, nor is she suffering from an illness that causes loss of reasoning abilities or situational awareness (like the aforementioned Alzheimer's and dementia). Ginny, to our knowledge, never displays suicidal tendencies, which is the only other reason she might be on a secure ward for her own protection.

Tl;dr; St. Mungo's is humane by 21st century standards. Unlikely that Ginny would be locked up, as she isn't a threat to herself or others.

Edit; people with diminished capacity also need to be protected from cruel bastards who would take advantage of them. My MCU had very tight security procedures.

Longbottoms. They need to be in a secure ward because both have extremely diminished mental capacity as well as poor physical condition. Neither Alice nor Frank would be able to fight off a physical, magical, or other kinds of assault (or even realize one was occurring).

Lockhart. He's more aware, but he has no memories before arriving at Saint Mungo's. He has no frame of reference for right and wrong; that's something that people are taught in childhood, of which he has no memory. He could commit a crime without realizing the act was illegal (Statute of Secrecy), or he could be taken advantage of by someone.

Bode. We agree here, enough said.

The world sucks. Such bad things occur even in real life. I can only imagine the terrifying and disgusting possibilities that magic creates in this context.

There are no "<bodypart> healers" at all. Healers are just called healers (if you don't count "Healer-in-Charge" and "Trainee Healer"), and the distinctions exists with the wards, which are ordered by the origin of the injury. As there are: Artefacts, Creatures, Magical Bugs, Potions and Plants, and Spells.

Outside of St Mungo's, there are no Healers. Madam Pomfrey is a matron ("nurse" in the AE versions), and during Quidditch matches there are "mediwizards", which presumably are the equivalent to paramedics.

*** You really think that eleven year old girl who was ten months under the influence of brainwashing (using the Muggle terms), and Tom Riddle wouldn't be gentle with her, because she was to be disposed in the end anyway, is unaffected by the ordeal?

Concerning the evidence, there is only this dialogue (from OotP, chapter 23):

#+begin_quote
  “We wanted to talk to you, Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you've been hiding ever since we got back ---”

  “I didn't want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.

  “Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.”

  Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he turned on the spot to face her.

  “I forgot,” he said.

  “Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.
#+end_quote

I think the last sentence is one of the most brilliant lines in whole heptalogy (and which potential was completely ignored by JKR), because we all forgot what she was dealing with all these last years, but it certainly suggests that even couple of years after Ginny is still affected by whole ordeal. Perhaps not having flashbacks and nightmares all the time, but I would think she went through some PTSD drama before.

There's nothing in the books about Ginny getting mind healing or "mind healers" being distinct from healers in general /in the books/. Mind healers was a cool concept that fans came up with; it doesn't contradict anything and it became popular to put into fanfictions because, if wizarding therapy were to exist, what else would it be called?

You have creatures/items that can possess you. Creatures like the Wampus cat that use legilimency, and tons of other things not listed in there. Hell, those areas listed are most likely their most used wards since they are the most common injuries. They could have other wards that are referral/appointment only.

Not to mention their emergency intake area.

Toss in the stigma attached to mental illness? Mind healing is probably one of those things that they do have, but don't advertise in an open manner.

Also... Remember Ron? Didn't he get messed up in the head after the brain thingies? Yeah, there was probably mind healing there, but you know how Ron is. He would downplay it. Because he doesn't want to be seen as crazy. Or as a Dark Wizard, since he's a parselmouth.

You are approaching this by looking at an IRL hospital and just substituting magic "Healer" for "Doctor", and I just see no basis for that. For all we know, possession is conclusively repaired by applying a variant of the Cheering Charm once, which every halfway-competent wizard can do, after which you are right as rain. We don't even know whether the often-cited PTSD actually is a thing! It's perfectly possible wizards don't suffer from that, so now what? Arguing solely with "it's not mentioned, so it can be a thing" just leads nowhere, because you can always add an "... or not" and be just as correct.

As far as Ron goes: He was delirious /before/ entering the brain room due to a spell, and the treatment for the brain attack is:

  There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain's tentacles had wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement.

In book 3 she's giggling with Molly and Hermione about love potions. She was on the train, where she nearly faints like Harry due to the dementors. She visits Harry in the hospital wing as well. Shes mentioned in passing in a few other scenes at Hogwarts.

Mind healing is fanon, and a mind healing subplot about a random side character wouldn't fit in the fantasy/mystery series. If you want to write a story about that, then write that story, but she never disapears in canon.

**** Meh, it's a children's and later YA series from a single character viewpoint. To shoehorn in a random sideplot of ginny bringing up to harry "mind healing" or other fanon stuff would break the flow for the next book's arc. The events of the previous books generally only matter in how they relate to Voldemort's return. The events of book 2 are eventually brought up again in book 5 at Grimmauld Place during Christmas, and her reaction to the dementors in book 3 imply it. These are both to reinforce current plotlines. Every scene in the books should develop the plot to some degree, in my opinion. Else you get something that just meanders around.

I'm not a huge fan of that article. It seems to want a 5 book Harry/Ginny romance subplot in the series, which I think is a bit stupid. ginny has enough character development to tell us what she's like and there's like 150,000 or more words of relationship development in Half Blood prince. Harry potter was solidly a children's/middle grade book through to book 3. Harry was infatuated with Cho in book 4 and 5, and then he develops a crush on Ginny in book 6. They're teenagers, there's nothing unrealistic about a teen quickly developing a crush.

Ginny has more character development than Fred, George, any of the rest of the Weasleys other than Ron, all of the other students other than Hermione, and arguably more than Neville.

  The Weasleys' trip to Egypt after CoS. No one will tell Bill anything, and Ginny isn't talking at all. And if navigating the relationships with his six siblings isn't enough, Bill has one more. But he and Amy Green are just friends, right?

** That's all fanon.

Ginny's recovery isn't important to Harry's narrative. There's no need to bring it up even as a side-plot if it won't tie back to benefit the main narrative somehow later on.

To fit a "Ginny recovery plot" into a story, you need to have a narrative that would benefit from it -- otherwise you'll just bore or confuse your readers.

** Both could be true, nothing is explicitly said in the book, but we don't know if that's because nothing happens or just because Harry is completely oblivious to it.

** It's just one of those things Rowling forgot to adress. Then again HP was intended as kids' books. It's about magical spells, adventures, ... not therapy for a traumatic experience. It's us adults who think about the details and immoralities of certain characters' behaviors.

** Considering that Dumbledore sent her to madame Pomfrey to sleep and drink chocolate (which isn't a magical drink lol) I personally don't think Ginny got any help. Further proof: Harry got no help after having to kill Quirell in selfe defence, etc.
