Harry gets captured after OOTP. Basically, he is being possessed by Voldemort, who forces him to become a killer. Takes place ten years after the OOTP. It's pretty dark and fairly well-written.

** I really want to like this as I am writing something similar* but I just can't.

The lack of logic in this fic is awful. Voldemort took over the Ministry in 3 years after his rebirth in canon, yet somehow, in this fic, they are still at war ten years later. Dumbledore not realizing Harry was possessed, even though he is a bloody genius and Harry has freaking red eyes...

Harry not remembering his past, yet still knows and talks with Dudley. Hell, his ability to go wherever he wants, has escaped prisoners in his house... and Voldemort does not do anything because he is a Horcrux. All-in-all, I can't continue as nothing anyone does makes any sense. It's drama for the sake of drama.

*My fic deals with Harry forcing to join Voldemort. No possession though.

*** Dude. Did you even read?

Harry only forgot his five years at Hogwarts. He still remembers the Dursleys. And Voldemort only just realized that Harry has been helping the prisoners escape, after Reddick Winfrey was caught. And there is a hint that he will do something about it. Why do you think he gave him his wand? Voldemort didn't know before that what Harry has been doing behind his back, which was why Harry is able to roam free. But he doesn't know about Kreacher. He doesn't about Grimmauld's Place. It was pretty vague what Voldemort was threatening Harry about at the end.

And if you read, you know, you will gather the hints that the Ministry is already pretty much corrupted, and it has been for ten years. And the last chapter updated deals with just that subject. There's so many hints that the freaking Ministry is corrupt, starting when Darcey Weatherborn was caught up until the last one. Hell, it's even in the first chapter when Rufus goes to visit Privet Drive.

Like, you missed the whole point.

This is a suspense story. It's an important to watch for subtle details.

**** So, because Harry is 'dead' everyone just stops the war for ten years. Really? Especially when the ministry is corrupted as the author says it is? Voldemort was able to take over the ministry four months after Dumbledore's death... Pretty sure he could do it in ten years, even with Dumbledore. After all, he almost had won before he went after the Potters decades before.

And, the first chapter talks about Dumbledore assuming the newest death eater leading attacks is Harry. Yet, he doesn't even remotely think Harry could be possessed. It's baffling.

Voldemort actions make no sense either. Why would you take away someone's memories but still leave the bit where he killed his parents? Harry didn't even know his parents were murdered until after he found out he was a wizard, it would be easy to take away. And why wouldn't you have someone following his every move? Keacher or not, Voldemort isn't that dumb. It would be pretty darn obvious who was helping the prisoners the moment they began to escape.

The idea behind it is good, but there are too many plot holes for myself. Others might enjoy it more. Just stating my opinion so you don't need to get all twisted about it.

I wish they went to way with Brody in Homeland. Harry kidnapped by a mysterious terrorism organization and assumed dead yet ten years later escapes. He is a war hero. Yet, something is wrong with him... And Ron Weasley is determined to find out. And have it lead up to possession, murders and more. Find out Harry has been brainwashed, and is struggling between the new and old ways.

***** Voldemort did take over the Ministry, based on the hints so far. It doesn't have to be a grandeur takeover. It's more subtle. And the whole thing with Dumbledore wasn't even that relevant to the story, tbh.

It was explained, if you read it, that Voldemort erased any good memory that Harry had. Especially his time at Hogwarts and his friends. Because it's building on JK Rowling's justification that the only way Harry was able to push Voldemort out of his mind was through love. In the ten years with Voldemort, all he saw was suffering, he was miserable, he felt little to no love. And for every person that dies, Harry becomes even more miserable. He starts losing his humanity. And that will show later. So, there's no point in erasing his parent's death. That was why Voldemort was able to possess him in the first place. It was explained in Chapter 5 especially.

As for the prisoners, that will be explained later why Harry was never caught. It's still building up. No one knew that the prisoners were escaping because Harry was messing with own memories. And he was sending them into hiding wih different identities. No one knew that they were even alive. No one knew that he was doing that until Reddick Winfrey came along.

No offense, but that version of the story sounds lame. Whatever. To each his own, I guess. I don't really care if you like it or not. I'm just saying that you're just misunderstanding the plot. Or you probably skimmed over a lot of stuff.

****** I read up to chapter 8. I saw what the author was trying to do, it just didn't work for me. I still don't understand why Voldemort didn't take away the knowledge that Voldemort murdered Harry's parents. For me, it makes no sense for it not to happen except for drama.

The author is a decent writer, and I do wish I liked it. It does has have some interesting ideas. I'm also a fan of the lack of bashing. That always deserves a bonus.
