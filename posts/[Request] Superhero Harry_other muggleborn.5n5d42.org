So, the Magical world waits until the summer before the student starts Hogwarts to contact them. What if a Muggleborn child noticed all the odd things that happened around them, deduced they were the source, but thought they were superpowers instead of magic? Then they practiced and practiced, because if I was a small child and I thought I had superpowers, I'd damn well use them all the time. Their magic warps away from subtle things like wands, wards or memory magic, and they become unable to use them. Instead, they gain such strived-for abilities as flight, super strength, etc: classical super powers instead of magical abilities.

And to top it off, by a freak occurrence, they fall under the MoM's radar and do not get contacted, allowing their delusion to persist and their magic to twist further into superpowers. What would be the consequences for the magical world, and the world at large, when seven years after the letter should have come, a masked, spandex-clad caped hero with an Alexandria package starts flying around and beating up criminals in London/New York/what-have-you? How many other muggleborns will think they have superpowers instead of magic and try to use it as such? How would governments react? How would the MoM react to such a blatant, yet not-blatant breach of the Statute?

Are there any stories like this or is this something completely new?


** Not exactly the same, but in linkffn(6486108), a muggle-born child (pre-Hogwarts) sees his parents get Obliviated in a misunderstanding with the Ministry, and he thinks the wizards are supervillains. His accidental magic conjures a fully-powered construct of Raven from Teen Titans, who causes mayhem. It was a weird story, but actually fairly good.

  Ginny Weasley pulls a PeggySue after Harry dies in the final battle. Featuring a determinator!Ginny who doesn't care how the previous timeline went, she's going to save Harry no matter what. Also, a minor not-really but sort-of crossover.

** I've never seen anything like that which would include the second part of your requests.

As for the first part, there are two (sadly, both unfinished) stories I like that are spot on, if you substitute "superpowers" with "the force". This counts, right?

  Harry Potter gets interested in Star Wars and after a small piece of accidental magic starts to believe he is force sensitive and his magic powers develop accordingly. Deviates from canon quickly and without apology. Multi-year story. First year is posted. Second year, and Luna's first appearance, will follow when it's finished. Currently only Star Wars fiction influenced.

** That sounds pretty awesome but the closest thing I can think of is a story where Harry is the son of the MCU's Thor and he find out during 3rd year. It's like 800k and I liked it. The sequel has been started as well.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

** Well [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11836594][Red-Mage-Looking-For-Group]] has a similar premise as in early experimentation with magic and a group of muggleborn/raised forming that would take the magical world by storm... if only the fic was continued... any time now T_T

I really like when characters get inspired by movies/anime/manga/games and try to incorporate the magic and lore from there. I also adore the idea of muggleborn actually breaking from the shackles of wizard tradition and being innovative instead of being railroaded and limited in Hogwarts.
