Hey all, Are there any fics that explain how goblins cast spells/enchantments? For example protection spell without using wand & other items they focus magic through. There must be way that they can cast magic offensively against DE as well as Wizards. Do they have a different way of apparition?


** Given what they're known for, I'd think that (denied of wands as they are) the primary means by Goblins to work magic is through craftsmanship - their famous silverworking for example.

** Goblins in canon can't apparate or sling curses the way wizards can, no. At least not without wands, they're second-class citizens.

Their magic seems to be limited to metalworking:

  "Well, goblins can do magic without wands," said Ron.

  "That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!"

  "Well, goblins won't share any of their magic either," said Ron. "You won't tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never-" - Deathly Hallows

The only fic I've read that spends much time dealing with goblin magic, that I can think of, is /Significant Digits/ - which is AU and a sequel to HPMOR. And honestly it spends more time on goblin politics than their magic, and even that isn't the main focus.

** One part of ‚Äú[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]‚Äù series (aside from many other points, like that it is by far the best ‚ÄúDudley's daughter is a witch‚Äù) is that it has very believable goblins. They are very non-human, slightly creepy, with their own (very distinct) magic. Highly recommended.

** I get into a bit of Goblin magic in Keystone Council, where one of the Harry Potters is goblin-raised. There, they use wandless magic, as one might expect. It's intended to be unobtrusive and subtle, lacking flashy offensive spells and relying more on touch.

For example, I have one spell that is essentially an ennervate but relies on the caster laying hands on the victim/patient. Another can pull information from a book and copy it out (used to prepare a bank statement from a master ledger).

The one I get the most use out of is a form of mage sight, cast with a hand gesture. Remember all those stories where the goblins see right through glamour's and whatnot? I figure this is how.

Offensively, my version of the goblins rely on weapons and armor, and focus their training on closing distance quickly and being a hard target. The idea is to take advantage of size differences as much as possible. Magic enhances these efforts (adding speed, etc) but is rarely the core of them.

Like I said, it's a minor element of the story, but something I had to think about during the writing. Linkffn(Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council)

*** Doesn't Harry Crow's goblin magic basically just exist as an excuse for Harry to out-perform everyone around him and serves no actual point of interest beyond that in the plot?

** I always thought of the Goblins as only being able to cast magic through touch. Like inscribing Runes of Power into weapons, then charging them with magic when holding them. This is why the Wizards keep Goblins from using Wands, as the only reason why the Goblins haven't taken over the surface world is because they have no ranged capability beyond MAYBE crossbows. The wizards being able to keep any attacking Goblins at bay with ranged attacks is most probably the reason why every Goblin Rebellion has failed in the past
