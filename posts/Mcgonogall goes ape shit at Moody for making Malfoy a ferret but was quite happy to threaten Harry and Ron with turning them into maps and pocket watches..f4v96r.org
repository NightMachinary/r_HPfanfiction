** This is the same woman who sent first years to the FORBIDDEN Forest, when there was an unknown creature killing unicorns for crying out loud. Not the best decision maker.

Though to be fair, she wasn't really going to turn them into those things, she just threatened to. It's like how parents threaten their kids with spankings but don't do it.

*** Saw one fic where MacGonagall was horrified that happened. Some paperwork got mixed up. A couple 7th years were supposed to help Hagrid, while the kids were supposed to polish the trophy room.

Filch didn't care. And Hagrid was just all, "Harry! Welcome!"

*** ”Perhaps you would be more useful if I were to transfigure you and Mr.Potter into a pocket watch?”

”We got lost”

”Then perhaps a map”

I count some points in movies as canon although they weren't in the books, this is one such occasion.

** Precisely. She THREATENED. I feel like a lot of people don't realise that if Malfoy had been bounced in one wrong way, he could have died.

  Darkfic. Moody bounced Draco the ferret up and down in the halls a bit too much. Rated M; not so subtly implied necrophilia.

** Maybe it's not the safety of the transfiguration. Maybe it's the fact that maps and pocketwatches sit there until you change them back, whereas a ferret could take off running and be damn near impossible to catch in Hogwarts.
