**** He comes off as an asshole. One of those types who proudly describes themselves as "Brutally honest" and proceeds to shit-talk your clothes.

***** Not just your clothes, either! Everything and then hides behind the excuse that they're honest and don't mean to offend you. Summaries that are so passive-aggressive are just not worth my time as I can already tell the author is an edge-lord who plays Call of Duty on the regular.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
