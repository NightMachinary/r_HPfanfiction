Turns out they end up summoning Harry, Ron and Hermione in their late twenties. And the three of them are pissed off because they can only go back once "Voldemort has been irrevocably defeated."

Alternatively, they summon multiple Harry's from different dimensions. I can just see Dumbledore making a joke to his Harry about how this is proof of how listening to him in any dimension ends up saving his life.

*** The air was thick with tension. "You want me to do what?" Harry replied with a little shock. "After all we've been through? I thought I meant more to you than that" he said.

"We're just looking for a few more hands to help" Hermione replied. "You know what it's like this time of year" she said.

"But Hermione... you know how much I hate paperwork" Harry whined.

"Don't make those eyes at me, it won't work! Well, maybe later... Now get cracking on that stack of forms." Hermione replied while trying to hold in a smile.

"This Ministry isn't going to fix itself as you very well kn... aaah!" she shouted as the air in front of Harry began to shimmer.

Wand out and slowly backing away Harry tried to move around the shimmer, towards his office door. The shimmer began to glow, and a faint whisper became louder and louder.

/tap tap/ "Uh is this thing working?" spoke a voice that Harry and Hermione hadn't heard in some time.

"Can you hear me? Can you see me?" it spoke again "I don't think its working lets try a different foci"

"Wait... We can hear you" Hermione said, a bit of hesitation creeping into her voice. "But... we can only see an odd shimmer. To whom am I speaking?" she added.

"My compatriots and I have utilized an advanced summoning ritual to find a champion from... " and then he paused a bit and spoke in a louder and deeper voice for dramatic effect "Another Universe!" /echo/ /echo/ before continuing "to um.. aide us with a Dark Lord problem" he said.

"Yes!" Harry shouted and fist pumped for effect. He /really/ hated paperwork. Then noticing the look on Hermione's face he added "I mean, um of course, I understand you could use some assistance" he paused before adding "but things are a little busy here. Could you perhaps tell us a little more?"

"Well assuming the ritual worked and I'm talking to someone who's defeated the dark lork before... perhaps things are similar enough there?" the voice pondered. "I am Gilderoy Lockhart, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Kingdom of Albion." he said pompously before asking "Did you perhaps defeat he-who-must-not-be-named?"

Hermione glared at Harry, slowly shaking her head, with arms akimbo and foot tapping at the floor. Harry's grin expanded to mouth splitting proportions. "Sorry Hermione, you know how it is... saving people thing and all" Harry said, but then thought to ask "Wait you mean Tom Riddle, right? Lord Voldemort? Yeah we took him down a few years back". he said with a smile and a faraway look in his eyes.

Headmaster Lockhart replied "Tom Riddle, you mean the defense professor? No I'm talking about the Dark Lord Dumbledore. Does he not exist in your dimension?"

Harry paused. And then paused again... because lets face it, this wasn't exactly what he was expecting after lunch. Then with a shrug he said "well beggars can't be choosers. I'm in!" And with a look at his oldest friend and occasional tension-release-and-emotional-well-being-partner he added "Are you coming dear?"

Hermione sighed and rolled her eyes a bit, but she already knew the score. She poked her head out of Harry's office door and shouted to his secretary "Hey Sally, the Hero and I are going to go deal with another Dark Lord problem. Mind the paperwork while we're away? That's a good girl. Ta ta!" and quickly shut the door as a literal cornucopia of curses slammed into it.

Arm in arm, Harry and Hermione stepped into the now violently shimmering air and into their next great adventure.

** An awesome twist would be one where it's a complete success.

They summon a 50+ year old veteran Harry who gets shit done. Horcruxes? Simple, Harry knows what they are, where they are, and what's defending them. Death Eaters? Challenging... if they all ganged up on him at once. Voldemort? No point in risking it, Harry & Dumbledore tag team him for the easy win.

Along the way there's some grumbling about the summons (Harry: "Kidnapping is pretty horrid, but at least you all had the bloody decency to not rely on mini-me for this.") , some fluff between the Potters (parents & veteran Harry, or kid Harry & veteran Harry), then in the end they amicably shake hands and send Harry back. He proceeds to meet up with his friends/family to have some drinks and tell a crazy story. Done.

Bonus points if Harry & Dumbledore idly chat as they casually break into Gringotts for the Cup and/or tackle the Basilisk together.

--------------

I'm not sure if this really counts as a twist per se, but I'd really like to read essentially linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth), but longer and fully fleshed out. I want to read about the Potters slowly reconnecting, and the parents + brother learning about why Harry is so haunted as he either opens up or lets details slip.

--------------

The way Harry was treated in linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief) was /utterly infuriating/. So I'd like to read a short fic where they summon Harry and try to treat him the same way... but Harry thrashes the lot of them, takes the knowledge of the ritual from Dumbledore's head, then reverse summons himself. If Harry is permanently scarred in the same way, I'd expect to see him 'thank' them properly for that.

--------------

The Potter parents live, but Harry dies. Dumbledore is genuinely sad about that, but he's 'content' knowing that Neville is the prophecy-kid. Then Neville gets dropped out of a window by his relatives and snaps his neck instead of bouncing. They accidentally summon 10 year old Harry, who proceeds to panic as he goes from locked in a cupboard to surrounded by strangely dressed strangers in a castle.

Previous Harry + Neville's death and the fact that Harry doesn't have /this/ Voldemort's horcrux causes Dumbledore to lead him down a different path. Oh, and I expect there'd be lots of Potter family fluff.

** Harry lets his baser instincts run free (sleeps around, is a dick (not just to be a dick, but doesn't let people walk all over him!), is as stingy with information as Dumbledore is ("Nah, you don't need to know, Bumblebee!")) and at worst starts experimenting with Dark Magic (maybe he even talks/works with Voldemort) :)

Seriously, the attitude I would like is:

"Not my world, I'll go home later, so I can do shit here that I never would do at home!" ;)
