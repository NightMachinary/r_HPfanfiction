-Applied Cultural Anthropology was great, but abandoned

-Demonologist was great, but only really covered first year in detail

-New Blood is looking promising, with frequent updates, but far from complete

-The Green Girl had a nice premise, but the execution was kinda meh

Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology; Hermione Granger, Demonologist; New Blood; The Green Girl by colubrina)

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** Depending on how you classify complete, you may enjoy my current series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). Volumes 1-3 are complete, and volume 4 is almost halfway done. It's got Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Slytherin, and a focus on politics and worldbuilding.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
