You can appreciate them as a character but not as a person (ex: Snape interesting character, asshole person). By this I mean Book Sirius, not Gary Oldman.

Sirius is a smart (says canon) person who does a lot of dumb shit. He's the bad side of Gryffindor. Yes, the Werewolf prank was terrible (and have created posts on here/the other potter sub complaining about it) but objectively I think he only intended to scare Snape, and didn't think about that Snape could potentially die. In book 3 randomly breaking into Gryffindor tower to kill Peter when all students were there was dumb. If I was in the HP universe and a classmate of theirs in the Marauders era I'd probably think he's good looking (as canon claims) but would avoid him, he seems obnoxious. It's also not cool that he thinks Harry is supposed to be just like James.

But despite his flaws and all of the many dumb things he does, as a character, I still like him. I like how blunt, impulsive and reckless he is-makes him fun to read. I also respect how he set himself up to die for the Potter family by switching the Secret Keeper, although obviously it didn't work out. And I think in Book 4 he does a decent job of playing the parental figure he was supposed to be. I suspect Rowling didn't like him that much. Recall her writing about how Sirius had a case of arrested development.

Be curious to hear other perspectives.


** I... Don't know if I like him as a person but I love the idea of him as a character.

Grows up in a strict aristocratic household. Rebellious heir to an estate. Is disowned for a variety of reasons, one being put into a different school house that was out of his control.

He hates his family and what they stand for. But is forever one of them. He is stubborn and self righteous and proud. He is ruthless and cruel. And always thinks he is right so doesn't even see the consiquences of his actions.

He's wrongfully imprisoned for 12 years and still goes back to fighting with the people who betrayed him and didn't fight for him even when they definately should have. He doesn't have the time with his godson. He never got to be happy.

I don't know if I like him because he's not 'good' but I am completely fascinated by him because how could he be 'good' after all the shit he's been through you know? I can't tell whether I hate him or love him...

*** One of my favorite aspects about Sirius is that he is a Black at heart, whether he's at peace with it or not. It's why I love fics that have a dark Sirius (but not an evil one).

*** I largely agree with this thoughtful post: the idea of Sirius is awesome, for everything you said, plus the fact that this--having a long-lost family member who loves you to bits--is kinda the dream for a lot of kids in Harry's position (ie, emotional abuse).

But as for /liking/ Siruis... It's challenging. As a kid, I wholly accepted his character through Harry's eyes, and so I loved him. In fact, I was beyond distraught when he died, and didn't start book 6 until years later, because I was so upset.

But reading as an adult... It was a completely different story. I saw him instead through the eyes of the other adults in Harry's life, and found their criticisms to be almost lenient. I definitely feel that children should be surrounded with as many people who love them as possible, but Sirius... He really needed some support.

And in absolutely no way am I saying that that makes him unlovable. /However,/ it does frustrate me how he relied so much on Harry. His boundaries were really not appropriate at all, and his choices were questionable. The fact that he loved Harry doesn't really excuse all that. It just makes it harder. : (

So I don't hate him, but I can't say I like him, either.

**** I think (or at least I believe and I hope others do to) that it is ok for me to love Sirius as a fictional character who is just so interesting as a concept and someone I desperately want to meet and analyse and study,

While still not holding them as an moral example to real human beings.

I love Sirius I really do. I love him because he's fictional. If he was a real person I'd be a wary of the guy and definately wouldn't be able to as easily overlook his actions but as a character he is fascinating.

***** Sorry, I forgot that might read differently outside of certain circles. But "boundaries" are a concept relative to family therapy theories; they're not necessarily physical, but more relate to the social/emotional interdependence of individuals within the family system.

Families with diffuse boundaries err on the side of emotional dependence / enmeshment, whereas families with rigid boundaries are more disengaged. For example, in enmeshed families, parents can be overly-involved in certain aspects of their children's lives (eg, helicopter parents) or may rely consistently on their child for emotional support or otherwise share information / put expectations on a child that are beyond typical developmental capacity (eg, the child who takes care if their parent when they come home intoxicated).

I can explain further, but I'm not sure if anyone has even bothered reading this far, and I spend so much of my time writing clinical assessments in line with this sort of stuff that if no one's reading, I'll just kindly dip away.

** No, I find him to be an enjoyable character and the type of asshole I wouldn't mind knowing.

He's reckless, he's cruel, and I've always said he and Bellatrix were a lot alike, but no matter how old I get I'll always appreciate that he was the one character not intent on treating Harry like a sheltered kid. I also think he devolves in development post GoF for the sake bof plot in the same way Harry and Dumbledore do.

Less of this and more of trying to live vicariously through Harry in OotP.

**** Absolutely. I'm not in the camp that he was on his way to becoming Dumbledore-esque, but he was far better than the everyman character he ended as.

I think my biggest issue is that he goes from trying to help himself in the first 4 books to becoming completely reliant on Hermione to look shit up for him.

**** Idk about OP, but IMO:

Harry starts off being powerful enough to fight off a hundred dementors and has enough will and power to turn the priori incatatem spell back on Voldemort in GoF. He kills a fucking basilisk at twelve. Then in the OotP and on, all he suddenly knows is expelliarmus. Yeah, he's really, really good at it, but it's not as impressive as everything he accomplished as a younger wizard. He put in so much work to survive the GoF but you don't see him try to learn anything to fight against Voldemort because the last two books are focused on hunting horcruxes.

Even as a teenager, the final battle never sat right with me. Their duel was so anticlimactic. You mean to tell me you've hyped up Voldemort for 7 books and he just dies because Harry's DISARMING spell backfires?

Not that Harry isn't impressive. He totally is. He went through all he went through and he still had the capacity to not hate Tom Riddle.

***** Well, in book 6 he learns the Prince spells. And I remember at the end of book 5 when malfoy's about to curse him it goes 'but harry was too quick for him' but Malfoy isn't impressive competition, at least compared to the older death eaters. And Harry casts Imperius and Crucio in Book 7.

I see where you're coming from though.

** Poor emotional boundaries, little to no impulse control, a little bit feral for someone born into a family that saw itself as royals...not someone I would necessarily like if I knew him as a person, but as a character, he is great. His greatest redeeming quality is his capacity for love and loyalty. His relationship with Harry breaks my heart in so many ways.

Edit: Rowling does like him - she just doesn't think he is "wholly wonderful" because of his hypocrisy with regard to Kreacher.

** I am not very fond of Sirius. Recklessness is a personality trait I don't appreciate in real life, and I have no reason to appreciate it in fiction. As far as I can remember, I have yet to encounter a story where being reckless actually pays out and the characters can honestly say that it was worth taking the risk. Sirius's role in so many stories is to be the hothead who rushes into an adventure, causing only suffering to the good guys. Since I know that from the moment he suggests doing anything, I usually hope he would not be in the story.

I like it when Harry has a patient and considerate father-figure, like Lupin. But if Lupin is in the story, the narrative doesn't feel like it has a place for Sirius. One of them must be left out, or the story will become too complicated. Rowling seemed to think like this, because Lupin suddenly disappareared for the duration of GoF, was quite insignificant to Harry in OotP and then became closer to him again in HBP.

Also Sirius's character and role in fan fiction stories has affected my view of him. I strongly dislike him being a shallow womaniser. And I'm totally fed up with the trope that Pettigrew is caught at an early point, making Sirius a free man. Pettigrew has such a massive plot potential, and to waste it just to give justice to the writer's favourite character is really bad.

In my story Pettigrew actually convinces those of the good guys who find out he is alive that he is just an innocent poor man who never did anything wrong. Nobody learns the truth about Sirius, and everyone suspects him of arranging the Triwizard thing and Voldemort's return. Even after Pettigrew is revealed to be a Death Eater, Sirius is still believed to be a Death Eater too, because nobody has any information that suggests otherwise. It is believed that he was a double agent just like Pettigrew, and that he tried to kill Pettigrew in order to protect his own cover.

I think this was in character. While Lupin did give Harry Dementor lessons, he never told Harry how deep his friendship with James went until a moment called for it. Even then, he doesn't make it sound like they are best friends - and this is the son of the man who not only turned Animagi for him, but also financially supported him until his death. The loss of James is devastating to Lupin, but not once in his interaction with Harry in POA gives an indication of this. Until he meets Sirius and threatens to kill Peter "in a quiet voice".

He is a detached character, he keeps people at arm's length. There is so much self hatred in the man, you see it manifesting best in an intimate relationship: the one with Tonks. He spends an entire book running away from her, and then once again, dumping her when she is pregnant. That itself tells you how bad his self hatred is. I see him getting close with Harry again in HBP because he recognised that with Sirius gone, Harry would have some expectations from him and he addressed this. Frankly, they became closer in DH, after Harry shook him to senses with that confrontation. Harry got through his walls then.

** I really really don't like him as a "person" and I have some issues with the way he's written as a "character", although they're not insurmountable. I view him as a quintessential Black, but a contrarian. Cruel, condescending, hypocritical, but unfailingly loyal. I also think that if JKR actually meant for him to be intelligent she failed abysmally. He's, at best, impulsive and reckless to the point that his intelligence is a non-factor in nearly anything he does, before and after Azkaban.

** As a character, I can appreciate him. As a person, not so much.

It's ironic that he hated his family so much when he acted like them all along .... the only difference was which side he was on . Him and Bellatrix share so many traits and I think even Narcissa didn't act like a Black as much as he did .

He is unlikable .

And there must have been a reason why nobody thought he was innocent when he was sent to Azkaban, right ?

** He's a hothead. Kinda like Ron. He acts before thinking and he doesn't fully realise the consequences of his actions.

I don't have that much sympathy for him because as harsh as it sounds part of me blames him for ending up in Azkaban. First there didn't put in any contingency plans when they made Peter the Secret Keeper. Then he went after Harry and let Hagrid take him away. He could have followed behind and taken him from the Dursleys. After that he went after Peter he just broke down a bit.. he didn't get up and sometimes it seems that he chose to stay in Azkaban rather than fight for his freedom or for a trial.

** Well, it is the opposite for me, I hate nearly all of the more important characters in HP for various reasons (like Hermione being lauded as being super smart, but she didn't even pick up on the fact that Harry was an abused child! Damned, I am not very observant myself - but even I picked up on the fact that two of my friends were beaten at home!).

Sirius Black however is a character I love because he didn't give up and become miserable (and looking for vengeance - which I totally would have done in his shoes!), despite having spent over a decade in Azkaban (!), his immaturity is refreshing!

Regular adults in most cases are either boring or annoying and almost all of them a hypocrites, who were trying shit out as kids that they will now try to forbid their kids from trying...seriously, I am not into kids (don't want any!), but if I did? I'd give them advice, but I would let them make their own mistakes (at first I'd try to shield them from repercussions, but as soon as they are old enough I'd step by step dial back that protection!) and I wouldn't be very restrictive and strict (that doesn't IMHO help - hell, I was very creative when going around my parent's restrictions as kid, hell I sometimes went to be early to play video-games during the night because my parents didn't allow me to play for long during they!)

So yeah, I love Sirius! Especially since he's not a coward like Remus, a snarky git like Snape, a child-sacrificing asshole like Dumbledore, a follower like McGonagall (she tells Dumbledore not to leave Harry at the Dursleys but doesn't have the courage to pick him up after Dumbledore leaves and find him a better home? Pathetic! Can't controll Snape either!) etc.

Sirius is an enjoyable character for me!
