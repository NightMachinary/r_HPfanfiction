:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic I read years ago. It had a Harry who had the power to have multiple copies of himself running around indepent of each other. It was a later fic, like 5th or 6th year.

Also due to a magical accident Harry was de-aged into a kid, without his be everywhere power, and had a "proper childhood".

Then due to another, or it even could have been the same, magical accident, James and Lilly were brought back to life.

Any help would be welcomed. I have been trying to find it again for a long while now.
