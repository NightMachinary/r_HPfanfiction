I'm in a Harry and Sirius kind of mood. I want stories that they are the main or at least two of the main characters.

I was also wondering if anyone knew any stories were Harry saves/rescues or jumps in the vail after Sirius. I've read one Marvel crossover where Loki was James and him and Harry went into the vail to get Sirius and I think I read one a while back were Harry was able to pull Sirius out. But I don't think I've read any others. And I just love the idea of him not giving up on Sirius or believing he is gone and find away to save him. I'm also a huge Remus fan so him helping would be awesome.

If you don't know any like this but know really good Sirius and Harry stories (long ones hopefully) you can recommend them. I'm looking most for father/son or godfather/son ones but if they are slash I want well written ones that have their relationship progressing slowly.

Bonus points for Darker stories, Bad Dumbledore, Harry (and Sirius, Remus too) join Voldemort or at least make their one side. umm I like slash but doesn't have to be. Character bashing amuses the hell out of me as long as its not the Twins.

**** Best exchanges in the fandom.

(Sirius) - Exactly how one does play /Tie-Harry-to-the-back-of-the-bus/?

(Harry) - It's kinda like /Punch-Sirius-in-the-crotch/ if you were seven and a bleeder.
