Your favorite playlists of original soundtracks you leave playing in the background while reading stories, preferably complimenting the fantasy theme or enhancing an epic battle or deepening the suspence/horror, or maybe spicing up a sci-fi element. Maybe even share some youtube channels.

Here's some of mine that haven't gotten old yet. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bki0PjoV14M][Bloodborne]] | [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhcoP8SnZZo][Shadowrun]] | [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rICzaVlDxBU&t=2094s][Atmosperic Horror]]

On repeat. Works for almost everything.

**** It is good, it's probably because I linked from the repeater page I use to play it. Not a single track I don't like.

** I don't generally listen to music while I'm reading, or at least don't specifically relate it to what I'm reading (I just have it on in the background). However, I do pretty much consider [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jFVPsTEfM][Won't Go Home Without You]] by Maroon 5 to be the unofficial theme song of linkffn(The Unwinding of Percy Weasley). It fits the climax of that story so perfectly.

#+begin_quote
  Percy is given an untidy and absent minded assistant named Audrey Larrabee to help promote himself in the Ministry. Will he be able to handle her seemingly complete apathy for the Ministry? Or will she be able to help him in ways he never dreamed of?

** I'm a big fan of writing xovers specifically with various game franchises and whenever I write I always put together a playlist of songs made for that game (so miracleofsound, jt machinima, dan bull, defmatch etc) or I listen to soundtracks or both like I have with the hp bloodborne xover I'm putting together.
