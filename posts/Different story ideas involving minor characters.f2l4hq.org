Can be from the Golden Trio or other eras. Would rather it be focused on the character instead of an actual romantic plot line.

Would like something that could be written as a one shot or two shot.

Haven't written fanfiction in years and would like to write something involving the minor characters. Could be something about Amelia, Rita, Justin, Marlene, Ernie, Susan, Hannah, Astoria, Theodore, or just whoever you can think of.

So yeah, just think of any idea that doesn't involve Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Neville or Luna.


** Tonks' backstory could be pretty interesting to explore. Even just auror missions she's been on.

*** Oh Tonks is such a fun character, she doesn't really have much of a backstory, though that could be interesting to dive into. I've always wanted to write a story where Moody trains her on missions, that could be interesting to write about.

**** That would be a great read. I always liked how she is a cool badass but wonder how she got there.

***** Though it is tricky, she's often portrayed as super clumsy and stuff, since that's how she was in canon, you'd have to write that in, in a way that'd make sense, and wouldn't hinder her job.

******* Eh, I think it's just her personality and everything, though I get it was just an idea.

Though even with her clumsyness she does seem good at her job.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** Are you looking for someone to give you a prompt? If so, how about Justin Finch-Fletchley being posh and extra to the point where he captures the interest (negative or positive, or better yet a combination of the two) of some minor Slytherin character. Friendship, hookup, frenemies with benefits? - you decide.
