I read this earlier this year, but I don't remember the name of it. I remember that Harry travels back in time to his younger body. He may be in Slytherin--quite possible that he is. The thing that I really remember is that Harry is going through the Room of Requirement's lost and found and he finds a jar of Nargles that he later gives to Luna. It may be the same fic that Luna makes him a pink bracelet too.... I don't remember. Any help would be GREATLY Appreciated! (i've read wwaaayyyy too many HP fics to remember them all before I started to keep track--started keeping track on 8/27. Started reading fics on 5/5. Depending on length, I read about a fic a day. That's a lot of fics I didn't keep track of. :(

HELP!

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
