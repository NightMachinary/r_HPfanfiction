Any length, any other pairings, Lily/James in the background is fine, as long as it's not the main focus of the plot.


** One of my favourite fics: The Promises Trilogy - Promises Unbroken - Promises Remembered - Promises Defended

There's also a sequel, Promises Defended. All amazingly well written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/22909/Robin4][robin4]]

** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1][All These Complications]] is easily one of favorite fics regardless of era or genre. It is AU where the point of divergence is Regulus deciding to confide in Sirius about the horcrux. Sirius, Remus, Peter, Regulus, James, Marlene and Dorcas are all excellently characterized.

There is actually more of the fic than I linked, but the author friend-locked her LJ. What is there is still excellent though.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** Start with some classic R/S fics by picasribit. That should get you somewhere.
