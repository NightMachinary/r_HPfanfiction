I'd be interested in a fic where Harry tries to change his future and befriends the Marauders. It can also be a slash fic with Harry and Snape. Thank you!!!

"Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort."

Harry is in the past - same age as his parents I think. 270k so far and updates weekly.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  As Severus Snape lay dying on the filthy floor of the Shrieking Shack, bleeding in the arms of Harry Potter, a profound, devastating realization awakens a long lost love, latent for years and torn asunder by time's cruel fate. Is love strong enough to overcome the pain from the past and ensure Severus' survival? Time-Travel fic. SSHP - COMPLETE.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

*** It's awesome for a light read. When you just want something lighthearted and fun and surprisingly funny. The beginning is a bit rocky and might put people off but it does get better. The ending is one of my favorites.
