Maybe the door to the Room of Requirement wasn't shut in time, I dunno.

...I wonder what Fiendfyre actually uses as fuel. Does it rely on consuming more magic to keep going, can it thrive on normal flammables magic or not, can it burn water, et-cetera?


** That's all it takes. One shot, and it's out of control.

** As long as something generates immense amount of heat, things close to that heat source would burn. It's not 'flame' that burns materials, it's heat+oxygen. Flame only means that there is immense amount of heat there. But for example you can make dry wood burn by generating heat through friction. In my head, fiendfyre generates lots of heat and any flammable thing that gets close to it would burn. Water would boil and evaporate IMO.

 

In my HP universe, it works something like this:

 

Fiendfyre uses only magic as a fuel and it's attracted to magical beings. As a result it wants to go to the closest magical being and in most cases it's the caster because, well, it appears right next to you. So when you cast the fiendfyre, you enter a battle of wills.

If you fail, fiendfyre consumes you and then starts to diminish unless there are other magical being close to the fire. But it's heat would burn other stuff and even though fiendfyre itself would diminish, it wouldn't mean there would be no fire. If you cast it at your home and fail to control it, it would consume you and then burn till it dies out. During this, things around fiendfyre would catch fire because of the heat and a regular fire would burn your home to the ground.

If you manage to control fiendfyre, the battle doesn't end. You still continue the battle of wills while you control fiendfyre. But when you move the fire away from you there is a chance that fiendfyre might find another target. And while controlling, you need to feed it your own magic to sustain it or make it consume other magical beings. As long as it's fed magic, it stays aflame. To put the fiendfyre out, you need stop feeding it magic and move it away from magical beings. Without you feeding fiendfyre magic, it would start dying but while it's dying it would try to attack you or whatever magical being it is closest to in the hopes of staying aflame. So you need to keep fiendfyre from consuming magical beings while not feeding any magic to it. If you manage it, over the course of time it dies out. Or you fail to do so and it goes free. If you fail to put it out, you either apparate or run like hell to prevent fiendfyre from consuming you and wait until fiendfyre dies itself while burning stuff around it. Or you just burn to death while cursing your own stupidity for casting such a volatile spell and questioning if afterlife exists.

*** So in a nutshell, Fiendfyre relies on consuming magic (wizards/witches, magical creatures, magical artifacts, etc) to continue spreading, but its sheer heat can start non-magical fires that will persist after its gone?

...Yep, that sounds like a sensible way to handle it. Thanks for that wall of text.

*** I like your interpretation = Fiendfyre as the ultimate killer of magical beings and items.

Given the ease of casting Fiendfyre (even that idiot Crabbe could do it), it should have been Death Eaters' preferred weapons to wreck devastations in Muggle world. Since no Muggle towns or villages were wiped out in such a fashion during the First War, and Ministry considered Wormtail's blowing up of 13 Muggles a top crime/atrocity, it leads me to believe that there were severe limitations to Fiendfyre's effectiveness.

Perhaps Fiendfyre + Apparating away didn't work that well after all.

**** Yeah, I don't like stories where some wizard casts fiendfyre and then apparates away so fiendfyre stays aflame for many hours while couple of wizards try to put it out with great difficulty and it destroys everything around it. My headcanon fiendfyre is a little weaker than what most authors write. Just deprive it of magic and it won't last more than a minute. And I believe wizards can extinguish non-magical fires easily and muggles firefighters could also extinguish them. If fiendfyre was more than that, surely we would see it used much more often and much more creatively by Voldemort or Death Eaters.

I actually got this idea from the deathly hallows pt. 2 movie fiendfyre scene. In that scene we see fiendfyre following people while leaving burning piles behind. And later (after a few minutes) we don't see fiendfyre following them anymore or any flames of those burning piles taking shape of a creature. And our heroes can part those flames with just a simple spell. I believe it makes sense that the continuing fire is non-magical and fiendfyre itself doesn't last very long without any magical consumption if it's caster no longer feeding it.

** My headcanon is that once the fiendfyre has been summoned the continuous control over is a mental battle in which the fire spirit (for lack of a better term) desires with all its' entire existence to consume everything.

If there's no magic for it to feed on then it won't grow often those with too weak a will are defeated and their body (and magic) is consumed.

While fiendfyre desires to consume everything, non-magical materials do not fuel the fire.

To put the fire out either requires a counter from another semi-sentient elemental construct (that won't destroy everything) to overpower magic or for a sufficiently skilled wizard to 're-connect' to the fiendfyre and reign it in.

** There's a one-shot fanfic of HPMOR where Harry threatens to cast an overpowered aguamenti at the sun, shoving enough mass into it to make it go instantly supernova, and also cast Fiendfyre into it at the last moment to make a Fiendfyre supernova.

It's not even overkill, it makes sense in context.

Funny thing, though, I don't think that would work, because apparently adding water to the sun would only increase its temperature or something. [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/14/]]
