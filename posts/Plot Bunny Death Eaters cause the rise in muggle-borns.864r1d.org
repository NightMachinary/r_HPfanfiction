Here's the series of events leading up to an increase of muggle-borns. During the first war death eaters rape and kill but make a habit of only killing the men. They leave the raped women alive (to suffer). Many of those women become pregnant and due to the stigma around abortions keep the babies or put them up for adoption. This leads to a large increase in the number of muggleborns in the future. The Pure Bloods are increasingly worried by the large number of muggleborn flooding their world. When an investigation is launched to determine where they are all coming from its found that they are mostly half blood bastard sons and daughters of Pure Bloods. At this point all hell brakes loose. I think this would make one hell of a drama fic.


** I've always thought Dean Thomas was an example of this... Now I really want someone to do a story about his year on the run.

**** Yeah. There was a department at the ministry that kept track of them all called "The Department of Accidents" or something.

** There's some fic somewhere that explains “Mudblood” as dating from pre-Statute times and referring to the bastard children of magical aristocracy and random peasants.

** Ive always thought it would be a neat idea if Voldemort used another method to rise to power. Death Eaters were muggles who performed a ritual to kill a wizard and eat their magic to become wizards themselves. Thus the name Death Eaters.

** Another idea could be that, after the death eaters kill so many witches and wizards, magic itself tries to make up the numbers by creating more muggleborns. So the more halfbloods and blood traitors the death eaters kill, the more muggleborns there are in the next generation, exacerbating the problem they're trying to solve.

** The problem with this is that there is zero stigma in having an abortion if you've been raped, and even less in giving the product of rape up for adoption. It wasn't a subject I really cared about in the late 70s / early 80s (I was too young at the time) but I'm pretty sure that there was no stigma in giving up the product of rape for adoption at least even if abortion was still frowned upon even if it had been legal since 1967.

However, there's another way of getting to the point you want! The same ideology that leads to the Death Eaters leads, amongst those who are less extreme, to muggle women being raped and obliviated, the latter being simply to preserve the Statute of Secrecy.
