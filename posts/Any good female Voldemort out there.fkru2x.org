Reading TheEndless7 and others versions of a female Voldemort, oddly both called Emily Riddle. But anyone else got any to reccomend?


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/Departure-from-the-Diary]] This one is a slow Harry/FemRiddle. Not completed but still in progress.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** linkffn(13507192)

This is only a few chapters in, but female Voldemort will play a huge part in this story and it will wind up being over a million words when all is said and done. Updates every Saturday.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
