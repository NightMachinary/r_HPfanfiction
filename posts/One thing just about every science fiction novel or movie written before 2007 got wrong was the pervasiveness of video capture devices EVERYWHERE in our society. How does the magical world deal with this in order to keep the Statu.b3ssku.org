** This is an interesting question. I think what it comes down to is that most witches and wizards don't practice magic out in open public spaces. I highly doubt that cameras would ever be installed in Diagon Alley, for instance. You might have some maybe out in front of the Leaky Cauldron because London, but likely all that would ever be seen there is oddly-dressed people going in and out.

We do have some magic occurring in alleyways--I think when Harry, Ron and Hermione jump Mafalda Hopkirk and Reg Cattermole it's in an alleyway. There is when they Apparate away from Bill and Fleur's wedding onto Tottenham Court Road, but that seems to be an isolated incident in an emergency. Most magic is happening inside of homes, the ministry, the countryside or purposely sequestered areas such as Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts.

Oh, the other one that occurs to me is King's Cross and everyone disappearing onto platform 9 3/4. That could be a sticking point, but it only occurs a few times a year and it's a very high-traffic place, so if people actually at the station don't notice, than whoever is in charge of the cameras likely wouldn't notice, either.

I imagine it might get tougher to maintain the secrecy, but not impossible.

One has to wonder though if wizards would become aware of that sort of thing and take steps to neutralize the cameras? I have the Ring doorbell and I'd think that a wizard could render it non-functional from a distance. I wouldn't know and the company wouldn't know why it had stopped working, just that it had.

Then if you have them inside, they have to find all of those without being seen by said cameras.

******** My headcanon says that the reason electricity doesn't work in high magic areas is because some spell crafter from back in the iron age invented a charm that prevents lightning strikes by arresting the flow of electrons in all inorganic matter; and that said charm was then applied to everything, and is even to this day a standard in ever ward, everywhere, even if nobody remembers what it does or where it came from.

You know how magicals are about traditional stuff. Incidentally, this also stops the flow of electrons in both silicon and copper, among other things, thus breaking all electronics. There are ways around it, it doesn't break pacemakers or other electronics that are within living tissue, but because nobody know that this even exists, nobody knows to try and protect against it, and it ‘does' prevent ingoing amd outgoing signals, and living things can be Obliviated.

I'm also not really convinced they need to catch up to anything. They might be behind in muggle terms, but do they really need to have all the things we do?

Since we never get to see how they actually manage that, I call bullshit. They might be able to keep the general population unaware, but at the very least, each High Command and the Intelligence Agencies would have found out by 1970. The remaining monarchs would probably also know due to the interwoven past of wizards and Muggle.

Honestly, I simply can't see Wizards sucessfully maintaining secrecy from organisations like the Gestapo, nevermind the CIA and KGB during the Cold War. Too many paper trails (later computer files) for one. Nevermind instant cloud storage nowadays.

It was always possible to change the past in canon. Closed loop time travel is the /Ministry recommended/ form of time travel to avoid accidents. It is not the only form available, and that has been the case since PoA came out.

**** My idea for their slow rate of change is simply that there are so many fewer of them, and they each lives so much longer.

The average magical, barring war, lives easily to 150, and can still be considered middle aged. However, most magicals go into seclusion after a point, ‘cus just like with muggles their mind begins to slip, but they also start to lose grip on their magic; and that can be dangerous to those around them. Examiner Marchbanks, for instance, tested Dumberdore for his NEWTs, and was still alive to test Hermione for OWLs. With people so long lived they have a long memory, Albus was alive while the sun never set on the British Empire, he lived through both world wars. His parents probably lived through the American Revolution.

Can you imagine how little would have changed if your grandparents were alive, old, even, in 1776? A century ago to the muggles, is a millennia to the magicals. Magicals remember when they Were the most advanced people on the planet, and it wasn't ‘that' long ago to them. If they've barely changed in 500 years, like we've not changed much as a people in 100, then they Were the better people 500 years ago. What were muggles doing that was so great in 1519? That was only four, maybe five generations ago to the magicals. Dumberdores grandparents were alive then, their world has changed a bit since then, but not even close to the 30 generations it's been for us.

Can you imagine being a mudblood walking the halls of Hogwarts, having been taken from a life were you don't even know bathing is important and thrust into a world with indoor plumbing, flight, and near instant teleportation? No wonder they're called mudbloods, they're just stupid kids that know of nothing but the mud, to the magicals. Atleast to all the ones that don't bother to look and see what muggles have done. And why would they? They live so much shorter lives and still they haven't changed in 3000 years.

Magic in Harry Potter goes well beyond waving a wand and saying an incantation. We regularly see acts of courage manifest by virtue of that bravery. Acts of love and sacrifice. Hatred and evil and goodness are all genuine things that matter. Why wouldn't this extend to privacy? I think it's entirely reasonable that the fact that wizards are hidden from muggles hides magic all on its own.

I really don't see why cameras or computers would be less easily fooled than humans. It's not like they're more complex. In fact by their very nature of doing what they're told to do by programming they'd probably be very easy to charm.

This is of course ignoring the fact that wizards ostensibly control the muggle world. We see in HBP Scrimgeour casually rearranges a phone call between two head's of state so he can drop in on the PM. They insert Kingsly into his staff without anyone noticing. There is a portrait on the wall that can't be removed. It's not like the government could even make any sort of move without wizards noticing and fixing it.

** In 1999, on an idea of Arthur Weasley (and his twisted comprehension of the "inter-web" as described by Hermione) the unspeakables installed a new room: filled with thousands of spiders specially charmed, they work tirelessly to cut the parts of an enchanted web that change colors when magic is mentioned on the internet. It sympathetically destroyed mentions, images and videos of magic, magic users and magical beings.\\
Several crisis, caused by acromantulas entering the room, led to the creation and diffusion of movies in the 2000s loosely based on the history of Voldemort's second rise.

** Its kind of a boring answer, but we already know wizards are capable of large scale enchantments such as the trace and the taboo.

The ICW would probably get together and make a large scale enchantment that makes it impossible for muggles to accurately record instances of magic. Considering the amount of muggle born parents and other potential leaks there is probably something like that already built into the Statute of Secrecy already. Memories might already be the the only weak point in the enchantment and the reliance on surveillance technology might make it easier to dismiss the use of magic.

I imagine magic works in a similar fashion with tech, but on a smaller more concentrated scale.

I've seen some people talk about cloud storage in the comments and replies on this post, and to that, I imagine frying cameras would lead to frying whatever system the cameras are manually connected to. Not sure about wifi cams though. You got me stumped with that one.

HP magic doesn't really have "wards," but if you subscribe to an idea/interpretation/intent based magic, then the effect could be bundled with the AoE Protego or the Muggle Repelling charm or the fanon notice-me-not. Stuff like the memory erasing rain in Fantastic Beasts also neatly cleaned up the newspaper headlines. So just assume that other spells do the same as needed, maybe they're "tapped in" to a literal, magical Statute of Secrecy that smooths over the cracks whenever issues pop up.
