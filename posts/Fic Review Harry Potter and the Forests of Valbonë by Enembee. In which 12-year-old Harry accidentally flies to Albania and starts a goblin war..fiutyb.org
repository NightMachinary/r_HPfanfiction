*Premise*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë]] is a canon deviation from around the end of Chamber of Secrets. Ginny has been rescued and Tom Riddle foiled -- all should be well. Instead, Harry has some genuine PTSD from the events of the Chamber.

A confrontation with Snape in Dumbledore's office sees Harry fleeing the castle with the sorting hat and the sword of Gryffindor and flying away from Hogwarts in the Ford Anglia. Harry falls asleep on the ride, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in Valbonë Valley; a forest in Albania and [[https://images.app.goo.gl/PH9p4BJ3FvrNhvQZ9][a real place]].

This is penned as a T-rated Adventure/Humour story, though some of the violence content might have made it better suited to an M rating -- it has been compared to the survivor novel Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It is just under 120k words, so around the neighbourhood of the size of Prisoner of Azkaban. The fic was first published in 2011 but not finalised until 2019, and in a few author notes there is talk of a potential sequel.

*Plot*

The plot of this story realistically has to be divided into two arcs.

*Arc 1*

Harry escapes from Hogwarts in a very surreal scene which involves breaking Snape's wand, having a brief but extremely romantic moment with Luna in which she sounds like an oracle or perhaps the Time Traveller's Wife, and hearing the Ford Anglia speak to him before he is taken away to the Forests of Valbonë. When Harry wakes up he has no idea how he ended up in Albania. Unfortunately, even having reached the end of the story, neither do I. Despite being the arc the story was named for, it is by far the weaker of the two.

More or less alone in the forest, the sorting hat becomes his guide. He informs Harry that these forests are a Class 3 restricted area; forbidden to wizardkind and ceded to the Brotherhood of Goblins for over two thousand years. Casting wand magic here would not only give his position away to the goblins, but also start another war between goblins and wizards over the broken accords. Since the Anglia is in no state to be flying them back out of the forest, Harry is instead relegated to studying forms of magic which pre-date the use of wands to keep his cover. The sorting hat is given the name Sternley quite early on in the fic, and I will refer to him by this name for the rest of the review.

What follows is part training montage and part descriptive wonderland. I did at first think that this fic was intended to be something of a spiritual, sensory adventure because much time is devoted to Harry appreciating nature and learning about the forest, and there are a good few times there where he seems to go into a transcendent state, or at least a very interesting mushroom trip.

But equal time is devoted to Sternley teaching Harry the basics on building wards, consecrating items and artificing, along with foraging, hunting and generally becoming self-reliant. As far as Powerful! Indy! Harry stories go, this might be one of the most convincing I've seen. Harry has to take time to learn the things he does; he is motivated by the extreme necessity of his situation, and he still makes mistakes and a fool out of himself once in while in the process. The explanations for constructing and manipulating magic are well-considered and interesting. I really have to give props to how well Harry's magical development was handled throughout the story.

At some point there are some goblin-bred wolves called Oiks who take issue with Harry, for reasons. Oik is British slang for a crass barbarian, Albanian for werewolf, but more likely in this fic they would be something like the [[https://images.app.goo.gl/RoZam43UMXZ8S8Wx6][wargs]] in Lord of the Rings. After a battle which leaves Harry with a bone-exposing hand injury and some of the Oiks dead, Harry decides he'd better just proactively kill the whole pack to settle the grudge that these Oiks will apparently have against him forever otherwise. When he's done he skins the lead wolf and wears its pelt around as a war trophy for the rest of the fic.

When Harry has almost repaired the Anglia to the point where he would be able to leave the forest, he unwittingly uses wand magic outside the confines of his wards and promptly receives a letter from the ministry expelling him from Hogwarts, and a letter from the Albanian ministry sentencing him to death for starting a war. Most importantly though, we finally get kickstarted into the second story arc.

Certain aspects of the fic require....well, a bit of suspension of disbelief. I was able to do this better for some bits than others, but the transition between the two arcs was a struggling point for me. I kept having these pesky questions pop up, such as “how do both countries' ministries instantly know that it was Harry who cast magic in f-ing ALBANIA when the Trace absolutely does not work like that?”

Or “why are the goblins riding dragons???”

“HOW is Harry able to outfly the dragon-riding-goblins AND the broom-mounted Albanian ministry in mid-air when he's never driven a car in his life!?!?”

*Arc 2*

A few chapters into arc 2 I abruptly realised that the fic is quite consciously following the structure of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XevCvCLdKCU][Hero's Journey]], just unfolding it extremely late in the piece. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the Hero's Journey is a framework developed by Joseph Campbell in the 1940s for writing hero myths, as well as some of the most famous stories in history (Star Wars, The Matrix, LotR, every Disney movie ever). The framework has anywhere between 12 and 17 checkpoints along it, depending on which revision you go by, but this story easily hits most of them.

Arguably, the first arc covers off some of the earlier points of the framework, but they actually feel like very different stories. Where the first arc meandered and languished in beauty, learning and retreat, the second arc is tightly structured, fast-paced and much more about action than introspection.

I'll try to give the quick and dirty of it.

Harry crashes the Anglia, escapes into the mountains on foot, falls asleep in a clearing and is woken up by a sexy cat girl who tells him that Sternley has been kidnapped by a bird. No, I'm not kidding about the sexy cat girl. Her name is Ksheta, she is hundreds of years old but only has a very basic grasp on human language, and she is a Zana, which are a race of ancient animal spirits in the fic but female deities or Valkyrie-like fairy guides in Albanian mythology. She guides Harry through an exhausting journey up a mountain, then gives him a magical kiss which makes him feel stronger again before she bows out.

Harry reaches the mountain summit, gets attacked by a giant eagle who manages to break the sword of Gryffindor but then apparently has no interest in fighting him and tells him to come inside his house where Sternley is waiting. He turns into a man but is not an animagus - another Zana apparently, but much older and more powerful than Ksheta (also he wears more clothes, as magical men are wont to do). Eagle-man gives Harry a new sword and sends him on a quest to “kill the snake” in exchange for fixing the sword of Gryffindor that he just broke.

Well hello there plot. Nice of you to join us, 28 chapters in.

The goblins meanwhile have begun open war on all humans and are attacking country villages of muggles. Harry intercedes in one attack, kills some goblins, saves a muggle girl and is driven to a mysterious “sorcerer's tower” by the girl's father. It's noted that everyone around Harry seems to be speaking English, even when they couldn't possibly know it. Harry kills more goblins, fights his way through the trials of the tower only to confront what no one but Harry is surprised to see -- the “snake” Harry is supposed to kill is Voldemort.

In the interests of not giving away the crux of the story I won't reveal the details on the last quarter, but I will say that the way the plot wraps up is less than ideal. There are some Dumbledore-splanations for Harry's trance-like episodes and ability to hear every spoken language as English, but they don't hold up super well to scrutiny, so you don't really get that “Aha!” moment when you read them. Harry makes a big deal about doing everything in his power to end the war he unwittingly started, but not only is it still ongoing at the end of the fic, Harry appears to have left it behind without a care, so it feels very unfinished.

Most importantly though, it's never very clear on the “why” anything happened. There are insinuations at various points about a higher power at work, as there commonly is with myths. Was Harry carried away to Albania in a car that shouldn't have been able to take him that far because of destiny? Was it an ancient magical force beyond the ken of modern wizards? The Zana seem to be tapped into it, whatever it is. Ksheta will only take Harry so far on his journey up the mountain, because “old laws”. Eagle-man cites the same reason to justify why it must be Harry and not himself (who is much more powerful) to go and defeat the “snake”.

However, somewhere along the way, Harry angrily rejects the quest he was sent on by the eagle man as nothing more than manipulation, and since this is never corrected, are we supposed to come away with the idea that there is no higher power or reason for the things Harry was called to do throughout the story? And if so, why the hell did he end up in Albania at all?

​

*Writing*

What stands out to me most about the writing is that it has a huge tone problem. The author self-styles the genre as adventure, humour, and innocent fun, but even from the first chapter, in which Harry is in a very real depressive slump from the violence he's recently experienced, I could tell that the story was absolutely NOT what it says on the tin.

Whilst there is virtually no sexual content or adult language in the story (Harry unironically uses “silly” as a heckling insult), there are unmistakeably dark and violent themes to the whole story. The most pervasive evidence of this is the rather insidious implication throughout the story that Harry's emotional maturity is directly proportionate to his level of desensitisation to violence.

He starts off by killing animals for food and absolutely hating it. As the story progresses he moves on to killing animals to prove he's strong (the Oiks). When he first starts killing goblins, it can be argued that he's doing so in self-defence - after all they have come to kill him - but it's noteworthy that Harry had the choice to flee before they tracked him to his location, and instead chose to remain and kill as many as possible before fleeing anyway.

His goblin body count gets very high very quickly, sometimes in self-defence or defence of the weak, but other times it's simply because they're in front of him or he wants revenge. He has isolated moments of being disturbed by the violence but gets over it quickly. It's very apparent that mutilation and murder are fine if you need to prove your strength to someone. He even fights another wizard to the death and comes away celebrating by the end, all before he turns the tender age of 13.

Various author mouthpieces in the last few chapters of the story laud how mature and wise he has become, and Harry's internal thoughts indicate that he considers himself to be in a much better place mentally now than he was at the beginning of the story. I must disagree with the author here -- whilst PTSD is certainly not a good place to be in, I would consider it healthier to be bothered by the violence than to be immune to or actively enjoy it. Most stories which deal with maturity into manhood in a violent environment teach that violence can sometimes be necessary but should not be delighted in or used self-indulgently for vengeance.

The author of the fic is a British academic, so the writing quality itself is high and use of British language cannot be faulted. There were a handful of chapters starting around chapter 11 where the editing seemed to have stopped because mistakes are much more abundantly found, but thankfully it picks up again a bit later, and I have no complaints at all about the properly edited chapters.

In terms of style, the author's strength is in imagery. There are some lovely metaphors and a feeling of escapism in the beauty of the forest which I think the author portrays very well. However sometimes it was unclear what was intended to be metaphor and what was literal, especially when Harry is in his trances. When Harry flees the castle for example, he describes the world spinning around him, the castle walls cracking, and the Ford Anglia talking to him about the breeze taking him away. Presumably the walls of Hogwarts aren't literally cracking, but the Ford Anglia may or may not be literally talking to him, so it's hard to tell?

In this whole fic there was exactly one chapter which I thoroughly enjoyed beginning to end, and that was the epilogue about Sirius right before he escapes Azbakan. The author's metaphoric imagery takes centre stage, and it strikes the perfect balance between describing his actual situation and giving a poetic, emotional impression of the madness he's sinking into. In describing Sirius changing into his animagus form, he says: “And the prisoner allowed his flesh mask to fall away, revealing his real face beneath.” Perfect.

​

*Characterisation*

Since Harry spends 80% of the story in Sternley's exclusive company and I've already talked a lot about Harry's character, I'll keep this brief.

Harry does have elements of being way too smart for a 12-year-old who doesn't swallow textbooks for fun like Hermione. For example: ” Snape says smaller sub varieties of protective flora tend to confer concealment properties, rather than physical or magical barriers.” I'm beginning to think this is just a mandatory ingredient in an Indy!Harry story at this point.

He also has moments of proper childishness and silliness too, and he's never too amazing to make mistakes. In part I think this fic was the author's attempt to better utilise Harry's full canon potential. Aside from the issues I've noted above about his growth, I don't think this Harry was implausibly different from canon.

Sternley takes the role of Harry's mentor, being a thousand-year-old repository of knowledge with no ability to make use of it. The sorting hat is a fairly blank slate when it comes to characterisation, but I quite like the direction that Enembee took with him. I imagine him with his movie voice and a personality like [[https://images.app.goo.gl/WLqnRUwvgsBoERSq7][Archimedes from The Sword in the Stone.]] He's a bit proud, especially of his intelligence, but he's not above a little messing around and ultimately tries his best to give Harry every advantage he can.

*TL:DR*

I wouldn't recommend ‘Valbonë for under 15s, and honestly I wouldn't know what to tell someone if they asked me what kind of story it was. There's a LOT of disconnect in this fic. There's disconnect between the story's advertised and actual genre, between themes of beauty and escapism versus plot and war story, and between the first and second arcs. Put simply, the author could not settle on what he was writing.

I get the impression that Enembee was just doing a writing exercise to see where it took him and didn't know where the plot was going when he started. There were many long hiatuses between the publishing of his chapters, indicating probable dry spells and author's block, which might also account for the stark differences in tone and theme throughout. Whilst there is a decent story here and it clearly hits the checkpoints of the Hero's Journey, it feels half-baked, and it gives Harry a very brutal morality in stark contrast with the Hero role he seems to be aiming for. Overall I'd give it a 6/10.

** It's interesting you found Arc 1 to be the weaker of the two - I thought everything after the escape from the forest felt slapped together and hasty in comparison to the earlier parts and overall found it less interesting. It may be that I was introduced to the fic as an good example of magical theory world-building, which is far more prevalent in the first arc than the second. It's also one of the few stories in the fandom that does magical survival right, so it'll always have a soft spot in my heart for that if nothing else.

On a side-note, have you read the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan? I've never been able to tell whether a specific event in the tower was an homage to that series or Star Wars.

*** I found arc 1 weaker in terms of plot and structure. The training montage was well written but didn't really feel like it was going somewhere, whereas the second arc had trajectory.

In terms of writing style, yes arc 1 was probably a more aesthetically pleasing read, and it does handle survival and development well.

Sadly no, I have yet to take on the beast that is The Wheel of Time, but given the author's inspiration from the Hero's Journey and the many articles about how heavily Star Wars drew from it, I think Star Wars is a very likely inspiration for the scene you're talking about.

**** I liked Arc 1 better, it was more impressionistic writing and I think stronger in terms of combining plot and overall focus: more emotionally effective and also more literary. It's been a while but I remember the lynx scene was particularly moving.

The second arc just goes crazy and I actually really liked how much it contrasted with the forest section, the pace was absolutely unbelievable and he manages to pull it off really well. But it's very episodic and some of the transitions don't really make sense.

I agree it was dark, but given NMB is one of the DLP big wigs it felt really emblematic of and close to the DLP style. It feels postmodern in a way that I haven't really seen in any other fic, and of course the quality of writing and storytelling is very high. Addressing OP's concerns I think part of the point is to write a dark, gripping fic in such a cartoonish and comical style. As expected from a DLPer though, Harry never really goes super out of character except for his rage scenes, and character development out of the original character is something I wish authors in general would be a little more flexible toward.

I'm a big WoT fan and don't remember seeing a WoT reference anywhere in this fic, it's been about two years so I could be forgetting. But overall one of my favorite fics, definitely in my top 5.

** Interesting. I actually found what you call arc 1 to be the better part of the story. Though it has been a while, I agree with your point about suspension of disbelief. You did have to forget it was a 12 year old. In fact, as I read this story I actually thought at many points that this was a 15 or 16 year old Harry. I did like, as you said, the depiction of Harry's improvement. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the magical system employed within the story, I did see it as working. I'd give the training scenes a 7/10.

I found the plot itself to be the weakest point. Though again it's been a while, it was a drag for me to read through it. While I didn't have an issue with the violence as I have largely given up on considering character ages, the plot felt contrived and the scenes against the antagonist or antagonists felt off to me.

These reviews are always nice to read through, though I suspect I'd enjoy them less if we had differing opinions. In fact, I'm almost inspired to write my own on the holy grail of fics, Realignment.

The overall plot in the second arc I can agree is weak, but it's virtually non-existent in the first arc, even if arc 1 has other strengths. So oranges and apples I guess?

I don't know what Realignment is, but I'd be fascinated to read someone else's HP fanfiction reviews, as I haven't seen them anywhere else. You should do it!

The ministry would have fed Harry to our goats than probably killed some Serbians.

**** Firstly Valbona is in the north of Albania, they have strong accents and are more Mislim than where iam from (the south).

However most of the mythology originates from the south, meaning the Zana should be fucking south.

All of Albania have little traditions which are very similar to Turkish ones.

And we have a two headed eagle. It's in our flag dammit.

Also I cant remeber what chapter it was in but I'm pretty sure it mentions something about our flag, which was put up near Vlorë (where I'm from) in a farm called Kanine (where my mum is from).

Yes I'm nitpicking, but my older sister was one of its earliest readers and asked Enembee if they need help with Albanian culture an they said no.

He spends 20 chapters in a forest and does things which would have comfortably fit into five or six, and been much more readable.

I've ever only read one story with a similar energy, and it was about the Dementors of Azkaban basically blackmailing Harry via mail to get them all the Horcruxes. In the end, they all hang on to a dragon that flies them into Albania and they're never seen again.
