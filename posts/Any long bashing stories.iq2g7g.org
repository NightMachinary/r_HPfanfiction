Hi everyone, I'm looking for completed stories that are at least 60k. I prefer Dumbledore, Ron, Molly, Ginny, and/Hermione bashings. I am all for stories that have Neville stepping up to be Harry's best friend.


** Linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) has a Harry/Hermione/Luna pairing and bashing of Dumbledore, Ron, Molly, Ginny, Snape and Malfoy.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** Here's the recs.

(Disclaimer: Some are Ron-centric and some might not be favourable to Harry either.)

-I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) one-sided job interview. A bit unrealistic but then again so are most bash fics. ðŸ¤·

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Ginny-bashing.

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

-This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to Hermione about her long essays and tells her to cut them down. Hermione ignores her and continues to do whatever she wants.

-linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

-linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack. Borders on bashing at times. Alternating POVs.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry at times).

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be. One-shot.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) Hermione un-Obliviates her parents. They only /pretend/ to take it well.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

*** Thanks for the recs! I actually struggle to get into bashing but keep trying to give it a go because some really good writers have done it. Do you mind if I ask how you know if it's a good bashing fic or a bad one?

Also - does it feel like you're confronting the negative traits of characters when it's done well? I'm genuinely trying, like it's a cuisine I just don't have the hang of haha. I keep on reading them thinking they're super out of character but maybe just reading the wrong ones?

**** A good bash fic is like a good whump fic: larger-than-life characterization that indulges the id and brings about catharsis. Sometimes that little, primal part of you just wants to see someone pay for being mean to +you+ the protagonist. You don't wanna be fair, you don't wanna be reasonable, you don't wanna see the other person's point of view. It's escapism.

Badly done bash fics, IMHO, don't set that scenario up properly. The reader still sees the bashed person as reasonable or sees them as horribly OOC. Or they'll have the revenge be disproportionate enough that the protagonist loses the moral high ground. A good bash fic indulges the reader's desire to be vindicated against antagonists, to be Right while your enemies are Wrong.

**** From my perspective, bashing is just somebody getting slammed in to a metaphorical wall, for some shits they did in canon, or somewhere in the past. A good bashing fic will usually deal with the person bashed in a very serious way or a in a crack way. But don't let me tell you that, I love bashing fics because i have a stone heart and want somebody to get hurt.
