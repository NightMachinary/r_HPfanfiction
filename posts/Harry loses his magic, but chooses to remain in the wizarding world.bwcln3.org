Choosing the path less trod because he finds magic inspiring, he leads a life where everyone besides his few loved ones look down on him and despise him by choice.

His cursed scar or destiny as the chosen one may also play into this,, although they aren't as compelling narratives - as his struggle would be over when Voldemort is defeated and he would be able to return safely to the muggle world. The story would have no lasting consequences, and that simply isn't compelling narratively.

It would play into a narrative of some things being worth suffering for rather nicely, in my own opinion.

That there isn't much he could do in the wizarding world besides pursue academic careers would also strengthen such a narrative rather nicely.

Thoughts?


** I think theres a oneshot by dirgewithoutmusic where he's a squib but Dumbledore still brings him to hogwarts.

*** There is, it's fantastic, it's part of their unilaterally stellar "boy with a scar" series.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.
