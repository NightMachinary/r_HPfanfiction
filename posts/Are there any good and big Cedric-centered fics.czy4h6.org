It can be an SI or just plain old Ced, that had a slightly different twist of fate (please, NO VAMPIRES!)

Forgot to add. Only heterosexual pairings :)

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU

** My favorite CedCanon is that he's the result of an affair between his mom (Lydia in Harry Diggory, so that's what I call her in my head) and Sirius. His dad is kind of a schlubby twit and Cedric seems smart and attractive, and I know it's fanon but I like the idea of Sirius banging everyone he could. I guess I also just kind of find cuckoldry interesting.

As evidence that Amos Diggory is a first-class moron:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúYou were found with a wand in your hand!‚Äù barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of [Winky]. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.

  ‚ÄúHey --- that's mine!‚Äù he said. Everyone in the clearing looked at him.

  ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.

  ‚ÄúThat's my wand!‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúI dropped it!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYou dropped it?‚Äù repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. ‚ÄúIs this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?‚Äù
#+end_quote

I wanted him to be a main character for an idea I had a while ago so I collected everything we know about him in canon, and there's this, and there's him being a douche to Harry about Cedric beating him at Quidditch and ignoring Cedric's explanation about the Dementors, and then there's his being somewhat gracious after Cedric dies but not publicly supporting Harry in any way against Fudge.

  Backstory for 'Between Two Lungs': when Cedric Diggory finally meets Harry Potter in the infirmary after that Quidditch match in Fifth-Year, he slowly realises there isn't any going back, not for him. Warnings for slash. Cedric/Harry, and others.
