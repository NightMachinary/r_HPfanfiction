** I'm honestly getting annoyed at how many different sites there are to upload fics. It makes it a lot harder to find the good stuff if they are all in separate places. Can't we just stick to one or two sites?

*** I prefer variety. It drives competition between sites so we don't have on monopoly ff site that doesn't care about its users

**** There is, of course, a trade-off. But alternative sites generally just get dominated by 1-2 themes, meaning that it is much harder to find those fics of quality.

**** That works in theory, but FFnet still rules the fanfiction scene despite its shitty feature set compared to AO3.

***** Well, authors can post to multiple sites, that way everyone gets the best of all the worlds.

*** If you are into HP romance stories, there is this cool site that is just getting up and going. [[http://hpromance.info/]] It doesn't have much of anything but the creator is basically trying to consolidate fanfictions already out there on various websites. For each pairing, there will be links to stories on a variety of different websites which should help a lot with finding good stories.

It is really in its beginning stages, but I know she is accepting moderators to be in charge of certain pairings. I know it doesn't really help you now, but hopefully in the future, when more stories are up, and more moderators are able to work on the website, it will be helpful :)

*** Monopolies don't work. They can just shit on us and we should just put up with it because we have nowhere else to go.

** Most other upload sites are pretty bad. Like HPFF.com was awful when I first discovered it in 2009, and it's only gotten worse.

*** Back in 2005, it was the bomb. It has not changed since then, which is problematic.

**** I've read on HPFF a few times, and it definitely does feel very clunky.

*** There's some good fics in there... Good luck finding them. One of my biggest issues is with how few character tagging options there are. It's hard to search for minor characters.

*** Part of HPFF's design issues is its codebase. They would very much like to update the site, but they don't have the resources or a real dev. I volunteered and mocked up UI improvements, but actually implementing it takes more time than I have. Not difficult--tedious. It's a rat's nest.

If there were enough experienced volunteers to refactor the site, it could be improved immensely--namely because all of the features they want to add would be much easier to add. I'd love to do all the UI improvements and search enhancements, but I don't have the time to do all that AND refactor. It stings because if the code were properly written, I'd be able to do some major UI changes for relatively little work.

They are taking donations to maintain the site, and ideally, hire a dev part time. It would be nice if enough devs here were invested in HPFF to improve the site collaboratively.

** I mostly read fanfiction in my ereader when it's above 50k words. I use a plugin in calibre where I just paste a link to a story and it downloads the story and makes it into an epub. It tends to know most fanfiction sites thankfully. The name is FanFicFare if anyone is interested in using it too.
