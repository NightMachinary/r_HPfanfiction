I was asked this question by person I was speaking to about the fandom. "What is your favorite form of AU?" he defined AU as "any story in which one to three aspects of the canon reality is changed." Some examples are slytherin!Harry. or Super!Harry. or even Evil!Dumbledore. I personally don't include pairings in the concept, since romance was not a major facet of the Harry Potter story. So what is yours? /edit/ grammar and spelling


** Fem!Harry

I really don' know why, but I love Fem!Harry stories, especially with femslash.

***** Slash is a genre of fiction that focuses on same sex attraction/relationships. A lot of people distinguish between slash and fem-slash for male/female homosexual content, but I find that a bit weird.

My main issue is with main character slash, I don't mind reading about a homosexual experience when done well, but most of the time it isn't, and my tolerance for bad sex scenes is somehow lower when it comes to slash. When it comes to actual romance and not just sex I really prefer to read about heterosexual relationships, probably because I am straight.

I do like it when there are side slash pairings, because I think it's realistic that not everyone in the story is either gay or straight, and also (and I know this is very wrong) because I like the 'gay best friend' stereotype.

** For want of a nail with the stations of canon changed substantially. different tests for the stone, if they go after it at all- but better yet, they go after something else and never realize about the stone, or face-off with quirrel before the tests, or something similar. If the stations of canon apply, don't show anything that's standard or near standard. if the tests are the same, but with crabbe, goyle, and draco replacing ron, hermione and harry, then there needs to be new ways to solve the tests. otherwise, just summarize it in a few sentences.

There aren't a lot of good ones, though. Next is future fics, which are better if not good.

Stations of canon can be worth reading, i suppose. I just generally prefer other stuff- though when moving into a new fandom, vaugely canon can work out pretty well, just so i have an idea of the original pathways.

** Someone else (not Snape, though...I sometimes read them, but I am mostly not a fan) raising Harry besides the Dursleys. I LOVE THESE FICS. I can't get enough of them. Ones with Sirius are my favorite, but Remus is always my second choice. There's even a really good one with Kingsley.

Love them. I just really like to see ways the story could have gone where Harry has a happier life before the final defeat of Voldemort.

**** I'm just not a huge fan. Snape almost always feels hugely OOC to me. There are a few I like, but I'm usually pretty wary of them because of that. It really throws me off when characters are really OOC.

I deal with Sirius acting a little differently than my canon perception of him better just because his character, imo, is far less defined in the books than Snape's.

***** Yeah, I just have a thing for Snape. I like the idea of someone who is cold and detached and selfish learning how to love and take care of this little orphan kid, and them building a relationship.

I'll read anything with Snape though, as long as it's not poorly written. I'll accept most interpretations of his (or any) character, even loose ones. But OOC things don't really bother me, I kind of just accept a character within the context of the fic, you know. That might be why I can enjoy that particular genre as much as I do.

** I like new new tasks for Triwizard tourney.

 

I think of AU in categories of /Setting, Plot and Characterization/. A change to the 'setting' might mean changing the rules of the magic system (ffn trope of wards, magesight), adding new groups/species (Mages, Fay) or adding locations (new school, Atlantis). Changes in plot: Lily survives. Changes in characterization: Dark!Harry, friendly goblins. I rate stories based on if they change 1, 2 or all 3 of the categories.

 

In general, I like stories where only the plot is changed and the characters respond with the same characterization and abilities that JKR gave them.

** I saw an interesting proposal regarding what to call an AU. It suggests we defime AU - Alternate Universe - when you use the characters or plot or whatever in an entirely different world. Then we should title the other kind UA - Universe Alteration - for when the story diverges from canon in one or more areas, but it's still the original universe. Just an interesting thought.

My favorite type of AU is Harry going back to the meet the Marauders and change how things happen. Or if not time travel, then dimension travel where Harry goes to a different world with the Marauders still alive.

(I absolutely hate fics, though, where either of those two things happen but Harry doesn't change anything or just ends up back at home as if nothing ever happened. Why did I even read the story then??)

** I don't really know that I agree with that definition of AU. To me, every fanfiction is more or less AU, because they depict events which did not happen in the canon continuum. The least AU stories are those which depict events that /could have/ happened in the main books, just that us as readers never got to see those things.

If anything that happens in a fanfiction contradicts what happened in the books, then it's an AU. Doesn't matter if the change is whether Harry decided to have two or three pancakes for breakfast, or whether Hogwarts was burned to the ground during a witch hunt in 1054. The whole /concept/ of a fanfiction carries with it the implication of an 'Alternate Universe'.

Now, when it comes to /my/ personal favourite type of AU, it would have to be the very major one. I'm over the 'seven years at Hogwarts with varying degrees of differences' stories, and if I were an admin of FF.net, I'd make publishing a story set in Hogwarts into a bannable offense.

Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but I think you get my point. There should be more fanfiction authors like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][enembee]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][joe6991]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1508866/Voice-of-the-Nephilim][Voice of the Nephilim]], who are not afraid to really push the boundaries of what is possible in JK's infinite sandbox.
