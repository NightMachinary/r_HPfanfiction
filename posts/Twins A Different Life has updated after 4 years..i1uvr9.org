Summary: When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

I would recommend it. However it has been a few years since I last read it so I can remember too much of the plot, but I can remember liking it.

****** Well not unbearable but it takes the tropes to the extreme and bashes james and a few others to the point of ridiculousness, so probably unbearable to most people but i can survive
