Hi, a while ago I read a fic where Lockhart lost his memory sometime before he started teaching and learned of his 'exploits' by reading his own books. Because of this he becomes a very competent teacher. I remember a scene where he tells his class that he got a T in his DADA OWL. Also, I think the story was a oneshot. Before you ask, yes I have read the various finding a fic threads but because of the nature of the fic google hasn't come up with anything.
