I've recently gone through An Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) and its sequel, and am looking for other stories where Harry's accidental magic makes him an Animagus early on.

I'd prefer the following:

- Normal Animagus form. No dragons, phoenixes, et cetera - those are way too often a symptom of Powerful!Harry, which is a trope I don't really like (but I'll put up with it in a well-written fic).
- The animagus form should have actual impact on the story, both ways - it comes up as a problem as well as a solution to problems.
- Tone-wise, I'd like something with the same vibes as Accidental Animagus minus the political stuff.
- I'm okay with shipping, but it should be realistic.

Tropes I (still) don't like:

- Character bashing.
- "The Ancient And Noble House of Potter", or basically anything that makes Harry politically-powerful. This is my one turn-off from Accidental Animagus, my eyes just glaze over when 13-year-old Harry starts acting like a shrewd politician.
- Abandoned stories. If it's not completed, it'd better have updated in the past month or 2.

I read quickly, so longer fanfics are preferable.


** Linkao3(Parsel)

Harry turns into a snake on the Dursleys' doorstep thanks to the cold, and leaves. He's raised by a snake and is not found until a decade later.

***** I don't even want to write it down. Suffice it to say that he spends most of his life as a snake, and when he turns into a human, the author saw fit to describe him commenting on all the things a human body has.

It's as bad as it sounds.

*** I had to Google that one since the bot didn't pick up on it. I got a result but it's on fanfiction.net...

linkffn(11585513) This one, right? Or is there a different one on AO3?

EDIT: Found one on AO3 as well. Seems to be the same fic. linkao3(6146470)

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129206][Growing Up Kneazle by Manatoc Fox]] is rather strange story (and unfortunately unfinished), but it is worthy of reading.

**** Haven't read that one. “Growing Up Kneazle” tends to be too long with a lot of unnecessary internal dialogue (characters act and they go through reanalyzing whole situation again in their head; SHOW, DON'T TELL!).
