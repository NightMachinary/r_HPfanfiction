Why make fanfiction if you are going to come with the same characters, same beats, same ending, or worse get mad when people have a different take on a character (or idea) you like. I understand feeling something you've grown attached to be OOC for someone may be jarring, but in reading a fic you have to let go of too many preconceived notions of a character. Taking a Harry that experiences both cannon and non cannon events shouldn't necessarily create a cannon ending Harry Potter or even *A* Harry Potter.

Second, why roll your eyes at a Lord Hadrian Black Potter Merlin (Insert all the founders) Percival, told to him by his new goblin buddies, when something like that can be used for a lot more than just the power boost shopping trip. The problem likely is that the author is a new writer and wants to show Harry as an extraordinary person quickly. Or simply finds catharsis in a canonically bullied and gimped character like Harry, stomping all over the universe which dealt him a bad hand.


** The only OOC that is annoying is a completely random change in character that makes no sense. Change the characters all you want but at least show why they changed, it doesn't work to have a cannon Harry for years one to four and only then have him change dramatically. Just a bit if back story can go a ling way even if it is just Harry hiding his true self
