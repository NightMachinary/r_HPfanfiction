I'm just curious because I'm going to polish off a bottle of sherry here in a few moments and write a fem!Neville/Moody because I realized I can.


** If no one else gets gender bent? Either Ginny or Remus. Expanding on this below.

--------------

*Giacobbe Arthur Weasley* grew up under the shadow of his six older brothers. He is the seventh son, and this means a lot in pure-blood circles. Amazing things are expected of him.

Jake, which he prefers, is not an amazing wizard. He can somehow sense this, even before getting his wand. But his hero Harry Potter is. He is brave, true, and kind -- all the books say so. He's everything Jake's smirking, arrogant, teasing brothers aren't.

When he sees Harry for the first time, though, Jake's guts clench. Something is wrong. Very wrong. Harry should stand tall and proud, but instead he looks like a lost puppy. During his hero's visit to the Weasley house, Jake is unable to look directly at the older boy for fear he'll blurt out something stupid. Like, “who hurt you?” or “what's wrong with you?”

And then Jake finds an extra book in his things after the shopping trip. Maybe a quiet gift from his father, who never plays favorites but seems to understand what Jake's going through and the pressure he's under. A used book, of course, as like his clothes those are all hand-me-downs this year. Not tent-like ugly things, like Harry's, but still.

Jake writes in the book, intending to use it to plan how to become Harry's best bud (his brother Ron is a plonker, and doesn't deserve the position) when it starts writing back.

And it's smart. Very, very smart, especially for a book. And it has some very interesting ideas on how to become Harry's best friend: by defeating all of Harry's foes and proving Jake's strength as a wizard. Everything, in short, Jake has ever wanted. Some of the spells it suggests Jake learn are a little questionable, but if they were truly dark, would they have been selling the book in Diagon Alley?

Still, he might be pushing it too hard, as he keeps blacking out...

--------------

*When the three boys* discovered Romola Lupin was a werewolf in second year, she thought her life was over. She'd heard...stories. Things pure-bloods did with those women literally cursed to the lowest rung in magical society. Those who were as low as possible without being cast out, like squibs.

Maybe it would have been better to live like a squib, but Headmaster Dumbledore had made her an offer. One too good to pass up. Attend Hogwarts in secret and learn magic like a normal witch, and she'd pounced on it like a starving wolf with a bone. And now, that dream was over because of the three pranksters.

Only, it wasn't. They took her in and made her their sister. Instead of abasement and abuse, they gave her love and support like she hadn't known since before becoming a monster. Because she was more interested in her studies than in pranking, they slowly eased back on their insane stunts and instead invested that time in their own magical studies. And then a year later, they joined her in her changes through the hardest magic she'd ever heard of. All because they loved her.

James had said later that, if it hadn't been for her, Lily wouldn't have gone out with him at all. They got together in fifth year and married immediately after school. Then Harry was born and the den mother in her roared to life. She was made Harry's godmother, but all she remembered later was blurred snapshots of a tiny little pink face, bright green eyes, and dark hair.

Then, like everything good in her life, it was ripped from her. Her friends in hiding. She couldn't see Harry anymore. There was a mole in the Order. She was a werewolf, so obviously the first suspect. The Marauders, slowing falling apart, were instead shattered in an instant. Martyred, murdered, and a malicious malefactor. A disaster which left only the monster. And her godson.

The Headmaster had told her something about protections and her status as a Dark creature. As if she were a child. Three seconds after hearing of the events of that night, it had all become clear. She knew she would never have custody of Harry. That did not mean she could not watch over him.

Strange things happened around the Potter boy. His much larger cousin's clothes seemed to fit unusually well, and seemed less...worn somehow once he was given them. His glasses would break often as his cousin liked to roughhouse, but before he could find his aunt to tell her he would always find a spare pair that looked exactly the same.

And for some reason, whenever he suggested storing something like the vacuum in the cupboard under the stairs, his aunt turned pale and left the room. He tried the door once, and the handle seemed oddly stuck and he felt a prickly sensation in the pit of his stomach. He didn't want to try it again after that.

So instead, he kept some of the cleaning supplies up in his small bedroom closet, as caring for the house and gardens and making things neat was his chore. He had to attend to both every weekend without fail.

Sometimes, now that he was ten, he got to help with the cooking and even got to use the mower on the lawn. But it always made his aunt nervous for some reason, and she never let him try it alone, always hovering and supervising him closely, as if something horrible was going to happen if she took her eyes off him for one second.

And sometimes, when he was out walking, he thought he felt someone watching him. But when he turned around, there was never anyone there.

Then, on his eleventh birthday, the oddest thing happened. A woman with a brutally scarred but very kind face delivered a letter.

**** Thanks!

I think I like the idea of a longer one-shot with Jake, but it diverges so fast, and in possibly uninteresting ways. I think it needs a different ending for that year, at least, but I don't want it to look like Jake being male somehow removes the threat.

I just want a new threat instead. Maybe he tries to take Jake's body over instead of simply sucking it dry. Maybe Tom didn't want to be female, which is why that wasn't his plan with Ginny in canon. Maybe instead of trying to close the school, Tom drags Jake into the CoS and teaches him horrible, Dark magic. Then he tries to make him snap and use it on his classmates, with horrible effects for the Weasley family and Hogwarts in general.

I think it might reach novel length if I could find something more. I'd later ship Harry/Hermione (obviously) and Jake/Luna. And wouldn't /that/ be interesting. I just can't figure out what that one more thing is to make it pop..

--------------

Romola might deserve an entire short novel of her own. That one really flowed. Took less than 20 minutes to write the whole thing up. Not totally sure where it is going, though. Lots of questions to answer.

Is Romola a teacher at Hogwarts first year? Did Sirius go to Azkaban? Were Lily and Romola friends? What about Snape, if Lily started dating James two years earlier? Lots of meat there, but not in a typical "Harry raised by Lupin" way. Maybe Mrs. Figg moves out suddenly next summer and Romola moves in. I think I'd skip around to the parts of Harry's life Romola changes, if she isn't at Hogwarts or making larger effects in his life.

Then have Romola do whatever ultra-cool AU thing in third year instead of PoA's canon plot. Everything goes off the rails at that point.

****** I could see that. But I lothe Marauder's Era stories, so have never read one all the way through and don't know of the tropes to play off. I wouldn't do a good job of it.

Or...I just barely hint at a possible love triangle. Between James, Lily, and Remus. And I can do silly romance. Maybe I just ignore the "antics" and Snape-hating storylines. I almost wrote something about Romola ignoring Sirius' /obviously/ teasing flirtations. Because clearly no one would actually want a monster. There is stuff to work with there. That might be interesting.

Oh! But I didn't say this before: anyone is free to use any ideas I post. Information wants to be free and ideas are cheap, so if someone wants to writes these then go for it. A mention would be nice, but not required of course.

**** Not quite - I mean, you could write it however you want, but I think the more interesting dynamic is for Salome (or whatever) to be close friends with Lily, but their friendship is put to the test when Salome falls for James, who only has eyes for Lily.

Angst and hijinks ensue, leaving Salome at the mercy of the Slytherin recruitment drive.

Later she hears a prophecy and has serious issues- what's her preferred outcome? Lily and son dead, James alive and in mourning? Or would she rather Lily survive without the other two, so that their misery becomes equal?

Instead she loses both her ex-friend and unrequited love, and she has to face their reincarnation when Harry shows up ten years later.

Cue opening credits...

** I've only read three HP stories with genderbending and the only one that didn't change Harry changed a whole host of other characters so I can't speak from experience. If I had to guess what would interest me most would be a femDraco. I'd love to see a really good Harry/femDraco story.
