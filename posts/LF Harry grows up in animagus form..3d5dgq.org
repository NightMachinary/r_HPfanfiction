Preferably the form being his first outburst of accidental magic and he just takes the hint and stays in the form. At least thats how I'd write the Prolouge.

I'd be really interested in a fic that does this well. I searched a bit, but got nothing good.

** I think Quoth the Raven, Nevermore fits this. Only read it once but from what I remember it might.

** I read a fic where Harry is a snake who saves Hermione from being molested when she was 9 or something, then becomes her pet. I don't remember what it is called, but you might like it. It is a Hermione fic though, Harry is secondary.
