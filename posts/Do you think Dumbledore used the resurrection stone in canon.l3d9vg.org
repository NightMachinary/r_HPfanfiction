Did he ever have the courage to call upon Ariana? Or is it in fact more courageous to not use the stone?

My feeling is he didn't use it & that's why the potion in the cave traumatised him so, he hasn't had the closure from her spirit.


** We know for a fact that Dumbledore /tried./ The curse on his arm was a result of him putting on the Gaunt Ring.

  “Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “/why/ did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”

  Marvolo Gaunt's ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.

  Dumbledore grimaced.

  “I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”

We don't know if he actually managed to use the Resurrection Stone. His use of the word /tempted/ and that he seemed to have destroyed the Horcrux right after touching it seems to imply that he didn't manage to use it though. I think he stayed far away from the Stone after this too.

*** Seems like he had not managed to actually summon anyone, then.

*** I agree, I think he would have seen the curse as a justified punishment for his moment of weakness and would have resolved to never use the stone because of that, regardless of how much he wanted to.

** I think he attempted to use the stone when he first came into contact with the horcrux and managed to summon Ariana, but was immediately struck by the curse on the ring. Then he had to focus on containing the curse, and escaping from the situation.

** Some fanfictions have the ring with a compulsion charm to put it on, so anybody who finds it will get zapped with the curse, but that's not my headcanon.

My headcanon is that Albus knows that his curse is the one that killed Ariana. The reason for this is the pensieve, full of his memories and others that he's collected. I think Ariana's death would have been one of the first memories he put in there, trying to get closure by finding out whose curse killed her, hoping that it wasn't his... and finding out that it was. I think he was hoping it was Gellert, to give him even more of the "moral high ground" against his former partner.

Thus, what he'd really like is for her forgiveness; to know that the changes he made in his goals and methods are enough to earn redemption. Faced with the possibility to find that out NOW, rather than waiting until he passes on himself, I think he just couldn't resist.

*** This does raise (not for the first time) the question of how the pensieve works and what its limitations are.

Does it work like an objective recording, and you can watch the whole event exactly as it happened, regardless of whose memory you're using, what their field of vision was, etc.

What does the pensieve do with facts that no-one knows the answer to (e.g. the curse that killed Ariana)? Does it fill in the gaps with the interpretation of the "rememberer"? Or fuzz it out?

**** The way it's described, yes you can see things that you didn't consciously note at the time. It allows you to "walk around" in the memory and see things that are not even in the direction the person was facing.

Clearly, there's magic involved rather than just showing somebody's memory.

The reason it would help in Ariana's case is that Albus, Aberforth, and Gellert were in a three-way fight and none of them noticed which spell hit her because they were concentrating on the battle. Viewing the memory would allow him to see it while not distracted and see exactly what happened.

** Well, he had to spend at least enough time with it, to get it out of the ring and into the Harry's snitch.

** My headcanon was always that you can't use the resurrection stone to get any closure from the dead but it is meant to assist you dying. Dumbledore himself says in the King's Cross chapter that he was not worthy to use the stone because he was only going to disturb the peace of the dead, while Harry was worthy because he used it to gain courage to walk to his death.

Edit: so I give OP a reasonable response and I get a downvote? I hope whoever downvoted has their most beloved person die of the worst form of cancer.

** If he did find closure, he didn't give any sign of it to anyone else. And yet he was wearing the ring regularly after that, so... Depends on his level of self control, I guess.

He uses the stone in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). Ariana's death turns out to have been by his own hand, though he would have wanted to humbly apologize regardless.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
