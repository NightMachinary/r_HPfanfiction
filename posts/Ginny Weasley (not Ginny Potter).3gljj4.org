As a longtime DLP lurker, I've read about a million ways Ginny is (or could be) evil/pathetic/potion-crazed/jealous. Almost every pro-Ginny fic I've come across from other sources has her with Harry. I know HP/GW is canon, but I'm interested to see Ginny in a positive light without him.

Got anything that highlights the littlest Weasley as her own person?

I'm not opposed to one shots, but prefer complete stories. Gen is preferred, as I'm interested in character development; but if you have a shippy story that's not just another romance I'm interested. Adult themes and ratings are fine (even desirable). I've read and liked "Lady Tom" by bitterfig and "Matching Muff Matrimony" by eloiselovelace, both of which are on livejournal. I'll add links later.


** I'm a DLP member myself, so may be some of our tastes will match.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] : /Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress./

This is probably the best Ginny-centric story that exists. Will be minor Ginny/Harry in the future, but it isn't shippy in the least.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] : /What happened at Hogwarts when the Boy Who Lived disappeared?/

Another excellent story I recommend.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4774376/1/Fire-Ice][Fire and Ice]] : /Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. Ginny Weasley burns for revenge and Tom Riddle is frozen in time. When two forces of nature collide, destruction is assured./

Ginny goes back in time to kill Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2016209/1/Lady-Darkness][Lady Darkness]] : /Being possessed by Tom Riddle wrought changes in Ginny Weasley no one could have imagined. Six years after first finding the diary, she's reached her goal. Now, Harry and Order face their most difficult challenge: fighting a friend./

This one is evil Ginny, but it is from her POV. I remember it being good, but it's been a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11128944/1/the-albatross-did-follow][the albatross did follow]]: /Treasure. Secrets and espionage. A mysterious oil painting. Draco Malfoy has gone missing, and Ginny Weasley has been hired to find him. It's the perfect storm for adventure---one with a dangerous outcome that no one, not even Ginny, could have predicted./

Somewhat shippy, with it being Ginny/Draco, but I liked it even though I rarely read anything of the pairing. It helps that it has multiple time travel loops, and Time-travel is my favorite genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9599624/1/The-Enigmatic-Headmistress][The Enigmatic Headmistress]]: /Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting. Danger, sabotage and sex at Hogwarts for Ginny, Luna and Neville. Smut in every chapter. Rated M for mature themes, language, and all that good stuff./

Some weird sex scenes. Still pretty enjoyable though.

*** After years of fanfiction-induced apathy, /The Changeling/ single-handedly renewed my interest in Ginny as a character.

*** It has been a long while since I added anything to my favorites list that wasn't a result of drug induced entertainment or a guilty pleasure, but The Changeling was really something else.

Thank you for the recommendation.

  It was a comfortable marriage of inconvenience, really, given how much they hated each other.

I don't usually read fics this short, but I started skimming through it and got drawn in by the writing style.
