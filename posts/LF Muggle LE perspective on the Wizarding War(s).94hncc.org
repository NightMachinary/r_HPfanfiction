Are there any good fics about the wizarding wars from the muggle law enforcement point of view? I'm imagining something in the genre of horror/mystery/psychological thriller.

Some of the muggle officials know about the wizarding world, so maybe they set up a special task force that's 'in the know'. Except when they go out to investigate half the time they come back convinced they never left, or that they're coming back from vacation, or from a different case they solved last week. Maybe Steve gets back from investigating a disturbance, claims it was a false alarm, and acts perfectly normal until he shoots his partner, his boss, the secretary, and then himself. Maybe sometimes they don't come back at all.

Meanwhile more and more people are dissapearing, dying in mysterious circumstances: gas explosions where there's no gas, things that just don't make any sense, except all the witnesses have the exact same story, and there's just something... off.

Maybe they have a magical informant, but can they actually trust him? Even if he is who he says he is, even if he is the same person he was last week, and acting of his own volition - none of which are givens, apparently - he is still one of the enemy, isn't he? Maybe not murdering people, but still complict to the race that holds 'muggles' in contempt. Maybe they interview the parents of Hogwarts students, but don't get much more than horror stories about 'you-know-who.' But they don't know who, do they? That's the problem.

Paranoia reigns supreme. The 'muggles' are the underdog in this fight, and they know it. But they also know there's something going on, people are in danger, and they can't just ignore it, can they? They have a job to do.

...

... yeah, anything like that? Crossovers, maybe?

** Well I would read this story. It definitely needs to be from a 'muggle' point of view, with the narrator /not/ all knowing. Or perhaps a LE squib, so they can know what's going on, but have no idea who to share the info with or even how to combat it once they do, giving a sense of helplessness to it all.

Sadly I haven't come across anything like it. At most some stories I remember have snippets from LE perspectives, but none that jump out as particularly fleshed out. Sorry :(
