*** Huh, usually every time I see a fic like this it's something like "7 of 3 million chapters" and "3k words long". A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I think I'll check it out even if only because it's so rare.

  “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”The world seemed to move in slow motion, as Rose Potter, the girl-who-lived, beater of trolls, new marauder and many other less pleasant titles, watched as the blasting spell hit her godmother, the only real family she had left, her rock, her teacher, she watched her slowly being thrown in the veil's direction.Until a mysterious green-eyed boy changed everything!AU! Harry and Female Harry (Rose), Harem! Evil Hermione, senile Dumbledore

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
