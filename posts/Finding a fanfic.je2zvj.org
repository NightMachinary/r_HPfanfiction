:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read a fanfiction forever ago that I really want to reread. I can't find it, so maybe banging some heads together will bring someone who knows it.

so here's the gist that I remember: post war. Draco's a healer. Harry sorta broke down and is unresponsive to everyone and is in st. mungos. Draco takes him on as a patient and slowly Harry responds to him. From what I remember, Draco goes home with Harry to continue helping him without him being stuck in st. mungos. I think Harry might've been tortured by Lucius and the other Death Eaters?? Not too sure about that.

if anyone knows what this fanfic is, I would be so grateful.
