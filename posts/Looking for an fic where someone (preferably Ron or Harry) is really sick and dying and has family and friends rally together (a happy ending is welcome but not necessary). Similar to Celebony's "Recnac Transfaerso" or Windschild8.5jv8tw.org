Hey ya'll this is my first time posting instead of just lurking through the HP Fanfiction subreddit but I really need help finding a story similar to these amazing works and I haven't been able to find one on my own. It's basically me wanting an angsty cancer/sickness fic that'll be a good cry but also a great read. These are my two favorites from this trope: linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso]]) linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/Stay-Standing]]) and i've already read the all the sequels to "Recnac Transfaerso" so any other suggestions would be great :)


** It looks like it's no longer on FFN, but if you can find it At Sunrise by Spectrum24 is a fic where Hermione has terminal, incurable illness.

** I don't have any recommendations but I just read Stay Standing and that was a fantastic read. I love The author's perspective on Ron so much.

** linkffn(750576) is similar to the celebony fic in the sense that Harry is like near dying for most of the fic and the weasleys and Sirius and Snape take care of him ... I don't remember why he was so sickly but it follows the same family drama thing.

** It isn't cancer, but have you read Celebonys "hero" A revised version of Recnac Transfaerso is over on skyehawke, it is unfinished but she improved on it after growing as a writer.

**** I wasn't very clear, it was two stories. The first story was "A Hero" I had the name wrong. The other one is the revised version of Recnac, here is the link. [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=18300]]

Even though she will probably never finish the revised version it is worth reading.
