Like he wants to be a Healer or a Professor or maybe even a fashion designer. Edit: It even can be a muggle job. In fanfictions where Harry leaves the magical world. It also doesn't even have to be the topic in the story it should just be a sign that he is changing, found new interests or something traumatic happened and he thinks more about his life.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.

** I know FF's where Harry becomes other things besides an Auror, but I don't know many FF's where he is in the process of learning to be other things.

Of the few I know, two is where Harry is learning curse breaking.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Sumer - linkffn(5915140)

Harry Potter and the Magic of Life - linkffn(11002763)

linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089) - This story has Harry learning how to become a healer.

After that, I don't know much else. Best of luck in your search.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

** Turn by sarasgirl !! Auror Harry goes to an alternative dimension where he became a wood worker instead. Like he had a fancy workshop where he made things like very expensive and artistic furniture, blew glass and so on

The author made it seem like such a good fit for Harry, like his life improved significantly and he became happier, more social, felt younger than he did as an upright and hardened auror and all that because he took a chance on a creative passion which suited him better after a whole youth of danger and stress.

The fic is great for a lot of things but that's one of the high points if you ask me, I highly recommend

** I just remembered some other fanfics about Harry wanting a different career in life.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Harry is slowly learning to become a magizoologist with a specialty with serpents. It's a fun story.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry is more interested in art, specifically pottery, at a young age and learns to incorporate magic with his art.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - Harry ends up becoming a dad and that causes a change in life choices.

Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion - linkffn(11610805) - Has Harry interested in dragons and learning to be a dragon keeper.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781 - Avenger Crossover: Harry starts up a bar but gets pulled into becoming a hero. It is a story about Harry leaving the magical world and finding a new purpose in his life.

Welp, here is my extended lists. Enjoy!

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.

#+begin_quote
  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
