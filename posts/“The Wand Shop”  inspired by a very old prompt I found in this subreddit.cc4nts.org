This is the first story I've written in a very, very long time. This has been my hurdle for about a year now - I'd start and stop it, think it's not good enough, doubt my voice and the story I wanted to tell.

But, it's published. The big scary thing has been done. And I just want to share. No pressure to read it, but I did the thing! And all you others out there can too :)

** Holy cow Pony. That was beautiful. Super sweet, a little sad but still hopeful.

So uh... When's your next story going to be done? üòÅ

**** It's hard to make it compelling, true, but the start is to actually say what the story is about. In this case: Is it about Ollivander and/or his successor making wand for the new students? Or perhaps about a new wand maker who has to overcome the special treatment Ollivander gets?

I may have written too harshly in my comment above. But I honestly think more people will read this story if the summary did say what it is about.

***** Thank you the feedback!

I chose to make the "summary" an excerpt from a first-year's letter because I share two scenes of a young witch or wizard getting their wand. The other main "plot point" of the story involves a twist that I wanted the reader to discover for themselves. My goal was to instead establish the setting and general time frame the reader can expect the story to be in, and then let the text itself speak for the other message I wanted to convey.
