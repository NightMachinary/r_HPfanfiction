Mine would be in a fic I read a while ago where they used it for healing. Not going to go in-depth, but they "directed" the flow of magic to the various ailments in different ways.


** Obviously the answer to this is linkffn(5446275).

** I can't say I've seen one I really liked. The best I can think of are those fics that mention it in passing, but never really go into detail on what it does or why anyone has one. Kind of like most everyone has a spleen, but they don't go on and on about it every day.

I know what fic everyone is going to cite as a "good use" of a magical core, and I'm going to just disagree with that notion right here and now. Those are some of the most tedious and boring passages I have read in recent history, and sometimes I wonder why I continue on with that fic because of them.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) mentions them, but hasn't really gone in depth. So it's left to the reader really, which is probably the least offensive tactic. It could be a classical magical core, or an aspect of the soul, or a complex magi-biological system or something else entirely

Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be woth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** Read it again. Dumbledore isn't good news for the muggleborns in dodging prison. There's an abstract (not sure it's the good word here, please correct me if needed) of his political actions, and it's not really something I'd vote for.

Luna picks everything up extremely fast and has a monster intuition. I must say I like this Luna. She seems odd and smart rather than a bit stupid, as she's often portrayed. Luna's tough to write it seems.

Could you link this please? I'm always interested in stories that have a focus on healing.

I don't have anything against the idea of magical cores by themselves, but any mention of them in fics invariably leads to a discussion of Power Levels and the quantification of magical ability, which I don't enjoy. Characters need to be able to do what the plot requires of them, not what an arbitrary number says is possible.

** Hmm ... I don't remember any that would have “the best” depiction of it, as far as the whole thing is concerned, but I do remember one (“The Untitled Cheekquel Project”) where it was presented as simply something that is (so no random power-ups from that, although Harry's power level in that story already reached the heights of crack mountains) but there was a minor plot point that there was a kid who was sick because he's spent too much time too close to too many dark curses and his magical core got infected with that.

That said, nothing whatsoever in that story was played seriously, so it's easier to look at potentially problematic things in it and just laugh.

There is a story the name of which I do not remember that is not actually a fanfic but an original story where characters have a core into which they can absorb various elements of magic that occur all over the world in places of nature and stuff, and which they later use in various proportions to make magic (imagine something like mana from “Magic: The Gathering” that makes sense in a story focused on normal magic users). Those cores had a limit of the total amount of magic they could hold without the wizard getting increasingly uncomfortable (and then even more than uncomfortable), and since they could not be found in places that were either fully artificial or had the influx of magic blocked, it actually was a plot element that this-or-that character had to operate on limited supplies on occasions. Honestly though, whether it's a magical core or simply magic or whatever else, what matters is how well it's written and not how one calls it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]

Magical cores and oaths are mentioned, but rarely described in detail.

This fic more or less started a lot of the tropes--but notably, nothing is taken to ridiculous levels. Dumbledore is not manipulative, for example, just overly disciplinary, which makes sense since he's terrified that Harry may be more like Voldemort than he thought. And there's bits and pieces of "Lords and Ladies," but it's primarily confined to a party at Longbottom Manor, and it's more stuffy old people than anything else.
