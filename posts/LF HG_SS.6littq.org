Was gutted to find out Ashwinder went down, which was my old trusted source. Haven't been into reading much in over a year, so I'm wondering what the good alternatives are. Esp since I've a few long travels coming up.

Might be a bit icky, but some recs for a still-at-Hogwarts Hermione would be appreciated (AU is obviously ok/def preferred).

Are there any really quality, more recent multi-chapter fics for this pairing? Minimal Voldemort/Death Eater asides preferred. Completed or reliable WIP is fine.


** linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria) might not be recent enough, but it otherwise fits what you're looking for.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

This author has written a ton of Snamione stories (mixed in with some Lunarry stories here and there), so this might be a good place to start looking. A lot of stories here are post-Hogwarts, but there's a few still-at-Hogwarts ones as well.

**** Some may be higher-quality than others, but there are a lot of sweet little one-shots here. She does a lot of her work on request from fans' prompts - or at least, she /did/ until fairly recently, when some jerk started plagiarizing her work...
