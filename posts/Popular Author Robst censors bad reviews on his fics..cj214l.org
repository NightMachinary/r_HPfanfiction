** Every author is different. Some welcome constructive criticism, some don't.

Think about it from their perspective.

For some writers, part of the enjoyment comes from growing their skills and perfecting their craft. In that case they welcome constructive criticism because they like to analyze their work to learn from it.

Other fanfic authors are more casual about their writing hobby. They enjoy creating a story and sharing it with like-minded people, but they don't particularly feel like examining their work any deeper, since that tends to spoil the fun for them. In some cases writing is a form of escapism from the stress of real life, and they might feel like analyzing/critiquing their work turns that fun thing into just another stressor.

Inspiration is a fickle thing. Authors often lose interest in writing a story if the experience is no longer fun for them. Fanfiction writing is something they do as a labor of love in their free time, not a job, so they are not obligated to receive our harsh feedback, especially if that feedback could cause them to lose their enjoyment in their hobby.

All in all, the polite thing to do is to respect the author's wishes if they make it clear what type of feedback they are open to. If they /don't/ enjoy a critical review, then you can always post somewhere else at a more polite distance (not directly in the author's face).

*** I'm in that second category. I've ended up giving up on ff.net because some of the comments were so nasty that it was clear there was no intention to help - it was simply a matter of taste, or, in some cases, a personal dislike against me - when I pissed some people off here I got a flurry of negative reviews. I've ended up going over to ao3 and Tumblr where it seems a bit easier to avoid nitpicking over something that, for me, is an emotional release rather than something I feel a desperate need to improve.

Personally I can't see why you would spend the energy writing pages of criticism for an already completed story that you did once enjoy but have now changed tastes, much less why you would then try to call out the author for not responding to you - they owe OP nothing, after all. I'm not sure what OP was hoping for.

** I'm going to assume that you're review just hasn't shown up because of the glitch. I will say that I kind of think every Harmony shipper goes through a Robst phase when everything her writes seems great. I know that at one stage I loved his work and followed/favourited everything he wrote.

I do feel sorry for him though because when people realise how trite and juvenile a lot of his writing is they seem to feel the need to go back and disassociate themselves by writing some really vitriolic reviews. I'm going to make another assumption that you weren't one of those.

At one point, Robst actually made an announcement that he was going to keep his writing to himself from that point on because the negativity was actually affecting him in real life and causing depression. So I can totally understand why any author would take advantage of the ability to moderate reviews.

Robst isn't alone in this, many authors do. Some even have stricter moderation policies about reviews, one of my faves Keira Marcos requires registration and login before you can leave reviews and if you are too critical she'll delete your account. Even if you just point out a grammatical error she'll delete you for "your non-consensual beta".

**** That doesn't mean it's not a glitch. If you're signed in, it's not possible for him to delete your reviews. Nothing is consistant on ff.net, not even the glitches.

** FFN is notoriously buggy about reviews not appearing without delays sometimes. It isn't the author censoring you. If you leave the review from an account, the review cannot be deleted.

Perhaps he's just enjoying his hobby in the way that he chooses.

You have an absolute right to leave lengthy screeds on how terrible you think his creations are. Yay, internet.

He has an absolute right to ignore you.

Like sometimes it takes a while for reviews to show, how long did you have it up?

**** If it's on FFnet, and you signed on with your account, then the review can't be removed unless you violated the terms (and even then, it's a stretch because FFnet does eff all with signed reviews). If it was a guest review, he could 100% remove it if he has guest review moderation activated on his account.

If it was Ao3 (is he even on that?), then the author can do whatever he'd like with comments.

*** It always serves to amuse me that the vast majority of despicable comments are from people far too craven to actually put them up under their own profile. I happily let them through and hope that some of them, down the line, will be embarrassed how ludicrously smallminded and pathetic they once were.

** Why did a fic writer not appreciate a multi-paragraph review (from a stranger, I'm assuming) about how the story they produced - for free - had a terrible premise and was "unreadable"? Yeah, that's a real mystery.

**** I've seen several authors delete their works from FFN and go private on Ao3 because FFN didn't allow them any input on the kind of comments that get attached to their work. Seems like Ao3's more versatile system is beneficial for the authors who prefer to have more of a say in how they interact with their fans.

**** By the same token, though, isn't the moderate/delete review option there so authors can, you know, moderate/delete reviews they don't want attached to their fic?

Anyway, the miracle of the internet is that you /can/ say all sorts of unpleasant things to lots of people. That doesn't mean you should, or that the other person is obligated to keep your comments visible.

***** I think the moderate/delete option would be more fairly reckoned to be for getting rid of trolling, flaming or spamming. Not for insightful,multi-paragraph works of constructive criticism written in good faith. If someone's put a lot of work (work just as free as the yours in writing the original story was) into giving you feedback, it seems outright disrespectful to delete all that work that was done in good faith.

****** Why are we assuming the review was insightful, constructive, and given in good faith? It sounds to me like this person disliked the basic premise of the fic, and while that's perfectly understandable, it's not exactly helpful to the author.

******* Because you yourself described it as multi-paragraph review (as did OP), which indicates a level of effort not usually found in trolls and other bad-faith agents. Even if it were of limited use to the author, OP clearly hadn't /intended/ it as such, and it's still disrespectful of robst to have turned away offered help; if robst thought the criticism made in the review were ill-founded, he should simply have replied to said review, not censored it.
