I'm not much for shipping, so I'd like to see what fics you'd recommend that are "slice of life." Length doesn't matter to me too much, so long as it's well-written and the stakes are relatively low. Hogwarts or home are both fine, so long as it doesn't break canon too much.


** I was going linkffn(11111990) Grow Young With Me, but you said something that doesn't break canon to much so their goes that. linkffn(11982933) Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake is a fun little "Slice of Life" where Ginny and Harry go to Dudley's wedding,

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
