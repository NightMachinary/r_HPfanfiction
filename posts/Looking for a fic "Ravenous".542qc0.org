I had downloaded a fic ages back called Ravenous. It has Harry Potter's parents dying in an attack and him going to live with the Tonks family with Sirius involved in his life. Neville becomes the boy who lived in an attack on the same night. Daphne is implied as the future relationship.

Some features include Harry being a bit darker and sneakier and sorted into Ravenclaw. Sneaking around at nights in Hogwarts. Befriending the Grey Lady. Being fairly powerful. Studying something about a dark Coven. I can provide more things if needed.

However I only read up till the end of the first year because no more was written. I have been searching for it and been unable to find it. It shows on google i think but takes me to a broken link.

Does anyone know if this story ever continued... and if its posted somewhere?

Thanks ahead of time.

Edit/Update: Author was Edelrost, and while their account is still active on FF, the story is missing. If anyone has any version beyond the first year, PLEASE post. Would love to know if there is more to this story or if that was the end before being abandoned.

Was deleted sometime in the last month and a half. Don't know why. It's a shame, was a very good fic even if it was abandoned.

***** I would have to see if I still have it anywhere besides my kindle, and if not then how to move it. The one I have ends with Harry on the train after his first year. So its the first year only... nothing beyond that. So honestly not that much longer then the one posted here by heresy on fictionhunt.

Edit: Ok so found it in Mobi form on my comp. Not sure if that will work but heres a link on dropbox.\\

I also checked and it looks like the version I have is just 1 single chapter longer then the fiction hunt one. Strangly it shows the same number of words so not sure whats up... maybe the fictionhunt version is out of order or something.

After some digging it would appear the author is still writing, but this particular story was deleted (likely due to it being abandoned or reported for some reason). Too bad.

*** Sadly thats even less complete then the version I have (my DL one has up to the train ride home after 1st year). But that is the Fan Fiction I was talking about. Perhaps the version I have was as much as there was before it was abandoned which is a shame since it was good so far.
