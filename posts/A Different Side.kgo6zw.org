“Pansy!” I whisper, shaking the girl awake.

”The hell Draco,” she moans.

”Where are kitchen?” I ask. “I'm impossibly tired but my essay is due tomorrow.”

”Too bad,” Pansy says, turning over.

”Guess I'll find them myself,” I whisper as I leave the common room, the chill air of the dungeons sinking into my bones. “Perfect place Salazar, the dungeons,” I grumble. “Didn't think it though, right. You just thought the squid would be cool, well con-fucking-gradulations. You successfully made a freezing walk to basically anywhere!” I continue complaining as I wander the halls, wondering why it's so hard to find a bloody kitchen. As I near the West Tower I hear crying, it seems to be coming from a bathroom. I slowly open the door and see a boy with messy raven hair curled in a ball. “Potter,” Harry quickly drys his tears and looks at me, “what are you doing up?”

”I could ask you the same,” Harry snaps.

”What's wrong?” I ask, sitting next to him.

”Why do you care?”

”I don't know,” that's a lie, “maybe it's sleep deprivation.”

”If I tell you how do I know you won't go tell everyone?”

”Truth is you don't,” I say. “You have no reason to tell me, I was a shity person for four years. I had myself convinced that it was to make Father happy, but that wasn't the reason.”

”What was?”

”I was jealous,” Harry laughs, “you were, are, everything I wasn't. You were perfect Potter, who my Father seemed more invested in than me. I thought just maybe if I brought you down a peg, not that you needed it, maybe Father would just pay attention to me.”

”That was more than I expected. I- I think I can tell you.”

”It always helps.”

”Nobody fucking believes me,” Harry says. “Cedric dies and they think I'm fucking lying! Seamus thinks I'm crazy! Dumbledore still expects me to save everyone when I couldn't save one person.” Harry's voice cracks, tears starting to form. “How do I function? The people who do believe me think I'll save them, but I can't. “ The tears start streaming down his face. “I just can't. What am I supposed to do when they all believe me. When everyone puts their life in my hands.”

”You don't do it alone,” I tell him, putting my hand on his arm. “You have Weasley and Granger.“

”Why don't you let everyone see this side of you?” Harry asks.

“I don't know,” I say. “I mean you can't just change overnight, right.“

”I'm sure in this case people wouldn't mind.” I know who would.

”I mean, I, you're right.”

”I should get back to my dorm,” Harry says, standing up. “Goodnight Draco.”

”Goodnight,” I say. He called me Draco, it doesn't mean anything right, right. It can't it‘s because he's tired, but I am too and I didn't call him Harry. I‘m overthinking this. With my mind going a thousand miles an hour I walk back to the Slytherin dorms, once there I go back to my half completed essay. Trying not to wander back to that goodnight. The one that can't mean anything.

*I hope you guys liked it, this is my first fanfic. I'm not even sure if this is the sort of thing you post here, but no where else seemed right. I know there isn't to much drarry here, but every good story needs a good beginning!*
