I'm planning to write a story centered around him and I'm wondering what misconceptions surround his character. I've seen many characteristions and most seem a bit off.


** Idk about mosconceptions but I despise the Tumblr/fanon Sirius you see a lot. My biggest thing about him is that he is 100% not okay,not at all. The level really depends on the writer but he's been through some horrible and tramautic years/decades.

He comes out of Hogwarts at 17 to become an auror where he fights on the frontlines of a war, (his brother dies on the other side); he loses all his friends/family in one night to betrayal and murder; he is then /wrongly/ imprisoned for 12 years where he endures daily forms of phsycological torture and physical stress; he then spends years on the run from the law.

At the very least he has some form of PTSD.

Edit:

Even as a teen I don't see him as a 'happy, go lucky' kind of guy. Given his family, I would think he would probably be more angsty, combined with being very stubborn it makes him reckless. I think the recklessness is born out of his stubborness (i.e., His need to help/look after Harry in OoTP leads him to the DoM) rather than the variations of oblivious!teen you often see. In actuality, I think his humour masks his anger, born out of a need for laughter than a proclivity for it.

He's also intelligent, not just at magic or schoolwork but in general and after his stint in Azkaban he has wisened a bit as well. In GoF he has a many poignant observations in the curiosities surrounding Crouch/Bertha/Death Eater/TriWizard Tournament mess- the chapter *Padfoot Returns*. He's not oblivious or blind to much, (he's /biased/ against Snape) only restricted in what he knows.

I could go on forever about Sirius haha, but I'll leave it there.

I don't think so. His general attitude suggests the use of humour to compensate, not sitting alone in the showers and cutting himself. He seems more like the dude who always tries a little too hard to "party", "have fun" or "get laid" because that is his escape from his miserable home-life.

** The problem with the Sirius we see in a lot of fanfic is that people seem to think the reason he is moody is because of Azkaban. Maybe that is part of it, but we see in OOTP he definitely had some moodiness as a teen too, and his sense of humour was dark, even cruel. Don't forget where he grew up and the context around that. I'm not sure where any of the silliness in canon even comes from to be honest.

Also, the gay thing. So, I have no problem with people interpreting Sirius as gay. Really. Its not how I see him myself, and I think if he was gay he was gay for James, not Remus. But I can see the appeal and if you think he is gay I fully support your view of him that way. But please for the love of god do not turn him into a camp stereotype. Its so unfair to the lgbt community to deny them such a layered, deep and troubled character and turn him into a glittery cliche. Also, please remember the historical context of the 1970s. Some gay lids definitely were camp then. They were not popular and they were not admired by girls.

This will be dependent on which family you're talking about though. The last male heir of an ancient family will have duties that supersede personal desires or attraction. So I imagine the Weasley's would be supportive of Ron being gay, while Neville and Draco would have more pressure to marry and produce a suitable heir.

On that note, it's not clear if the magical world has a concept of adoption. I mean obviously Harry was adopted by the Dursley family, but if he had been taken in by Dumbledore for example, would Harry be legally considered to have the same rights and privileges as a natural born son of Albus?

** Ahahaha okay here we go, I suppose I'll do this one. Way back in the day (about the time Order came out), I used to write in HP and I wound up hating most of the Sirius' I saw and wound up writing him just because it was driving me crazy. I can't say fully what he's like in fanon these days, I don't delve in that deeply, but I can state the things I have seen.

- Sirius Black is not a dog. Yes, he spent a considerable period as one in Azkaban and out of it, but that does not mean he runs about excitedly constantly, yells about everything, jumps all over people and will hump the leg of the nearest attractive person.

- Sirius is not stoic and withdrawn either. He's got quite a dry humour as we see it in canon and he uses it as a compensation for his experiences, he's unapologetically blunt (especially if you compare him with Remus, but he outright tells the Weasley kids some things are worth dying for when it's their father on the line) and he's prone to fits of depression. This is not the same as being stoic. Sirius is obviously concerned about seeming more stable than he is, because he is noted as withdrawing during his more intense periods. I could go on about the blaming the individual for their weakness rather than recognising their trauma thing that seems prevalent in magical culture and seems to be a throwback to a pre-WW mentality, but it would digress from the point.

- Sirius came from a purist family, and changed gradually. My most irritated thing is people who forget that Sirius has a fair number of more Slytherin traits. He can be quite manipulative in his representations of facts (perhaps not on purpose but he does get wrapped up in his own perspective and is quite an unrealiable narrator, possibly due to some of his experiences in Azkaban). This gradual change has always appealed to me as while not directly comparable, growing up at the protestant side of the peace walls in Belfast during the troubles and ending up with a best mate from a catholic family meant that both of our perceptions of each others 'side' of the wall were very different and often misrepresented. I feel like through James, and others as they came into his life, he got his horizons opened in much the same way. This is such an important cornerstone of his character.

As such, seeing people who have him be super into muggleborn rights practically from birth gets side-eye from me.

- Sirius has his hair long as a side effect of being unkempt and depressed. It's not his default state. You see in pictures that usually, when he's happy, it's cut shorter.

- Sirius bangs everything that moves. Where did this even come from? Girls looking at him in Order? He doesn't seem too interested in them, and a few posters aside, doesn't seem to show much interest in general. His friends are super important to him and fulfill a lot of his emotional needs. For me when it comes to Sirius, it's hugely important to emphasize how deeply he loves his friends and this is often overlooked for a ship. I don't disagree about the possibility of a name of obsessed house meaning he was sexual earlier than you'd expect, but I don't think that translates to promiscuity automatically.

- Sirius doesn't have canon tattoo's. The film director just thought it looked cool. PoA is a beautiful film, but do not get your canon information there.

- A little adjacent, but where on earth did people get the idea that Sirius is afraid of Orion? I know it's the cliche for the child in an openly emotionally abusive situation to fear the father, but I think we can see pretty openly, Walburga was much more his sparking point. He even makes a note of it in Order. Whatever Sirius' relationship with his father, there's no canon indication he was a feared patriarchal figure.

- He's not flighty. He's the opposite of flighty. He digs his heels in hard. I'm guessing this is part of the whole dog being easily distracted idea, but he's much more 'dog with a bone'.

- Sirius does change across the series. He's angry, sullen, disconnected, out of control and struggling with Azkaban in PoA. He's recovered a little by GoF, sounding much more chilled and relaxed, and is protective of Harry. In Order, he's deep into depression and stuck in a house he hates and he slips closer to a melancholy version of PoA and gets some revertigo because he definitely acts a little more like a teen in it (probably being in that house). These are all important factors to take into account when choosing your time period.

- Sirius found James and Lily's bodies. I realise this is the film probably putting it about that Snape did, but it was him and Hagrid.

- He was brilliant, but lazy. This is noted by his professors, and probably indicates that he was bright only in things he was interested in excelling at. 'Exceptionally bright', as McGonagall put it and 'talented', as Slughorn does.

Honestly, these are all off the top of my head and there's probably more, but I've rambled enough.

ETA: Just for the sake of debunking, I also added in Slughorn's quote.

It seemed more that he was /bored/ with school rather than laziness. Remus described him as one of the cleverest in the entire school and it's pretty much supported by his attitude. People who are generally bored with school are also people who are outstanding at most subjects. How many people do you know come out of an exam and say 'I'm expecting a full mark'? Most would be nerve-wracked. He is also described as the top of his year (along with James), so he's basically a straight-O student. He's also said to be very talented by Slughorn, who taught him Potions.

**** I did note Slughorn's comment above, yes. I agree with you that he was definitely bored. It's possible lazy wasn't quite the right word to describe what I meant, and I do apologise for that. He's not ambitious or driven in things he has no interest in, he knows he's smart and has no desire to push himself because he doesn't need to. This is, I feel, his contrast to his brother who is driven and has everything to prove, which gives them their fundamental House difference. When he decides he wants something? Pushes himself to excel beyond expectation, such as becoming an animagus. I just don't see him as pushing himself the same way in say, History of Magic. He's done enough to get an O, so he's happy enough, he's not interested in pushing himself to get an, idk, 100% or extra credit because it's super boring. This would be what some teachers would consider to be 'lazy' because it's not giving 110% across the board even though he's capable of doing so.

***** There's really no need to apologise, lol. I just get extremely irked because there's been a user that says Sirius and James are idiots, in addition to everyone claiming Lily, Lupin and Snape were the top and Sirius is dragged down... And anything that suggests he's less brilliant he already was in canon just irks me very hard, especially with fanfiction!Sirius. Yeah, I see Sirius as too arrogant to /not/ get an O in History or Magic but I don't think he's interested. I mean, like you said, he's ambitious in his best subjects (Transfiguration, Charms and possibly Potions). Hell, I think he'd be too arrogant to even fail Divination. But I don't see either him or James taking it, as fanon likes to assume. I do see how he'd be perceived as lazy, so thanks for clarifying.

But Sirius does showcase some Slytherin traits, as you've already noted. Some people peg him as a Hufflepuff but I disagree. He'd be a Slytherin. He was cunning, had some degree of ambition, shrewd, manipulative and most importantly, loyal to those he cares about only. He is only loyal to those he loves, as you've already noted. I think that's generally regarded as a Slytherin trait, not a Hufflepuff one. Hufflepuffs are loyal to a lot of people, Slytherins just have a group of friends that are carefully selected. But they remain loyal to them.

****** Yes, I saw the same user but I didn't want to engage and feed the trolls, so to speak. We know from Pottermore that Sirius is excellent in Charms (and nonverbal magic), which I think is interesting given Remus seems to be adept at Defense and James as transfiguration, making them quite the team (I don't know about Peter, as his page is less than complimentary). I just don't see Hufflepuff because I don't think Sirius necessarily prioritises hard work or fairness in general terms. I think Sirius is very much about his own narrative and experiences, which gives him some tunnel vision and that does seem rather Slytherin. He is the product of almost a thousand years of Slytherins (if you go with the Blacks being part of the Norman influx to Britain around 1066 along with the Malfoys) and he was raised by them, so I think it's leaked into his personality more than he realises. Loyalty to those who are loyal to you in absolute is definitely more of a Slytherin ideal, because it implies a quid pro quo more than Hufflepuff does, it's focused in a small group as you say and betrayal is not an option. JKR once said Sirius, for all his faults and traumas, has incredible loyalty to people and I like to stick with that. I think Hufflepuffs can be loyal to an ideal, whereas I think Sirius is more loyal to people.

Everyone takes a level in maturity, and while understandable, it's difficult to see them at Point A and Point B without the time to explore between the two. Sirius, as you noted, went through a lot of abuse during this time and yet shows little of the arrested development he shows in canon after Azkaban. I still think it's well written and well characterised, but I think it just suffers from the 'everyone is awesome' vibe which is cool if you're into it but I really enjoy flaw explorations. I keep thinking of his reactions to Peter and Snape upon returning, and it just doesn't feel as if it was explained well why he would have this sort of reaction. I only got a few chapters into the second one before it all got a bit too 'everything is about Sirius' for me, and he's my favourite character. It's one of the better ones, but I am (by my own admission) hypercritical about Sirius to the point where a lot of moments that feel just slightly off will turn me away from a fic, which is why I'm very fussy about which ones I read and if I know the author.

And it does suffer from 'everyone is awesome' like you said. For example, during the Unicorn Group meetings, it was nearly always Lily that did the stuff despite being there, like, ten other people? I think she suffered the worst from it, in my opinion. But the characters did seem a bit more human and because everyone was admittedly 'awesome' that made it a bit more bearable instead of just only one person for everyone to gawk at. I also didn't like Julia much, she lacked depth.

I think the situations differ here a bit. When he went to Azkaban in canon, he lost all three friends in one swoop. However, in this AU, he still has them around him, all of them supportive and he wasn't locked up. He was also being hunted down by Voldemort every chance he had so that must add some level of maturity. Being hypercritical of him is almost a requirement to love his character, to be honest. I mean, look at all that worshipping he gets and the people that make him very OOC as a result because they overlook his flaws. They even hand wave the Werewolf Prank Incident away like its nothing. So, understandable and very relatable as well.

I just don't understand why the author wouldn't choose to show his journey to that level of maturity rather than granting it and leaving readers to rationalise it, but it's not my writing style, after all.

************* Julia was a frankly terrible character. Her and Sirius's relationship had potential but it was wasted. I liked her job and wished that the author would have delved deeper into it. I mean, magical archaeology? Hell yeah. Her other interests were also quite neat. It's just a shame that she decided to give them to Lily at the end while Julia was just there for the romance. While we're on the topic of Julia, Lily. Lily was frankly terrible and quite bland. The author made it quite clear that she was more than just a secretary but her place within the Inner Circle didn't make sense in the slightest. She was supposed to be awesome but we're never shown that and instead get her image as a housewife. If anything, just give her role to Julia already and she'd have been more interesting.

I think that the fact that, again, the situations differ, Sirius's motivation would have been something else other than anger. Because, again, he was being tortured daily for their wherabouts so he clung onto the friendship this time. There was really no reason to be angry since there was no betrayal. And even then he still managed some anger at Voldemort, but that was after his escape. I think it's also worth noting that what actually kept him alive in Azkaban was the thought of his innocence, not his anger.

Yeah, writing styles differ and that's OK! Renascentia is amazing and so is the Unbroken Universe and they're too very different stories. But I think the series itself was quite large enough already without the author developing his level of maturity. During a war, it just hits you like that so I can excuse it.

************** Yeah, it just wasn't the kind of story that kept my attention because of those character deficits. If you're ensemble, you have to juggle and give fair time to each person and balance them well, especially OC's. I just don't feel like that was exactly it.

If you'll excuse me putting on my work hat for a moment and dragging psychology into this, Sirius speculates that it's his innocence that kept him sane but this is a thought, not an emotion. He specifies that the emotion wasn't a happy one, and while he never says it was anger specifically, the way he talks abut knowing Peter was with Harry is like a fire being lit in his head. To me, I would interpret these both as types of anger. There are other emotions linked to his innocence that could have done it, but my gut says it's anger. I do see what you mean about the fact that Peter didn't specifically betray him or James, though he did become a Death Eater which was glossed over a little bit too much for my liking giving what DE's did to him. I don't know, I get where you're coming from, but it doesn't have the right emotional impact for me and as a reader, emotional impact is important to me.

The author had their priorities and it doesn't line up with that I would prioritise, which is fair enough honestly. Everyone has different experiences, and see's how characters will react differently based on their interpretation of it. I personally don't see maturity during a war as a given so I would want it explored, but my war experiences are not going to be the same as other peoples or even what other people might think a war experience would be. It's all about finding your individual priorities and groove. Not every story is for every reader.

*************** Yes, but I don't know, anger-driven characters or always angry characters don't attract me at all so if that's the case with Sirius, I don't know how I ended up liking him so much. The fact that Peter was a Death Eater but was as inactive as possible and eventually denounced Voldemort to the entire magical community is enough for redemption, to be honest. The author actually explains this through Sirius, he feels like he can't deny himself - and the other three - their full friendship because it was what kept him going. And it was only two weeks until Peter defected. He later gets tortured because of it, but doesn't betray his friends. This is honestly my favourite Peter in the fandom. He actually has a personality here, and a believable one at that.

**** I'm glad you enjoyed it! It's both late, and I'm rather sleep deprived, so I hope this makes sense.

If I had to hazard a guess at why he's showing some signs of being insecure (at least to me), I'd say it's because of his upbringing. He may have had every advantage financially and educationally, but his familial relationships are complicated to say the least. In terms of my own thought. I believe he has issues with attachment because those emotional needs just weren't met as a kid, but obviously, this is just speculation.Then we have a couple of things that indicate that he latches on hard with people: we know he did with James (as Harry did with Ron, who was an isolated child and living in muggle London, I imagine Sirius had an insular upbringing too), we see he and Harry latch on very deeply from limited communication, and from context, he was close with the Order.

So where does this lead into insecurity? Well, if you consider the Black's as a whole, family as a concept is something earned and maintained. It's not a given. You will be removed from it if you don't bow to their desires. Everything comes with conditions. Having that in a child, it would be easy to see why he would seek out a family of his own definition (i.e. he says he's related to Bellatrix, but she isn't family) and cling to them desperately because he was raised to believe if you don't co-operate, you get removed. This is bound to leave a certain amount of insecurity about status and relationships. You see some of it with Harry, when he assumes that Harry wouldn't really want to be with him in PoA. I mean, even his oldest friends were down for him being a Death Eater and as we see with Remus, he forgives him immediately. He clearly wants that acceptance.

This can also interplay with, from the hurled insults, his self worth being very, very confused. He feels superior, but inferior in his own superiority. It's the being told you're practically royalty, but also being screamed at for a variety of things (i.e. the bike, I imagine). It would incite a feeling of worthlessness on top of feeling self-confident.

So I suppose by insecure, I mean that he doesn't feel solid in many of his relationships but still clings to acceptance. They believed he was a DE, he believes Harry doesn't want him, he believes it's his fault James and Lily are dead because they trusted him and Harry had to save him instead of the other way around. I think feelings of insecurity and worthlessness are hand in hand, because he both feels he can't be good enough and when he's shown loyalty (not even to himself, his tone to Ron completely changes upon him showing loyalty to Harry), he clings on for dear life because somewhere in the back of his mind, he knows love, family, friendships are all conditional and he may not measure up.

**** As a rule, I don't see him as ending up with anyone. While not strictly canon, given what I imagine are some intense attachment issues, I don't see Sirius as the type who would feel comfortable in a conventional relationship in the long term. Especially if you're post-Azkaban, where he has even more trauma to add to that and difficulty with betrayal.

I can see him enjoying sex, but his emotional needs are met by having strong friendships. However, I'm not against it if the chemistry and work is put in. I think for it to work, it needs to be someone he has a strong friendship with, who has no problem with his wanderlust and can put in the time and energy required to reach a strong level of trust. Other than that, my only thoughts are that I very much doubt he's wholly heterosexual (I tend to characterise gender/sex being non-issues, it's always about the person) and that it's someone who can keep his interest in terms of humour, adventure, temperament and someone who can appreciate his intense loyalty. Acceptance is key; he didn't have it at home.

I'm not sure maturity is a requirement, I think he'd fluster under too much of that but perhaps someone with some similar experiences or has knowledge in some of the other non-Azkaban issues (he has some mental instability even before it, he clearly had an emotionally abusive upbringing and personally, I also see some signs of insecurity) so I suppose if I were tailor making someone for him, they would need to be stable more so than mature, unwilling to give up, able to cope with whatever other issues he may have (I'm not sure how he would feel about genetically his children, for example) and be willing to let him help and take care of them because Sirius latches on hard when he feels strongly and will want to connect in that way. Aside from that, a good sense of humour, Sirius is both very dry and a prankster, and above all else, understand how important his friendships are to him.

** Hard to say. I will seperate this into the reasonably certain aspects of his character and the speculated or outright wrong.

Reasonably Certain:

- Sirius was good looking, though take it with a grain of salt from Harry's viewpoint.
- Azkaban did affect him somewhat, though clearly not as much as you would expect given what we know about the place.
- He has some dog-like traits.
- Even before Azkaban, Sirius was a very reckless person (see November 1st 1981).

Speculated:

- Azkaban unhinged Sirius significantly. His recklessness was because of that and not how he was before.
- Sirius became more dog-like /because/ he became an animagus. This dovetails with the ideas that James and Peter changed after 5th year as well due to the animagus transforamtion.
- He was a ladies man. Possible, but not nearly enough evidence. He never gives Harry "girl advice."
- He didn't hold a grudge against Moony for the situation with Harry, or Dumbledore. Who knows? Maybe he yelled at Dumbledore the first time he went to speak with him in PoA.

** Most characterizations I see of him either portray him as flamboyant and overexcited or constantly in a depressive state. Neither of them fit the way he is characterized in the books. Sirius was obviously someone with a lot of issues - reckless, moody, angry, impulsive, etc. JK Rowling referred to him as being in a state of arrested development after being put in Azkaban at 22. You can see this in his relationship with Harry where he seems to be more interested in recreating his dynamic with James rather than being the father figure Harry needs. Despite all of this, I think Sirius is one of the most interesting and complex characters in the books. He has an immense loyalty to his friends because he was not born with people loving and caring about just for being himself. He isn't used to that type of unconditional love. He created his own family with the Marauders (which mirrors how Harry found a family in Hermione and Ron). I think he's incredibly charismatic and obviously very quick-thinking and intelligent. As a teenager, he probably had this casual coolness about him that made him really popular. He seems like he was really fun and always down for a good time - not someone who took things or himself too seriously. I think he would have used humor and fun as a way to avoid the trauma of his childhood (as corny as that sounds).

Sirius is reckless and has a problem with authority, though he does obey Dumbledore enough to side with Snape at the end of GOF. He's a bit moody and there's definitely some damage that Azkaban wrought on him, but not so much as what we expect of Azkaban. His very redeeming quality is the sheer loyalty he has towards James and therefore Harry.

He's also a treasure trove of knowledge about Voldemort and Death Eaters as we learn most of it from his mouth in GoF and OotP.

He joined the Order when he was very young and thus sees Harry as eligible to fight too, something that Molly cannot accept. She didn't fight when she was younger so she can't understand why Sirius supports Harry in that decision. He's a very able fighter as seen in OotP (his duelling is incredible if you've read that part)

He pushes people out of the way and when Harry is in danger in OotP, his instinct isn't to fight but rather, to get Harry and Neville out of the way. He pulls Harry out of the way of the fighting, and when he see's Tonks topple from her fight with Bellatrix, Sirius tells Harry to take Neville and run before going after Bellatrix himself. Sirius is deeply protective as a person; loyalty is paramount to him, making him running away from home a wonderful contradiction because what would it take to break the bond of someone who is that loyal.
