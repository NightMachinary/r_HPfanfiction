I just started writing a li'l one-shot in the darkness ascendant 'verse where Harry accepts a duel based off the Hamilton track Ten Dual Commandments and number four is "If they don't reach a peace, that's alright / Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site" and got me thinking about how mages might actually have a wand or wand sets expressly for dueling.

In the darkness ascendant 'verse i've already postulated on combat specific wands that use a combat specific wood and a core of liquified leprechaun gold(like a four leaf clover, an occasional coin will remain and is kept as good luck).

But how would you add dueling specific wands? Would you lock them to a certain amount of casts per use like how in a duel with flintlocks, each duelist has one shot? Or would you expand their usage to allow for multiple casts(but perhaps locked to 7 spells or 17 or 49 in total)?


** I kind of like the idea that there are 'wand building' duels. Each wand can hold a certain number of 'points', and spells all have a cost. Then each dueller can load their wand with whatever spells they like. The end result would be vaguely reminiscent of a deck-building card game.

**** My better half is a huge CCG player, so it seemed like the logical thought. Then of course, all the spells these wands cast are purely cosmetic, and are registered by a vest or pendant or something that keeps a running tally of effects and 'hp'. The spells would be stored on an object of some kind, that could be loaded into the wand - disks that drop down into the wand so it can only hold a certain number? The spells would be tradeable, and sold in some sort of blind packaging. Like a CCG, some would be rarer than others. Maybe you could get limited edition spells with some items, as a promotion. Bet Lockhart has a deal to ship them with his books, containing whatever trademark spell he used to take out the big bad in that book.

** Because of the issues with how different sorts of wands are attuned differently for each wizard, yet with how different types of wands are better for different purposes, I wouldn't be shocked if there was a cottage industry of just producing wands made for dueling.

For instance the wands are made from the type of wood, and shape most conducive towards dueling. Then when you send somebody to "get the wands" for a duel, it's actually a group of wands with different cores so that the people selecting them can find the one that 'matches' them the best. Yet, all other things about the wands are similar (wood, size, length, shape, etc).

On top of this, it depends on how dueling is set about in the world. Is it each side shoots till they receive satisfaction (with an agreement made beforehand on the level of spells permitted), or is it each gets a single spell? Is it like the sword dueling we saw universes like Firefly, where you kept going till you got satisfaction?

I very much doubt in a world with instakill spells that a situation would arise like where Andrew Jackson intentionally let himself get shot first, just so he could have all the time in the world to formulate his shot. At the same time, I very much doubt that the extreme opposite would be allowed where it was an all out war between the two.

** Ten Duel Commandments

[COMPANY]

Number one!

[LAURENS]

The challenge: demand satisfaction

If they apologize, no need for further action

Harry laughed at the wizard's earnest expression. "Tell the "esteemed" Wizard Thadwich his demand for satisfaction is the actions of a craven coward. How he graduated from Hogwarts astounds me if he truly believes the shite he spews."

The wizard scowled and turned away to return to his compatriot.

"Harry, are you sure you know what you're doing?" Sophie asked breathlessly. Hermione nodded while Ron and Neville both just looked resigned.

He looked over at his friends and was about to speak when Wizard Wallace approached, scowling.

"Harry..., did you just accept a duel?"

"Yes."

"Har---! Sirius hired me to protect you, must you make it harder to protect you?"

Harry shrugged. "He's insulted me enough times but he insulted my mother. The duel is accepted."

[COMPANY]

Number two!

[LAURENS]

If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON]

Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

"Then I'm your second," Wallace said. He looked to the bodyguards who looked annoyed he was usurping the role while Neville looked slightly relieved and Ron started to raise his hand in objection. Hermione pulled his hand back.

[COMPANY]

Number three!

[LEE]

Have your seconds meet face to face

Wallace met with the wizard who had approached Harry.

[BURR]

Negotiate a peace...

"Thadwich only requires an apology and his position returned at the Academy."

[HAMILTON]

Or negotiate a time and place

"Thadwich lost his position for experimenting in ways that were ruinous to his department. A witch lost her life. He was lucky to not be arrested.

"Time and place."

[BURR]

This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY]

Most disputes die, and no one shoots

Number four!

[LAURENS]

If they don't reach a peace, that's alright

Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

Wallace accepted the package and left Ollivander's. His father-in-law's antique dueling wands---a pair of blackthorn wands with liquified leprechaun gold cores---were in excellent condition he now knew and since Harry was the challenged, it was his duty to supply the weaponry. He stopped just outside Ollivander's and looked up, searching the sky for a sign.

[HAMILTON]

You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

Medi-Wizard Voodoo dropped the heavy bag of gold in the fountain of St. Mungo's then apparated. He recognized Harry's friend and accepted the sock from her. "It'll activate at five am," Licorice told him.

She bit her lip as he nodded. "He'll be fine," Voodoo told her. "I'm sure Thadwich will realize how foolish he is to face off against Harry Potter."

[BURR]

You have him turn around so he can have deniability

Voodoo finished verifying both wizards were healthy enough. "Well, you're both of sound body. Now show you're of sound mind and stop this stupid shit."

"He insulted me," Thadwich replied.

"He killed a young witch with his stupidity."

[COMPANY]

Five!

[LEE]

Duel before the sun is in the sky

The horizon began to fill with light.

[COMPANY]

Pick a place to die where it's high and dry

Number six!

Harry knew the exact point he wanted and selected the beginning point for the duel.

[HAMILTON]

Leave a note for your next of kin

Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

Harry handed over the letters, even though this duel was not to the death, they were still required.

[COMPANY]

Seven!

[LEE]

Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]

Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]

Your last chance to negotiate

Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR]

Alexander

[HAMILTON]

Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]

Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]

Sure

But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]

With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]

Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]

Okay, so we're doin' this

Wallace walked from his place and nodded at Thadwich's second. "There's no way your man was stand down?"

"No."

"Then we do this," he said, looking to Harry.

He approached the young wizard and nodded.

[COMPANY]

Number nine!

[HAMILTON]

Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher

Summon all the courage you require

Then count

Harry and Thadwich stood back to back as their seconds and medi-wizard Voodoo turned their backs.

"Begin the steps."

"One."

They took one step forward each then brought their trailing leg to heel.

[MEN]

One two three four

[FULL COMPANY]

Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR]

Number

[COMPANY]

Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR]

Fire!

Harry turned at the tenth pace and let off a spell wordlessly, a sickly green light that took the shape of a skull as it seemed to chew the air, pulling itself forward in eagerness to hit the other wizard.

~•~

Thadwich's spell fell from his mind as the green light rocketed towards him. How?

He tried to summon a stone between himself and the green light of the Killing Curse racing towards him, unable to concentrate on anything else.

~•~

Harry apparated behind the the wizard, drew his personal wand and activated the blades in its hilt, then stabbed the man in the kidneys, twisting the blade. The quick, brutal stab and its flawless placement left the wizard dying as Harry's wand flicked out and 'caught' the spell before sending it up into the sky.

"Thus to murderers," Harry muttered.

Edit: i know there're at least two plot issues but it is a first draft. I'll revise eventually and remove the lyrics so i can post it to ffn eventually.

** First things first: your fic :D what do you think about associated positives and negatives of the leprechaun gold core? Like I assume it's used because it's lucky, but is there a disadvantage to them? Next: what do you want formal duels to test? If there is some sort of ceremony to them then the wands will be designed with only that focus in mind i.e. accuracy or speed. Maybe duels are traditionally more elemental in nature as they predate the invention of the stunner, and they focus entirely on elemental manipulation a la OotP big Dumbledore vs Voldemort fight.

Tangent: part of the reason why I haven't actually posted this yet in my fic is because I keep getting sidetracked by the glorious worldbuilding >_< but yes. I wanted to expand on the idea of the sentience of wands, I want them to have likes and dislikes and to grow with the user. However, this doesn't mean that the wizard or witch only has the one focus. Specialised foci are used, for instance by runecarvers. Staves work fundamentally differently from wands (they are more of an earthing point for channelling large flows of magic, whereas wands are the designed to be incredibly efficient), and I'm thinking of including specialised blades as an outdated type of foci (like the Sword of Gryffindor).

So it's perfectly possible in the system I'm using for someone to have a wand that feels more aggressive on the duelling floor than another wielded by the same person, and older wizards who have multiple foci will change between them depending on which tool they feel is best for the job.

*** That is an excellent q about the gold but it has nothing to do with luck and everything to do with the 'gold' being pure [leprechaun] magic. A leprechaun's gold disappears except one in every fifty thousand coins made(or whatever i say in story, dunno if i quantified). Mages think they're lucky and keep them as good luck charms. As a youth, Ollivander found one and decided to test it as a potential core. He found it was good for big magics but delicate stuff was impossible and shelved the idea until grindlewald and begins to develop the idea again off and on. I go into it a bit in story and will more later when harry receives his gold cored wands.

As for 'dueling wands' in my head, dumbles and riddle fighting as you suggest, while a 'duel' is in fact combat. These wands for dueling would be more focused on etiquette and the rules of "combat" as simplified for dueling. What's your story? It sounds interesting.

**** That's a really cool background for the leprechaun gold! I think it makes perfect sense that they are good at 'flashier' magic.

Mine can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12404980/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alchemist-s-Tale-Book-I-Calcination][here]], but I last posted a few months ago as in between I've been ill and recovering from a cracked rib that was rather distracting when trying to write. I'm back to writing now but it's slow going, as I'm trying very hard not to fall into clichéd pitfalls for Harry's first year. Also, am trying to put a bit of spin on most things to keep stuff interesting despite the audience having read permutations of some events (the sorting, first potions lesson) literally thousands of times before D:

If you want to talk worldbuilding, I can certainly do that :') I have a veritable ton of notes that I'm working to get down into actual chapters.

#+begin_quote
  But how would you add dueling specific wands?
#+end_quote

Dueling wands have a trick where if you hold them backwards they still cast spells but remember the last movement of the previous spell which lets you use it as the first moment of a new spell allowing for specific spell chains to be cast very quickly.

There are spells specifically designed for dueling so that their last movements correspond to the first movements of other dueling spells.

Other idea:

Dueling wands fire spells which travel at twice the speed but have half the power. They aren't capable of casting emotion based spells because of the power choke.
