So one Woman works for "the Justice", while the other is a Criminal. The Good one is a lesbian and gets attracted to the Evil one, but hides it. The Criminal discovers at some point the homosexual identity of her justifical counterpart and tries to use it to her advantage (distraction,seduction, possible sex), altough she is actually Hetero.

Does something like that exist?


** I read a similar fic about Hermione and Bellatrix long ago except I don't think it was one-sided.
