** I'm collecting a bunch of my one shots and short stories into a loosely connected series. A bunch of them have nods to the others, because they're all part of my headcanon, but all the stories can be read individually and you can skip them without losing anything. Mostly slice of life and character driven pieces.

** Northumbrian's fanfic bio states that all of his fics are book-canon compliant and that all but one of them take place on the same timeline.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

The "There is Nothing (to fear)" series is a non-canon compliant series of shorts and one-shots about a Gryffindor!Tom Riddle and his impact on the wizarding world.
