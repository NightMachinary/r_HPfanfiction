I always filter out the "romance" tag. What great stories am I missing out on?


** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) For me, this was the type of fic that made me miss the characters when I got to the end (till next update, ofc).

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

**** Fantastic. Both her and Harry have a a REALLY rough start because of various misunderstandings and secrets, so they constantly try to fight one another or scream at eachother, mostly because Harry is really prejudicial and both are stubborn as a mule. I'd say that Kally is my second favorite OC in all of fanon, only losing to Abby from Grow Young with me. Both have depth, a well developed personality, a past that isn't well known, so you get "mystery" behind it, aren't Mary Sue, in fact, Kalliandra has severe health issues and can't do usual magic (this isn't a spoiler because its explained in the first few chapters). She's definitely not perfect but their relationship feels quite genuine. It started before the sixth book came, but there's elements from it, after it was released. (horcruxes, though they are REALLY different and way way way cooler and interesting)

******** I'm using the actual meaning of prejudice, to pre-judge, to have pre-conceptions of someone without actual knowledge. He's extremely prejudicial against Kally in the begining, thinking her to be dark and evil simply because he saw her buying a book in Knockturn Alley. Hell, they had a fist fight because he thought she was DE, because of the book and the fact that Malfoy for some reason spent time with her.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]] linkao3(7737991) and its sequels are great next-gen fics that have a fair amount of romance/relationships. (They do reference /Cursed Child/, though, which I know wasn't everyone's cup of tea.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486][the lost generation]] linkao3(1110486) is one of my favorite marauder-era fics, even though I'm not all that big on Sirius/Remus.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13082262][gone was any trace of you]] linkao3(13082262) is focused on Harry and Ginny's relationship, with an amnesia plotline.

** I'd throw in my own Dawn of Darkness, which used to be tagged as romance for quite some time.

The basic premise is that Harry invites Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas party, they end up in Tonks flat and decide that Harry should crash there for the Christmas holidays. While a lot of fluffy relationship stuff goes down (without anyone proclaiming their undying love after three days), there are more and more events happening in the background, which cumulate in Harry and Tonks fleeing Britain and trying to figure out why the Ministry is suddenly acting like complete idiots (from their perspective, there is actually a sensible reason for that).

I'm going for believable power levels, even if that means Tonks is the better fighter for now and no one is pulling Hollywood stunts.
