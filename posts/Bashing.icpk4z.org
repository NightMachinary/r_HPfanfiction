Who are your favourite characters to bash in fanfiction? Can be unpopular opinions!


** I'm not really a fan of bashing, however it is quite funny seeing the lengths that some authors go to make Dumbledore look bad.

“Harry m'boy, have a potion laced lemon^{TM} drop^{TM} while I lead you to your death for the greater^{TM} good^{TM”} Dumb-as-door told him, while probing his mind, limiting his magic with one hand, and paying off Ron to be Harry's friend with the other.

*** I've read fics where Dumbledore tried to sacrifice Harry so that Tom Riddle could become the new leader of the light after he retired.

**** That's a new one. Craziest one I can remember is Voldemort was good all along, operating under Dumbledore's imperius curse. Voldy was sent to kill the Potters, but when he pointed his wand at the baby, he couldn't do it and broke the curse. Dumbledore had to step in himself and AK Harry, creating an accidental horcrux for himself.

** The more misfortunes that befall the Malfoys,the happier I am

And I know she's not actually a character but I do like like seeing Daphne as a bad person because of all the ice queen oversaturation

** I've made fun of Draco and Lucius before, I even made Hermione beat up Draco so bad that he might've died in real life, but I don't like bashing if there is no reason for it.

It can be a good thing if it makes sense. I would never write even a subplot for bashing someone if it doesn't give anything to the plot, but after that, I'd call it a plot device instead of bashing.

*** Snape isn't as overrated as you think, because half of the community hate him, some keep him neutral and others worship him (bleh for the last one)

Draco bashing depends on the plot- eg. Slytherin Harry then good Draco, Harry who is sarcastic, doesn't like bullies then bad Draco

** Ron is the go to just, cause. Shrug, I don't hate the guy, I just don't get all that upset about it.

I do usually hate Dumbeldore bashing just cause it's usually written so... stupid. Most Dumbledore bashing has him at crack level of senility and/or stupidity which just makes the idea Voldemort ever feared him ridiculous.

** Depends on the writing. If they make it plausible I can enjoy anyone getting bashed even hermione anfthe twins who deserve it the least imo. But just cranking Ron's laziness and jealousy to 11 or taking molly's one off line about a love potion and making her some diabolical potion queen is just irritating. Best version I've seen of molly bashing was in linkffn(watching over harry) where it was because of a prewitt family grudge against the potters. Better than big happy weasley family via potions I see most of the time

*** Hermione deserves to get bashed- I always hated her character, and saw her to be way too bossy overbearing and insufferable. In PoA, if I was Harry I would have have been way more angry over the broomstick thing. In HBP, she literally abused Ron and should have gotten a detention for that at least. Read Apex by JustBored21 to see twins bashing. They don't deserve it, but I do see where the author comes from. linkffn(Apex by JustBored21)

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
