I don't do much research into fan theories, so I apologise in advance if this one is already floating around. I was just thinking of this the other night....

*Harry's Wand:* Holly, Phoenix Feather, 11 inches long, nice and supple.

*According to JK Rowling Holly means:* Usually chooses those who need help overcoming anger, chooses those engaged in some dangerous and spiritual quests.the wood is volatile.

*Phoenix Feather:* Greatest Range of Magic, show initiative, allegiance has to be won.

*Length and Flexibility:* length is average, very flexible-meaning easy to adapt and willing to change.

*Voldemort's Wand:* Yew, Phoenix Feather, 13 1/2

*According to JK Rowling, Yew means:* Good at duelling, wand never chooses mediocre wizard, but both heroes and villains, can be a fierce protector of others.

*/Phoenix Feather: */ Greatest Range of magic, shows initiative, Allegiance is hard won.

*Length:* Is average, there's no description on his wands flexibility.

*Is Harry's wand only attracted to him because it is attracting to Voldemort's soul sliver?*

I think there is a chance it might be. We know that Harry's wand and Voldemort's wand have the same core, a phoenix feather from the very same phoenix. I do not believe Dumbledore gave Ollivander two feathers at the same time. It makes no sense to me, Dumbledore gave Ollivander a feather for Tom's wand years before Tom even came to Hogwarts in 1937. So sometime before 1936 Dumbledore gave Ollivander at least one feather. And Harry wouldn't even be born until 1980. However Dumbledore very well could have given two phoenix feathers and Harry's wand sat there unclaimed for over 64 years. Simply Ollivander handed Tom his Yew wand first and it matched up. So that's really not relevant.

Obviously Tom was the first to get his wand, and matched up with a Phoenix Feather, same as Harry, so similar in fact it came from the same bird, Fawkes. Looking at the traits of each wand: Holly: Voldemort Certainly needed help with anger-control, and he was definitely engaged in dangerous and spiritual quests. And the wood is volatile much like him. Riddle is both rigid in ways and easy to adapt. Rigid in his never-ending pursuit of Harry, but flexible by the means of doing so, or the way he came back with many different attempts. However since we don't know Tom's wand's flexibility it's hard to say. But it looks to me like Tom matches up pretty well with Harry's wand based on the traits alone.

Now let's see, Harry is good at duelling in comparison to his classmates, and isn't quite as mediocre (He throws off the imperius curse, something no one else in the school could do and is difficult to do even for adults, he can also cast a patronus charm at 13), He's fiercely protective of others, and is a hero. (Yew can go either way). Phoenix Feather, oh look it's a feather from the same bird, also average length. It looks like Harry could be a good match to Voldemort's wand as well.

And in a wand shop of /thousands/ of wands, it's just a mere convenient coincidence that Harry, with a sliver of Voldemort's soul in him, matches up perfectly with a wand that has the same core from the same bird in it? Phoenix Feathers' are very hard to come by, but there were other Phoenix wands in that shop. In fact Ollivander had Harry try out another wand of Maple and Phoenix Feather before his Holly one, and it didn't like him. Only when he tried the wand with the same core from the same bird as Voldemorts did it work. Furthermore Phoenix feather wands are very picky about their owner, so it picking something it had already picked before wouldn't be quite shocking.

Now we know that Harry repairs his wand with the elder wand and decides to use it, and seems to just fine, however I think it'd be more realistic for it not to work anymore and Harry would need to get another wand. I think it would have been more interesting to put that in there and see Harry struggle to get a new wand (Ollivander had been kidnapped, etc. and not making them, so where did all the first years get their wands in year 7?). It'd a bit funny to see Ollivander collecting and making wands and each one is like 'nope nope nope'


** Well, throughout the story we often see a comparison between Tom and Harry and, even though the letter tries to deny it, this comparison makes sense. They are alike in many ways. So it is not out of realm of possibilities that the feathers of the same Phoenix look for the same characteristics in people.

And even if the wand reacted to the Horcrux, I don't think it will suddenly stop obeying Harry after the soul piece was removed. Harry grew up with it and therefore became the person he is because of it. That's just my headcanon though.

** In linkffn(Faery Heroes) Harry has to get a new wand after the Horcrux is expelled, and in my own fic, I have something similar planned, but the Holly and Phoenix feather will still be important.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
