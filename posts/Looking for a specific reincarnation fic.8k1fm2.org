Harry encounters Death who sends him off to various AUs. He's paired off with a different woman in each. After some number (like 10 maybe?) of reincarnations, Harry is given a choice. He can choose any of the AUs or he can choose the one that he hasn't visited yet. He takes the latter option and ends up with Daphne Greengrass.

  Harry's dead again, but instead of passing on Death gives him an option; view eight possible futures and pick one to return to the land of the living. People from Harry's past help him with the visions. Which one will he pick? And will he be happy with his choice? AU, Post-Hogwarts. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
