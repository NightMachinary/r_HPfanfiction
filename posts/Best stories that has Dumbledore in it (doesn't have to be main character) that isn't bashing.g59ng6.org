As it says. Just looking for ANY good stories where Dumbledore is in it (doesn't have to be main character) where the story isn't bashing him.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Can be on ANY site. Anyone can be the main character, can be from any era.

No OP Harry, no super smart Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but no OP Harry. No Lord Potter stories either.

No Weasley Bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]] Dumbledore starts to get more scenes in fourth year. It is quite a good story.

  Post-OotP Reluctantly taking a leadership role in the fight against Voldemort, urging others to 'say the name', Harry tries to learn how he can use his 'power the Dark Lord knows not' to fulfill the prophecy as he becomes his enemy's biggest target.
