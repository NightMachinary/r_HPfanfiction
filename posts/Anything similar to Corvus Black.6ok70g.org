So, ok, this is probably a cliche Trope since I've found plenty of fics of this kind (none of them well written or much too short or / and rather angsty) furthermore none of them extend to Hogwarts and are abandoned before he can go to school again.

So it goes like this, Lily changes Harry's appearance so that he looks like her and James, but he is Bellatrix's son and it goes from there.

Do you guys have any similar stories that are long and well written? The best example I have is linkffn(10478838) but it's too angsty at times, I'd like it if Harry doesn't suddenly become Slytherin and the entire Black family tree get a change of heart. But I'll settle for anything that resembles written english language. Anyway, it doesn't have to be Bella who is his mother, but the whole Death Eater parents should (if possible) still be there.

Cheers

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.
