Do you guys have any recommendations for good Ron-centric fanfics? I've read some good fanfics over the years, but they've mostly been from Harry, Hermione or Ginny's POVs so I was wondering whether there were any from Ron's which were worth looking into. Thank you!


** I read an amazing AU which focused on Ron and Hermione. Can't seem to find it anymore but it was one where Malfoy took over after voldemorts absence and brainwashed all the muggleborn to become his wands. One of the best fanfics I read. Ron and many others fled to France and are now fighting to come back

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Ron? Yeah, I love this new Ron. He's so cool and yet not over powered (he does mess up). I also really like Violet.

Hermione and Daphne? Not my favorites.

  Winner of "Best Depiction of Ron" at the 2009-10 Ron/Hermione Awards on Livejournal. The story of Ron and Hermione's complicated romance, with added biscuits. Not remotely fluffy despite the title, and rated M for later chapters.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.
