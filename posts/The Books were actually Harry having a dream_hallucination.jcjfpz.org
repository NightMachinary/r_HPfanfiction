Looking for stories in which the events of the books were actually Harry just having some kind of dream or hallucination. Linkffn(13013233) is one where he wakes up in a hospital after Voldemort kills him in the forest and finds out the series was actually just something storyboarded by himself and everything was a dream induced by head trauma. There was also another story in which Harry woke up in a mental hospital and Ron/Hermione were his imaginary friends with TMR being the head doctor. Looking for stories like those.


** The Serpent and the Mirror » Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort? Now COMPLETE

*** Just finished reading this and it was great. I loved the symbolism Quidditch had and what the author did with Sirius, although the whole Oedipal complex thing was weird. Thanks for the recommendation.

**** Your welcome I'm so glad you liked it. It's an underrated story in my opinion. I have another story were Harry grows up in an asylum until he is eleven and Dumbledore picks him up. Although magic is real the story is still very haunting and deals with the distortion of reality.

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

** (Edited) This is one I never finished reading years ago but I remember it winning various fanfiction awards. It even had a podcast before.

  “There are no such things as Deatheaters, Harry,” Ron solemnly said. “It's part of your imagination. Voldemort does not exist! Magic isn't real! There is no Hogwarts, there never was!”
