I admit to be vastly inspired by linkffn(12184104) The lone traveler: Professor of Defense, but I was thinking about going more in depth about the magic system and the various magicks a Defense Master may know! I would like for it to be a serious one, but without taking the wonder out of magic (that is what I feel to be the most common error). MoD!Harry should hop between realities at will, this time taking the DADA post from Lockhart

If anyone has a suggestion, a spell that they made that they want to see spoken of in the DADA class, or something of the sort, let me know!


** There's few Harry teaches himself stories:

Linkffn(Sine Qua Non by AzarDarkstar) - this one stands out.

Linkffn(A Good Teacher by Nia River)

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

*** I do believe he will try not to single young Harry too much, but seeing as he had an untapped potential in the subject, he may be receiver of additional teaching along a few others

** I love this theme because it leads to great questions. What kind of teacher is Harry? What is he like inside and outside of the classroom? How do other teachers treat the revolving door of doomed defense professors? Anyways, I'm looking forward to your fic and to see your take on Harry being a professor!
