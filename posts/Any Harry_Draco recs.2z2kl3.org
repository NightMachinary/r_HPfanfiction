Haven't read any before, but I'm in a mood to. No PWP, and Hogwarts age is preferred, but I'll try whatever.

Thanks!


** I discovered that I don't have very many Hogwarts age favorites in my list while looking for fics to rec, but here's a few: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6029161/1/White-Lies][White Lies]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6560750/1/The-LipLock-Jinx][The LipLock Jinx]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5401510/1/Talk-to-Me][Talk to Me]].

Also, I second Draco in Darkness.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP.html][Irresistible Poison]] by Rhysenn (hogwarts age)

#+begin_quote
  Under the influence of a love potion, Draco learns that poison doesn't always bring death -- there are other ways to suffer and live. Chemical emotion runs feverish as Harry and Draco discover the intoxication of love.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_ivyblossom.html][Origins]] by Ivy Blossom. (hogwarts age)

#+begin_quote
  This is the prequel to another fic, Haven, which was turned into a trilogy. Origins is by far my favorite of the three stories in the series.

  It takes place during Hogwarts and tells of how Draco fell in love with Harry before Haven started. She doesn't give an official summary for Origins other than that, so here is the summary for Haven:

  After a whirlwind romance with Draco Malfoy that ends in an explosion of clashing political beliefs, Harry Potter graduates from Hogwarts and takes a job with the Ministry. He hopes that Draco wil not join the Death Eaters and will come to him in time, and he doesn't guess what Voldemort has in store for him.
#+end_quote

There were also a few H/D Big Bangs done after books 5-7 came out. I really enjoyed most of the fics and art. Here are each of the challenges. Most should be Hogwarts age.

I'm drawing a blank on other Hogwarts age fics right now, so here are couple more of my other favorites

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=2226&chapter1][A Thousand Beautiful Things]] and the sequel by Duinn Fionn (post-hogwarts age)

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy struggles with changed fortunes, shifted alliances, an ugly war, and an unusual spell, with the help of a concerned professor, an insightful house-elf, and an unexpected Gryffindor friend.
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]] by Saras Girl (they teach at hogwarts)

#+begin_quote
  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.

*** I've had Irresistible Poison bookmarked for awhile now, and you reminded me that I wanted to read it. Finished it late last night and it's one of the very best H/D fics I've ever read.

This is the story of my life, haha. Find a good fic, stay up half the night to finish it. I remember constantly refreshing schnoogle hoping for a new chapter of IP, and then subscribing to her and Cassie Clare's mailing list and monitoring my email like crazy the whole time. I swear the chapter updates only came at 10pm on a school night.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/plumeria/DID.html][Draco in Darkness]] by Plumeria

#+begin_quote
  Following an accident in his seventh year, Draco loses his eyesight. At first he completely withdraws, avoiding any hint of pity, as well as any assistance; he is determined to succeed on his own. But after Harry elbows his way into Draco's dark world, both boys find themselves in a strange new friendship, and they each learn new ways to see each other... and themselves.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581954/1/][Mental]] by Sara Holmes

#+end_quote

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/metisket/refraction.html][Refraction]] by metisket (This one is a bit weird, but I enjoy it so I'm including it here.)

#+begin_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/41103][101 Way to Heal Your Wizarding Woes]] by who_la_hoop

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a trainee Auror, and Draco is living at Malfoy Manor, bored and petulant with nothing to do, and no career prospects. Draco's attempt to heal himself via Muggle psychology---including writing a series of 'why I hate you' letters to Harry---backfires when an overanxious house elf delivers the results to Harry. Harry is bemused, Draco is angry and together they have a lot of issues to work out.

*** Yussss. Some of these are H/D classics and must reads. God, it's been 13 years and Beautiful World /still/ gets me just thinking about it.

I don't think I've read Mental or Refraction, so I'm going to give them a read this week.

** If you're hoping for something with a larger focus on plot than on the shipping, you may like Lightning on the Wave's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]].

It's a full seven-year Hogwarts story [complete, 3.05M words]. The first few books don't even touch the main H/D ship (beyond a hint or two), and are instead more focused on Harry's personal struggles that arise from the way his parents (who are alive in this universe) treated him as opposed to his twin brother (the Boy-Who-Lived in this universe).

There are appropriate trigger warnings everywhere, especially in the latter 3 books where things get much more violent. Additionally, the author goes out of their way to specify where potentially triggering scenes occur in each chapter, so it's easy to skip if needed.

**** Harry does tend to have a lot of repetitive problems in the series, it's very true. I found it different enough each time, with the slight variations in his reasoning and current struggles, but I can definitely see why it can be difficult to get through.
