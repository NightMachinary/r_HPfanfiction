Let's be serious harry should at least be suffering some sort of trauma by book 3 not to mention the rest of the cast.


** Currently working on one. Im trying to be accurate in how his personality changes, but there are also some changes I've made to the world and how things have happened. Might be along the lines of what you're looking for.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

  Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends, warned the red priestess and, for once, she was not mistaken. At the Wall, an army of men fights ice with fire while the struggle for the Iron Throne continues with old and new players alike. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen becomes determined to go home, leaving behind a trail of destruction in her wake. Amidst it all, Arya Stark returns to Westeros teaming up with the most unexpected company yet, becoming a participant in a very different meeting of ice and fire.The realm will soon discover House Stark and Targaryen are not as dead as everyone once thought and, more importantly, that the darkest hour is upon them.

** There is an ongoing story linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12940130/1/Grim]]) which is an AU of sorts as Wormtail kidnaps Harry when Sirius escaped Azkaban in 3rd year. Plenty of mental trauma to go around.

This is post-DH; Harry is a peripheral character, and the story mostly focuses on Hermione, Draco, Neville, and some Muggle OCs. Mental health is a strong theme.

**** Glad you liked it! I have read Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation and The Princess Rescues the Dragon. I recall that both are well-written, but I'm not sure either one is complete. I think both are in the same universe (which is not the same universe as Four O'Clock) but are written from different perspectives. They are also somewhat grittier; mental health issues still apparent, but not dealt with as responsibly by the characters. I don't have strong memories of any of the others, but I probably read them, and they do blend together after a while.
