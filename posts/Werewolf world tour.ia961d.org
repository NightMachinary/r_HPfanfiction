Let me know if this idea has been used before in fan fiction.

Instead of even bothering to use the Wolfsbane potion, on the night of each full moon; set up a series of portkeys that activate 3 hours before sunset at starting locations and then proceed travel West by 6 hours of time zone.

Then they recover and relax for 6 hours, then repeat the process 3 more times to get to their starting point the following day.

No full moon, no furry problem. Do that once a month.

What could the possible side effects be or consequences for keeping the wolf üê∫ continuously caged?


** "Harry Potter, Self-Insert" By 15Redstones linkffn(13195996) has werewolves portkeying to New Zealand.

Chapter 7:

  Sirius seemed totally flabbergasted. "Don't tell me he just cured lycanthropy."

  "Well, it's not really a cure, but I thought of a way to block the full moon. Remus told me that werewolves tried hiding underground before, but a few hundred meters of rock never was enough. That got me thinking... what about an entire planet?"

  "Planet?"

  "The Earth," Remus explained. "I spent the night - or day - camping in New Zealand. The portkey was quite expensive but it was so worth it. I skipped the entire night."

  "But why would... ooh. Time zones. Of course. Remus, why did we never think of this?"

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

** The earliest story I know who used that is linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House). Valeria writes an anonymous letter to Remus at the end of third-year and gives him coordinates to places where he can apparate without entering the jurisdiction of any magical government as well as a book on how to survive in the arctic with magic and a broom so he can reach the aforementioned places.

Edit: I didn't see your last bit, but there wouldn't be any side effect if a werewolf never transforms. After all, it only transforms in the first place because of the presence of the full moon and the curse has no other effects (just social stigmas).

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** I seem to remember a fic that had Remus portkey to different safe houses across de world. I believe one was in the states and another in Australia, but can't remember anything else at all... maybe someone else knows?

This one. I am about 93% certain that this is the fic, Harry and Sirius makes a company called Potter Communications, using werewolves on motorcycles as delivery boys and portkeying them to the US every full moon. Ingenious actually.
