I really liked hpmor. I like the villain, I like the magic, I like the characters, but most of all I love the way that problems are solved with real world science and that I learned while still reading a story that was enjoyable.

I've had a hard time finding stories that give me the same feeling of going "oh that's pretty neat" whenever something is explained or how the characters go about problem solving. It doesnt really have to be centred around science, I just like seeing characters thinking more creatively with magic (particularly transfiguration cause that's just op imo).

Any recommendations?

** Quick warning that /a lot/ of the science in HPMOR is simply not correct, and the way it is portrayed is very biased. Don't take it from just me, look up reviews of HPMOR, especially the ones that focus on the science of it. I would not consider HPMOR educational. For an example of a review, try this one - [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]]. Granted the language is as biased as HPMOR, but it should serve to as a good baseline for the issues with HPMOR science (and also the writing if you're interested).

*** The genetics of squibs was complete nonsense, true. However, not all of the science was that bad. And that review you linked was bizarre, like the writer has no concept of an unreliable narrator. That version of Harry values only a particular type of intelligence, but the story shows how wrong Harry's outlook is.

** A bit of self-promotion, but I just started one that might fit the bill. It's a modern-day college Marauders AU where Remus is a teaching assistant for Professor Dumbledore's philosophy class. It touches on classic works and principles of philosophy as relevant to the plot, centered on the rich and powerful House of Black. Think half fluff, half class commentary :)

Only a couple chapters are up so far, but I've got the whole thing planned and will definitely finish!

** You might like "The Arithmancer" series. It pretty much includes a lot of real-life mathematics which is well incorporated into the story itself. It is Hermione-centric though.

*** Take [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=103][all HP stories]], order by popularity, pick the first story :). There are VERY polarized opinions about the story. For many it is the best fanfic ever (perhaps even the only fanfic worthy of reading), many really despise it. I try to stay more in the middle, but in the end I think it is not worthy of your time (read three times Moby Dick by Herman Mellvile instead, that's roughly the same size).
