I just finished Back to the Garden by Antosha tonight, which is what got me thinking about this. I thought that story was absolutely fantastic and very moving. But that story's over ten years old and it's read count, despite having 40 chapters, was less than 23k in all that time. Worse, it was apparently only posted to one minor site that's since died so very few new people are going to come across it.

It just makes me feel weird to think that this marvelous work was only ever read by a few hundred or thousand people and probably only a few copies of it exist, probably none of which would be easily found if you weren't looking for it.


** Absolutely. There's many great stories in the fandom that willn ever get any recognition simply because they are fanfiction... and then there are those that even among fanfiction won't get much recognition.

I've always pondered the very questionable relationship between popularity and value / quality.

** Definitely a little. It's always a shame to see what is in my opinion a very good story get little attention.

*** Yeah, even though I usually sort by favourites and updated within 7 days, the amount of likes isn't really a good metric for quality. For example, linkffn(12936605) has 9 favourites and yet is a very great fic whereas there are countless stories with Death Eater ships with thousands of likes.

**** Yeah, sorting by favourites is only so useful-this sub is definitetly the best for finding hidden gems.
