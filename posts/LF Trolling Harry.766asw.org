What it says on the title. I'm looking for trolling Harry. Not prankster Harry or trickster kind but trolling people and generally being a pain in the ass while being too powerful for other to get rid of him. A Harry like Merlin from type-moon franchise and Zelretch as he was depicted in fanon.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.
