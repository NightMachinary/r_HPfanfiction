A friend followed some weird trains of thought and wants to tell a story that takes place inside Azkaban, following the experiences of one wizard, who may or may not have killed his wife. Exploring what it's like to be a magical inmate and having the events of canon Harry Potter affecting things like parole hearings, and, or course, the eventual destruction of the prison.

Are there any fics that delve into Azkaban as more than just a tertiary story element?


** "What is your name?"

"Sirius Orion Black."

"What are you in Azkaban for?"

"Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me."

** I would like to see this. I would also love an Azkaban story written like the tv show Oz.

** It would be great to see the inside going ons. I mean the inmates still have to be fed and I'm sure there are still different levels of secerety so just like a normal prison they probably have the inmates doing some of the work. Free labor. Perhaps with modified wands. Sirius escaped because he seen a paper with a picture of wormtail. So did they get reading material? There's definitely room to play.

I use to work at a jail and inmates were always coming up with new ways to pass messages and items with each other. I just don't see Azkaban being any different especially since the jailors can't see. The inmates could blantonly be passing things to each other as long as a wizard wasn't watching.

** I think that you don't have much room for something like "Orange Is the New Black" or similar prison intrigues because Azkaban makes even a gulag look like a holiday resort. The prisoners are all isolated and exposed to soul-sucking demons who don't speak English. Having a PoV of Azkaban would be little more than torture galore.
