I've been working a lot on background and world building for my fiction, but I've spent so much time on my main character and 1-2 off characters that I'm low on ideas for others, be it protagonists, antagonists, ists, etc.

What I need help with, if you are willing, is creating some basic character ideas. OCs welcome, but no Gary Stu or Mary Sue. I need believeable character ideas that can fit into what will initially be a character driven story.

A snippet of the background, as much as I am willing to spoil for now: It is summer 1999, just over a year after the battle for hogwarts. The battle went differently, with half of the death eaters and most dementors fleeing after the battle turned south for them shortly after Harry's Death. Many people who died in the books did not die here, or returned without explanation (for now.) The auror department has been working overtime since the battle as the remaining known death eaters have continued carrying out attacks, and the influence Voldemort had seems to have shown itself in new or formerly unknown death eaters and dark wizards popping up across the globe. The Auror departments in most countries have started to work together, both for prevention and damage control. Dementors have returned to Azkaban and any remaining prisoners have been sucked of their souls. The dementors regularly attack coastal villages and resorts as well. For lack of a better phrase, things have gone to shit. Regardless, school goes on, and at Hogwarts the damage from the battle was repaired shortly after. Harry, Ron, and Neville were made aurors immediately after the battle, and put on assignment at Hogwarts to keep it safe. The reasoning is that they know the school well enough, and the more experienced Aurors had to be put on the more dangerous assignments. The offer of becoming an Auror was also extended to all DA members contingent upon their completion of schooling, and the new 7th year DA members are allowed to serve as junior aurors under the three.

So that is a bit about where the setting is. What I'm requestion is character ideas for the following types: Ministry officials (any office) Students (1st and 2nd years.) Death eaters/dark wizards/malcontents Foreign wizards/officials

I'm looking for simple stuff, like appearance, family, what drives them, and anything else you'd like to fit in.

This is only a request, but any help is appreciated!


** Firstly: I'd like all new babies to be called Harry, as grateful parents name children after the Saviour. Harry Potter cannot handle all the Harrys.

I'd actually really like a fic where almost all wizardborn first years in PoA are called Harry. They'd be sixth and seventh years by that point wouldn't they?

I'd go find a list of names JK almost used but didn't. In addition, use the names from the sacred 28 for Death Eater names. There's lots in there we don't know much or anything about. For example, you could have an Ollivander who is angry that a half-blood (Garrick was one) is in charge of the family business.

*** While Harry is not a main character for my story, he is a plot device and side character. I'm on a similar track as your suggestion, that Harry is tired of hero worship.

** -a muggleborn first year who's obsessed with learning to defend their family and regularly asks DA members for lessons

-a pureblood child whose family is fleeing the Aurors and left them behind 'enemy lines'. Their mail is being searched and they don't know where they'll stay over the summer.

-an overwhelmed ministry employee who incessantly talks about 'the good old days' and annoys everyone around them

-a snatcher fleeing from the wife of a muggleborn who they kidnapped and got killed. She's pursuing them on her own since the Auror department is overwhelmed, the snatcher is trying to find a group of Voldemort followers to hide with.

-a ministry liaison to the prime minister trying to coordinate Auror response teams to dementor attacks on muggles while dealing with muggle counterterrorism teams and their (maybe) useful advice

-an Auror trainee who joined up after Voldemort died and is learning everything on the go

-a couple of 2nd year students with severe ptsd from their 1st year. They sleep together in hiding places throughout the school and have to be persuaded back into spending some time in their dormitories. The prefects check up on their latest hideout during their rounds.

-Slytherin students struggling to redefine their house and control/confront the students who got a taste for dark magic. At least one of the carrows protégés are run out by Christmas.

*** I really like a lot of these ideas. On the slytherin subject, while a number of them no longer attend, some who remain do struggle with the sins of their kin, as well as trying to prove they're not bad. Ambition can be good as well as bad.

I also had the idea for a cocky and snobbish gryffindor, who actively goes out of their way to lord over the slytherins that he/she is from Harry potters house and is better than everyone else.

** *Ministry of Magic Character*: A burned-out Auror who now has to mind newbies since she or he is so shit at the job. Preferably the type who drinks too much, sleeps too little, and shakes down people who should probably do stints in Azkaban. Some form of mentor, perhaps, to Harry and the others, who is supervising their "work" at Hogwarts.

(No Auror Hermione, though?)

*** Well she did return for the 98-99 year to finish her studies. I'm at least keeping that to canon. As for Auror work, I see her as more of a ministry witch involved with inter-species relations. Her desire to advocate for house elves will not have gone unseen by the other races deemed beings.

** Luna's husband (or soon to be) and Newt Scarmander as ministry employed for countermeasure against dementor?

The ministry are seeking more permanent solution against dementor threat. As the one with expertise in magizoology, he follows his own father's footsteps to gather more information and analyze the existence of dementor.

*** I'm a little uncomfortable using characters that while they are canon, I know nothing about save for their name. For all we know he could have been younger than Luna, or have taken after his grandmother rather than his grandfather.
