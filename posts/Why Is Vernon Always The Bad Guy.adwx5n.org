In basically all of the fanfiction I've read, Vernon is the bad guy. If Petunia is being nice to him, Vernon is either grudgingly accepting him, or actively attempting to force Petunia to stop being nice to Harry. This is stupid. Why?

Petunia is the one with the grudge against magic, magic has torn her sister from her, her parent's attention away, then her sister away for good.

Vernon? Vernon has grown up without knowing magic really existed, he might have grown up wishing he had magic. Vernon should favor Harry more than Petunia does in general, however, he doesn't. If the uncle in the family is nice to Harry, it's never Vernon, it's the 'better choice' that Petunia chose.

Why is it like this?


** Because Vernon has no family history with magic that might explain - never justify - his antipathy toward Harry /but is an arsehole to him regardless/. And he's clearly from a family of arseholes, his sister is the kind of person who'd insult an orphan's dead mother to said orphan's face. You'd call her a cunt, but she lacks the depth or the warmth.

** I find the relationship between Harry and Vernon to be really interesting in the books. They are very in tune with one-another, largely because abused children need to be able to read their attackers, but also, because Vernon actually notices Harry. Petunia is generally very distant with him, doesn't engage or talks past him. Vernon notices him, warns him, listens to him and engages with him. It's an awful abusive relationship, but at least they have one.

Because he actively engages with Harry, it's a bit easier to imagine him taking the interest in abusing him. Vernon also makes threats of physical violence which you could chose to interpret as serious rather than hyperbolic. I personally cannot see Vernon being at all imaginative in any abuse of Harry- that is to say, I always imagine that he's physically rough with Harry, would push, shove and would hit maybe once out of anger, but wouldn't keep pummelling or anything.

Unrelated; If you read the books, Harry's a cheeky little shit and he's not punished for it. He's punished for any magic he exhibits or implies, but not for being openly disrespectful or insulting. Vernon getting angry or shouting at him has nothing to do with anything he deliberately does or says, and there's nothing Harry can do not to get punished. I find it really funny that Snape causes the same response from Harry- once he learns that punishment has nothing to do with what he does, he starts being a cheeky little shit because he might as well.

*** ...Fuck, gotta remember that. Been working on a fic where Harry's situation has left him with no fucks to give for people who don't respect him, yet he hasn't encountered those kinds of people yet (Vernon, Petunia, Snape, Malfoy, etc.). And while I was setting him up to vent, I think I'm going to downplay that instead. I need Cheeky!Harry in my story.

  Why is it like this?
#+end_quote

As with most questions like this: because fanfiction writers don't know canon very well. They /think/ they do, because they have read the "stations of canon" again and again in lots of fics, but the items that get repeated and reinforced (often in exaggerated or twisted ways) are a tiny percentage of the totality of canon.

So very few fanfic authors will remember sections like this:

#+begin_quote
  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her --- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...

  [...]

  Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...

  Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er --- Petunia, dear --- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?”

  As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.

  “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”

  “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...”

  “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.

  “Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.”

  Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son --- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?”

  “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

  “What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?”

  “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”

  “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”
#+end_quote

Instead of remembering these parts of canon which show that the hatred of magic comes from Petunia, who feels it more strongly than Vernon, people just remember the 1000 fanfics which depict Vernon as leading the way in anti-magic hatred.

*** Yeah, but does Vernon even know about magic at this point? I think over whole course of the whole series we get way more scenes of Vernon pontificating about Harry's freakishness than Petunia. I wouldn't say people are making it up whole-cloth.

It's not so much that canon!Petunia had a better attitude towards Harry, but she was definitely more passive-agressive about it. She let Vernon be the disciplinerian most of the time. So when an author wants to write a fic where one of Harry's relatives is less terrible, I can see how Petunia would be the natural choice.

***** Or just that Petunia's relatives were part of some huge cult of weirdos. Maybe you're right, though. I'm trying to remember what we know actually happened at Petunia's wedding, and who got obliviated. Or was it Lily's wedding?

I think it's significant that Petunia's parents were probably killed not too long ago at this point, too.

In any case, Vernon and Petunia were definitely in a negative feedback loop with each other when it came to magic. Either one of them would have probably had a more tolerant attitude if they were with other people, or even by themselves.

** i like this idea:

Vernon is unpleasant but not despicable

He only knows the minimum amount about Lily and James (Petunia's sister, bad sort of people, knows they have a son because they sent a letter or something and Vernon read it)

One night that son shows up on their doorstep with a letter, explaining that his parents were murdered by the leader of some kind of Wizard terrorist group Vernon would have /no difficulty/ mentally comparing with the IRA. So his nephew's parents were assassinated by the Wizard-IRA, and while Dumbledore /assures/ Vernon there won't be retribution, Vernon would have been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bombings_during_the_Northern_Ireland_Troubles_and_peace_process][very well aware of the Troubles]] and would have had plenty of reason to doubt the boy was actually safe

oh and did I mention already they're */Wizards/*. This world probably has no tradition of skepticism, so we can contrive science and technology progressed along fine, especially with war and wealth being motivators of the 20th century, but the philosophic tradition of doubting shit never really crystallized because, yknow, magic.

Let's add to this that the boy /must/ stay with them, and all of a sudden Vernon has two kids, one he didn't want in the sense of "didn't want another kid yet" and then doesn't want in the "oh great this kid's got a target on his head" sense

Dumbledore hopes eventually he gets over it, but he doesn't

Meanwhile, Harry's treated poorly, but not /that/ poorly, he just has no comparison, so the worst experiences of his life are the worst experiences in ~6-7 years of memory. Yeah, his aunt and uncle are pretty bad, but not so bad that it was inexcusable to leave Harry with them, because like the attempt at realistic portrayals of characters here, Dumbledore could easily have kept the boy at the castle if it were that vs a truly tyrannical household.

I do get your point, though. If Vernon wasn't influenced by Petunia's attitude and didn't know there was anything different about Harry before he actually started displaying signs of magic, would his relationship with Harry be different?

And a related question: if Dudley comes out of the closet, does he get disowned?

** He isn't. I distinctly remember in linkffn(old soldiers never die) he was actually quite a nice guy...

...well, no; that's a lie, he's still pretty messed up. My headcanon will tell you that it's because a certain headmaster we know likes to cast excessive mind magic on him, and that Vernon is secretly the estranged brother of a certain pink toad we know.

He and his sister were abused in their childhood by the Umbridge's, and so now they despise all things magic as Freakish.

Now, ‘maybe' I'm taking that from a few too many fanons, but that's just what my headcanon says.

** People have a tendency to not like child abusers which is the primary reason as far as I can tell. You can find people who can make a excuses for Petunia (Who is just as bad as Vernon) which let's some stories with her being nice skate by, but Vernon has no connection to canon that really permits people to easily excuse him.
