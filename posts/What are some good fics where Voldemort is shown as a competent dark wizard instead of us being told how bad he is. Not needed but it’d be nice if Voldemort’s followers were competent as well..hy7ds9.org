#+TITLE: What are some good fics where Voldemort is shown as a competent dark wizard instead of us being told how bad he is. Not needed but it’d be nice if Voldemort’s followers were competent as well.

** Black Queen series, Denarian series, Earl of the North, Stepping Back. Also a lot of Death Eater Harry fics, like the Downward Spiral saga.

**** Indeed. But I feel it's how a DE Harry fic should be. Death Eaters are supposed to be evil and depraved, not "misunderstood" like people usually make them.

****** It will do that. I will say it is in the same Category (but inarguably not at the same level) as The Revenant. Objectively well done, but very unenjoyable. I felt gross inside after reading it. It really brings the dark and deranged home and invites it in for tea. I am glad I read it, and I am glad I finished it, but it goes on the short list I will probably never read again, and will never recommend to someone who isn't specifically looking for that kind of feeling.

** Come on in most heroic stories the bad guys can't be that competent otherwise the underdog hero can't win. I just came back inside the house a little while ago and Silverado is on. The scene is where three of the bad guys find Danny Glover's father by himself getting water. After a few bad guy insults they kill him, the next scene is Glover hearing the shot, jumping up, grabbing his gun and running down to the river. When he sees his dad across the stream he tosses his gun away and goes into the stream. So he's unarmed. Where are the bad guys. Already gone.

Now Glover's dad told the bad guys that glover went to town but why would you have believed him. If I was the bad guy I would have gone back to the hiding spots we used to surprise Glover's dad and waited 20-30 minutes to see if Glover shows up. If I had done that Glover would be unarmed and dead.

So bad guys can never be that competent.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him. (Post-canon, ignores epilogue.)
