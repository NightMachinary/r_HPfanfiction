** 'Like Hope' in what way?

Linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) is 'like hope' in that it features an Adult Harry Potter and a teenage Gabrielle Delacour and has a lot of quidditch involved.

It is not like Hope in that it does not have any soulbonds, insanely overpowered magic, or deal specifically with fluffy saccharine romance.
