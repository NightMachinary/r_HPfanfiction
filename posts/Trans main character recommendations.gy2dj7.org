I can't be the only one needing to reclaim something I love at the moment, right? Does anyone have any fic recommendations for me?

I don't read very much fanfiction of any fandom if I'm honest, but I'd like to read more work from fans of HP who don't feel seen by its creator, or are allies who chose to represent this marginalised community.

Heck, if you're not an author and have no work to share, but still feel excluded due to JKR's comments/views, I want to hear from you too.

I'm feeling mad as hell about many things at the moment, this is just one of them.

EDIT: To everyone suggesting fics, thank you. I'll be reading them all. To everyone thinking a bigoted comment from a random stranger on the internet will make me suddenly change my beliefs or whatever, MOVE ALONG.


** "the girl who lived (again)" fits your request. If you like it, every fic posted to the "boy with a scar" collection is great:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]

#+begin_quote
  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world.

  "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy.

  But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl.

  Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink.

  The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

Eileen Prince Snape is a trans man.

Summary: Lee is used to winning his Gobstones matches, and he thinks he can come out ahead in the game of life. If only things were as simple as when he first met Tobias at that pub in Cokeworth. In a perfect world, he sure as hell wouldn't be pregnant and learning his way around a Muggle kitchen, but it's 1959, and he is all bones and weary mind, weighed down by the flesh that doesn't feel like his own.

** Alchemia Dent and Bugland have two fics on their website that I looove - “Pigfeathers” and “Blaise.”

In Pigfeathers, a trans Harry hunts down fugitive Snape to help brew a sex change potion. Everyone in this fic is deeply flawed, but Harry comes out on the other side. It has a good ending.

Blaise is a darker fic, but so good. It's relatively short and plays with Mirror of Erised magic - Blaise is trans, and sees herself as a girl in the mirror. But her reflection is looking back out at her and seeing her greatest desire - to be a boy.

I'm not sure how to properly link these - I'll just leave the link for the website. After you enter in, there's a short fic list with both of these on it. [[http://www.intertexius.com/]]
