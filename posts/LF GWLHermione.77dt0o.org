Hey,

looking for a well-written WBWL!Harry fic in which Hermione is the actual child of prophecy.

Thanks in advance!


** Part 10 of the “boys with scar series” has Hermione as the GWL: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9344273][the brightest witch of her age]]. Unfortunately, the author rehashes almost EVERY canon station.

***** That reminds me. Has there ever been a story with the premise that Luna and Xenophilius are /totally right/ (not just about the token Snorkack as happens surprisingly often in fanfiction, but on /everything/?) A fic where the Rotfang Conspiracy really exists?

*** You know, Voldemort might have asked them to pull out teeth from some of his victims, without anesthetics of course. Dental Assistant Granger refused three times in a row. Voldemort waited until later to kill them, thus creating the Hermione as GWL situation.

**** Of course! Everything has sense now. And Hermione's "power he know not" is the abillity to change the shape of her teeth at will?

***** You know she did actually do that. ROTFANG CONFIRMED.

And also the line of logic I used for my own story, though Hermione isn't the Girl Who Lived.
