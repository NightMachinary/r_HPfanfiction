:END:
I'm looking for a story I read a few years ago, no idea what it was called or where it was hosted. Novel length. Set when Harry is in I think his 20s, but AU enough that it basically doesn't depend on much of anything that happened in the books beyond the very basics. Harry is kind of a spy/special forces, and Hermione works for the government too, they used to date before the story started and do end up together again during it.

The thing I remember most is that near the end Hermione becomes leader of the magical world, I think her title is Chancellor or something, but no one is allowed to know that she is, there's like Unbreakable Vow levels of secrecy around the position.

I think there was also a few scenes set in a restaurant set literally in the sky, with a name that might have been the French for "azure sky" or something similar.

Also Harry borrowing a piece of jewelry from a world-famous magical jeweler for whom he'd once done a favor for Hermione to wear when they finally are back together and get married.

Any thoughts?


** The restaurant bit rings a bell, but I can't remember the story title.

** NVM, figured it out. I was conflating two (extremely) different stories, "Contractual Invalidation" and "The Paradigm of Uncertainty"
