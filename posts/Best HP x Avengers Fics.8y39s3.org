Longer is preferable and I really like This Gonna be Good linkao3(This Gonna Be Good) so fics like that are awesome. Preferably no Infinity war only stories. Other marvel characters are also welcome! Thanks in advance!

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** My favorite HPxAvengers fic is linkffn(Child Of The Storm) and it's sequel linkffn(Ghosts of The Past).

They're really long individually, but together they're a little absurd length-wise.

Some people are turned off by how much of a multixover it is, too. It might be more accurate to just outright call it an HPxMarvel xover, but it does prominently feature the Avengers so.. /shrug/. Off the top of my head, it also has X-Men and a decent amount of Dresden Files that's mostly in a subplot. You don't at all need to understand/know Dresden Files. It's appearances are either sideplots that are well explained or minor characters. A little X-Men knowledge will be helpful, but probably not required. I usually don't like crossovers when their scope is too wide, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

It's definitely a complex story, though, and can be a bit hard to follow.

*** I so wish for this to be good, more than a million words, it would have been brilliant but sadly couldn't read past chapter 4 in which following happens

Tony Stark goes to Dursley's home in iron man suit and start looking around in the house to presumably gather evidance of Dursley's crimes against Harry

There were many similarly ridiculous moments/actions in the previous chapters as well but this was the last drop for me.

Like, why not? Would you prefer he go without the suit? I just figured it was for the extra sensors/scanners/intimidation factor.

It does go a little over the top occasionally, but it was never enough to make me stop reading. But different strokes for different folks and such.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

** Only one I can think of is Heroes Assemble by Stargon1 and its still updating.

Takes place about 10ish years after the Fall of Voldemort and loosely follows the MCU/Netflix shows and is not epilogue compliant from HP.

I don't know where exactly the story is going but its currently between Winter Solider and Age of Ultron and may be (slowly) leading to Infinity War assuming the author want to go in the direction.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.

However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

** I don't know if you're still looking but I had to rec my absolute favorite crossover (and possibly fic) ever, Mischief's Heir. Best part about it? It's 443,529 words spread out over a five fic series. One fic for each year it follows.

edit: And it's completed. That's important too.

​

Basic low spoiler sales pitch:

Summer after 1st year Harry has been locked in his room by the Dursleys and prays to Loki to come save him. Loki decides to answer the call.

​

High spoiler sales pitch:

End game is Loki adopting Harry and being genuine family to him, family that expects the best of him and encourages him to embrace being smart and clever and ambitious. When second year comes Diary Tom is restored and it turns out he wasn't all that bad of a guy. The crazy came from the Hocruxes, so Dairy Tom gets adopted too. Harry and his friends make a club and that club after some time becomes focused on making the first wizarding world space program. Things spiral from there. Loki is a nice mix of MCU and legend. Things verge on crack at several points but there is usually enough realism and "they live in a magical world" to make it okay. Lots of characters get rolls to play. The MCU (beyond Loki) plays a smaller role until later in the story when their part grows but Harry and his side of things remain the bigger focus through it all as we follow him through his school years and holidays.
