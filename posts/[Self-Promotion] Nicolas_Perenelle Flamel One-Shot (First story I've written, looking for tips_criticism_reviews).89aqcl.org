#+begin_quote
  You can always have too much of a good thing---even true love. People like to tell their lovers that they would stay with them forever if it were possible. If immortality was indeed within their grasp, would they stay true to that promise? (ONE-SHOT)

** Firstly, I liked it! It's an interesting idea and it helps to fill in/flesh out a part of canon that people often gripe about.

Now, some (hopefully) constructive criticism:

A lot of the sentences feel long. Not exactly run-on sentences, but awkwardly long, like you're putting too much info into a single thought. I noticed it the most when there were descriptions of actions or behavior after dialogue, like:

#+begin_quote
  Perenelle whispered, as if she were imparting some great secret.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Nicolas said, smiling warmly towards the only person he'd ever cared for on such a profound level.
#+end_quote

If you can break those post-dialogue descriptions in different sentences, I think the story would flow better. But that might just be my reading style.

I think you need more periods of time in the story to make the reader care about the change in the characters. [[/spoiler][We don't see any of the time between when Nicolas first gets the stone and when Perenelle commits suicide and he decides to do the same. A gradual exploration of their time together over the years, as Nicolas slowly goes crazy and Perenelle is helpless to stop it, would have made me much more sympathetic towards the two of them. As it is, there's a jarring change in personality during the time jump that made it a little hard to believe.]]

All in all though, this was well done and I hope you continue writing!

*** Yeah, I never got the highest English grades so I was worried that syntax and punctuation was going to be a problem.

Also, I kind of wanted the skip to be jarring but I suppose it ended up being jarring in a bad way.

My next story is going to be chapter based, which might be easier for me. Trying to fit all the ideas I had for this into a one-shot ended up being harder than I thought.

Thank you for your help, I'll be mindful of what you said on the next one.

**** If English isn't your strong suit you must be a genius in maths! It's really good writing.

I do agree with the length of sentences though, I think you have maybe overloaded on prose somewhat. I think the key here is to remember you can paint more of a picture with a poignant description of just one or two things than everything in the room. You will never be able to replicate exactly what you see in your readers head, so it's sometimes best to just give them the right feeling and let them fill in the blanks.
