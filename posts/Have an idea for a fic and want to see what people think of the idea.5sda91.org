Basically it's a sort of harry potter and d&d crossover using the general plotline of rise of tiamat

Harry is fascinated by dragons because of what Hagrid said in the beginning of book 1 and his interaction with Norbert

Second year he decides to write to Charlie and over the course of the year he embraces his parsletounge (spelling)? Ability because while researching dragons in the library he discovered that he could speak to dragons with this ability. Second year continues as in Canon.

Third year he leaves as normal but in the ally he received a letter saying if he wishes to learn more about dragons and his ability concerning them to arrive at the place specified

The cult meets with harry and explains they are ancient order of wizards who worship dragons as God's but they were driven to near extermination by uthar pendragon and now seek to return themselves and dragons to power . they sought harry out because he is a parsoulmouth and respects dragons

They never tried to seek out voldamort because he would just use dragons as beast and is insane

Harry agrees and must seek out the five dragon mask and the horn of dragons while the cult goes to recruit more members

Each year and book it's own quest it will still follow cannon events triwizard and voldamorts rise and so forth

And obviously I'll add in my own stuff so it's not a coppy paste from rise of tiamat

But what do you guys think of the general idea? Do you have any ideas you would want to add I'm open to suggestions!

I think it could be really cool story if done right


** Why would Harry follow a bunch of nutcases who worship dragons as gods? Being fascinated by dragons is one thing, but worshipping them? That needs to be explained really well. It might be easier to have those guys fool him into helping them by acting as if they are the good guys, instead of going "hey, we want to take over Britain/the world and rule it with dragons!"

** Dragons were weak in HP universe, and there were basically used as ingredients in magical products (wand, clothing, potion).

But you could have some Cult of Dragon members coming over from the D&D universe and becoming horrified about what was going on here.

On the other hand, Muggles were significantly more powerful in HP universe. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II][A10 Thunderbolt]] could outfly, outmaneuver, and outshoot dragons. They were the perfect dragon killers.

** Well, maybe Harry Potter dragons could be to D&D dragons, as humans are to apes?...Well, I mean 'looks very similar, but massive difference in intellect', but I guess apes are too intelligent for that.

This could tie in with the bit of your idea that Uther Pendragon attempted to exterminate dragonkind; he could have nearly wiped out the intelligent ones while domesticating the unintelligent megamidae ('mega agamid', get it?). Are you perhaps thinking of a Merlin crossover?

I probably wouldn't have them worshiping the dragons themselves, mind. Maybe they'd see the dragons as servants of gods, though.

Maybe it could be like a druidic thing, with wise-dragons being seen as guardians of nature and protectors of the world's ecosystems and whatnot. Maybe centaurs, goblins, and other magical creatures could be part of the cult, or get along with them.
