** The story you're looking for might be *Broken*. linkffn(4172243)

Also check out this [[http://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/post/45498565388/tags-pregnancychildren][link]] to see some stories featuring Pregnancy/Children for Draco/Hermione.

One of my favorite child stories with those two is *Aurelian*. linkffn(6590337)

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.

** Hey, about your fic, sorry i have no idea. I just wanted to say that for others that are interested in the fic and haven't read it, it would be really nice if you spoiler tagged the part about the end.

*** I've read the fic but can't recall the name. However, I'm 99% sure that you find out Harry is the father veryyy early on. The reader knows, but the characters don't!

** In the story, does Hermione have twin children who reveal themselves to Harry after the end of his professional quidditch match? That's the story coming to mind, but I'm forgetting the name of the story.
