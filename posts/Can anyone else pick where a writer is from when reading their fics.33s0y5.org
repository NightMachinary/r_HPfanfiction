I dunno, I just always seem to be able to pick the Aussies out before reading their profile. I'm Australian and it might be me picking up random references, I'm not sure? And I can always pick out Americans even if they are using UK English, there just seems to be references or phrases they use that makes it immediately stand out as an American. And I can pretty much always tell if English isn't the writers first language.

Was just wondering if anyone else does this as well?


** Just fyi, if someone is using UK English but are not from the UK or Australia, they are most likely Canadian. We still include "u"s in many words, like colour and favourite, and we also tend to write with "s" instead of "z" for words like analyse. Canadians do have similar phrases like Americans, given that our media is intertwined, but we do tend to use UK English as opposed to American English for spelling. So, if you see an author using North American slang/terms, but UK English, it's most likely us maple syrup loving, moose riding, igloo building, and hockey playing Canadians.

As for your question, I can always point out an American the second I see "huh" or terms that even us Canadians consider American. That, or a horribly misplaced "eh". British authors stick out, too, because their terms and spelling remind me very much of JK's without sounding forced or awkward. It flows naturally.

Non-native English speakers do sometimes stick out, primarily on grammar and verb issues. Simple mistakes that I see my francophone friends make whenever they speak/write in English. It's quite cute, actually, and I always applaud their effort, because it's not always easy.

I believe that's it...

*** They might be Americans trying to use UK because of the source material as well.

Which I guess makes sense, because as long as you're having characters say "pram" and "toss it in the bin," you might as well just write in British English

**** It's very possible, but I see the American spelling way too often, even when they use British slang or terms. If you've written colour as "color" for your whole life, you tend to automatically write it that way. They will also use the American metric system, too, which is simply because they are familiar with it.

That's why I said that it was most likely a Canadian, especially since Canadians use UK English naturally compared to Americans, who don't.

*** Just checked some of my current and old writing for this. Within 2 paragraphs you can tell I am Canadian.

You think you can. How do you know that some people aren't so good that you don't realize English isn't their first language?

** Absolutely.

Each country uses different lingo, and a lot of that seeps through into their writing.

I'm Australian too, and I will always notice when someone is American if they use American terms. There was one fanfic that I read a while ago where Hermione put a /diaper/ on her baby then placed the baby in the /crib/.

They also spell words differently, like colo*u*r and color. The British version is the former, which is what I'm familiar with, but Americans will always drop the /u/.

I won't usually notice differences between Australian and British writers because like I alluded to, we spell things the same way and use the same terms. I think that the /only/ time I picked it up was when Harry spread /Vegemite/ on his toast, as opposed to /Marmite/.

** If they use any Pittsburghese, yes, immediately.

** I'm not, but English is not my native language. (It's my fault because I don't really pay any attention to it either.)
