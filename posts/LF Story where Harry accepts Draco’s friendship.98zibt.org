** Linkffn(oh god not again!) is easily my favorite harry/Draco friendship. They have such a weird yet believable relationship (I'm screwing up you're life, but it's mostly out of boredom and without any malice).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** There is for example They Shook Hands ( linkffn(7659033) ) with this premise, which has sequels up to the 6th year by now, though I haven't read it past the third I'm afraid. It didn't look like Slash though and I think I did like it back when I read it.

If you like a more humorous story I can also recommend On a Train, Switching Tracks ( linkffn(4810036) ) which does have Harry and Draco becoming friends in a way, though I'm afraid it has been discontinued.

Other than that I do have some more stories with them being kinda friends, or at least not antagonists during the train ride (e.g. Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven ( linkffn(11496914) ) which is even completed, including all sequels) but it's rare to find non slash fics focussing on the two of them as friends only.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.
