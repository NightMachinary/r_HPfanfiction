Not by them not doing it. But it being something that all Wizarding family's do A bit like a Magical enforced version of the Guest right from Game Of Thrones?.

Maybe it was Created to stop the Problem of Muggleborns Betraying the Wizarding world. like maybe the potion was first Created by one of the Hogwarts founders to stop the problem of Muggleborns who were accepting there place at Hogwarts only so they could give Hogwarts location to the magic Hating muggles.


** Wait, you want a fic where an entire society is using rape drugs because they don't want people to leave. That sounds like a sick cult.

*** I assume you are talking about love potions?

I was more talking about a mild Loyalty potion not the Omnipotent ones harry is normally give in bashing story's.

****** Lets put it this way, that sort of potion would be Hitler's/Stalin's wet dream. I don't think you realise how fucked up such a thing would be. I am definitely not interested in a story where that kind of behaviour is alright "because everyone is doing it since a thousand years".

I would only ever read a fic with that kind of society if the story would put a permanent end to that kind of system and harshly punish everyone involved. Meaning everyone involved (all purebloods, including the "light" side) get at least twenty years in a magical Gulag/Azkaban.

******* I know how fuck up the world would be as you put it.that doesn't stop me from wanting to read about such a world

and Good luck to any outsider trying to change it after all residents of the magical world would be effected by the Potion from age 11 at the oldest when they start school. and any muggle that tries to change it would just get obliviated

which i guess would be an interesting one-shot about some Muggle who keeps finding about about what the Wizarding world does and being obliviate over and over again till the continuous obviation destroys there mind. and most of the wizarding world wouldn't care even if they found out after all it was just a muggle that was poking there nose in were it wasn't welcome

Hows that for a distopian Wizarding world?

******** I'm not a fan of a dystopia when nothing changes. Harry seems to resist the mind magics quite well. If he can shrug off Voldemort's imperius then I doubt a mere potion would do the trick.

I'd read the story if Harry fought the system French revolution style, or even followed in the footsteps of the Mossad. But not if the fic merely shows how fucked up the magical society is.

********* I'm not a fan of a dystopia either

Any way I don't think it would be something that could be done on a large scale the way that your mind went to. The WIzarding world would not have enough Ingredient to do it on a mass scale and even Voldemort would probably only dose his inner Circle. if he used it at all after all the potion would make the death eaters loyal to Voldemort but would also make him loyal to them.(edit Voldemort wouldn't touch the potion with a ten-foot pole he would see being Loyalty to his followers as a weakness)

I was more thinking of it as something that say the Wizarding Community of Ottery St Catchpole (about five family's) Get together for a Yearly get together were they brew the Potion and them each person adds a hair to it ( likepolyjuice potion) and then mixing it into the food that is eaten at the event. with it acting more like a Year long Reputation gains Booster with anyone else who added DNA. with the more people who add DNA the Weaker and more Spread out the potions effect would be.

The individual Family's might use a Second Potion that only has to be redone When a new child is born.

or maybe a couple when they get Married

With the potion having a Temporary effect and greatly reduced effect on anyone that didn't also add there DNA
