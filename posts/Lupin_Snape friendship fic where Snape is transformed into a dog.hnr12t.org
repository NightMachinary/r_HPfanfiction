:END:
Hey guys, I'm looking for a fic where Lupin and Snape have an established friendship (from a prior story.) Lupin becomes worried about Snape now that the war has ended and realizes he's going to commit suicide. With the help of Hermione and a magic spyglass / mirror/ something? they catch him before he can apostate into a mountain. Dumbledore transforms him into a dog so that he can heal mentally. Harry doesn't realize who the dog is (at first) and by the end they've bonded.

You'd think I could find this with this amount of detail but I'm struggling!
