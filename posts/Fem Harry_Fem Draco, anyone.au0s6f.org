I'm feeling weird...


** Look for Backsplash by GatewayGirl on Ao3 - quite a bit of gender-flip follies due to a potion called the Tiresias Draught

** Linkao3(791048) For the sake of a name is complete, although I didn't finish it, but should scratch that itch. Draco starts off male, which might put you off.

Linkao3(11518236) The changing lights is also a genderswap story, and Draco continues to use the male pronoun. The characterisation is better in this fic, though it's unfinished. It also seems to be heading towards Draco becoming a man once again, but Harry is supposedly demisexual and won't mind.

Both have elicit scenes.

I started Linkffn(6863983) Harry Potter: the Serpent Lord but couldn't get over the name /Draconica/ but I remember it being otherwise compitent

  Draco has an accident which costs him everything he knows, completely changing his life; is it possible that it is changed for the better?

  Harry returns for an eighth year following the end of the war and soon realizes that although he's put his own animosity towards Malfoy aside, no one else seems to have done the same. When a hex leaves his oldest rival in the body of a female and ridicule doubles, Harry discovers that his hero complex is a difficult thing to fight.
