I was reading another one of those ridiculous blood-purity dystopias, whereas an idea struck me...\\
Muggleborns are actually more pure than wizardborns.\\
*The less traceable magic blood in your bloodline*, the purer your magic is, since there is no where for it come from other than magic itself.\\
Now if you swap this with the default blood-purity, the 'fresher' your bloodline is, the closer you are to source of magic!\\
This idea can fit nicely into either muggleborn-ruled AU dystopias, or more 'canon' compliant rebellions.\\
Any fics that play with this idea?


** Kinda very similar to the historical situation in canon, really:

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin's discrimination on the basis of parentage was considered an unusual and misguided view by the majority of wizards at the time. Contemporary literature suggests that Muggle-borns were not only accepted, but often considered to be particularly gifted. They went by the affectionate name of ‘Magbobs' (there has been much debate about the origin of the term, but it seems most likely to be that in such a case, magic ‘bobbed up' out of nowhere).

  Magical opinion underwent something of a shift after the International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.*

  Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles. Increasing numbers of wizards now preached that marriage with a Muggle did not merely risk a possible breach of the new Statute, but that it was shameful, unnatural and would lead to ‘contamination' of magical blood.**

The idea that pure-blood ideology was a historical majority/popular view is mostly a fanon thing. In canon I think it was clear JKR was going for a Hitler analogy, and Hitler was a radical, not a traditionalist.

  following persecution by Muggles
#+end_quote

You know, there's actually something screwy about that.

By 1692, /only Protestants/ believed in witchcraft enough to have wide-scale witch-hunts. The /Spanish Inquisition/ of all groups believed people claiming to be witches needed /help/, not burning at the stake.

Which means that the "persecution" of the magical community was limited to, like, four major European nations: Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Prussia.

But this caused the /International/ Statute of Secrecy.

Of course out-of-universe it's because JKR's world falls apart really fast when you start actually thinking about it because it was never meant to stand up to scrutiny.

But in-universe, I'd like to find a fic that tackles the question of how the fuck at most four major European nations managed to convince the literal planet that a problem only they had was actually universal, and dire enough for drastic action to be /required/ for everyone's continued survival.

**** My theory is a Dark Wizard who was particularly charismatic created the entire crisis to further their political ambitions and cherry picked a few incidents to support their claims.

As you note, the Inquisitions weren't witch hunts. IRL magic was actually relatively acceptable as long as you didn't hurt anyone, and Alchemists were often given positions of power (see Isaac Newton and his competitors). The few witchhunts that really did occur followed disease outbreaks.

But people are easy to panic and scare, and even in Harry Potter's time wizards are very easily swayed by fear and whatever the Daily Prophet prints. So yeah. I think the wizards got bamboozled into cutting themselves off.

***** It's pretty easy to start pointing fingers whenever a new plague crops up (hell, look at all the Covid conspiracies that persist), so one Rita Skeeter type individual be like: "look at all these muggles living in filth, spreading disease!" and over time that leads to hostility and eventually a perception that muggles are little better than cattle. Some of the older wizarding families probably have portraits that can tell you of a time where muggles would dump their trash and feces all over the streets, people lived with animals, muggles ventured out in brutal conquests killing untold numbers of their brethren, plagues, dysentery, cholera, and all other manner of diseases wiped out tens of thousands of muggles, etc.

It's painted as muggle witch hunting being the reason for the Statute, but it makes far more sense for Wizarding World biases being the impetus for the Statute. This same sentiment crops up when Grindelwald sees how destructive muggles have become and argues that the future survival of the magical world is to stop muggle progress.

Even Aurthur Weasley, who is vehemently pro-muggle rights, views non-magical people and culture the same way we study apes and dolphins in the wild.

Basically: The Statute doesn't protect wizards or even muggles as much as it protects the blood-purist point of view and insulates wizarding society.

**** To be fair, witch hunts started in imperial China where magic was banned around 600 ad, and still happens in modern day, such as in 2015 radicals from Islam(ISIS) beheading two couples for using 'magical medicine' in Levant, similar things happening to street magicians in Syria, Iraq and Libya. So the International Statue of Secrecy happened after a thousand years of hunts.

Also no, it was not just Protestants, though they were the main christian sect still doing it, multiple other religions and governments were still killing 'magic users' in the 1600's in countries like China, India(Early 1700's), Nepal, as well as in the Middle East, Africa and various islands of Oceana.

***** Even is far back as the Greeks in the 5th or 6th century BCE mention "magi" in an unfavorable light, also as a description for people practicing strange customs and religions (and wearing funny clothes) around the various Mediterranean states.

#+begin_quote
  As early as the 5th century BCE, Greek magos had spawned mageia and magike to describe the activity of a magus, that is, it was his or her art and practice. But almost from the outset the noun for the action and the noun for the actor parted company. Thereafter, mageia was used not for what actual magi did, but for something related to the word 'magic' in the modern sense, i.e. using supernatural means to achieve an effect in the natural world, or the appearance of achieving these effects through trickery or sleight of hand. The early Greek texts typically have the pejorative meaning, which in turn influenced the meaning of magos to denote a conjurer and a charlatan. Already in the mid-5th century BC, Herodotus identifies the magi as interpreters of omens and dreams (Histories 7.19, 7.37, 1.107, 1.108, 1.120, 1.128).

****** Indeed, there were also laws in Egypt and the Babylonian empire about illegal magic in 18th century bce (Code of Hammurabi), however, with such old sources we have no proof that they outright hunted said 'magi' simply for being 'magi', such things only spoke of them in unfavourable light, and the laws only spoke of if they should cast magic on another without cause they should be punished, so there is no solid evidence that they were outright hunted.

For this reason I went with imperial China, as with the laws passing for the total ban on magic there were multiple documented witch trials and documentation of hunts to find said criminals.

**** Because as of 1692, Britain and its colonies covered most of the fucking globe, and while the magical communities may not have all fallen under the sway of the limeys, the muggles doing so would have been enough a concern to join in on going into hiding. In real life reasons, it's because JKR has the world history education of an average public high school/equivalent student, and it fucking shows when it comes to the HP world's international community, especially in regards to British relations to various areas- like Ireland, for example. Or, you know, how the only other mentioned wizard of schools exist as jobbers for Hogwarts.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.
