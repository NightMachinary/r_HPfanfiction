I'm feeling like reading something new but with a Quidditch twist, preferably completed stories but incomplete/abandoned with decent length (40k+ words) works too. I've read A Game of Style and Brutality and Vitam Paramus; as well as Hope, Letters, the Firebird Trilogy, and Knowledge is Power which have long quidditch arcs even if they are not quite the focus of the story. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. It's quite hard to find newer stories with quality writing and plot that also follow my tastes.

No slash please.


** This is an old one, I honestly don't remember anything about it except it's a Quidditch centric story. linkffn(1534065)
