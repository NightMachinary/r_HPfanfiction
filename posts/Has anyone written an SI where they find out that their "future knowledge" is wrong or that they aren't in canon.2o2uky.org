Like, SI character is all prepped and ready to deal with canon's plotline... and then arrives at Hogwarts to find out that Draco's a girl, or Quirrel isn't the DADA professor, or they go up to the RoR and find a cup instead of the Diadem.

it just occurred to me that a botched time travel fic could also read like this...

**** Which in itself is a rather loose term.

Originally it referred to your garden variety Mary Sues whom arguably poor authors would plug in as some kind of reinvented version of themselves into the universe in question.

After a while, things started getting more and more sophisticated, where you could hardly tell the difference between an SI and merely an OC, except oftentimes they would have some critical advantage (future knowledge, etc.) that a character true to form would not be able to.

***** I think of a SI as a story request as only applying where it is literally the case - the character is from the real world and somehow ends up in the story. Granted, I've only read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][one which applies]], which all the reviews I've read state being suprised as to liking it. (Doesn't particularly apply to OP, btw, although it is largely well written).

I believe SI when not meant as such is generally used as a disparaging term for a OC, as you outlined.

****** Consider a story like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors][Vapors]].

The main character, Aiko, is clearly an SI OC. Twin sister to Naruto, she is reborn in this world with knowledge of the anime and a largely developed adult psyche.

And that's all there is to it. Most of her old personality is purged through time. She remembers little enough of her old life, and the various technologies and concepts of her old world are mostly ignored as benefits except for certain ways of thinking - the application of the scientific method being notable.

Of course, SI as a term is not disparaging. Neither was negro, once. It's simply how many of its kind turned out to be, as a natural consequence of the demographic of authors inclined to write SI fiction.

** You know, it does occur to me that there's a lot less SI OC Harry Potter stories than there are of, say, Naruto.

I wonder why that is?

*** given that the closest I've come to Non-HP is crossover fics I couldn't say for sure... but I wonder if some of it is that Harry isn't the kind of person whose life we'd want to experience personally? Like, outside of fanon, theres no established means of avoiding the fact that the hero of our story needs to die... And we have no guarantee that we can mimic the events that led to Harry managing to have death itself not stick.

** I think the only SI I've encountered was a Mary-Sue that I wrote myself in 7th grade, at least for HP. For fics of IRL bands and for TV shows, I've seen a lot more.

Does anybody actually like to read those?

*** One that springs to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]]. I saw it recommend on the sub some time ago, but I'm not sure if I'd repeat the recommendation. The main character is quite the Mary Sue who wants to pursue a romantic relationship with 14-year old Hermione, while he himself is implied to be 18+ (he's in a 14-year old body though), and flirts with every girl he comes across including the 12-year old Astoria Greengrass.

On top of that the pay-off is extremely weak imo. The whole story builds up to his big secret coming out, but the big secret is apparently not that he's in what he believed to be a fictional universe, but just his future knowledge, which was extremely disappointing to me as the former coming out seemed extremely interesting to me if handled well.

**** Curse of Truth is the kind of story you read when you want something funny rather than something immersive and serious... save the rec for a rainy day when you've just finished something depressing and then go find the Omake where Luna and ?Bud? mock Lucius and Draco's obsession with their hair.

Alternatively go read anything the sorting hat says in The Lie I've Lived

***** I think I'd like to do that, but Curse tried to be emotional too and the imo creepy relationship between Bud/William and all the girls just makes it very off-putting for me. I'd rather read something like Lie, a Black Comedy, Bungle in the Jungle, Oh God, Not Again! or All The Dementors of Azkaban.
