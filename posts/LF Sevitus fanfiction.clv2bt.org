I remember I read this fanfiction set in the early Hogwarts years of the series where Severus Snape is actually a pureblood ( I believe this fic is pretty old and that was written before HPDH) and had a relationship with Lily in school. She got pregnant and had to use some potion to stop the devolpment of the pregnancy. Harry finds out and tells Snape. I can't find it anymore as at the time I had no accounts on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. Has someone read it and remembers the title?

  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. LGBT characters. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. More notes inside.
