So... I'm searching fanfiction where somebody of our world, who has read the books (or seen the movies), is send into the HP world or someone just receives a hogwarts letter, who already read the books.

I only found "Reincarnation at its Finest" by SheMaurader, although it's not the thing I'm really looking for :/

I would appreciate if the Fiction was finished, but it isn't required :)

Thanks for the help


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth]["A Curse Of Truth" by Butalearner]] has an avid fanfic reader dropped into Hogwarts as an exchange student at the start of the 1994-95 school year (Goblet of Fire). Pretty entertaining, and complete.

There's also a sequel for Percy Jackson fans, but not having read that series I'm afraid I couldn't get into it.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** I remember reading an awesome story about girl dying and being reborn as Ginny's twin sister. I remember it being well written and the world building and characters were superb. It think it was called linkao3(Rose Petal Red)? I don't think the author finished the story yet, I still receive updates via email. The story starts at the moment of death and then continues from her birth into Weasley's family.

I don't quite know in what ways isekai is different from self-inserts, but in this story character knows they have landed in HP world.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

** You're looking for a Self Insert or SI fic, just searching for the term should help you find a lot. I cant really recommend any one of them though, since I think they are all bad.

***** I thought The Butterfly Effect (short PreRiddle-Era, protag is named Mariposa Gaunt, if that rings bells) was decent. I think there used to be one by Tozette (The Faith and the Devil), which focused on bread. It was a hoot, despite having rather convulted reason for the actual self-insertion. Can't find it on Tozettes profile anymore, so i guess its deleted.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.
