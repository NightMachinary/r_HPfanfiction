So I was reading emperor by marquis Black and i licked the style of the written but was a bit put off by how magic was implemented in a domestic policy.

Do any of you guys know book( so not a hp fanfic) that are similar but do not have magic implemented.

I know this is not exactly the principal focus of the subreddit but i really don't know where to ask. If any of you know where this should be asked please mention it.

Thanks

I'm not really sure what you're trying to say here.
