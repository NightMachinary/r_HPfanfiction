I'm writing a fanfic, where Remus is one of the main characters and I would like some other opinions on his characterization.

Fic summary : It is a story about the reprocussuons from Sirius' escape from Azkaban, told from the perspective of three people that have close connections to him, whether they want to or not. As far as Murphy Black is concerned, her father is innocent and she wants justice. Murphy's mother Allison is on the other hand caught in the political game at the Ministry and Remus Lupin's past boils up to the surface to haunt him.

Other than my two MCs, its going to be fairly canon compliant, at least I aim to keep the canon characters that way (albeit my interpretation); Sirius escapes the same way, Remus works at Hogwarts and very similar things play out in the Shrieking shack. Why I'm drawn to this idea is the fact that I want to explore how people close to Sirius are affected by his escape, for instance how a daughter that fully believes he is innocent would handle him breaking into Hogwarts, etc.

I feel pretty on track with the character arcs of my OCs, but I feel like I'm butting my head against a wall with Remus. I'm completely stuck in portraying him sitting in his office, hating and blaming himself for stuff, and he never wants to do anything. I have identified one motivation for him is to feel like he is loved and belongs somewhere, but that is constantly conflicting with his self loath, resulting in him never taking action. I think I'm coloured by the fact that he never got out of his way to be present in Harry's life as "uncle Moony" in canon (feeling forever robbed of this by JKR). My Remus has tremendous respect for Dumbledore, who let him be a student at Hogwarts and teach, despite his lycantrophy. He believes Sirius is guilty, but deep down he still loves him, as he is the only living person he has ever felt was his family, and genuinely wishes Sirius is innocent.

Sorry for long rant. Does anyone have any thoughts they would like to share?


** I think it's hard to insert a canon Remus Lupin into a fic that has the OCs you've described.

Part of what's going on with Remus in POA is that he is the ONLY person left alive who was an emotional intimate of Sirius. That's no longer the case where Sirius had a child and a significant other. Sirius being thrown in Azkaban, and then escaping from Azkaban, isn't quite as isolating for Remus when it affects other people as strongly as it does him. (Does he not know about your OCs? Did Allison hate him and refuse to make him part of Murphy's life as someone who was close to her father? What does Murphy know that allows her to believe Sirius is innocent when literally no one in canon did... and why hasn't she told Remus? If she has told Remus, and he refuses to entertain the idea, he's a different person than the person he was in canon.)

But then, I also think that the complaints about Remus not being present for Harry are overblown. The Dursleys didn't want Harry to be in contact with the magical world. Dumbledore didn't want Harry to be in contact with the magical world. That's A LOT for an impoverished, chronically ill, socially stigmatized man to fight-- it's not as simple as "he could if only he would." Or if we're talking about after POA, he admits in HBP that he knew Harry would have expected him to write but he didn't because he was undercover and literally could not. And they proceed to have fairly emotionally intimate conversations in both that book and the next.

As for what the canonical character wants: To be liked. Acceptance. Friendship. Assurances that he won't hurt the people he loves. A world free of Voldemort.

*** First off, thank you for your thoughtful comment!

I agree here. And I'm actually keeping it that way, in Remus' POV. Remus is isolated and alone because he and Allison had a fallout shortly after the death of James and Lily, and has since then not been part of neither Allison's or Murphy's life. Allison was furious with him (in that moment) because he was believing Sirius did it. Allison was in shock and initially didn't want to believe it - had Remus contacted Allison some time after, she would forgive him, but he never did.

Murphy only thinks Sirius is innocent, she doesn't know anything, really. She is just a child with strong integrity, who really wants to have her father back. And this spurs an internal conflict when he is breaking into Hogwarts and actually do things that appear incriminating.

Allison has not talked a lot about Sirius with, but she has mentioned stuff like he loved his daughter very much etc. Kind of like how I imagine a parent talking about the other parent who has died. I mean, Sirius was pretty much dead, no one expected him to escape.

Yes, your points here are super valid, and I agree. I definitely don't expect him to actually try to make contact before PoA, on that I 100% agree. I was mainly referring to him not having contact with Harry per owl during GoF, Sirius kept in touch while being on the run. I imagine Remus would be as worried as Sirius during the tournament. It was a while since I read HBP, but was he really undercover during GoF?

On point here as well. Your comment has helped me to start to formulate an arc for him to actually try to reconnect with Allison and Murphy, it feels like a good step.

** I'd say, don't forget that Remus was once a Marauder. Sure, he was "the most serious one", but "the most serious" /of Hogwarts's most notorious band of pranksters in a century/ doesn't go very far.

While not as pun-a-minute as Sirius in his prime, Remus should have a miles-long mischievous streak bubbling below the surface, ready to come out. He can't stop himself from thinking of jokes and pranks about various situations (then immediately feels guilty about it, of course... most of the time), and when it isn't Dumbledore, would quite like to knock authority down a peg with a whoopie-cushion if at all achievable. I could see him trying to arrange for various unpleasant incident to befall Umbridge and other anti-werewolf legislators, but then acting all prim and proper when he "hears" about it, for example.

But yes, this is all rationalization and fanon, and the Problem Of Remus Being A Wet Rag is a well-documented ailment of fanfic-writing.

(By the way, if you're writing a fic involving politics, then I beseech you, /please/, for once, give us a fic about that which remembers that Lucius isn't on the Wizengamot, he's just a meddling businessman who tries to interfere with due process but doesn't actually hold any office.)

While I do understand your point, I'm not sure I agree. I don't think he was ever on the front line into any prank, he was just happy to tag along and have /friends/. Of course, he would have picked up some ideas he could throw out there, but I honestly don't see him as a prankster.

I feel this part is one of the hardest parts, I know little about this. Do you have any good fic recs on the politic topic? I have read some of A Marauders Plan (or whatever it's called), where it is a lot of focus on Wizengamot och Lords of Houses. I'm not going down this route, my still very loose idea is revolving around Allison (employee of Department of Magical Transportation at the Ministry), and how she might be used as a political pawn. Lucius will at least try to force Fudge's hand/manipulate him into doing that. I mean, it would look good if Fudge could imprison someone for assisting in Sirius' escape, wouldn't it?

**** Glad you're not going with the fanonical Lords! We see way too much of those. And yeah, sadly, as a result, I don't have many good examples to link you to. But all this sounds good. Possible bit of advice: considers how much power the Department Heads likely have. If they're not automatically Wizengamot members (and I think that would make sense), then at least they must have sufficient influence (over their employees' votes, say) to seriously influence the goings-on. So whoever the head of the Department of Magical Transportation is, they're someone whose company your Allison should be documenting diligently.

** He always seemed like a bit of a coward to me. Scared about Tonks liking him, scared that post-marital sex resulted in a child and needed a teenager to beat some sense into him before he'd go back, didn't demand to know where his best friend's kid was, didn't do /anything/ to curb his friend's bullying behaviour while a prefect, etc. Hell, you could argue that going to the Battle of Hogwarts with an infant at home was also cowardice/escapism: he'd rather face a battle than his actual life and the choices he made.

They say, in canon, that Pettigrew mostly just went with the flow. Well, imo, Lupin was just along for the ride also.

He never got an arc that fixed any of that stuff, and that might be a place to start if he's a main character: his death just seemed so /pointless/, and beyond the knowledge that it made Teddy an orphan, my ability to give a crap was hovering around zero when the author revealed his death.
