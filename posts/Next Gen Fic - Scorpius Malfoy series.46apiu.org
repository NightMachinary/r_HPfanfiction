** A next-gen series that I haven't read already?

Which isn't meaningless trashy romance, abandoned, or shit?

Wow, thanks. Just started, and it seems a little bit cheesy, angsty and not particularly amazingly written. I'll go through a few more chapters. I assume it improves, since this sub usually has excellent taste.

*** There will be 8 books. I'm currently on 7. I've got withdrawal symptoms as the author will post the chapter soon. What you'll like is how close they've stuck to the Canon. It takes time getting into it but once you do, you'll love the characters as it makes you question there morals with the concept of White, Grey & Black.

That's one of the things I love about it, how close it's stuck to the canon with little references to things gone by.

So in summary, it has an awesome, well laid out story that has many layers to it, this coupled with references from the past makes for interesting reading. There sentence structure, punctuation is off at times, but that's not a problem as it's probably a foreigner. The main thing is the story is quality. I love it. This story has become head cannon for me now. It explores so many themes, some of which are quite extreme as you'll find out as you go along in the story.

Please, please read it. My description of it doesn't do it justice!

** I may not agree with all the decisions of the author but it still is a very good story. On quality alone it's one of the best out there.
