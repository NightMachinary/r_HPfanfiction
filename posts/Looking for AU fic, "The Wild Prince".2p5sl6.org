I'm looking for a HP fic I read years ago, that is an AU right from the beginning, because Harry does not defeat Voldemort as a baby, does not lose his parents until later, and never goes to live with the Dursleys. Unfortunately, I can only remember a few things about it and the title being "The Wild Prince". ( ?) around the parts I only vaguely remember.

Here's what I know:

- WIP / never finished
- Harry lives in hiding with Lily & James
- Learns how to be animagus (white buck/deer) at a young age
- Voldemort sends DE's to befriend Harry, so he will turn out dark (and not be the prophecy child?)
- Harry is learning magic from Lucius Malfoy in secret, trusts him.
- One Halloween Voldemort attacks, Lily does blood magic to protect child-Harry (9 years old?), who escapes (into the woods?)
- Harry goes to Hogwarts (a few years late, having lived as a wild-child in the woods?)
- International wizarding tournament (like Tri-wizard tournament) held at Hogwarts with 100+ students from around the world
- First Task is magical plague/illness, Harry & new international friends make a cure when nearly everyone else falls ill. Students who were ill/unable to figure it out either failed out of tournament or not awarded points.

I've searched endlessly on a variety of sites, but can't seem to find it. As far as I remember, there was never any slash or romance, but unfortunately, I can't even remember who Harry befriends at Hogwarts... Please let me know if this sounds familiar to you. Thanks!
