I know that a lot of writers are there for wish fulfillment. I know a lot of them aren't professionals. I know a lot of these are made for fun and not meant to be thought of past that point. I know that they do it for free and I don't have to read if I don't want to.

But some fanfics are just so very, very, very terrible. After I get past the fact that Harry is powered up. Or that it's my favorite pairing. Or that the people I dislike get bashed. Or that everyone is happy. It doesn't change the fact that, when I really look at what I'm reading, it's clearly written by someone who is writing a story to force their opinion on to the reader.

So many of the most widely reviewed and popular stories are like this. Sometimes, you have to ask ourselves. "If it weren't for the fact that I am already emotionally invested on these characters, would I really read past the first chapter of this work?"

I'm not saying that you should stop liking what you like. I'm not going to force anyone's opinion to change. But you might find out something about your favorite fiction if you re-read some stories and judge for yourself. Would you like the person being written about if it weren't for the fact that we have the assumption of him being Harry Potter just because the writer named him so and used material from the books?

** Authors have "an agenda" to push. That seems to be a main point of literature itself, beyond providing short term amusement. With a less menacing terminology, it might also be described as "the message" of a story.

This is true for original fiction as well. /Animal Farm/ has an agenda. /The Aeneid/ has an agenda. /The Chronicles of Narnia/ has an agenda. /Wide Sargasso Sea/ has an agenda.

Note, that two of the four above named works are traditionally not called "fanfiction", yet they still contain pre-existing settings and characters. The focus on expecting "original" franchise-building is entirely the product of modern, ultra-commercialized pop culure.

So yes, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ has an agenda, and /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ has an agenda, and /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ has an agenda, whatever, they fit right into the picture.

That many of them are doing it terribly, has more to do with the fact that we are talking about a format where millions of random people are uploading texts to the same archives, than with the inherent nature of fanfiction. Your problem is either with reading too much random crap (and feeling obliged to read the daily newest uploads after running out of the most recommended classics), or with not reading enough (and being utterly unskilled at filtering them by popularity and quality).

While filters can help narrow your search to features you tend to enjoy, there really is no way to search for quality other than trial and error. Popularity is absolutely no guarantee of quality and vice versa. You kind of have to wade through the random crap to find the stuff that's worth reading. For me the important thing has been to learn when to just /stop reading/ because the fic isn't worth my time. I often used to feel like I needed to finish a fic once I'd put in a certain amount of reading.

**** By filtering, I also refer to the intuitive reliance on word of mouth, and recommendations, not just the technical filters.

You also occasionally watch bad movies or read bad novels, but most people still have enough experience with being an informed audience member, not to blindly wander into the first bookstore and buy the first book their arm reaches.

With fanfic, they seem to lack most of that, and judge the format by it's /average/ rather than by it's top.

***** Eh, I would argue that that's unreliable as well unless you're getting recommendations from someone you know has the same taste/standards as you. There are a lot of fics that are incredibly popular that I consider utter dreck.

****** Exactly. OP's some should be most. 685k fics on FF.net and I'm struggling to find 1000 that I can muddle through.

***** The dead tree book publication process is a much more rigorous filter than the ability to post your work to fanfiction.net. The average published book is much better than the average written book of original fiction. The average written work of fan fiction is probably equivalent in quality to the average work of fan fiction on fanfiction.net.

** If I'm reading you correctly, you want the narrator's voice to be a neutral one, and any biases in the work to be shown through events and characters' voices. If it's trying to convince you that Snape's a bastard, it will show you that Snape's a bastard.

But it would be a crappy story if it just went through Snape being bastardly to everyone, so you want the main point of the story to be being a good story. You don't want to be beaten over the head with the idea.

Is that accurate?

** I see what you mean, but isn't that the whole point of a fanfiction? The author tells the story his/her way. I dont think that most authors write for the audience as such, many just write to have a creative outlet or because they simply enjoy it. Thats why theres such a wide variety around. Some people hate Ron whilst others love him. Is it wrong of the author to force his opinion down your throat? Well no not really since the author is the one who seed blood, sweat and tears bringing that fanfic alive.

*** I'm not saying that they don't have the right to do that. I just wish ~I~ had some magic powers to tell whether a story is told from a more or less neutral point of view rather than one that has an agenda to push.
