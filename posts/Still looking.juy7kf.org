:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I need help finding a specific fanfiction. The main thing I remember is that at some point Harry is kidnapped and tortured by Lucius. He escapes but he refuses to speak for awhile until there is a dementor attack at the Burrow. I believe he is kissed but is saved by his patronus. Afterwards he starts talking again. I also want to say that Draco was good. Does anyone know this fic? Thanks in advance ðŸ™‚
