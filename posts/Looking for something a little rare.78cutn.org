Hi everyone! I've been searching through some archives trying to find a certain type of FF but I can't seem to find anything quite what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a fic where Harry kinda just says screw it and goes and acts like a normal teen, he goes through piercings and gets tattoos and argues with people, it would be fun to see him actually work as a tattoo artist or something like that. I don't know why I have the urge but I think it would be pretty fun! Oh, I don't mind slash or angst or anything like that, but I never really liked Fem!harry so if possible avoid that please.Thanks for stopping by!
