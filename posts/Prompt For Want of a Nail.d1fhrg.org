Halloween night 1981, Voldemort decides to stun Lily Potter and successfully kills Harry, making his final Horcrux as originally planned. Snape, now sworn to Dumbledore and loyal to Voldemort has a much more complicated life. Lily is able to speak to Sirius being innocent, sparing him prison. The Lestranges and Crouch Jr. don't go after the Longbottoms early for revenge, and do not go to prison. The war continues, with Dumbledore assuming Neville must be the chosen one.


** My one issue with this is Dumbledore assuming that Neville is the chosen one because of this: in canon, he never put much stock in the prophecy; he was more concerned with what Voldemort thought about it than with trying to interpret it himself.

*** Well, I'd agree in principle, but since there are two boys who can fit the prophecy, Voldemort would target Neville to share Harry's fate and therefore Dumbledore would have to assume that Neville is the Chosen One unless he believes that the Chosen One is yet to be born.

**** My point is that I don't think Dumbledore believes there /is/ a chosen one, strictly speaking. I guess I'm just being pedantic here, but I think Dumbledore would focus on Neville because he knows that Voldemort will likely want to off him, as well, just to be safe, not because he believes that the prophecy is inherently meaningful. Basically, I think he always knew that it was self-fulfilling.

Edit: which is 100% just my interpretation, and now that I'm thinking about it some more, I'm not sure that it entirely holds up, so, y'know. Take it with a grain of salt.

** I've always had the belief that had Voldemort not inadvertly engaged the perfect storm that was Lily's sacrificial love protection, he'd probably have won the war overall. I always got the impression that he was winning and had he not died that night, he'd have taken over completely.

He wouldn't last forever -- his eternal thirst for power would eventually get the attention of ICW, but Wizarding Britain would be in ruins in the aftermath of that.

I am working on a pair of Harry Potter stories, and I posted the first chapter of one on ffn, but it is slow going.

Half-decent is probably generous. I am a robotics engineer, so not the demographic most likely to be exceptional writers.

*** Because Snape asked him to, and he was willing to give her the chance to stand aside, and it would be absolutely no effort for him to knock her out vs killing her. In addition he mentions he knew that the magic that protected Harry was a thing and should have expected it. It wouldn't be a huge leap for him to exercise no additional effort to fulfill the request of a useful follower, and also spare himself the trouble of a protective magic he already knew was a possibility.

**** I actually really love this because on the one hand, Voldemort failing where and how he does in canon is kind of the point, but on the other hand, that point is . . . pretty trite by now. Like, "oh, hey, look at that villain who fell because of his own hubris and inability to love and trust others, I've never seen that before!"

So I really like this direction for Voldemort's character: he's more cautious and pragmatic, placing actual value on the people who are useful to him instead of treating every follower as being equally expendable and largely interchangeable. He's a genuinely different character, and especially a different antagonist, than his canon counterpart, which is exactly what you need in an AU/FWoaN that changes the protagonist.

***** I think Tom Riddle is a fundamentally cool character and could make a great villain, but I have always felt the best villains are the ones who you can sympathize with and who you could see yourself supporting, despite their actions being contrary to moral or legal norms. Villains who are puppy kicking sadists and mustache twirling "muhahahaha, look how evil I am" types are boring, and not very scary.

A Voldemort who really lived up to being as powerful as Grindlewald and brilliant besides, who values power over right and wrong, and who fears nothing but his own death could make a terrifying and dangerous villain, if they were sane and rational and a leader that inspired loyalty not just "obey or die, and also I'll kill you for mistakes out of your control". Maybe splitting his soul so many times affected his mind, but many of his actions post-resurrection didn't feel in line with how he is described as a child, teenager, or even in the first war. Blood purity fanatics, blackmail, torture, and imperious curses left and right wouldn't be enough to be as successful as he was.

***** This is why I like linkffn!I am Lord Voldemort?

Instead of killing Lily or Harry he binds Lily to his service and sets her up as a fake DE, with the ultimate aim of subverting her slowly, and eventually Harry as he grows up. He uses Snape to keep this a secret and train her, with the incentive that it keeps her alive and maybe one day she'll be so thoroughly subverted that she'll forgive or even love him. So far, it's working very well.

*** 1. Just because he hasn't marked him YET doesn't mean he won't, in some sense. That's the point of prophecies, they're vague and can be interpreted many ways. Perhaps, after killing Harry, he sends Neville a death threat or something and that counts.
2. It's entirely possible that you could interpret a successful slaughtering of Harry as marking Neville as Voldemort's equal itself - by avoiding Neville, out of fear or respect for his family/blood/status, by easily eliminating Harry and thus placing Neville as the "only" other possible half of the prophecy, making them equal in status (as they're both 1/2 people referenced in the prophecy), etc etc.
3. Even if Neville's *not* the Chosen One, if prophecy is bullshit and there is no such thing as a Chosen One, then the reality that he's the only plausible candidate and that both Voldemort and Wizarding Society more broadly do put some/a lot of stock in Divination would likely drive him to be placed in such a position regardless. Hell, maybe Voldemort terrorizes the Wizarding World for another 5/10/15 years, until some Unspeakable notices the prophecy on the shelf and its existence becomes known, leading to pressure on the DoM/Ministry to find out its contents and act on them, so they go to Dumbledore and by this time he's too weakened or too desperate to hide it, so it gets revealed and Neville becomes known as a result.

My point is, more generally, that it's entirely possible to write a reasonable, enjoyable plot in which Harry is killed and Neville is or is assumed to be the Chosen One as a result. Dismissing it out of hand, based on a tiny part of a very vague and potentially self-fulfilling prophecy, and with as much anger as you have seems strange to me.

*** 1. It's a prophecy, it is weak sauce to begin with. Prophecy driven plots are the same as McGuffins or any number of other plot devices. I am pretty sure a big part of a chapter of book 5 was dedicated to "prophecy does not really matter, but good to know that the villain believes it and will act on it."

2. It could refer to two people. It's not a huge leap of logic to assume that killing one is equivalent to marking the other as being equal.

3. Why are you mad?

That is a phenomenal leap of logic, in that it bears no relation to marking him whatsoever. You kill someone means you mark /that person/, not someone else.
