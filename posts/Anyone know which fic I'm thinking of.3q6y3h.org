It was an other boy who lived one, Harry is a few years older than canon was raised by Remus who opened an inn in Diagon or Knocturn Alley and has a coke sponsorship that gives him a couple of bottomless bottles of it that he keeps in a safe.

Only other think I remember is that the guy who posted it has a long rant at the end about how it isn't his story and how everyone needs to stop calling him a sexist pig.

Edit: and Harry spends most of his time being an arrogant asshole, I think.
