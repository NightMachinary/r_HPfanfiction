There are a lot of OP Harry fics out there, what surprises me about them is that he's rarely respected despite all of his power. He could show up with wandless magic in his first year and Draco would still antagonize him. I want to see a fic where Harry actually gets a say in the war ( Dumbledore respects him enough that he informs him of stuff to find solutions together ) and the tension doesn't come from mindless squabbles with Snape, Draco, Ron and Dumbledore but from Voldemort, who is a big threat even when Harry is extremely competent for his age. So Molly doesn't try to order him around, the minister and Skeeter wouldn't dare to start a hate campaign against him since everyone knows he, Dumbledore and Voldemort are on another level. The aurors would follow his orders, because you don't say no to Harry Potter.


** Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. Even in fics where Harry shows himself to be "the next big thing", like the next Albus Dumbledore, canon events play out as they do. I want to see something different.

It takes a bit but Harry is sorted into slytherin and is respected by his classmates for his power and who he is even though he has his many less than perfect sides as well. The author has written up to book 5 and is still updating.

**** I mean, without spoiling it certain events occur a lot sooner than they otherwise would have. Some of it is fluff yes, and it does have some weak moments, but overall the quality is much better than many fics I've read. And with how much extra world background is included it's natural that the story doesn't specifically focus on a single aspect of the main character, and to do so would be a detriment to the rest of the story.

** In "Something Wicked This Way Comes" Harry gets a lot of respect from people mostly because of his power. He's not a Mary Sue though. It's technically a Disgaea crossover, but no knowledge of Disgaea is required.

In "Magicks of the Arcane" he's coming into his own power and becomes Dumbledore's apprentice and eventually joins the Order and does missions for them. He's definitely not a passive participant.

Both of these fics get off the canon rail pretty much instantly, Harry is respected, he has credible conflicts with enemies, none of that "I defeated Snape and Malfoy and I'm proud of it despite that they are several orders of magnitude below me in terms of social and/or personal power and they cannot offer any credible challenge due to it" bullsh*ite.

****** That fic was started around 2004, long before magical cores were a thing, let alone a trope or cliche. To summarize the first few chapters: Harry awakens as a magus during a time of stress (I think DE attack?) and becomes basically a superwizard. However his power is unstable and he needs a circle of people to bond to so his power won't burn him from the inside or harm someone else. Think Arthur and the knights of the Round Table.

#+begin_quote
  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** I'm reading linkffn(Gods Amongst Men by Slimah) for the second time right now and in it Harry first earns the respect of most of the school by being powerful and helpful as a teacher in a Defense Club and later in the story he starts taking an active role in the war, works closely with the minister and is a figurehead in the press.\\
I'll be honest, it's not the most amazing story and some parts are a bit annoying but all in all I would consinder it worthwhile to read
