It was a FF with Tonks either going undercover or Harry and Tonks being the same age, they had a relationship, and during a hogsmeade visit there was a Death Eater attack, and I think she died..

Sorry, this isn't much help but that's all I remember.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
