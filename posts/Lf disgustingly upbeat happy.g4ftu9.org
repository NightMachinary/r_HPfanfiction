** - Luna's Hubby: linkffn(2919503)

Best described as "Luna being Awesome: The Fanfic". Luna kidnaps Harry Potter at 7 years old because she wants a husband. Warning for being written pre-Deathly-Hallows, so Xenophilius is named Larry in this fic (among other changes).

- This Means War by Jeconais: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]]

Harry/Ginny fic featuring "Harry can do literally anything, as long as no-one convinces him he can't do it", a few large scale pranks, and Harry making a complete mockery of the Final Battle.

- Oh God Not Again: linkffn(4536005)

Peggy-Sue fic parody. Harry falls through the Veil and time-travels because of it, meets up with Sirius who also time-travelled and escaped Azkaban, they decide to have fun while essentially speedrunning Harry's ordeals. The absolute highlight for me was Neville's Boggart being, quote, "The thought of Harry as Minister for Magic".

- The Naked Quidditch Match: linkffn(3689325)

Pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. Also the origin of "m-mails", the magical e-mail system also used in This Means War.

- Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Again, exactly what it says on the tin. Harry's a sapient dragon, things kinda go from there. Ongoing fic, but updated recently so at worst you'll have something to look forward to.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkffn(Adorable Violence) - Hilarious and fluffy fic in which Hermione is a little... /off/. Let's just say getting in between her and her books and/or her Harry is bad for your health.

Also, most of the work by Rorschach's Blot and/or mjimeyg on ffnet. Both tend towards very upbeat and humorous stories with lots of fun and happy endings. Neither is exactly high literature, not fraught with tension and hardship and tragedy. They're the ones I go to when I need to read something fun.
