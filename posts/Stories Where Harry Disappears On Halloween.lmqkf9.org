I mean stories where Harry disappears after Voldemort Aada Kedavra's him in 1981.

If romance, no slash or harem, please.

idk, I haven't really seen any and thought it would be a cool premise.

Thanks for your suggestions!


** Disappearing as in being kidnapped? Or going off for his own secret plans? Or disappearing to privately mourn for his parents?

I've seen the third one occasionally, but I'd like to see it more.
