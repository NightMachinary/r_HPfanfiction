Why is Harry/Daphne way more popular than Harry/Tracey when they're both Slytherins, we don't know much about them and they're both best friends?


** The thing that makes Daphne interesting is that she's usually portrayed as a pureblood Sacred 28 Slytherin who, through her relationship with Harry, gives him more options (magical, political, economic, whatever). As a half-blood,^{1} Tracey is less narratively interesting -- there's less of a connection to history and society, less culture shock for Harry, etc.

Could you give Tracey those connections? Sure. But Daphne already has them, so why bother? Just use Daphne.

^{1} According to Rowling's notes, since Tracey never appeared in the stories.

** Daphne is the sister of Malfoy's wife in the epilogue, according to JKR, not that Malfoy's wife was named in the 7 books. This alone is more interesting and notable than anything Tracey Davis has going for her.

Tracey Davis literally only exists on a list of people in Harry's year that JKR showed on a documentary thing. We also are told she's a halfbood.

Given that one of the complaints the fandom has with Harry vs the pureblood stuff is there is no good reason for the pureblood side. Harry doesn't see, (we the reader are not shown) why they fight. As a result there are people who want to know why the feel the need to do what they do. An extreme but obvious example is the failures of the Weimar Republic (not all their fault by any means) leading to the election of an infamous Austrian man. Without the conditions to force people to make a desperate choice why would they go so extreme?

Daphne's status as a pureblood can provide a gateway into the pureblood 'culture' or whatever it is they're fighting for. Characters are devices and Daphne works better than Tracey as a device for this.

** First, I want to point that the friendship between Daphne and Tracey, while "possible", is not written anywhere in the books. In Canon, Daphne is only the name of a girl who pass one of her OWL at the same time than Hermione, While Tracey only appear in the notes of Rowling about "the students in Harry's year" (which makes her technically not canon).

As for "Why is Daphne more popular?", it is probably because she is considered as more interesting by writers and fans. Outside of her House, Daphne brings a lot of things into her relation with Harry : her blood purity, her membership into the "Sacred 28" or even her political knowledge. Most of the "popular" ships also bring something into the story : Hermione has her intellect and her "best friend" statut, Ginny is Ron's sister and a Quidditch player, Luna has her quirkiness, Susan her aunt and "assets". Compared to that, Tracey is . . . a Slytherin, so she seems a bit flat.\\
The only time an author can use Tracey is when he wants Harry to be paired with a Slytherin, but in that case why not use Daphne and use all the tropes that come with her? Even Pansy could be used to create more content "from bitch to lover".

Also, when you looks at the last Harry/ Daphne fics, 90% of them seem to be the same 3 scenarios that are rehashed again and again and again. Years ago, someone wrote a popular story with Daphne inside, which created most of the tropes used with her, and now people write about her because she is popular. If that author had wrote the same story with Tracey as the love interest, we would probably be wondering why she is more popular than Daphne.

** We know almost nothing about them in canon. The fanon appearance of Daphne is based on the movies, and the girl assumed to be her is never named or credited as Daphne. We know she has a sister who hooks up with Malfoy, and is a pureblood in Harry's year in Slytherin, and that's about it.

Literally all we know about Davis is that she's a half-blood and in Slytherin.

They're both basically fandom OCs. Their friendship is based on them both being mentioned in the same scenes in the books a couple times.
