And everyone gets put into where they should be.

Harry Potter goes to the Slytherin.

Draco goes to Gryffindor.

Ron goes to Hufflepuff.

Hermione goes to Ravenclaw.

The same thing happens to the other children.


** Draco is absolutely a Gryffindor. He spends half the book confronting Harry directly with blatant, un-subtle mockery. He tries hard to be a Slytherin and sneaky/cunning, but he in no way succeeds. He even has to drag Vince and Greg around to back him up because he knows he's going to get his ass kicked the second Harry stops be restrained by the rules.

I would love to see a fic of outtakes from the Hogwarts time of Vince and Greg, how they're posing as big dumb bodyguards for the little ponce and how annoying and insufferable the whole situation is. How they purposely sabotage themselves in class for the sake of sandbagging and are actually intelligent, sophisticated boys who hate all the rigamarole they have thrust on them by their families. After Voldieshorts gets put down, they go into business together and open a chain of high class tea shops or something.

*** I really don't understand how so many people can see Draco as a Gryffindor, it makes no sense to me. He might not be as perfect a Slytherin as, say, Tom Riddle, but the idea that he belongs in Gryffindor is laughable.

Just because he's not pulling elaborate schemes every other week doesn't mean he's not cunning, he absolutely is. He tricks Harry and Ron with the wizard duel, feeds Skeeter information because he knows Harry hates his fame, would have caught them with the dragon if McGonagall had believed him, and comes up with the Potter stinks badges. I think there are probably some other minor things I can't remember right now. Of course, comes up with the whole vanishing cabinet scheme. I can't help but feel that you've read too many Slytherin politics fics; so what if he confronts Harry a lot, he's a kid, he gets angry sometimes? He's reasonably ambitious too, joining the inquisitorial squad and, presumably, working fairly hard to become a prefect.

But mainly the reason I only see him as a Slytherin is because he's not even remotely a Griffindor!? He's a huge coward - we constantly see scenes of him coming after Harry and then backing down throughout the series. And the idea of him being described as chivalrous is enough to make me laugh - maybe his insults are childish but they certainly hurt, don't they? Harry's most sensitive about his parents and Ron's most sensitive about his family and money, it makes sense for him to target them. And makes him a massive unchivalrous dickhead in the process. I'm sorry but if you think that him having the ability to walk up to Harry a couple of times a year and yell a bit makes him daring or courageous, you're mental.

The sorting hat made its decision essentially instantly, and for good reason. Just because he's not the /perfect/ Slytherin doesn't mean he belongs somewhere else.

I think it makes far more sense for Harry to just want to learn magic, to just experience this new wonderful world that he's now a part of. He doesn't want to be a hero, so why would he go to Gryffindor?

It makes far more sense, to me, if Harry decides that he just wants some good friends in this new world, and Hufflepuff is advertised as the "friendly" house from memory, so I think that's where he'd want to go if he had this all explained to him.

Gryffindor did nothing in canon besides amplify all of Harry's worst traits: his brashness, his bullheadedness, his willingness to charge into danger without a plan.

In a place that promotes loyalty, friendship, and other such things? I can easily see Harry having an entire /house/ of people to call on for things like the Tri-Wizard Tournament, instead of... what was it? Three people? Hermione, Ron (when he got on board), and occasionally Neville?

***** I don't believe that the sorting hat said that Harry had Slytherin traits. Its just that if he went to Slytherin he could develop them, and gain true friends that (no offense to Ron) stick by him no matter what the rest of the school believes. The sorting hat also said that he could be great which might help because in Slytherin most of the kids are from old pure blood families. Those kids would have access to old books in their family library's and if Harry gains their trust they would probably share it with him. He also wouldn't have to endure whining about homework because the Slytherins would know that it is important. So he might behave like a Gryffindor at first but he probably would of had a better life in Slytherin without everyone nurturing those self-sacrificial tendencies.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

*** Seconding Ron in Slytherin or even Ravenclaw - he's surprisingly ambitious and cunning, even if it seemingly gets overshadowed by Harry and Hermione.

Ambitious is pretty clear - it was his deepest desire to be a separate entity from his brothers and though he certainly got it, it was as Harry Potter's sidekick. He's not so bad academically as well, and without Hermione to push him and in an environment where ambition was prioritized, I have no doubt he would actively push himself.

A lot of Ron's plans are also cunning in the sense that they are pragmatic. Ron was the only one to keep his head over Devil's Snare. Ron outwit McGonagall's board and actively accepted the sacrifice play at the age of eleven. Ron tried to stage a rescue operation by recruiting his brothers and breaking all the rules to sneak his best friend into his home with the family car (which would have worked had Mrs. Weasley not been awake). Ron reminds Harry and Hermione about the Taboo and prevents them from breaking it on more than one occasion. Ron fakes parseltongue to get to the Chamber of Secrets after thinking of that idea to remove the cup.

There are countless other actions and things I can think of, but Ron is about as intelligent as Harry, just not nearly as motivated academically - after all, Harry and Ron get nearly the same scores in everything except for DADA.

"multiple times "

Once in his right mind and once while being affected by one of the darkest aritfacts ever created. Hardly multiple times

And I think you have Gary Stu perfect friend fanon Neville mixed up with canon Neville.

When did Neville face down hundreds of his greatest fears to help save his friend ?

When did Neville follow Harry into the lair of a deadly giant monster ?

When did Neville tell a mass murderer he would have to kill him to get to Harry ?

When did Neville dive into a freezing lake without hesitation to save Harry in the middle of winter ?

******** Never read Gary Stu so.. no on that one lol

It could very well be that I'm just biased against his charector as I don't like his charector in canon much at all. And that dislike of his charector could be skewing how I view his charector traits as a whole.

I think by far my biggest issue is his jealous issues though. I abhor jealousy in real life, so to see a charector written with that bad of jealousy issues that it causes him to straight up abandon his best friend for over half the book in gof, I think that book just forever ruined his charector for me.

** Ron is way too lazy to be a Hufflepuff, plus he's not that loyal. He's crazily brave however and thus a true Gryffindor.

Neville seems to have much better work ethic and may actually fit into Hufflepuff.

Hermione is tough because she fits well into all 4 houses.

Draco can fit into Gryffindor because of his boorishness, but I think he is still more Slytherin because he is quite resourceful (as shown in his 6th year) and seems ambitious enough.

Similarly with Harry who has some Slytherin qualities, but he's overwhelmingly a Gryffindor.

** Harry would have ended up in Gryffindor regardless of what he wanted imo, never seen much Slytherin in him tbh. Why would Ron go to Hufflepuff? He isn't exactly hardworking, and some would say he has loyalty problems. Hermione could be in any house but probably Ravenclaw the most. Draco's plots are crap and I wouldn't say he is brave or chivalric, loud and obnoxious though.

The only reason he knows about Hermione is probably because she is top of her class, and/or friends with Harry Potter.

Lucius is presumably getting all of his information from his son, Draco, and whatever tidbits drop from board meetings. It would make sense that Draco would notice Hermione as his friend as pass it on, as well as a Board meeting mentioning her (possibly).
