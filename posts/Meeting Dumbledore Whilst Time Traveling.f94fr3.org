In quite a few fics I've read about Hermione, Harry, etc going back in time, they meet Dumbledore and greet him by name, and Dumbledore is able to figure out they're time travelers based off of that.

It would only make a bit of sense if it was the forties or earlier and he was only a professor, or perhaps still a student, but later on Dumbledore is an inventor, Headmaster of Hogwarts, along with a couple more titles, and famous enough to have his own Chocolate Frog card. He's probably in the newspaper and on the wireless quite often. If someone affiliated with the Wizarding world didn't know his face that would be strange.


** Most of the time Dumbledore takes a look at Harry and thinks 'Not Mister Potter, obviously related though... and Miss Evan's eyes'

*** Yes! They look like relatives, but why would he come to the conclusion that Harry is James and Lily's son instead of some long-lost relative?

**** Because the story needs it to. Seriously, there are few instances where impossible time travel would be a real answer to be considered. Think about your daily life, how many times have you met people and thought "must be a time traveller"?

Long lost relative it is.

** There was one story where Snape is the time traveller (the consciousness travels to an old body type) - and he just straight up tells Dumbledore by thinking about things he couldn't possibly know and then making eye contact and letting legimancy do the rest

Don't remember the name of it though

*** So his expert Occlumency skills didn't go back with him? I'm assuming based off tour not remembering the name that it's not worth a read.

***** So shouldn't he know that Snape knows Occlumency and therefore be suspicious as to why he's allowing Dumbledore to see his whole life? Why immediately trust him?

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

********* To answer your earlier question, I /personally/ didn't find it worth reading, but that's because I despise Snape/Lily, not because I thought it was bad - also Peace Not Promised was the story. What I went through wasn't bad, but, again, wasn't for me

** In this type of story, what always strikes me as strange is that after they've had the initial conversation with Dumbledore, he usually tells them they can't go home immediately for reason xyz, and then makes up some cover story to explain why they're suddenly joining the school population in this time. Often he barely warns them against changing the past and the effects that could have on the future. And lots of these fics are set in the Marauders era so James, Sirius and so on are interacting with them. Harry would be unable to resist trying to fix things - it would be far too risky to let them roam free in the school.

*** And then it goes something like this: Harry, you'll be meeting your mum, dad, and Sirius. I know you really want to just warn them about what's going to happen, but you have to keep quiet. If you don't I'll wipe their memories of you when we find a way to send you back.

Dumbledore also usually has already formed the Order of the Phoenix. It would make more sense to form an Order guard of a few select members and keep them under lock and key if Dumbledore didn't want the traveler to change anything.

**** Yup, true. I often give up on time travel fics when they head this way, they just don't seem credible for Dumbledore's character.
