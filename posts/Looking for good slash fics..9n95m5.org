Not your run of the mill 'everybody who isn't gay in this story is LiTeRaLlY hItLeR' slash fics, I'm looking for thoughtful, genuine stories whose characters are /people/ instead of /ideas/, you know what I'm saying?

I read an excellent slash fic a while ago with Draco as the main character, it was a 'groundhog day' fic where he botches a time turner and has to redo the same 24 hours over and over again. I wish i could remember the name, it was really good...

  In which Ron realizes that maybe, just maybe, you aren't supposed to feel this way about your best mate. But only after a dance at the Yule Ball, months of being busy with other things, Cedric Diggory's death, the return of Voldemort, and a quiet knock at his door.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378?hide_banner=true]]) is one of the best slash fics I've read. You really feel the characters as people and the story is brilliantly written.
