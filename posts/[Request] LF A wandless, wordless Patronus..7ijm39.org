That is literally the only specific thing I can remember about the fic in question. For whatever reason, Harry is in a class with some upper-year Slytherins, and they get mouthy when the Patronus charm is mentioned. Harry (who might not go by his name in the fic, I can't remember) gives them a /look/ and produces a wandless, wordless Patronus. I remember that the "gas" emitted from the tips of his fingers and condensed into his Patronus.

Some other things I can kinda remember:

- Harry is either back in time, or in an alternate dimension.

- Harry is nearly an adult.

- Harry isn't in Gryffindor, I think he's in Slytherin.

This has some wandless Patronus in it I think. Also an alternate dimension.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** That's a great fic, but I don't think it's the one I'm looking for.
