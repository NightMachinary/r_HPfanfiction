I hate that ship in that stage because it's so unhealthy and weird.


** I know a bunch of HP fanfictions of James and Lily surviving.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2808795/1/Dealing-With-Destiny][Dealing with Destiny]] is good, though I haven't read all of it.

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/23507611-if-james-and-lily-lived][If James and Lily had Lived]] on Wattpad is another good one.

I myself have a James and Lily fic of them surviving, but it's not completed, and only has 4 parts.

** There is linkffn(5856625), although that one does have some unhealthy obsession on Sev's side.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"
