Or any other type of story were the whole world suddenly gets access to the system


** None that include the whole world as far as I'm aware.

There are a couple that have Harry interfacing with a game interface, but even those are pretty rare. I haven't read them so I don't know what the quality is like.

Having the Statute of Secrecy broken because the system lists magical humans with the sub-race witch or wizard would be entertaining, if nothing else.

*** It would be glorious chaos especially if the system came online after harry was born but before Voldemort's first fall.

When would you have the system come to earth? I would go either before Voldemort's first fall or the summer of fifth year.

**** I'd have to think about it because when the divergence happens can set a lot of tone for the story.

Example 1: If it appears before Halloween 1981, it could disrupt Voldemort's first fall. Maybe it gives him knowledge of the full prophecy, maybe it changes power dynamics, or something else, but he could wind up dictator of western Europe by the time Harry would have started Hogwarts. Or maybe the newly empowered muggles off him and wizards become super hunted.

Example 2: If you want to have Harry's generation meaningfully involved in leadership (rather than being led around by Dumbledore), they'll need to be mature enough to assert independence. I would probably time it to coincide with Dumbledore's death both for maximum chaos and because that's the time Harry decided to stop waiting for other people to solve his problems.

Personally, I lean heavily toward the second option because incompetent adults syndrome in canon made a lot of the characters in James/Lily's generation unattractive. Plus, I would want to rewrite the second war to be about more than Voldemort and Harry's +wangs+ wands.

***** Agreed the night/morning of Dumbledore death would be a really good time to do it as well.

**** Fourth year some time after the other two schools got there, Maybe the night/morning after the second task or the morning after the final battle. Mainly because I think that Hogwarts would be a level 100+ zone so on launch of the system all the students and staff of the three schools would end up with a small,medium,large and greater perk for starting in a 100+ zone.
