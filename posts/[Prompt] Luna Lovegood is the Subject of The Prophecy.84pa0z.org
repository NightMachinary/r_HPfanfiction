Luna learns of the prophecy and through typical Lovegood interpretation decides that it /clearly/ refers to her. Xenophilius printed Voldemort's name in the Quibbler three times over the course of the war, and as for the rest, something like "Any Power I have is a Power He Knows Not, since he does Not Know Me" , "Every Month is a Seventh Month if you squint hard enough", or "He considers me so UnEqual it wraps back around to Equality" should do the trick.

Bonus points for:

- her finding a Snorkack
- her gatecrashing a Harry or Dumbledore vs Voldemort showdown
- her bamboozling Voldemort
- her defeating Voldemort with pudding


** Voldemort slips on pudding and snaps his spine, killing him.

**** I really, really, really want to write it. Unfortunately, I'm busy writing my own ridiculous story. I know --- [[/u/Full-Paragon]]! You're the man that we need!

** I had just the opposite idea. Luna is the child of the prophecy but everyone thinks Harry is, including Harry himself. Harry is his usual self-sacrificing, hero complexed self, launches himself into every dangerous situation because he just knows he's the only one who can take a stand and Luna solves everything by accident/quirky logic/coincidence. Until both of them finally understand what's going on and team up and show just how badass they've become through all these trials.
