No particular fic in mind just curious if people have explored the HP universe in a setting where maybe Hermione doesn't become their friend, or Ron. Though I guess I'm a big Hermione fan so if she weren't around Voldemort probably would have won. I'm okay with fics like that too. What are some favs along these lines.
