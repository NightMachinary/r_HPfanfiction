** Huh, just did a Ctrl+F of my ebooks, and here are the following usages of "slimy" in conversation (not as narrative description):

Book 4:

- Ron calls the Malfoys slimy at the Quidditch World Cup
- Sirius describes Snape as slimy when he and the trio are talking about who might have put Harry's name in the goblet.

And that's it! So yeah, I guess the phrase "slimy Slytherin/snake" is based in fanon, not canon.

*** One of fanons greatest “strengths” is coming up with a myriad of annoying and cliche insults towards every single character in any series.

See manipulative, old man, codger, crazy and senile for Dumbledore.

**** Though "smily Slytherin" is unique in being mostly used to portray the "bigotry" of the one saying it, e.g. Ron.

** It doesn't even make sense. Snakes aren't even slimy. Their scales are smooth and dry.

** I think the closes you'll find in Canon is this:

#+begin_quote
  "You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
