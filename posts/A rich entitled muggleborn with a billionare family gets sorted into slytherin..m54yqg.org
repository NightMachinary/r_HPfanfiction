** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13139149/3/The-Hidden-Duchess][A Hidden Duchess]] featuring a Slytherin!Hermione who is part of the British royal family has a similar hilarious exchange.

"What was that, Granger?" sneered Malfoy from the other table.

"Nothing, Malfoy," she sniffed prissily, "I was just saying that anyone can have a good broom, but it doesn't matter if they don't have a lick of talent in their bones. Honestly, you sound so horribly nouveau riche, with all the bragging you're doing Malfoy."

"My family goes back three centuries, Granger. We're anything but nouveau." he growled.

"Mine goes back nine hundred years." she said matter-of-factly. "So you're still nouveau compared to me."

​

I also read a one-shot before with Justin Finch-Fletchley being snobby as heck but I can't remember the title.

*** This is a fun story, but I wish all the characters didn't talk in exactly the same way. Five different characters all call each other "love". Who speaks like that in real life? Most of the characters feel like Mary/Gary Sues.

**** Yep, honestly even the period before the quotation mark bugs me. The author definitely has a lot of improvement in terms of writing but I still also find it a fun story with a unique premise.

"Mine goes back nine hundred years." she said matter-of-factly.

In both instances, there should be a comma before the end quotation mark since they're followed by he/she + action word. Not a period.

** That might come down to how much muggle money the goblins are willing to convert into wizard money. My impression is that even the richest wizard family like Malfoy are millionaires not billionaires. Hypothetically the Muggleborn could outspend them and buy more influence but I wouldn't underestimate good old fashioned snobbery.

*** Heh, remember one fic, just a side comment really, had the goblins mention they put limits on the amount of muggle money they'd convert. There was an incident with a muggleborn Rockefeller years ago.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] Justin Finch-Fletchley is obscenely wealthy, and he enjoys pointing it out to Draco when Draco tries to hire him for a pittance. If you don't want to read through the whole thing (which is rather massive), the main conversation where it comes up is in chapter 18 of the second book (the 52nd chapter on FFN).
