well yeah i'm currently writing a fanfiction and im on chapter 3 i was wondering what should i do to make it uniqe? what should we do to NOT make a fanfaction like other overdone fanfictions? and what tropes do you think are done on FF.net way too much?


** It all depends on what you want to write, but I think by avoiding these 3 cliches, you can automatically avoid many bad tropes:

1. Don't try to rehash canon plot, don't try to follow JKR to resolve everything by year's end, and don't try to force something happening each year. You should especially avoid the canon COS plot because it's actually the epitome of the "useless adults" trope. Also, please avoid the Moody impersonation plot and the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme. It's nauseating to see them repeated thousands of times in fanfics.

2. Don't let Harry get all the credits for winning. The series says friendship is great, and I think that's a great message too. But for god's sake let his friends be useful and make contributions. Apart from Hermione's awesome research ability, let Ron become a good tactician or strategist since he's so good at chess, let Ginny be his ultimate sidekick, let Neville be his voice or diplomat with the traditional Purebloods, let Susan be his Ministry contact, let Justin be his money man or Muggle relation expert, let Tonks be the ultimate spy and infiltrator, and let Dumbledore do something cool too. There is absolutely no need for Harry to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight. War is all about deceptions, fighting unfairly, and maximizing your own advantages anyway.

3. Don't dumb down anyone to jam through your plot or manufacture unneeded drama. Canon, being a children's book mostly, is especially guilty in this regard. There are countless moments in DH where bad guys are dumbed down into oblivion so good guys could pull off a Pyrrhic victory. And please don't use surprise Deus Ex Machina to screw over anyone.

** - A 20 page will that shows EVERYTHING. Like who their secret keeper was, who ate the last piece of pie, etc. 20 bajamillionkazillion galleons. If you make him rich, don't just have it sitting in the vault, have it invested in businesses and properties. I refuse to believe that Gringotts would leave a vault of one of their biggest customers idle for almost two decades to wait for the sole beneficiary to become an adult.
- A dozen lordships. Pick two. Peverell and Heir Black. Those are plot relevant AND are the most believable of the rest. That, and they are higher ranked than the others. The rest can be traced back for other people.
- Heir of Gryffindor/Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw. If you HAVE to go this route, don't give him a lordship. Give him something interesting, like veto power over the Board of Governors and/or Headmaster. Don't make it blood heir, magical heir maybe? He did pull the sword out of the hat. Also found the chamber of secrets + parseltongue. This is a good way to veto Umbridge. Or the Dementors.
- Multiple Animagus forms. I've only found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][ONE FIC]] where multiple forms was a thing and was believable. He took the hard way to get his form AND has to put in the same effort for every form. It wasn't some flick of a switch and BOOM! I have 20 forms.
- If he has a bind on his magic, or you want the soul fragment found early, don't have the Goblins find it. That's overdone. Create an accident that forces him to St. Mungos and then you can introduce the Goblins. You can use the basilisk venom in his blood. Have Aunt Marge's dog bite him and the dog dies from the venom. Have the blood splash some more and no more Durseleys. Can you imagine that letter? "Dear Ministry of magic. This dog bit me and now everyone in my house is dead. Who do I call? You would think that they would have a class on this for muggle born/raised students. Love, Harry Potter"
- Dumbledore. I personally enjoy every flavored Trope of Dumbledore there is. My favorite one is where Snape was manipulating him with potions, charms, etc.
- Ron - Don't intentionally dumb him down. Make him manipulative, make hima prick. Do anything with him. Just don't dumb down his character.

You are confusing Gringotts with a Modern Bank. Vaults in Gringotts are not like account in the real world, they are more like strongboxes. You pay an opening fee, plus a maintenance fee (and even this is not confirmed in canon), and in exchange, Gringott provide you with a vault, and the promise it will never be robbed. Apart from that, Goblins could not careless about what you do with this vault, you could stack it with gold, treasures, or even shit, it's all the same to them. They do not have any access to the inside of the vaults, and even if they did, the way they treat Harry (and all the wizards they meet) during canon make me think that if they could invest for Wizards, they would intentionally select terrible investments out of spite.

For the same reason, I also dislike helfull Goblin, pretty sure that even if Goblins could deal with Horcruxe (that I already find it doubtfull), I think they reaction would be either "You have a soul fragment stuck inside you, guess you will die" or "We could deal with this soul fragment for a price sir, but you have to pay first and you only get 5% to survive the procedure".

**** The only way I see Gringotts being a thing is a treaty. And I see them as a warrior culture turned bankers. So they take the banking seriously.

Why would they purposely make bad investments? It would only hurt them.

*** To add to this. Avoid bashing. If you want someone against Harry who's on his side in canon build that character in that direction and try to still make them an interesting character.

Make the antagonists competent. If they're useless, they aren't engaging or threatening. If they're useless and still a threat, the protagonist becomes useless too, by default.

If you plan to bring in sentient magical creatures (like goblins, veela, centaurs and so on), explore how they're different from humans. Don't ignore that they aren't human and really don't shove them into a singular behaviour as if they aren't people.

If you're going to make Harry powerful, make it a gradual growth rather than flipping a switch. And avoid god mode in general, remember the above point about useless bad guys? That's still true even if they're only useless because the protagonist is untouchable.

**** Just make the Hallows normal items that are the best they can be. Say that legends puffed them up more than they are.

Or, make their true purpose be soul-based. Wand can empower spells to find/destroy souls (Dementors/ghosts can count here). Stone summons deceased souls. And the cloak can hide your soul (Dementors/wraith cant see you, Avada Kedavra doesn't work if it hits the cloak)

This would repurpose the Hallows into something useful, but doesn't make him an OP killing machine. He would still have to duel Voldemort.

** Different genres and subgenres have different cliches and pitfalls. We could (collectively) list off a hundred cliches, but it would be more productive if you gave us some idea of the premise and the genre.

** A lot of people have mentioned it, but I'll say it too because it's all too common. Avoid bashing, it's fine to paint otherwise good characters in a less favorable light, but their personity should still be recognizable to their canon one, and they shouldn't have only negative traits, one dimentional characters are just boring and baly writen. I recently read a fic that was okay except for the bashing, after the author had Ron rape a 12 year old that kinda killed the fic for me.

Authors also tend to result to bashing to facilitate a break up. It is actually possible for a breakup to happen without one part of the couple being the actual worst.

*** I feel like instead of bashing people by inventing crimes like this they should just make their protagonist dislike people. I mean you can just use the traits characters possess against them. Like to bash Hermione you can just increase her comments and "know-it-all" behaviour a little bit and then make your mc dislike the hell of it. Or with Ron just use his ambition to stand out in his family. Show the negative side of it. If I read one more fic in which Dumbledore is evilly munching on a lemon drop while plotting evil deeds.... Just make his motives a little more "for the greater good" while he doesn't want to hurt Harry make him believe that Harry's death is a necessary deed to finally defeat Voldemort and highlight that. If Harry is your Main character it's obvious that he might be pissed about that.

**** Agreed absoultely. I don't even really consider leaning on negative traits and making the MC dislike another character because of it to bashing exactly.

There is a big difference between saying "Molly is frequently overbearing, so I dislike her", and making her flaws all there is to her, ignoring all her good traits, and saying "She and Giny are giving him love potion!"

** Yeah, no gringrotts blood adoption shenanigans or them fixing horcrux stuff. It's a bank, go to the ministry and seek legal consul and go to st. Mungos(or invent some private research hospital, anything but goblins having all the answers).

Bank wouldn't have anything to do with that business. Deeds/will/inheritence would also be under legal consul, banks have no jurisdiction aside from holding the accounts.

That's like the #1 pet peeve trope. Animagus forms also get a little crazy and super overdone. If your doing a retelling, introduce new solutions and really canon diverge. It makes no sense reading different scenarios if the problems are solved the exact same way as the actual book.

** My suggestion try to think every so often about the motivations of you characters. Even a side character should have some kind of motivation/goal. Even if it is only about finding out the latest gossip or to have fun or to get to breakfast. Otherwise some characters just seem really empty and shallow

** Here's an odd mix of chiches and my personal preferences.

1.) Snake familiar - You can easily tell if a snake familiar is well done or cliche'd. I like that one fic where the snake helps Harry with healing magic.

2.) Goblin-friend!Harry - I dig immersion and culture, but having goblins just waiting to shower the first person who's polite to them with benefits is unbelievable in the extreme and reminiscent of the Fountain of Magical Brethren.

3.) Bashing - Outlandishly evil Dumbledore/rotten Weasley characters (almost always Ginny, Ron, Percy, Molly)/ suddenly snobbish Hermione - highly entertaining, but lazy (and frankly, quite laughable.)

4.) Billion-galleon account - I think it is reasonable to assume Harry is wealthy, but his family isn't overly old and with the exception of Henry Potter, not incredibly political.

5.) Lordships - this is more of a recent attitude of mine, but Lordships are getting a bit pretentious and drab. Give me a good election cycle for the Wizengamot any day. If you must, please keep it modest and don't give Harry sole control over half the seats of the Wizengamot.

6.) Inheritances - again, avoid Billion-galleon accounts. Also, making Harry the sole beneficiary of age old accounts belonging to Merlin or Le Fay... et cetera. If you want to, though, I have seen scenes where Harry inherits the money and possessions of families that have died out without any heirs or next of kin. In these instances they put him in their will as thanks for taking care of moldywarts.

7.) Nicknames - avoid the words: 'moldywarts', 'moldyshorts', 'dumbles', especially while not using dialogue. Using these a few times in dialogue is forgivable, but please don't overdo it and only let the twins, Sirius, James, or another comedic relief use them. Utilizing 'Tommy-boy' in reference to Voldemort is an unforgivable offense.

8.) Following canon - seriously, I'd rather read the books.

9.) Animagus - Personally, I can see Harry being a bird (which is what he mostly is in fanfic) but I want to see more four-legged mammals. Maybe a fox or a dog. The fanon process of gradually working up to a transformation, limb by limb, is just as good as the canon process (and in some fics the fan-made process is even better.

10.) Magical core - no. no. NO.

11.) Talent - don't make Harry an instant prodigy. Write him as one and develop him properly.

12.) Marriage Contracts, Veela-bond, Soul-bond - avoid the latter two if they make your characters objects or nullify their free-will. Unless you describe a magical process or they include an artifact of some sort, don't make age-old contracts magically binding.

Magical oaths - if you use these, I will roll my eyes and sigh inwardly, pretending they never happened. So mote it be. The only exception would be ceremony. Oaths of marriage or of office, even then - don't make them binding. It's a cop-out.

*** 13.) Occlumency and Legilimency - if you want your characters to learn them, keep in mind that these are moderately obscure arts. Make it believable and make your character work for them. They're described as very difficult.

** Don't be afraid to take inspiration from the movies as well, they are the best example of what things would look like visually. The books are your best friends, as they are an encyclopedia of the events surrounding the boy who lived. Make sure to write in character for every single character. A sentence from a character such as Ron weasley should not have the same speech pattern as a sentence spoken by a character such as Severus snape or Dumbledore. The books are a good way to get a feel for character's speech pattern and personality.
