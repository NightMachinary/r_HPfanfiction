Recently read a lot of so & so goes back in time after witnessing the 2nd blood war play out and decide to change the outcome to save everyone etc, havent found one yet with dumbles as the guy, btw this is most definitely meant to be a more of dark comedy but I can see it also see it as a fluffy crack fic too if anyone wants to write it that way

anyways setup is as follows:

Dumbles is dying as per cannon and realises he has colossally messed up in his plans to try & eliminate Voldemort, given the only real hope of the wizarding world is a broken shell of a man who barely has the will to to even get up each morning let alone fight for & potentially sacrifice himself for the good of the magical world.

Taking in the other burdens the rest of the wizarding world have placed upon harry, Albus becomes even more pissed which is only compounded when Snape then comes to him for help in rescuing several of his pureblood female students who have essentially been told they will be made into breeding stock and sex slaves for the various death eaters in order to curry favour with Voldemort.

Naturally pissedï»¿ off and trying to work out how to amend things with harry and save his students from the depressing failure that his cherished Wizarding World has become, he heads off to his brothers pub to seek both advice & alcohol.........

You can see where this is going

The following morning Albus wakes up only to learn that somehow his conscience has traveled back in time to three years before Harry enters ï»¿Hogwarts, now in his younger curse free body, his memories as to how involve blurry and vague recollections that mostly consist of streaking through Hogsmeade with a horrified Aberforth trying to stop him, breaking into the Ministry to kick Minister Fudge in the balls whilst disillusioned and then breaking into the Department of Mysteries whilst dressed as a woman for some reason that felt oddly right to him, taking a literal swim in a vat of liquid luck the Unspeakables kept down there before diving headfirst through the veil of death whilst shouting â€œfuck 'em all i'm getting him a harem", wierdly he could have sworn something in the Veil of Death cheered loudly as he did along with a powerful feeling as to how to save Harry

Realising he now has an empty slate, he takes Harry fromï»¿ the Dursleys with the first intention of removing the horcrux via unifying the Hallows, given he now knows the location of all three Objects, its only right they are wielded by the last True Blood Heir of their Bloodline, Harry Potter (Voldemort used to count but him no longer having a body means he no longer has either the blood or DNA of the Peverells flowing his veins, on a side note could that mean Delphini was technically Harry's Child DNA wise as Voldemort was reborn based on his blood, so biologically she should be a Potter not a Riddle, right?)

His second intention is to ensure Harry's happiness and to screw the rest of the magical world over, and what better way then to get his favourite pseudo-grandson a harem of lovely ladies...and if some of them just happen to be the pureblood daughters of his enemies in the wizengamot then oh well...its not like they are a true threat given he now has 10 years worth of political, economical & societal knowledge that they do not.

Harry meanwhile has no idea what a harem is but loves the fact he now has a loving and happy family that seems to keep growing in numbers, even though grandpa Albus is definitely a little bit crazy

Side note: Given death is an omniscient & omnipresent being if there is a master at one point in its timeline it would also exist in all of its timeline, short answer, Harry is, has always been & will always be Master of Death regardless if he has collected the hallows or not hence its desire to remove the Horcrux via unifying its artefacts upon that particular plane of existence
