I read a lot of Crossovers, many are Harry Potter Crossovers. A lot of Stories have Harry Gaining a Harem (Many others are also Slash but that isn't the point) but what if Harry, a Straight Noble Powerful Handsome man ended up friends with another young Man whether he be Issei, Kenichi, Ichika, Rito, Tsukune, or many other Anime Heroes who end up with multiple women in love with them. The funny thing about Harems is that they don't always make sense and so while Harry's Friend is drowning in gorgeous young women, Harry can't seem to even get a date with a single girl at school, interested in his pal or not.

The idea is just turning the usual idea of the Crossover Character getting the girl that you see often. Harry isn't the other MC's Gay Friend, nor is the MC a Abusive or evil dick that Harry opposes, Harry is just the Unlucky Sidekick/Friend/Teammate who while shouldering his own share of the Hero's burden just can't seem to get his own chance of Happiness just yet. Harry can end up with a Girlfriend(s) Near the end but the jokes the fun come from everyone acknowledging that Harry IS a Catch, he IS Attractive and he IS a Hero but for whatever reason he just can't get a break. There could even be a few aspects of the "Villainesses Want Heroes" Trope where the only women who even want Harry usually also wants to destroy/harm/kill his Friend
