** Voldemort transfigures the entire thing into virtually anything else solid. You are now trapped inside an iron man shaped coffin. You are especially screwed if you cannot reach your wand.

*** What's to stop somebody in doing that with clothes as is? While it wouldn't be comparable to a coffin, it would make moving as good as impossible.

** I had a similar idea to this as part of that Me-as-Harry story I've had bouncing around in my brain for a while; but it'd be less of a whole set of magical power armor and more a collection of magical clothing/items that when combined result in something akin to a steampunk/magiteck Iron Man suit.
