** I think you're thinking of [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun]] by Vanir, over on Ficwad. Note that the story is quite erotic and a bit silly, but that was always the author's intent.

I don't recall the Sasquatch wand core, but most of the rest of it seems to fit.

** Good grief. I thought I'd read some really insane fic in the past. This must take some kind of award for being waaaaaay out there.

I'm glad you found it and I'm sad for you that it's still unfinished.
