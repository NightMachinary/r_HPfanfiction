I would like to know Fics that have Harry and Narcissa being married (it doesnt matter, if they have Canon age, so she is older than him or if both have rough the same) for possibly many Years, maybe even Decades. But i would like them to have no Children. The Reason for this, as i would accept it, would be that The Progress of this AU is of course different from the Canon one, so Harry and Narcissa lived different lives than the Canon ones and dont have a desire to have Children, yet. Im ok, if at some Point at the End both change their Mind and decide to make a Family, but it would really be at the end, like in a Epilogue or something.

​

What im uncertain is how this Fic would progress at all. Would it be from the POV of this AU Harry or would Canon harry or Narcissa or both somehow get dragged into this World.

​

I would like if AU Harry and Narcissa would have any important Position in the Magical Society. Like Harry being the Leader or a well known member of an Organization or Group like the Phoenix Order. Narcissa can be in this with her Husband or she they are in separate Groups.

Possible Sex scenes are ok, but im also fine if there are no ones. Harry and Narcissa love each other deeply and have a desire for the other one, so there should be atleast hints, when they got intim.

** Laughing All The Way To London is a time travel fic with Harry/Narcissa. They are not married and have only met a few times so far, I think. It's still in the process of being updated. This is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. Linkffn(13173587)

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No time paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated.
