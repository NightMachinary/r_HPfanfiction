I was wondering what are the best fics where Harry is sent back to the 1970s and James Potter and Lily Evans know from the beginning about the truth? Others don't have to but I want a fic where James and Lily just know.

Bonus points if:

James and Lily are already a couple. (or at least friendly to each other)

Harry travel back with a love interest. (Hermione, Ginny, Daphne, Susan, etc)

Harry is the same age as his parents.
