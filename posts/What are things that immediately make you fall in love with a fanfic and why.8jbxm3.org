** Interactions between characters.

If they are made properly and look real, it's the biggest plus for the story.

Event the greatest plot is usually ruined by cardboard characters.

** I love divergences in character development from canon.

Characters being the same even though they have had totally different lives bothers me even more than canon plot rails.

**** I personally always thought that Harry would've turned out a /lot/ more like his father, James, had James and Lily lived: more arrogant, cocky, spoiled, and like a Gryffindor version of Draco Malfoy, albeit with Harry priding himself on being the son of two, famous war heroes, and not his blood status. Malfoy and a young James Potter even share some of the same lines of dialogue in the books.

That's also precisely the point that Dumbledore himself makes in the books, and why he had Harry grow up with the Dursleys in the first place, even though Dursleys treated Harry terribly in the long run. Yet a lot of the fanfictions I've read where "James and Lily lived to raise Harry" seem to make it out like Lily's presence somehow made Harry the same as he was in the books, which I don't agree with.

***** James' presence would have make Harry cockier, but I don't think he would have been a Gryffindor Draco. James had to change a lot of things for Lily to accept dating him. He certainly would have been much more of a prankster, and more outspoken than in the books (thanks to both James and Lily) and cockier, more spoiled, but not to the same extent as Draco and young James

** An internally consistent, well thought out magic system without random stuff stuck onto it (cough, runes, cough).

A plot not enabled by artificial stupidity. It feels like 70% of fictional plots are based on two people being either stupid or too stubborn to have a genuine conversation, for no reason.

** Realistic character actions and interactions. The reader shouldn't (with rare exception) be clueless as to why a character acts a certain way in whatever situation is being written about. If your viewers are confused (assuming the story isn't about some mystery that's occurring), then you have failed as an author. When I can understand why they act as they do because of good characterization and their personalities play off each other well, I'm probably going to really enjoy the story.

** Logical alternate universes, or topics that touch things that the book overlooks. I've been reading The Artithmancer series and it touches so many things that canon overlooks, like spellcrafting and house elf culture and even the fun parts like the making of the marauder's map. It also puts into light characters that the canon book overlooks, like the Creevy's and Cedric Diggory, Luna Lovegood, etc. I've said it to myself multiple times that this fic is better than the books themselves.

** A different than usual Daphne (non-ice queen, or with a real reason, not just "protect myself" garbo)

An inteligent Harry that makes the most out of the simplest magic available, kinda like "Brightest Witch and the Darkest House" MC does.

A great romance.

Interesting time-travel without paradox.

** I don't know about 'falling in love'. But if the first chapter gives me the sense that writer knows what they are doing and where the story is going and I can see a solid plot set-up happening (and ideally the writer has a good track record for completing fics) then it will give me confidence to keep reading.

** Beautiful descriptions. It's something a bit hard to describe and it's hard to find in fanfiction, but I really appreciate stories that take the time to explore and show a reader the world its characters inhabit, including sound and visuals even if you're only writing brings a story to life.

Something along the lines of "Suddenly, in the moment in which a procession of deportees in striped clothing came out from rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine onto the Place de la Nation, in the middle of a respectful silence which thickened as they passed, suddenly, the sky darkened. A flurry of snow fell, brief but violent, on the flags of the 1st May."

This is a quote from a book, not a fanfiction unfortunately (I'm also translating from french so it doesn't sound half as nice, but its the first example I had on hand), but yes, generally descriptions like these which have a sort of dreamy storytelling quality to them. I've been reading a lot of auto-biographies lately and I really like the way they're narrated. So basically irrelevant of the story, just really well written descriptive passages.

*** I love beautiful descriptions as well, however, it's hard to find a fanfic that does it all throughout a series. I often find a series that starts out with wonderfully descriptive writing only for it to fall away almost completely when the plot/characters take hold.

** Capturing the feeling from the books. Not forgetting the magic. Bonus points for getting the era and the culture just right.

Side characters doing something independently from the protagonist, like talking behind their back and confronting them, or doing something to help; having doubts and emotions and their own motivations. When characters other than the main character go off on their own and surprise you.

An actual plot. If it's a time-travel canon rehash, at least one original and unusual idea is enough.

Anything with Tom Riddle in it /has to/ read like a psychological thriller. I also like mature psychological tension, not like in a B-movie, but where grown men and women deal with the rising tensions from questionable politics and outright war.

Stuff with a unique writing style, too. I remember reading a fic about Snape and the young Death Eaters acting like they were the bright young things in the 1920's, written in a very Evelyn Waugh style, completely forgot what it was called though. It was on ao3.

I also like an occasional wholesomememe-tier story like The Arithmancer where everyone's reasonable and nice and stuff gets done.

This! I will read almost anything so long as it feels authentic to the original writing style. The subtle (and sometimes less-subtle) wit of Rowling's writing is what gives HP a high re-read value to me. I love seeing it in fanfiction, because it makes even trite plots entertaining.

*** The Evelyn Waugh-influenced fic you mention is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/638325][Romance of the Age]] by nimmieamee. She's a fantastic writer, and the pastiche of style and attitude really suit her takedown of the Marauder's generation.

** For me it's bashing or a very out of character portrayal. Dumbledore and Ron are the usual victims. Ron deserves to be relegated to the sidelines, and Dumbledore needs to be shown as the manipulator he is.

To me, this shows that the author has a deep understanding of these characters and really cares about writing an accurate and honest portrayal. Even better when the characters remain 3-dimensional, but Harry Potter is known for mustache twirling ridiculous villains so it is thematically consistent if Dumbledore is just a ridiculous fool. It's a good sign that the author doesn't worship at JKRs altar, nodding along like an imbecile with some of the ridiculous stuff she wrote. It's a good indicator that it might be an interesting fic[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8jbwr2/what_are_things_that_immediately_make_you_nope/][.]]

*** I genuinely can't figure out if you are being deeply sarcastic or absolutely serious. On the off chance it is the latter, I disagree with you almost totally, the bashing of characters is the absolute low hanging fruit that thousands of crappy stories have latched onto. Amplifying any negative trait to the point where characters are unrecognizable and one dimensional has never produced a good story, outside of the odd tongue-in-cheek crack fic that plays it for laughs, and every single other story that was merely poor is turned into steaming garbage by adding bashing into the mix.

If you are being sarcastic then I applaud you for confusing me so much.

** Jedi mind tricks don't work on me. There's nothing that will guarantee that I'll like your fic. If I decide to read it, I'll give it a fair shake--what I think is fair. Tbh, I don't hunt for specific genres anymore. Sure, some things I just won't touch cause it's not my thing, but I don't exclusively acour the fandom for clones of PotDK.
