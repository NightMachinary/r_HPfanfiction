A new dark lord rises. Can be OC or an existing character (Harry, Hermione). Gathering followers, holding secret meetings, learning a lot of unusual magic, all that stuff. Dumbledore and the Ministry are aware that something is up but can't do anything since the new evil organization hasn't done anything illegal yet. Lots of opportunistic influencial people offer to support the group. The new dark lord gets a reputation of being powerful after multiple (legal) displays of power and eventually achieves many goals through intimidation and politics without breaking a single law. Everyone is convinced that there's illegal dark magic going on in secret but nobody can find anything.


** Difficulty: Dark lord is Percy Weasley.

Edit: Additional difficulty: all follower meetings are governed by Robert's Rules.

***** *Robert's Rules of Order*

Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, commonly referred to as Robert's Rules of Order, RONR, or simply Robert's Rules, is the most widely used manual of parliamentary procedure in the United States. It governs the meetings of a diverse range of organizations---including church groups, county commissions, homeowners associations, nonprofit associations, professional societies, school boards, and trade unions---that have adopted it as their parliamentary authority.The manual was first published in 1876 by U.S. Army officer Henry Martyn Robert, who adapted the rules and practice of Congress to the needs of non-legislative societies. Ten subsequent editions have been published, including major revisions in 1915 and 1970. The copyright to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is owned by the Robert's Rules Association, which selects by contract an authorship team to continue the task of revising and updating the book.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.
