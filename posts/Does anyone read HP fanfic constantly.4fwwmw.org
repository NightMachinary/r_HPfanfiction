I read fanfic in short runs every year after I re-read all the HP books. This year I read all of little0bird and I have decided to continue on with all of Northumbrian's work. With the amount stories Northumbrian has completed I suspect it will take me until November/December to finish them all.

So do you guys ever read fanfic constantly? Has anyone read fanfic for most of the year?


** When I first got into fanfic around 10 years ago, yes. It was a combination of two factors: firstly, there was so much to read and secondly, I had yet to develop the standards and preferences which now prevent me from reading most fics. So I just read (almost) anything and everything.

Today, 99% of fics I see I don't like the look of. And of the 1% I do like the look of, I've already read almost all of them. So my fanfic consumption is now mostly limited to new releases.

*** Statement: Agreement.

Statement: Reading actual published books that have been written by competent authors and gone through a proper editing process enables one to see just how incompetent most fanfic authors are at the use of language.

** I've read fanfics about 95% of the time for almost 3 years now, and I read a fucking LOT. If it's a choice between re-reading a fic i've read a couple of times or reading a traditional book I'm just not getting into, I do the fic. I used to worry about that; now I just don't care.

*** I'm at least a year and a half, myself. Why bother buying a new book when I have an entire freaking library right at the tip of my fingers? I mean, yeah, a lot of it's shit. But you can't have everything, right?

**** I feel that way about actual libraries. I've come across books that /must/ have been independently published because they didn't look like they had seen an editor.

** I read at least a couple hours everyday, I feel I have a much better grasp on what makes a good story (to me, at least?) sometimes it feels like I have to try 4 or 5 stories just to find one that I like now. But the Gems in the rough are worth it.

** Not sure if this makes any sense, but I spend more time reading /about/ fan fics than I spend reading them. I'm obsessed with the culture itself, I guess.

** Used to take up most of my time, but lately, not much fics are catching my interest.

That was during my college days, when I didn't have time to read much. Now with a lot of free time, I'm drawn to more time-consuming activities.

I do still check out fic updates almost every day.

** I read HP fanfiction every day and have for about three years straight now. 50% of my free time is spent reading fanfiction and 50% doing other stuff. I also read fanfiction for about 20-30 minutes before bed most nights. I read a variety of pairings/tropes so there is ALWAYS something new for me to read. I think I've re-read only about 7 or 8 fics so far.

** I started reading fanfic when I was about 13 - 5 years ago now - and I read constantly. Now I'm that way where I don't read it too much, I have to be in the mood for it and more often than not I read a story that I know I like! I hate being disappointed in a story that I thought would be amazing, so I stick to what I know is good! I think if a story can stand up to 4/5 rereads, then it must be well written.

** All the time. I've got a reading list of around 80 that I cycle through. Probably read 70-80% of them at least once this year.

** I follow a lot of WIP stories, so I'll read them whenever they're updated. Colubrina updates rather frequently (once a day for "Rebuilding" and biweekly/monthly for most of her other stories) and the other stories/authors I follow are more sporadic but seem to update every couple of months. If I see a story that I like, I'll read it over the course of a week, same as if I read a book.

** I hesitate to say I read it constantly, but yes it does seem like a majority of my free time is taken up by it, or writing it.

Of course I have only recently started reading and writing so the novelty is still there for me

** I used to. I probably still would, if there was enough new and interesting stories to read. These days, if I want to read something, I almost always end up having to reread an older story instead,

** I've read Fanfiction nearly constantly, or at least more often than not since shortly before OotP was released. I've read a lot of crap stories, I've reread a lot of stories. I've cut back in the past few weeks, but that's only because I switched phones and my library was corrupted and I'm working to rebuild it.

** Kinda. I'm usually rereading stuff, too, since not much good (and complete) stuff is out there that I haven't already read.

I've started putting real books back into the mix, but it's still 2+ fanfics between every real book. Less recently, it was all fanfics, all the time.

** I have to alternate between HP fics and other fandoms (or, you know, actual books) or I start confusing what happened in which story. Or, they have to have no overlap, like a 4th year redo and a post-Hogwarts.

That said, I have definitely been reading more HP than anything else for the past 2 years. And I generally read 4-5 hours a day if I can.
