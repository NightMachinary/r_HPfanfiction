This is definitely a long shot but if anyone might know this fic, this is the place!

I've been trying to hunt down this Romione fic that I read ages ago for a few months now. It was one of the first fics I read and I'd love to find it and read it again. I remember it being on a lesser known fanfiction sight when I found it, but it could've been listed elsewhere as well. The site was at the very least HP specific and maybe specific to Romione. I remember the site being the colors of Gryffindor.

As far as the story itself, it was pretty long. Ron and Hermione were both older (around 30s) and I believe Ron was an auror. I can't remember the reason, but Hermione was staying in a cabin in the woods and Ron found her there. Pretty sure they were the only characters, mature rating, PWP maybe.

Again, it's a SUPER long shot, but if you have any guesses let me know!


** Probably something on Checkmated? It sounds vaguely familiar, but I've got no suggestion for you I'm afraid
