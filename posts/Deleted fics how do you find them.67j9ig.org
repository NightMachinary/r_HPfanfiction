I"m looking for this fic I found via scryer.

Title: Flames of the Phoenix by silent song of shadows Summary: The age old question: Which comes first? The Potter or the Trouble? Either way, both are here and Melody is stuck trying to figure out who she is and what exactly she's supposed to do, think, or even feel about a certain attractive wizard who is totally and completely to blame for the complications in her life. Time travel but no horcruxes or hallows. Don't own Harry Potter

** Step 1: See if Fiction Hunt has it. If not, proceed to step two.

Step 2: Insane Googling. If this fails, proceed to step three.

Step 3: Ask around here. If that fails, proceed to step four.

Step 4: Sacrifice a Goat.

** The author's profile is still there. Have you contacted them? Seems to me that should be your first port of call.

Anyway I know people often do try to track down deleted fics and sometimes succeed, but please do take a moment to consider that the writers probably had good personal reasons for removing their stories.

We all know that when something is on the intenet it's there forever, but would you want somebody raking something up from your past like that?
