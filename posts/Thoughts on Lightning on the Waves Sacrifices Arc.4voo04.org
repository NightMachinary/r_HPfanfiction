So I just finished these, (a bit late to the party but hey I had a lot of reading to do.) Mainly I'd just like to discuss it. Firstly I loved the authors usage of Swinburne's poems. The lines added some interesting weight to the story, and specifically the character of Evan Rosier. But what I liked most was the way he described the magic system. It was something I hadn't seen before(in fanfiction), and it made the characters power believable. Because at a certain point, casting spells just doesn't do it. Like the canon duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, it was more like they used their magic as extensions of their will than anything else.

It had its flaws. So long. Way too long. Longer than the actual HP series. And the entire middle arc with [[/spoiler][Falco Parkinson]] was a little unnecessary, but the fifth book fight with Voldemort was amazing. Not a huge fan of the slash either, but as it wasn't the central point of the fic I didn't really mind it much.

Anyway I could go on further, but tell me strangers. Thoughts? Or am I the lone remaining wanderer of this old series.


** I really feel like this is the type of story that has to be your entry in to the world of fanfiction, while you still have the rose-tinted glasses on and before you become jaded. The type of story that you look back on and have nothing but good memories of, despite having been ten years ago. For me, that story is the Hero Trilogy, but I know if I were to read it now, I would hate it. And, every time I've tried to get into Sacrifices, I just can't get into it at all.

*** Mm, I don't know if that's true.

You do need to know what you're getting yourself into. 3 million words, slash, powerful!Harry, slytherin!Harry, Light and Dark, manipulative!Dumbledore, wrong BWL, it gets pretty dark at times, the "good guys" are all quite flawed which some people apparently don't like, etc.

Maybe someone who's been in the fandom longer than me can correct me, but... when it started most of these things weren't the tired cliches already present in thousands of other (shitty) fics. It also handles most of it better than the vast majority of fics. It's full of really extensive worldbuilding. While Harry is powerful, he can't just steamroll his enemies. They're powerful too, and most of them are much, much more knowledgeable.

It also, as much as I like a long, epic fic, probably doesn't need to be nearly as long as it is. Large chunks could probably be cut without affecting the overarching story much.

I've read the whole thing twice, and I didn't hate it the second time around though by like the 5th book I was like "holy fuck this is so loooong, why did I decide to read this /again/?"

** I ended up dropping out in the fifth book. The tipping point was when I realized I was getting a headache just trying to keep track of all of the sideplots upon sideplots, while simultaneously Harry had something dramatic and/or terrible happen to him constantly, every week, with no breaks in between. It just became exhausting.

Also, the whole pureblood "dance" traditions thing was just way, way over the top, and it bothered me the whole time. Any society that had every single move dictated by a relentless series of absurdly-complicated social patterns would grind itself into stagnation almost instantly- no one could possibly keep track of it all, much less have it all memorized by the time they're 11. And it double couldn't work with non-purebloods in the mix; forget being rude or not understanding the culture, non-purebloods would have to form an entire parallel society because they would have no way to interact with purebloods as they didn't know that the first conversation of 14 in order to get a contract signed needed to be accompanied by gift of significance level 3.

*** The pureblood "dance" traditions is one of the best thing about this series, it portrays the magical world as a fully developed civilization, as oppose to a mimic of human society. With older civilizations, its completely reasonable to have long drawn out civilities that dedicate multiple aspects of daily and public life. The ancient Chinese for example, the process marriage between two significant families can take years, with specific times and dates for different gifts, meetings, negotiations, symbolic gestures, each layered with specific meaning. Skipping a step or making a bad move is usually taken as rude and disrespectful, and result in resentment.

Bitter feuds that lasts generations between family is not uncommon either, there are STILL certain families in modern times that have rules to never marry someone with specific family name due to historical disagreement, to break the rule is disrespecting family history and may get kick off the family book, 100 years ago they would get kicked off the inheritance list as well. Once in a while these things gets on the news, and you see reports on how a brave couple broke some 800-year family edict, and made family history.

** I actually really enjoyed the length of it. The problem I always end up having with fanfiction is I go in looking to find more of a specific idea, like an adopted Harry au or a slytherin au, but nothing really touches enough on the idea for me to be able to walk away happy. With Sacrifices, when I finished I felt like I'd seen everything I'd wanted to see and more and I could walk away happy.

I kinda feel the same about the Parkinson arc. I mean I enjoyed it, but I think I would've been just as happy not having read it.

What'd you think of the worldbuilding for the Purebloods? That was one of my favorite aspects of the whole series. Always felt like the canon worldbuilding was just eh, like there was so much more and what was there just wasn't enough or made no sense.

*** That was a brilliant aspect. The level of detail the author crafted really created an intricate feel to the society instead of JKRs rich old people who hate those uppity outsiders. The detail made me understand the pure blood point of defending culture and heritage. Plus some of the rituals were just very cool.

** I re-start this series about once a year because I always quit around end of book 6/beginning of book 7. It's just too damn long, plus it just gets so dark around book 6. I love it, though.

** It is indeed far too long.

One place it really fell down for me was the pureblood rituals and traditions. The author tried to make it seem like there was a large, complex set of traditions, but in reality, parts would be lost on all but the most assiduous practitioners, and there would only be a small number of traditions remaining.

And the amount of action required to convey a meaning was not appropriate. You're wearing red and gold, which means you have righteous anger and feel wronged. That would take probably three cultivars in the language of flowers, and there are a lot more types of flower than recognizable, dyeable colors.

The first half (books 1-5) are pretty good, but I can't go much past that. (I did, once.) Falco Parkinson was a good addition, in my eye. Harry's constant instinct to diminish himself and give of himself and forgive can get grating simply because it's the same conflict repeated again and again. That so many characters fall so hard makes it rather grim.

I enjoyed it, but I don't want to read it again.

** I've only read through the 5th story.

I thought the author did a great job with world building. It's some of the best I've seen in fanfiction. However, the plot gets extremely bogged down with side plots and side plots for the side plots, meaning, oftentimes there is just way too much going on by way of the plot. Also, the author spends an inordinate amount of plot time on the many OCs and that just adds to the often drudgery-like feel of the story. But that said, I do eventually plan to read all seven parts. Eventually.

***** The slash doesn't happen until book 5, and its limited to light kissing in book 5. You can at least enjoy book 1-4 free of romance. The story itself is not romance focused.

** I'm reading it right now and I'm on the fourth book. I like it a lot so far. At first, it was difficult to get used to the idea of the characters being so different...but I kept reminding myself that that was the point of the story and then I was able to continue reading. A lot of people say that they give up around the 5th or 6th book because it becomes very repetitive, and I can't comment on that yet. However, if it continues as it is, I don't think I'll give up on it. I love how the story looks further into magical creatures and really explores magic. It gets a little annoying the time with the whole "magic levels" like it's DBZ or soemthing, but that's minor, and you're definitely right that it's a great way to describe magic.

I don't mind slash. I got into fanfiction because I always loved to read but didn't have any access to many books, so I have read some crazy stuff. I once even read an original story about cat people because the world building was absolutely amazing, so slash is not a problem for me at all. So far, the length hasn't bothered me. I guess as the books continue and get longer, it may become a problem, but so far it hasn't been an issue. I like long stories. What was your favorite book out of all of them?

*** Hands down 5th book. If for nothing else the battles in it are truly epic in scope and magic. I can agree the repetition can be an issue though not for me since my obsessive nature would never allow me to stop 5 books into a series. The magic levels I honestly never thought of in that way til it was mentioned here. Mostly I just thought of it as a fuel tank the way a vehicle would have.

**** Well that makes me excited to continue reading :)

Every story has it's downsides, to be honest. Small things that bother you as you read it. So far, I'm loving this series. Even if I didn't I couldn't help but admire the author for sticking through the whole thing.
