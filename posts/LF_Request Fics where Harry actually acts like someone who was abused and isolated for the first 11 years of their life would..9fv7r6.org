Fics where Harry has trouble bonding with others and leading a normal life, due to the abuse at the hands of the Dursleys.


** /Brutal Harry/ linkffn(7093738). And see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8pf2rg/lf_abused_harry_that_doesnt_suddenly_become_well/]]

EDIT: I also just thought of this one. It wasn't for me (and I honestly don't recall the ending or even much of the plot beyond the first several chapters), but it might be something you're interested in. /A Patrol Changes Everything./ linkffn(5953863)

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

But a narrative can still be compelling and a character likable that still has reactions and behaviours worked into the writing without obvious explanations pointing at why. Realism innit.

  Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.

** - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL fic with Harry sorted into Slytherin. Unsympathetic James, Dumbledore and Ron. Life with the Dursleys gives him intense trust issues, he can't stand being touched, etc.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]] - A WBWL fic. In my opinion, the most realistic exploration of what Harry would be like if he grew up with no loving caregivers (low self esteem, depression, trust issues, vulnerable to manipulation). Gets very dark.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12365453/1/The-Memento][The Memento]] - Harry is highly introverted in this fic due to no experience making friends before Hogwarts. Also, unlike many fics, he actually has realistic learning difficulties that you would expect from a child with poor eyesight who suffered heavy neglect from his caregivers and didn't have access to age appropriate reading material for most of his young life.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - The plot of this fic revolves around Harry realizing the full extent of his abuse and slowly beginning the process of recovery. (Submissive behavior, hording food, residual health issues from malnutrition, etc.) Contains Dumbledore, Ron and James bashing.

Saving Harry by The Seeker on SIYE fits what you want pretty well.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

*** Just a note to others, this is not what you're looking for if you're interested in seeing Harry dealing with his canon abuse. This fic took the abuse much further, and in a different direction.

*Edit:* I meant catechism here, but the same could be said of both to differing degrees.
