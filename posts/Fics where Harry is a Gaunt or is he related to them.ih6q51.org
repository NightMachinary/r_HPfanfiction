I don't care if he has the last name or not, just that he's a Gaunt in blood. It can also be a time travel fic, in which Harry adopts the name Gaunt instead of Peverell or whatever the authors usually use. I don't really care about the context or the plot, just that this is an important and repeated detail.

(Forgive me for my grammar/spelling/way of expressing myself. English is not a first language).
