So I just finished Ectomancer which is sadly cancelled so I had to come back here

The first thing I am looking for is anything similar to Ectomancer at all, if a fan went ahead and continued it that would be even better.

The second thing I am looking for is a muggleborn dark lord, especially one's development as a dark lord.

Finally, the third thing I am looking for is any fix in which a muggleborn, preferably main character, is actually amazed by magic and has a drive to learn it, not for the sake of grades like Hermione, but because it is magic.
