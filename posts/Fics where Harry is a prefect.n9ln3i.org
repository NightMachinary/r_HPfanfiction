Harry was made prefect instead of Ron

Non-BWL Harry, he is Head Boy here but IIRC he was also a prefect before.

  After an attack that robbed him of his beloved, Harry Potter is given a chance to go back and stop Voldemort and save those most precious to him. But Death, unwavering and unstoppable, will have its due. Always. !MOD! Harry. Strong Harry. Time travel.

  There are two similarities between Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass. Both of them are partial to their mothers and both of them hate each other passionately. When they are elected as the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts, can they put aside their personal issues and work together? AU with Neville as BWL. Rated M for multiple reasons.
