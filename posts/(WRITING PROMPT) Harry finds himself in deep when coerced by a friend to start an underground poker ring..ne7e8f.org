I always wanted to write this but never knew where to start. Bonus if the friend is an MC Slytherin muggle born or half-blood, but whatever suits your fancy. Never seen anything along these lines other than weird harem/pure blood coercion poker fics (no judgement- well, a little judgement lol). Thoughts? Recs? Even writing a drabble in the comments would be awesome! Thx!

"Shut up Harry and take our bets!"

** That's . . . a pretty strange idea. If you have no idea where to start, try to answer some questions about the story to at least determine the starting point and the goal of the fic. Here's an example (though you can totally change the answer) :

1. *Who is the MC?*\\
   You mentioned a MC in Slytherin for the bonus point. There are no know Muggleborn in Slytherin around Harry's age, and I'm too lazy to create an OC, so let's use the arguably Canon character of Tracey Davies.

2. *Why do they want to start an underground poker ring in the first place?*\\
   Fanon usually make her a Half Blood, so let's say she is an ambitious girl who decided to start a Poker Ring because, being surrounded by a bunch of Heirs way wealthier than her, she decided to start a little side business to "redirect" the galleons into a more worthy cause, her own.

3. *What is this MC relation to Harry?*\\
   Once again, I'm too lazy to go into details so let's keep something simple. The MC (or Tracey now) has a semi-friendly relationship with Harry after she started to partner with him in Potion. Harry's presence means that she doesn't have to partner with a moron like Goyle, and her own presence partially protect Harry from Snape since she is pretty good in the subject. With time, they decided to other was bearable and would give mutual help with other subjects like Defence of Botanic.

4. *Why do they need Harry specifically?*\\
   Let's say that she already did a test run in her Common Room, and that Malfoy refused to pay when he lost. The poker ring is illegal so she can't go to a teacher, and she is bad at Défense so she couldn't use force against him. The problem is now that she left Malfoy go consequence free, the other will also refuse to pay. Worse, her idea was a big success and now she has to organize a poker night or suffer the displeasure of her roommates. With her back against the wall, she decided to recruit Harry as an enforcer. Harry is good enough to handle Malfoy, and his reputation means that most people won't even try to start trouble with him. Also he is pretty honest, and would probably not try to cheat her with the profits.

5. *How can they coerce Harry to help?*\\
   I like to keep it simple. Let's say that Harry has a crush on Daphne Greengrass, who is part of the poker ring. Joining in would give him more chance to interact with her, while showing her his "cool" side.

*** After answering these questions, here's a short drabble I wrote (though it ended up not being that short). Keeping in mind that I'm clearly not an author (separated into 2 comments because Reddit have a 10 000 characters by comment limit):\\
“Please Harry, I'm begging you!” said the girl, throwing herself at Harry's feet, her eyes filled with tears.

Harry quickly looked around making sure that there was no witness to the scene. Luckily for him the girl, or Tracey Davies, had chosen an isolated alcove with nobody around when she said she asked to have a talk with him.

Knowing the girl, she had probably planned to beg from the start. After years of partnering with her in potion, and sometimes in other subjects, Harry thought he had a pretty good handle on the girl, he would even consider her as a friend though more distant than Ron and Hermione. Yet, she still managed to come up with ridiculous ideas that totally threw him off, her last one being an example of that.

“Why would you even want to start a poker ring anyways?”, he asked, unable to contain the curiosity in his voice.

The moment he said these words, any trace of distress disappeared from Tracey's face, replaced by a smile. Harry had a feeling from the start that she was putting a show from the start, making use of his “Hero complex” as she liked to call it. Still, it was nice to have the confirmation.

“Have you ever seen my roommates?” she said, “All of them have more money than sense, and keep getting more money from their families than they could possibly use while at school”. Harry could clearly hear the jealousy in their voice, with a touch of longing.

After years of conversation with her, Harry knew how much Tracey could be jealous of the other student in Slytherin. While he would not consider her a poor, if her new robes and general demeanour were anything to go by, their Slytherin's year had an amazing concentration of young Heirs and Heiress. Of course, anyone who had been around Malfoy for more than 5 minutes would have heard boast about his family money, but even the other member of House seemed to come from Old money, never wanting of anything. Harry doubted that Tracey could even compare to people like Crabbe and Goyle, who followed Malfoy as goons, not to mention that her status as a Half-Blood would probably mark her as inferior by the idiots that inhabited the dungeon.

“So what? You just want their money?”, he asked.

“Of course I want their money! These idiots get load of Galleons from their family and only use it to buy some Butterbeers at Hogsmeade. If we pool all their allowances together, there is probably enough to buy a place in Diagon Alley. They have enough to open a business and waste it!” She was getting more and more excited along her tirade.

It was not that Harry ever had any doubt about her place in Slytherin, but if he had any, just hearing her talk about her dream would have been enough to convince him she belonged there.

“And? If you have everything planned out, why would you need my help?”.

That was the heart of the problem. While Tracey always had some sort of plans to fund her dream shop, she was the kind to work alone. Harry usually never heard anything about her plots until everything was over, and he could not understand why she would ask him to help this time.

His question seemed to calm her, and she even seemed -- was that embarrassment? “The truth is that I already made a test run in the Common Room” she started meekly.

“Everything went fine at first, people were having fun and I even threw some good hands so the profits would be split. But then Draco decided to be an idiot as usual! Who even goes all in with a pair of double! And now he refuses to pay what he owns!”.

“So what?” said Harry. “Just goes to a teacher or force him to pay.”

“Betting is illegal at Hogwarts; I would be expelled or poisoned if Snape ever heard about it! And I'm not like you, battling monster and Dark Wizards during my day offs. Malfoy would destroy me in a duel and then he would probably force me to pay him money because I offended his family or anything. But now everyone now that I let him go without any repercussion, so they probably refuse to pay when they lose. And since they had fun, they want me to do another night, but I can't do it if I have to pay for their lose, but I can't refuse because then they will blame me, and Pansy will be a nightmare and Millicent . . .”

Harry stopped her rambling. “So, your solution is to call me in.”

“Yes!” she exclaimed. “You are good at duelling so you can probably handle Malfoy and his goons. You just have to stop him from playing until he pays anyways. And with your reputation, the others probably won't even try to cheat because everyone is terrified that you would snap and destroy them like You-Know-Who”.

Harry could feel his face burning. His friends in Gryffindor all treated him like a normal person, but conversations like this made it hard to forget the ridiculous reputations his adventures gave him over the years. Just last week, Ron had told him with glee about how some 2nd year Hufflepuff were convinced his eyes had the power of the Killing Curse.

Sensing his weakness, Tracey kept her attack. “If you do this for me, I'll split the profit with you, and introduce you to Daphne. And don't say you don't care about her; I saw you stare during dinner.”

“Now that I think about it, I may even have a conversation with her tonight”, she added with a smile.

If Harry had been embarrassed by her comment about his fame, he now wanted to hide under a rock. He was convinced that he had managed to be discreet with his crush on Daphne Greengrass, but if Tracey knew about, who knew who else did. And now, she was even holding it over his head to force his cooperation.

“Fine”, he said, forced to admit defeat. “I'll deal with Malfoy for you and help with your plot.”

“Perfect!”, she was so glad of her victory that she was literally jumping of excitement. “I'm planning of doing another night this Friday, I have everything, but you can come in advance and help me organize things”.

“Where do you even plan of doing it?” asked Harry. “It's not like I can come to your Common Room.” While Harry could in fact go into the Slytherin Common Room, some secrets, such as the Maraudeur's Map and his Invisibility Cloak were best kept quiet around Tracey, unless she found new ways or ordering him around.

“That may be a problem,” admitted Tracey, “and Blaise also said he had some friend in Ravenclaw that wanted to join”. She seemed to mull the problem in her head for a moment, before asking: “Can't we use that Magic Room? The one you used for your secret club last year”.

“The Room of Requirement?” said Harry. “I'd rather not show it to too many people, and she had been malfunctioning recently. I can't open it sometimes.”

“Pity. Though you'll have to show me sometimes, it seems amazing”. She kept pondering for a bit before sighing. “I guess we will have to find an empty classroom and pray to not be caught them” she finally said.

Harry could already see the risks of this plan. If he was being coerced into joining an underground poker ring, he had rather not be caught the first night. He was thinking about potential place to play before he was suddenly struck by an idea.

“The Chamber of Secret!” he exclaimed. “The entrance is in Moaning Myrtle bathroom so nobody ever goes there, and nobody else than me can open the Room. It's perfect. Though we will have to clean the bones, and the Basilisk must be very rotten”.

He interrupted himself when he saw the shocked look on Tracey's face. “You found the Chamber of Secrets” she said slowly “and there is a dead Basilisk inside. You solve one of the biggest mysteries of Hogwarts and just drop it as if it was nothing. Damn Gryffindors.”

“But who cares, it seems perfect!”, her spirit came back as fast as it had left, and Harry idly wondered what it would take to truly shock her. “Lead the way, I want to see what we have to do before dinner!”.

And with what, she left their alcove and started prancing toward the stairs, muttering a happy tune. Shaking his head, Harry slowly followed behind her. Tracey always had crazy idea, but at least it would be entertaining.
