** Very challenging...

Well, to start, for Vernon Dursley to be a good man he would have to act ethically (or, at least, try to act ethically). The main unethical behaviour of his in canon is his treatment of Harry, which is widely considered child abuse (I have seen some people say it wasn't /exactly/ child abuse, but I don't think that's a relevant discussion here). So in order for Vernon to be a good man his treatment of Harry has to be morally justified, meaning we'd have to explain that there is some child abuse which is not inherently immoral.

Child abuse /is/ inherently immoral. The only argument I can give in Vernon's favour is that maybe he didn't actually see Harry as a child. Maybe he was so ignorant about wizards in general that he didn't even think Harry was a child but perceived him more as an alien of sorts, a real-life threat inside a child's body.

That's the /only/ argument I can think of and I don't even think it's canonically justified, since he labels Harry as 'boy' throughout the series, which would be a weird term to use if the above were true. So I'd say that canonically he perceives Harry as a boy and his canonical actions are abusive, so we can't argue he was a good man.

From a fanfiction perspective, if you wanted to make Dursley a good man you'd have to change on of the above. Either he has to think of Harry as something less than human (this wouldn't make his abuse universally justifiable, however) or he'd have to change his actions to something less than abuse.

** People are afraid of things they don't know and Vernon knew very little about magic. Perhaps he thought it evil. So MAYBE you could say that how he acted towards Harry was him trying to protect his family from it and maybe Harry himself too (stopping him from going to Hogwarts)? This is a real longshot.

And he must have been good at his job, since they lived in Surrey ( I understand it's expensive). Does that count for anything, lol?

  Getting expelled from Smeltings was probably the best thing to happen to Vernon. Finishing her Nursing degree was probably the best thing to happen to Petunia. In this universe, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of a very different Dursley family.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!
