What I'm talking about is small- but also large-fry things; Gravity, Particle Physics, Quantum Physics, Astrophysical processes and objects.

In essence, I suppose the question would be "Is physics entirely non-magical?"

IMHO, I think it's far more interesting if the two areas, Muggle Science and Magical Research, mesh in ways that make it impossible to find the whole entire truth if one is only trying to find it from one side. There's a few objects and concepts that would be particularily interesting when viewed with this concept in mind - especially their possible magical effects.

For example, there's the (now confirmed) existence of Black Holes in the depths of space, points in space where matter and energy are so concentrated that the resulting gravity makes their escape velocity larger than the speed of light, which results in the appearance of a perfectly uniform black sphere with an immense pull that nothing can escape from, not even light itself. If anything falls into a Black Hole, it is gone forever. What might this structure's influence on magic be, especially spatial and temporal magics, like Apparition, spatial expansion and time turners? In proximity of structures such as a black hole, time becomes distorted compared to the rest of the universe, and it's theorized that /inside/ a black hole, the roles of space and time switch places, making the only direction in which you could escape it's pull /backwards in time/, and the only place you can approach the singularity at the center. What would a time-turner, a device that allows you to travel backwards in time, do in conditions like this, seeing as how it gives an option for this escape route? Would it even function? What about apparition, which functions like a wormhole - a structure very similar to a black hole, and one which would be massively disrupted by the immense gravity well? Or perhaps the magical component of the spell has the capability to pierce the restrictions of physics and break free from the event horizon, giving wizards an (extremely reckless) way of examining a naked singularity in all its glory. All in all, Black Holes exist mostly because they have to for relativity to make sense - they are what happens when escape velocity is higher than the cosmic speed limit discovered by Einstein.

Second thought - it's established that Astronomy is important in magic, and although it's not canon, I refuse to believe that a seven-year course would really be a non-elective if it had zero influence on magic. In this sense, what would the magical astronomical properties of some cosmic structures, like Black Holes, Supernovae, Nebulae or Pulsars be? Does a star in an established constellation going supernova have an effect on magic as a whole, like Orion's belt breaking in the middle (hypothetically) or Taurus losing a horn (hypothetically)? What is the effect of Saguttarius A*'s (the central black hole of our galaxy) presence in the Sagittarius constellation? What will happen when the Andromeda Galaxy comes closer and closer, and becomes a more prominent part of the night sky, and what will happen once our galaxy and it collide, throwing the entire nearby cosmos in complete disarray?

On a less grandiose note, consider Antimatter, and the symbolism that can be attached to it. Antimatter is simply matter with the opposite charge to normal matter, some sort of "twin" or "mirror" to normal matter, which annihilates normal matter explosively if they come in contact. At the beginning of time, there was much antimatter in the universe - yet a little bit less than normal matter. For every billion particles of antimatter, there was one more particle of normal matter, and the universe we live in now is the result of this remaining matter. From all these, you can attach some pretty dark and evil symbolism to antimatter and anti-energy/anti-gravity - a primordial destructive force which indiscriminately destroys everything in its path, even at the price of its own existence.

Lastly, the False Vacuum - a concept in quantum physics, though thankfully purely hypothetical. The theory states that the Higgs field, the quantum field that "gives" objects their mass and in fact allows mass itself to exist as a concept, may not be at its lowest, most stable and most entropic energy state, something the universe always tends towards. It instead says that it may exist in a state of "pseudo-stability", a point at which external energy would be needed in the field before it could collapse further than its initial state. Furthermore, the theory states that through an effect called "quantum tunneling", which is the spontaneous and random teleportation of a particle on the quantum scale, this field could be "kicked" out of its momentary state and collapse into a state of full stability, which would release enough energy to get the rest of the field surrounding the initial point to collapse as well, causing a cascade effect of "true vacuum", which would rob the universe of the concept of "mass" as it passes by, coupled with a shockwave of pure energy that would incinerate anything. Now that that's out of the way, what would the effect of such a thing be? Symbolism attached to it would be bitter-sweet - at the same time a return to a "true state", a more "pure" state, but also a total destruction of anything in its path. A cleansing fire that resets the cosmos as it passes, making it more "right", but in the process violently destroys anything.


** I need a story where Muggle Scientists get together with the Department of Mysteries to discover what would happen if a brave explorer used a Time Turner inside of a Black Hole, like, right now.

BTW, False Vaccuums are scary as fuck. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijFm6DxNVyI][Kurzgesagt made a video on it.]]

*** So I actually wrote this just now

Just have to wait the 12 hour period for new users, then I'll put a link here (a new comment so the alert goes through)

** The basis of black holes is relativity and the fact that nothing can travel faster than light, as you said. In fact, it can be derived from the basic princinciple of causality. This principle stands in a fundmental conflict with the way magic works. Apparition and Time travel come to mind, two things that could REALLY break physics, meaning it stands in direct conflict with fundamental principles. This conflict makes it impossible for me to think about physics and magic together too formally.

I think Harry Potter magic is just classic children fantasy: Not too well thought out, but really poetic at the same time. And I have to say, with what we already discovered about particles and weird solid state theories (superconduction comes to mind), there is no way muggles would not find out about magic.

About the Higgs field, the process you described is called spontaneous symmetry breaking and happened with the Big Bang. The vacuum state of the Higgs field jumped to a non-zero value, whose potential is the source of mass for elementary particles, but NOT for macroscopic objects. No loss of mass, no shockwave, sorry to disappoint you ;)
