As the title says, I'm looking for a H/Hr fanfic to read, preferably a time travel one and M rated


** *All Our Yesterdays by SallyJAvery* linkffn(12820671) fits this. It's a one shot, but it's one of the best HHr I've read.

Think a darker Groundhog Day with a little mystery.

  This story was written as a gift for Olivie Blake, in the grand tradition of giving her murder for her birthday, and since I know that she enjoys the particular flavour of Harmony. It was partly inspired by Groundhog Day, but with the darker twist of Edge of Tomorrow. EWE.

*** Also check out *Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak* linkffn(6033933) if you haven't read it already, although the time travel aspect is only the focus of the first eight chapters or so.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** linkffn(6780275) - The Last Casualties by muggledad

Instead of killing James and Lily, Voldemort put them into some kinda time stasis for 13 years intending that they would come out in a world ruled by him. unfortunately for him, everything else pretty much happens as in canon. James and Lily rejoin the timeline at the start of the triwizard tournament

the author kind of rushes through getting the potters reestablished as a family in the first few chapters, everything feels very contrived and convenient. but if you stick with it, it gets fairly enjoyable

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr
