I have read a few of these and I just like the idea of a motherly or even grandmother like plot. I read one where McGonagall was lily's birth mother. It was really good.

Ps. If you can find the fic were Harry ends up finding out during 4th year. There was one like that which was really good but I can't remember what it was.
