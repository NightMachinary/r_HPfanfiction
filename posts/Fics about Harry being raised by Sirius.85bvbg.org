Suddenly found myself in want of a good fic in which Harry is raised by Sirius, and not the Dursleys! Any good ones out there? I remember I read some a few years back, but really I've mostly ever read Marauder Era fanfics.


** Have you tried the Innocent series? It's on the 4th book so far. Gets a little canon rehashy at times but is overall really good and really well written! Sirius kidnaps harry at age 8 and it goes from there. First one is linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** I'm reading this right now and god is it just me or is Harry age 9 going on 20? Feels like they've written him as an adult, not a child. The story and plot is good though. It works well. I wish they could have aged harry a decent amount, but that wouldn't work. :/

** The Wise One trilogy by FarrenMaddox is a well-written but also unusual example of what you are after, especially the first and the third parts (I somewhat dislike the second part due to canon station following in year 5 despite wildly different prior history). Here's the first one: linkffn(4062601).

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.
