Im looking foe fics where Harry is studying alternative branches of magic, such as rituals, druidic magic, enchanting, alchemy, creature magic, that such of thing. Anyone got good stories with a focus on such?


** Here's a good one about Harry learning necromancy to revive his sister. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/]]

** A lot of Dark!Harry fics have an emphasis on forbidden Magicks like rituals and necromancy, if you need specifics I can think of quite a few but most of what I read is slash

This is one of the best fics when it comes to inventive use of magic. [Be warned though that it plays fast and loose with the canon magic rules.] There's unique necromancy, creepy rituals, magical submarines, super powerful occlumency, constant use and abuse of things like imperius, polyjuice and fidelius, wandless magic that makes sense and much more.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
