Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality: linkffn(5782108)

#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

DID YOU KNOW THIS STORY HAS IT'S OWN [[http://www.hpmor.com/][WEBSITE]] AND [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][WIKIPEDIA PAGE?]] YA DO NOW!

according to Wikipedia's shitty Synopsis, not provided by yours truly

#+begin_quote
  At Hogwarts, this alternate universe Harry first attempts to apply the scientific method to the study of magic. The story proceeds to describe a more complicated system of politics in Magical Britain than found in the original books, with Harry finding a mentor in Quirrell, unaware he is possessed by Lord Voldemort. The story ends with Voldemort's defeat but Dumbledore's banishment to an alternate dimension.
#+end_quote

This sums up the story, but it doesn't sum up how ABSOLUTELY BRAIN MELTINGLY DULL THIS STORY IS.

Reading this story, is like opening up The Prince or the Communist Manifesto as an edgy 13 year old. You think "hey If i read this and learn these big words the seniors out back smoking pot are using I'll be sure to get into their club" and then you try reading those big words and you instantly close the book and realize how fucking stupid you really are.

Lets sum up the first chapter,

Harry is a nerd who's entire room, his entire fucking room is covered in book cases. This boy has so many damn books that he's using books to stack books to show off MORE BOOKS. This is boy is canon Hermione's wet dream personified, now all he needs is a swimming pool full of ink and we're in business.

Our hero everyone is introduced as Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, because you thought Lord Harry James Potter-Gryffindor-Dumbledore was bad.

Harry's relatives his Aunt and his Uncle named Not Vernon are busy arguing about Magic, side note the explanation for why Petunia isn't a horse in this universe is because she asked Lilly to unhorsafy her using her magic, this also had the side affect of making Petunia's natural attraction skills NOT roll at less than 5 so now she attracts nerds instead of Elephants.

While these two argue about the validity of Magic and try and *Rationalize it* -wiggles eyebrows- Harry "I'm a mothafuckin genius" Potter-Evans-Not Dursely steps in and sciences the shit out of them and gets them to agree to disagree... he quotes some book that I as a 24 year old history major have no fucking clue about, and fails to even get his little Pyrrhic victory, instead he just dips out to his room while Petunia continues to argue with her husband.

Deciding to cut out the middle man and to show those darn adults that he's to smart for them, Jimmy Neutron writes to Octagonal and basically says to her "Science real magic fake don't @ me nerd" to get her to show up at his house to prove that the Earth is flat and that the tooth fairy is indeed very very real.

With that some creepy old lady takes his letter and Harry waits for Mcdonalds to arrive for that epic science showdown.

stay tuned for tomorrow where we butcher...review chapter 2.

But onto my verdict, The story so far is ok...i remember dropping it around chapter 7 when Draco "Ima rapeya" Malfoy gets introduced,but to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Harry's existential catchphrase "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimization," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius wit unfolds itself on their Computer Monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kids 😎


** I stumbled across HPMOR because I sorted by favorites, but I could only get through the first one or two chapters. That says a LOT, considering I've been able to pull through a few of the worst of Hadrian Potter-Peverell-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin fics.

*** The first few chapters really depend on how much you like the basic premise it tries to sell you on - a 'smarter' Harry who pokes at some of the inconsistencies of the world.

After that, it's how much the fic itself has caught you - and for me, the first time I stuck around until it devolved into a dumb version of Ender's Game, mostly because the basic premise of Science + Magic is one I really would have wanted to see explored in a good way. But 'Rational!Harry' was not really scientific at all.

  some of the inconsistencies of the world.
#+end_quote

This is where the MoR lost me, so there was no hope I'd like it. The books' world-building is fundamentally illogical, something I do not consider bad. It's the fantasy version of Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy's science fiction world-building: British humor represented as a world/universe. It's like trying to argue there's no way a whale would have materialized by using the Improbability Drive - that's the whole point, and it's meant to be funny. Fanfiction can be whatever it wants, and people don't have to like these worlds, they can prefer more rational world-building, but I don't get why this fic has to "fix" the illogical world of HP when the HP world is unabashedly designed to be funny and whimsical before anything else anyway.

***** It's not /bad/ that the book universe is illogical - but the base for HP is good enough that, well, different people will have different tastes. Particularly when it went away from that illogical world building towards trying to be more serious later on.

The biggest issue with HPMOR is more that it deals with those inconsistencies in a boring/bad way - but with how wide a breadth fanfiction has, it's a good thing that some look to take the world away from whimsical and illogical to match some other tone for their story. For instance, the biggest failing in the original story to me is the disconnect between books 1-4, which are /heavy/ on that whimsical feel, and books 5-7, which are.. not. It makes characters like Dumbledore feel much worse when we are forced to view his early actions through the lens of a more serious situation, I find.

****** This is a bit of a tangent and no longer really related to fanfic, but I think going from light-hearted to serious is not necessarily the same thing as going from irrational to rational. I would say the magic and world-building is inherently emotional, which is maintained throughout the series, even if it becomes more serious. I hope I didn't imply that I'd never like rational world-building on principal. I just meant to suggest that there's all sorts of reasons to design a fictional world in different ways. I've been reading /Anatomy of a Story/ recently and it suggests making the world a manifestation of the issues the hero must face. I feel like HP has the right world for the story it's telling, but another story is served better with a rational world.

edit: as for MoR, I actually never read it, maybe just the first chapter. I've read summaries, though, but I shouldn't comment too much about how well it builds its world. I trust your judgement there, I've heard similar things that it actually doesn't "correct" anything very well anyway.

******* Perhaps - and yes, it's not the same thing. But it is also a tonal shift where it will have problem adapting to. Worldbuilding elements that in a light-hearted context work well will have problems being interpreted seriously later in the same mood. For instance, the incompetent Ministry wielding its power to expedite and ignore trials, to send people to a horrific jail, or all the other dystopian elements of HP have a very different look if it's in a light-hearted context vs a serious one - just as much, to me, as the background going from irrational to rational. I do agree that others can disagree with that, particularly since a lot of the appeal of the series is in the way the light-hearted elements combine with the whimsical world building that's interlaced with our own world.

Absolutely, I feel this transition is fine on principal, but it does make some other problems later. For example - why is Snape refereeing the Quidditch match in the first book if his objective is to protect Harry from Quirrell? /Surely/ Snape is more effective sitting in the bleachers without having to multi-task as referee? But it's fun and whimsical to have the teacher Harry hates suddenly the referee. But later in the series we're like "lol, Snape as referee? I can't even picture that!". It doesn't seem to gel.

This wouldn't bother me so much if that was the end of it, if it was just "haha, that's kinda funny in hindsight", I could deal, but some of the problems have much greater consequences, like why is Detention in the Forest? What did Dumbledore really know anyway? I know people have all sorts of theories, but I'm fairly convinced that all theories have huge gaps in them, and there's nothing readers can do about it, it's just that the first books (as much as I love it) is not that well plotted.... .... I won't delete this comment, but I just realized I'm talking more about plot and not world-building.... but there's probably some overlap there anyway.

Nice to see someone not mindlessly frothing over hpmor. It took me several goes to get through it, and I really only finished so I could say I had. My favourite thing about Harry Potter is the characters, and this fic destroys every character it touches. I found it bland, soap-boxy and pretentious, and it really felt like an author insert.

I find it so bizarre many people think this is one of the best fics ever written. While the author's writing style is good, it's almost comical how ridiculous some aspects of this fic are.

*** I only read it because when I start out in a fandom and don't know what to read I sort by favorites, complete and exclude whatever character i don't want to see slashy garbage about (generally Draco and Snape) So the most favored story on FF.net was HPMOR and Me being a super big brain 20 year old at the time thought I could handle it, I couldn't and ended up not reading it.

It's hilarious that their are underappreciated romance and action adventure stories that are better fics than HPMOR but people are too stuck up to see that.

Harry Potter and The Forest of Valbone is a prime example of this, I just read that and I'm surprised more people don't see how great of a story that is but constantly wank methods of rationality off.

Tbh 28 yo me now probably wouldn't get through it either, my time is too valuable for pretentious bullshit at this point. But we're on the internet... home to a lot of people pretending to be smarter than they are.

I'll check out Harry Potter and The Forest of Valbone maybe though. After 17 years reading fan fic I have a pretty small niche of what I enjoy; characters are canon, "rules of magic" are canon, relationships are (mostly) canon. Would it meet my frustratingly specific requirements?

Unfortunately, one of the reasons MoR gets so overhyped (and I say that as someone who more or less enjoyed reading it) is that it is overall so divisive: most people either love it or hate it. And since favorite counts and rec lists stand out more than negative reviews, it gets far more visibility than you would expect given the overall reception to it. Still, it is complete and mostly free of grammar and syntax errors, which puts it at least in the upper quartile of fanfiction quality.

** Like most people in this thread, I was introduced to HPMOR by an online rec list, and told it was a smart version of Harry Potter that actually made sense. That sounded great, and I was pulled into the hype, when I was a fandom newbie and looking to get a start into fanfic. I liked the idea of a Harry who uses his magic and magical tools (Invisibility Cloak, Time Turners) effectively. But I eventually lost my like of it because I realized that the premise was dumb, the characters' unlikeability overruled their effectiveness to the point I didn't care how smart they were when I couldn't stand reading about them, and a lot of the writing was smarmy and wank.

I tried re-reading it recently and I... just couldn't. In hindsight, I hadn't realized how silly it was that Harry (JPEV, pbuh) was so rational because Petunia drank a potion that made her hot, and that won her a science professor husband. What the hell.

To this day, I am reluctant to read fics that market themselves as "rational", even though I liked them once upon a time, and binged on the HPMOR spinoffs and lookalikes. There can be stories with logical characters and plots, but if the author makes a point of putting it in the summary ("Smart!Harry") I probably won't read it because I have turned away from Smug Harry for good.

I also don't get the people who defend this fic so adamantly, with the reasoning that people who don't like it feel that way because they don't understand why Harry did this or that. Just look at the shitshow of [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c2r62o/the_absolute_worst_popular_fic_youve_ever_read/][threads like this]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ca5hzi/does_methods_of_rationality_get_any_better/][this one]] where HPMOR is brought up.

Someone in one of those threads unironically wrote this comment:

#+begin_quote
  "Why does this subreddit hate HPMOR so much? The elements of the story (writing, plot, characters, foreshadowing, worldbuilding) are objectively excellent. Is the story just legitimately too intelligent for the majority of the people who read Harry Potter fanfiction? I'm being serious here."

Harry being smart has, surprisingly, nothing to do with his upbringing. As a matter-of-fact if you want to be technical, Harry died in 1981 in the HPMoR universe. Mostly. He kept some of his ability to form relationships and otherwise not be a psychopath from Harry Potter but otherwise pretty much the entirety of the rest of his faculties are Voldemort 2.0, but used for good.

**** That fact about Harry's identity is revealed near the ending of the story. But it's Harry's adopted family that is given to us as our point of divergence for why Harry had the scientific education he had. It's not the real reason why he's so intelligent, but this is what we're /told/, and what we're asked to suspend our disbelief about when going into the story for the first time.

#+begin_quote
  "Lily had always been prettier than me, and I'd... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got magic, can you imagine how I felt? ...She told me it was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice to me."
#+end_quote

From chapter 1.

This implies that people were nice to Lily because Lily was pretty, not because she was kind to people, like Snape of Spinner's End, the weirdo kid from the poor side of town. This implies that a makeover potion that Petunia took could re-write her entire personality, when we know that she was a naggy brat at the age of 10 years old. It's one of the biggest running issues why I don't like HPMOR - I don't like the way the characters are written, because the author didn't try to and/or didn't care about making them reflect their original personalities. Professor "Dumbass" McGonagall is another such example. She's been lecturing for 40 years, and somehow allow 11-year-old Harry lecture all over her the first time they meet.

It's like going into a fanfic and straight away you see Evil Dumbles and Death Eater Ron. It's a fic you have to suspend your disbelief to read, and it would've been completely different had Dumbledore and Ron's slow descent into villainy been shown on-screen rather than told to you in a random line of dialogue. "Harry, you're a wizard! Oh, and I would've gotten you an owl for your birthday, but Ron killed it.".

***** I do not know why I even care about this but this -> "This implies that people were nice to Lily because Lily was pretty," kinda bugged me from your comment. It really has nothing to do with the actual substance of your comment either.

So the reason it bugged me was because I felt your comment implied that she did not get /any/ leg up from being pretty. Especially in the likability department.

Every study that studies pretty vs non pretty people shows that they are found to be more like-able and able to succeed easier in life. Every study. So really people would like Lily more as a person just because she was pretty.

Now this has nothing to do with the substance of your comment I know. I just got bugged from that so sorry.

****** Yeah, this is actually called the Halo effect: attractive people are perceived to be smarter and more likable than less attractive ones. (in this context, but this a more complex cognitive bias)

Also, if Petunia has different experiences after being “beautified” than of course she would turn out differently, namely more confident (so maybe she wouldn't feel the need to tear others down like in the original book). Whether or not she was truly unattractive before taking the potion, being in that negative mind space can really fuck you up and how you behave towards others.

Also, by this I don't mean that unattractive or people with low self-esteem will behave that way. It's definitely a possibility, though. Just an opinion.

*** If you yet hold out hope, there is minimal smugness of any sort in linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species). I do actually enjoy HPMoR, but if you want rationalist fiction done right, Origin of Species would be my top recommendation. It does a really good job of exploring the psychology of persuasion, planning for success (and for failure), assessing probabilities and risks, and a dozen other things, /without/ having a protagonist who looks down his nose at the world. I guess the drawback is that it's slow-paced and far from complete. Updates regularly, though, at the start of every month.

**** This is the only place I disagree with you.

When I was a teenager, my family really got into LessWrong. When HPMoR came out it felt like it was written only for the Less Wrong community, with a bunch of references to the philosophies we'd been talking about.

HPMoR has a lot of faults, especially in the first dozen chapters, and I've seem some aholes saying basically the "if you don't like this your brains not big enough" and that's pretentious bull. However, in the beginning it was just an extension of the LessWrong community.

Eliezer Yudkowsky openly admits he had only read the wikipedia plot summaries of Harry Potter when he began to write HPMoR, so it's no surprise that his characterization is way off. In the end, he was writing for a preexisting community with preexisting context and cultural references.

The fanbase is the worst part in my opinion. They (not all ofc, but the most vocal) seem to think that because the story was written by an intelligent man and features intelligent characters, that it makes them intelligent aswell for liking to story. If someone claims parts of the story is bad or stupid it therefore follows that they are bad or stupid. An "attack" on the story becomes an attack on them because they self identify with it.

You can tell when something is intelligently written because it's woven in the story. Intelligent is what it is. You can tell someone's going "look how smart and Nice a guy I am" when they just scatter it over the top like sprinkles on a sunday. Maybe the ice cream will melt a bit and the sprinkles will kind of fall in by accident, but then the sunday falls apart. You get what I mean?

#+end_quote

Why are you treating this as something ridiculous? We know magic can alter appearances, and doing it permanently is treated in-story as risky and not something to be repeated (Petunia was quite sick for some time afterward), but it's not an unreasonable thing for HP-verse magic to do, and it's a very understandable (if perhaps unwise) request on Petunia's part.

This is a circlejerk thread, and the point is to make it common knowledge that this fic sux XD. And I think that kind of judgmental attitude is really unwise to bring to a fanfiction subreddit, of all places.

We get like weekly threads despising HPMOR at this point. What's the point of that, if not to demean other people's tastes? And why be /so/ insistent on demeaning those tastes? Why not just accept it's not for you personally, but that's okay, and doesn't indicate anything bad about the author or the story's fans?

******** I see that you're doing other fics too, which is a little reassuring. I feel like there's a small cadre of people online who go out of their way to give the author of that story grief whenever they've got a spare twenty minutes here or there, and the total weight of criticism that results in is kind of unreal.

I don't want to say that individual criticisms are bad, so maybe my last comment overstated things. I don't even mind a circlejerk thread every now and then, or occasional memes like Harry Crow being bad (as long as they don't veer into encouraging others to take glee in how awful a writer its author is, or anything similar), but the intensity of the criticism seems to amp up for this story specifically. You're not responsible for all of that, though.

** Meh HPMOR gets a lot of hate, but honestly, there's a LOT worse fics out there. I found it early on in reading FF, and I enjoyed it well enough. At the very least the author shows competency at spelling and grammar. While I'm sure the plot isn't for everyone, it's not outright bad, at the very least it manages to meet the two most important plot criteria for me: A. Be internally consistent, and B. Not just rehash the same cannon plot over and over again, and C. Not be outright dumb.

I didn't care much for the ending, it seemed a bit... hmm.... off. Pretty much everything after the temporary hiatus just after dumbeldor is checking harry's rock to make sure it's not hermiones body IIRC. (I totally had it pegged as he did steal her body, but turned it into the ring, not the rock itself.) I don't know if the tone/plot style changed, or if my taste in fanfiction grew up in the meantime, but the ending felt unsatisfactory, and a little bit forced. Also a little out of left field maybe? It's been a rather long time.

Is it a good harry potter story? Well it's barely HP, file of the names, and you could go to publish. Still closer then those dumb as shit "Harry is an airplane pilot, Hermione is his flight attendant, and Tom Riddle is the new co-pilot" that some people insist on writing though. At least the goddamn setting is the same. (And has magic. Seriously, some authors...)

But it IS a fairly decent STORY in it's own right, if you only did file of those names and let it stand on it's own, rather then being propped up by a work it is really only inspired by.

No matter how downvoted one side of the conversation is getting, these posts still allow to highlight the widespread negative opinions and points of criticism against HPMOR, and allow to determine which ones among these were accurate and which ones were a product of misunderstanding or lack of understanding (as with the sleep disorder, for example).
