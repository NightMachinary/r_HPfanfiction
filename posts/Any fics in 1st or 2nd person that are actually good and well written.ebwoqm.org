Title. Thanks.


** I don't particularly enjoy the second-person perspective myself as it always feels like an artificial way to get you immersed into the character that IMO doesn't work without the CYOA-aspect to give me input into their actions, but Bungle in the Jungle is well-written enough that I can tolerate the POV.

**** If you're willing to go into non fan fiction, check out David Brin's Kiln People. It's an excellent book, if somewhat hard to read because it switches between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, as the story demands.

Also, if I recall correctly, the entire original Percy Jackson series was in 1st person.

Those two are my choice of first person perspectives. The second one is under going a rewrite though

You don't need to do that. When it says Text (Optional) while you're making a post, it means it.

  Annabel has a bad day, and she tries to deal with it as best she can.The last thing she needs is to meet someone else who has hurt her, someone who she hasn't seen in many years. Or is it?Do people really change. Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up?

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
