I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11674317/1/When-Harry-met-Wednesday][When Harry met Wednesday]] recently and I'm looking for fics that do something similar to it. I've already read Out of the Night (can't remember if that's the right title, but it's the one that got abandoned) and Cadmean Victory.

Bashing and overpowered stuff is fine with me but I don't like slash all that much or teacher x student ship fics.


** *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): the horcrux in Harry was sentient and it made a deal with Harry after year 5. The resulting Harry became extremely powerful and far more ruthless. Voldemort was no longer his worst enemy though.

*Rise of the Wizards*, linkffn(6254783): Voldemort's possession in MoM changed the nature of the scar, and Harry became different as a result. Voldemort, again, was no longer his worst enemy. [[/spoiler][Later he would fight Hermione for more than a century]]

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): Harry went dark after Voldemort's fall for political reasons, and his friends joined him. This is one of my most favorite stories.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.
