Does anyone know of fic where Hermione has a character arc? Preferably not one where she is "put in her place" or "taken down a notch". Definitely no bashing please - for any character. No romione or dramione or cross-generational ships (eg. Snamione etc) please.


** Definitely linkao3(109558).

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

**** In cultures where monogamy is mandated, bigamy is the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another. A legal or de facto separation of the couple does not alter their marital status as married persons.

**** Entering into marriage while already married. In most countries it is a felony. In that story there are outstanding betrothal contracts, which force Harry to be married to Daphne Greengrass and Hermione at the same time, which seems disgusting to me.
