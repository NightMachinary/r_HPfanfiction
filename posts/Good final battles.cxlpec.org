Any recommendations for fics with good “Assemble the Avengers” type moments? Specifically, where the Forces of Good™ get together bunch of allies (ideally, that we've seen them cultivate) and have some sort of exciting final Manichaen battle against evil.

I'm already familiar with Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power, sunrise over Britain, and parts of Harry Potter and the Horcrux Three that have this.

Anything goes for the story (tropes, pairings, whatever) as long as there's good grammar.

(PS: this doesn't mean I want an avengers crossover lol)


** I really liked the Battle of Diagon Alley in linkffn(Divided and Entwined), there's Harry with the special anti Voldemort weapon, Ron with his arsenal of Dumbledore's gadgets, the Twins with whatever they can get from their burning store, Sirius and the Order rushing in, the French allies helping after Voldemort's stunt in the Bastille, and Hermione's guerilla group arriving with machine guns, wands and grenades, all against Voldemort's Death Eaters in a massive and messy battle. The Avengers kinda didn't make it as the only surviving ex-member was still imperiused at the time. And the aurors arrived just in time for helping with the cleanup.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Well, I'm partial to my own - the final battle takes place in two locations, over the course of two lengthy chapters, and at the end of over 750,000 words spread out over three fics. A lot of people are involved, most of whom receive a decent amount of character development over the course of the story. A couple start out more negative but gradually come into their own and play important, positive roles. The spells, the attitudes, and the plans are also all assembled bit by bit.

The villains get what's coming to them, the heroes get closure, and not all of those you're rooting for actually survive. There's one death which I'm sure is unexpected to most readers, but it was the only way for that character to get their "happily ever after" (which probably sounds like a contradiction, but it's true - and yet I still get a little choked up when I go back and reread it). And even that was set up, in some ways, well in advance.

linkffn(11197701;11251745;11761312)

Note: this story involves a female Harry with a femslash relationship, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea.

*** I just posted a recommendation to this series today. I'm really grateful you wrote those. I think I binged them in about 2 days and they remain some of my absolute favorite fan fiction work.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings.
