From what I recall the opening chapter includes Voldemort and his Death Eaters attacking Hogwarts. While trying protect everyone Harry is hit by the Killing Curse, but this causes Harry, Voldemort and all the Death Eaters to be teleported to a seemingly inescapable cave. Harry is tortured. It's a HarryxGinny ship as far as I remember. Further information below the spoiler mark.

*SPOILERS*

- Voldemort killed all the Death Eaters through possession and it turns out his shade in within Harry, but Harry is able to control him.

- Harry has incredible ability in wandless magic, and when he finally does pick up his wand again it transforms into a staff.

- Harry duels the Head Auror, a secret Death Eater, who stabs him with the poisoned Slytherin's Dagger.

- Harry's animagus form turns out to be a griffin.

That's all I can remember. Haven't read this story in a few years and would love to go through it again. Has been impossible to track down though and I don't think I'll get anywhere without the title, which I cannot remember.

Any help is greatly appreciated, as well as any recommendations you think I might like. Thank you!
