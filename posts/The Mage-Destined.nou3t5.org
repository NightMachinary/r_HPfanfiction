James runs into his house only to see Charlus Potter, his father dead, after closing his father's eyes he went upstairs to see Dorea Potter nee Black, his mother dead. Lily on the other hand went to the twins and saw William has a V-like scar on his right cheek while Harry was asleep with no scars.

James turns to see Remus, Sirius, and Albus run into the nursery to see Lily hold William like the hero she's going to claim and James closing Dorea's eyes before picking up Harry.

"James, I'm sorry about your parents' deaths. Both Charlus and Dorea were close friends of mine." Dumbledore said while he rests his hand on James' shoulder.

James is sitting in an armchair and reading a book about Eastern Myths in The Pottery when Lily walked in wearing brand new clothes that look top of the line too. Lily looks at James with a lustful look until she saw Harry and the book that he's read to that Boy. Lily spoke to her husband "I want that @#$* out of this house now! I don't care where you take him I don't want him near William and more. So disown him and give him off."

James looks at the woman he once loved, but now he doesn't even know her. To make matters worse his two best friends agreed with Lily. So James asks them to give him a week to find a good home.

James is sitting at the Potter Cottage with Minerva and Albus asking if they could be Harry's new godparents after both Sirius and Alice threw Harry to the side for William. Minerva and Albus said yes before Minerva asks James where is he talking Harry to.

​

"I'm going to ask Toshiko to blood adopt him and raise him as her own while the three of us can still see him.

*/A.N:/* I'm playing with a couple of ideas for Harry Potter and Digimon crossover and this is one way I was thinking about going. The Potters are from Japan because if Desi Potter's can be a thing so can this. Toshiko is Sora's mom and James' older sister (at least in this story) I thought about giving this Harry, Dracomon, or Wizardmon for his Digimon and he will have the crest of Wills and the symbol is the Triforce (Because I can. But if you have a better idea please let me know, that counts his Digimon.) I'm pairing Harry with Kari because why not.


** What's with the people and the idea of James and Lily abandoning one of their children? Taking into account short mentions of cannon Potter family interaction in memories/letters this is just stupid imo. And Lily disowning Harry because he isn't the BWL? The woman died when she could have just stepped aside, for fucks sake

*** I wanted the Potter's alive but I also wanted Harry to be Sora brother. I always see Lily stand by Harry instead of James. Harry might not even be disown. It's still in I'm playing with the idea stage and this is the rough draft of this version.

*** How about this idea: Toshikois the 3rd Evans Sister and Petunia (or Dumbledore) sends Harry there. Potter's don't abandoned their son and Harry grows up as Sora brother
