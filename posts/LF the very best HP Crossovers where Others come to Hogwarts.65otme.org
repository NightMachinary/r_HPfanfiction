  The Doctor and Jack have found themselves to be 11. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix, so the Doctor decides they should attend Hogwarts until they can find a way to return to their proper ages. Here, they make friends, confuse professors, and desperately try to avoid disturbing fixed points in time. Updates on a monthly basis.

** Here are the ones that I can remember.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi is that a Baby?]] Naruto crossover with a bunch of outtakes at the end of some chapters where the Akatsuki teach defense classes.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568][There May Be Some Collateral Damage]] Crossover with Bleach but it's good so it's not like the others. Ichigo gets stuck as Harry's bodyguard 5th year. Very funny fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]] Shirou, Rider, Saber, Rin, and Sakura all come to Hogwarts as visiting professors because Zelretch wants them to learn about how HP universe magic works or something. Really liked this fic. Great Dumbledore.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4766627/1/From-His-Excerpts][From His Excerpts]] Crossover with Naruto. Kakashi gets sent to Hogwarts during the timeskip for some reason. Don't remember why but it was almost entertaining and that's a lot better than most crossovers do.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]] Crossover with Highlander. Macleod teaches a Defense class at Hogwarts 4th year. Fun fic. Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6868583/1/We-Are-Nothing][We Are Nothing]] Crossover with Nightmare on Elm Street. Freddy Kreuger comes to Hogwarts and a some people die.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes][Something Grim This Way Comes]] Crossover with the Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy Harry and Mandy are childhood friends and they both end up going to Hogwarts. Fic was okay. Not the greatest thing ever.
