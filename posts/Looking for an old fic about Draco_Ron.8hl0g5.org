I remember reading this a while ago. It was a Ron/Draco story, in which basically Rons entire family and Harry and Hermoine abandon him when they found out they're together.

I remember there was some scenes where Draco and Ron were hanging out with Neville and Luna, and One where Lupin conforts Ron because he knows what its like to be different. Can anybody help me out?
