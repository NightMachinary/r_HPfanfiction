Looking for 2 fics. Hermione's parents decide Hogwarts is not safe and send her to another school. Or Hermione does not forgive Harry and Ron for being bad friends. And she cuts them out of her life instead of the other way around which is what you see in most fics.


** In linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by slythernim) Hermione's parents pull her out of Hogwarts after the Troll-Incident-equivalent... so she tricks her way into Durmstrang.

In linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel), Hermione goes to Beauxbatons for a bit for similar reasons.

Other than that, there is myriad fics where she abandons Ron and Harry into the arms of Draco or another Slytherin in Leather Pants. Those fics almost invariably focus on a Twilight-style romance to the exclusion of everything else.

I've long had a plot bunny like what you're asking. There's a single point of divergence: on Halloween 1991, unbeknownst to Harry and Ron, Hermione wanders back to Gryffindor Tower shortly before Quirrel lets the troll in. This leads to a cascade of events along the following lines:

1. Harry and Ron go to warn her, but without the troll being drawn to Hermione, it goes after them. They run for it and run into the professors, who stop the troll but also take a lot of House Points for endangering themselves (because McGonagall doesn't reverse Snape's penalties).
2. As a result, not only is Hermione not friends with Harry and Ron, she is actually angry at them over what she feels is a betrayal (because she thought that they were friends, and then Ron called her "nightmare"), not to mention annoyed at them for getting themselves (and, sometimes, her) into trouble.
3. Hermione refocuses on her own studies, much more reluctant to help others; if she hangs out with anyone, it's the Ravenclaws, or maybe Percy.
4. Though she doesn't have friends in Gryffindor, she, ironically, becomes more popular than Harry and Ron, after Harry, Ron, and Hermione's Replacement (HR) get caught after smuggling a dragon: between Harry's Quiddich victories, and Hermione's relentless pursuit of House Points, Gryffindor actually had a shot at the cup, but then Harry, Ron, and HR went and lost 150 points in one night, /and they are refusing to tell anyone why/.
5. Eight months later, Harry, Ron, and HR, having somehow solved the Philosopher's Stone mystery without Hermione, prepare to go after the Philosopher's Stone, when they run into Hermione (as they had into Neville in canon), and she is sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory about Snape, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it.
6. She knows the Petrificus Totalus jinx, and she's not afraid to use it...

And so, Hermione Granger dooms the world through an excess of competence and common sense. Or, alternatively, Hermione Granger delays Voldemort's return indefinitely due to Dumbledore's Erised trap working as intended.

/If/ we go with the second outcome,

1. Hermone becomes even more popular in Gryffindor at Harry's and Ron's expense, since she singlehandedly stopped another embarrassing point loss in a very Gryffindor way, and it might further embitter her relationship with Ron. (Though, Harry is still the Seeker, so he's rather popular anyway.)
2. Meanwhile, Draco gets a talking-to from Lucius that a mudblood beating his marks is unseemly (which I believe is canon, but please correct me if I am wrong), and since Draco doesn't view her as Harry's sidekick anymore (and thus a part of his general Harry Problem), he might try to bully her, which could produce some fun fights in Hogwarts's hallowed hallways.
3. The plot hooks of CoS (Tom Riddle's Diary possessing Ginny to open the Chamber) and PoA (Sirius escaping form Azkaban) can still happen no matter the dynamic between Hermione and Harry and Ron, even if what actually happens and how it ends might be very different.

Lots of interesting character development and interaction possibilities.

*** What if, with Hermione not connected to Harry and her making Draco look bad, she's the one to get the diary? As a competent, popular student but without close friends, she might get along pretty well with Tom...

"Brilliant, but scary" applies to her and to Tom, they both are generally known as rule respecting students (teacher's pets) but both are perfectly willing to do highly illegal stuff if it's for a serious reason (polyjuice, DA), and she'd probably develop a secret disliking for wizarding society due to discrimination she'd experience from Malfoy (whose father is high up in the government).

We'd probably end up with a Gryffindor dark witch.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

*** Problem with number 6 is that it's not very likely that a first year can hit a spell off 3 times quicker than it would take for atleast one of them to drop her + Harry has quidditch dodging.

**** Hard to say:

1. Harry won't be on a broom.
2. There may be obstacles to dodging (including his friends).
3. Hermione would not have spent time on their mysteries, so she may have some other spells in her arsenal that she didn't have in canon at the time. If she can cast the Shield Charm, she wins.
4. Conversely, Harry and Ron would not have benefited from her help.

But, let's suppose that Hermione can't hit Harry with the jinx. She doesn't need to, in order to derail the ending:

1. They don't have a way to reverse the jinx, so without her cooperation, anyone she does hit isn't coming with them. In particular, if she gets Ron, they have no way to get through the chess obstacle.
2. They are young enough that the sex differentiation in physical strength hasn't happened yet, so if it comes down to a physical fight, Hermione has even odds.
3. They don't have any spells that can reliably keep Hermione down, so they have to either hit her with multiple jinxes or disarm her and take her wand. (They don't know the Disarming Charm.)
4. A drawn-out fight will attract attention of a prefect or another student, cutting their adventure short.

***** 1. Harry still has really good reaction times.
2. Harry and Ron aren't expressly terrible at spells and it is safe to assume they would have learned at least one they could use against her.
3. IIRC, the finite spell is learned in first year and they can cancel it.
4. While there is no sex differentiation, 3/2 people, who have been playing a physical sport like quidditch, will easily take down 1 bookworm in a physical fight.
5. Fights, unless near people, would not attract that much noise. They're not that loud.
6. In canon, the mysteries only take up a couple days of the whole year, so she probably didn't learn anything extra.

****** Ultimately, there is only one person whose opinion matters, and that person is whoever is writing the fic. Plot bunnies are cheap, so if you want to write this premise and stay on canon rails, feel free.

On the specific points, 1. Like I said, sure, maybe Harry will be the last one standing. The adventure still can't continue. 2. Didn't say they were. Just pointed out that Hermione would probably be much better. Say, Leg-Locker jinx doesn't take someone out of the fight, but Full-Body Bind does. 3. I've found no evidence whatsoever that the General Counterspell is learned in first year. It appears to be a moderately advanced spell. It's worth noting that many schoolyard jinxes have special counterjinxes---and the fact that they are needed suggests that a general counterspell can't be relied upon. 4. OK, so they take her down physically, and by some miracle they do so without attracting attention. And then what? I don't think they'd be willing to do anything brutal enough to render her unconscious. Do they tie her up? With what? (Incarcerous is not an easy spell.) 5. They'll be shouting their spells, possibly scuffling. Missed spells can produce sound effects as well. This isn't just one clean Petrificus Totalus and then nothing. 6. They're going to have to research Nicholas Flamel without Hermione's help.

Here's the thing... None of these factors will derail the adventure with certainty, but only a few things have to go wrong for Harry and Ron or right for Hermione to cause the adventure to be aborted, so on balance, I think that that's the most likely outcome.
