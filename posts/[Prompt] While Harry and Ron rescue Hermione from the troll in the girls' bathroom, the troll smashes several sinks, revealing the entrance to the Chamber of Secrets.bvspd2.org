** ...Well, now I want to see a fic where Harry & co. (including Dumbledore) end up doing some kind of blind speedrun completely by accident.\\
The troll accidentally exposes the Chamber of Secrets, Harry accidentally discovers Secrets of the Darkest Art while invisibly browsing the Restricted Section, Peter Pettigrew just reveals himself and up and confesses for whatever reason, a costume party amongst the house-elves ends up getting Rowena's Diadem exposed, a Coprolalia Concoction splashed on Quirrel inadvertently reveals his potty-mouthed passenger...

The involuntary and repetitive use of obscene language, according to Google.

I assume the intended mental image is a disembodied voice in the vicinity of Quirrell suddenly spouting oodles of profanity.

*** I think if you set up a situation where slughorn admits about horcruxes earlier it's possible they could destroy all of them without Voldemort even coming back. Maybe pettigrew stays a rat for the rest of his life.

Maybe year 2 Lockhart gets fucked up somehow so Dumbledore finally gives snape the job and he recruits slughorn.

It would be pretty tough to get at the diary and cup though. Harry only pieced together the cup being at gringotts from bellatrix flipping out about her vault.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

**** I'm pretty sure Flitwick and mcgonagall could take a 16 year old Riddle. Tom is a prodigy and all but at 16 I don't think he has ever been in a fight and he only had the Hogwarts library and maybe some classmates to learn spells from.

***** That's a fair opinion. I always found fandom's opinion of McGonagall was a bit overinflated, as Snape never meant to hurt her. That being said, Bellatrix was an absolute monster and she lacked years of experience from being in Azkaban. It would make sense that Tom Riddle was a similar prodigy.

******* Magic in canon Harry Potter is more about intent and Skill. Being a Horcrux isn't really an issue. Dumbledore himself called Voldemort possibly the most brilliant student to go through Hogwarts. Voldemort was at least a 5th year at the chamber of secrets incident. 5th year Harry taught NEWT DADA in the DA. Ergo, teen Voldemort would slaughter any student.

******** Hard disagree? Just because you're smart in school doesn't mean you're going to be a good brawler. Riddle can be as talented as he wants, but I doubt he'd ever actually been in a straight up fight. He'd get flattened by any competent adult who wasn't a 12 year old Harry. His talents were being a charming psychopath, he didn't have any fighting experience at the time. He was just some smart manipulative kid. Put that kid against a war vet or a martial artist and he'd get his ass beat.

That's what I hate about stories where Diary Riddle somehow gets out and owns McGonagall and Snape and escapes the castle. It's bullshit. He was just some kid at the time. Way overrated.

********* Most of these people aren't interested in the martial aspects of magic and canon doesn't have post Hogwarts education. Riddle was good at everything. As to the extent, you could be able to argue that competent professors could take out a teen Riddle. Dumbledore definitely could. Snape might be able to. Flitwick might be able to. McGonagall might be able to. The thing is that it's very uncertain.

I'm not saying Riddle would even duel them. As a villain, an adult Tom Riddle would be more terrifying than Voldemort. He operated from the shadows. But he could kill easily. He was already proficient with the killing curse. He delved info the darkest magic and had a freaking horcrux already made.

Remember that Voldemort fought Kingsley, Slughorn, and McGonagall to draw when they had the protection from Harry's sacrifice. A teen Voldemort beating any of the professors isn't far-fetched, although it would be an effort.

Just a smart manipulative kid doesn't really apply to Tom Riddle.
