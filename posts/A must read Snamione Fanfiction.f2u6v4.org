Okay this is going to be quite long and please let's be respectful of this pairing. I know people would find this pairing quite off putting and truly that was once my first impression of it but that all soon change when I read this fanfiction right here. This fic is just surreal the words are pure poetry, the characterisation are seriously and realistically on point. I think this is the most canon snape on anyone who has written, in other words a bastard, but he fits in all the drama and happenings in this fic has showcased. The fic portrays the true depictions about war, it is just so raw that you could never stop reading, from the very first chapter you are already hooked. The writing style is very compelling that shows the element of reflection for us readers. You can tell that this fic has some inspiration by the other fanfiction titled ‚ÄúThe Fallout‚Äù by everythursday (a Dramione Fanfiction) but I tell you this one is very different and in my opinion more enticing. It's one hell of a rollercoaster and such a masterpiece. What the author made was art and it made the readers feel a thousand of caving emotions. On the contrary this fanfiction is proclaimed as hiatus as the author has stated and it has been what? 7 years or 8 years and I confess that I am still waiting for that slim chance of update. Wherever you are dear author we are still waiting for you. Even if you are not a fan of the pairing I feel like it's still a must read because it is profound and utterly beautiful.[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8869173/1/Self-Slain-Gods-on-Strange-Altars][Self Slain Gods on Strange Altar]]


** I loved this. I'm so sad that it probably won't be updated, and is most likely abandoned after such a long time. This is one that I know I will reread eventually.
