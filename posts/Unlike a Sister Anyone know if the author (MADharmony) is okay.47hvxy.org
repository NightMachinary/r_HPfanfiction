So I recently stumbled across HP Fanfiction, even though I've read all the books ages ago. I've read most of the good ones - and IMO, Unlike a Sister is the most realistic HHr romance out there so far.

The author, MADharmony, checked in on ff.net last in November, 2015 I think. I know it hasn't been that much time since then, but can someone here who knows her/has been in contact with her before at least reach out to her, make sure she's okay? Don't care if the author posts new chapters tomorrow or next year (okay maybe I do lol) but seriously I just want to know if she's okay or not.... Much thanks in advance and I hope I'm not over stepping any boundaries in my first post.


** Authors have disappeared for years at a time and some never return. It's just a sad fact of the medium, there's really no way to know if someone quit, lost their muse, lost their password, or was injured, sick, or died. Sure there are some who share facebook accounts and twitters and tumblrs with select friends but for the most part we keep our accounts mostly separated from real life. You probably could dox me pretty easily because I share this name across dozens of sites, but others like say Nonjon, Jharad, Kbinnz, and radaslab - all authors on the top 25 reviewed/favorites who haven't been active in years - don't use those names anywhere openly or easily accessible.

Occasionally you get some like MSGT SilverDollar's son, BroomstickFlyer's husband, or SimonsFlower's husband, or Bobmin's wife who were involved in their fics and were kind enough to let us know what was going on (the first three passed away, while Bob has multiple terminal cancers). For most authors, even most with spouses, children, roommates, or parents, their family and irl friends don't know about their online accounts and wouldn't know to let us know if something happened. My brother knows about my reddit account, and knows I go on youtube and twitch all the time, and a couple others, but if I suddenly died tomorrow it's not like he'd be able to access my computer to see all those communities I have bookmarked. Even tracking usernames across the net or using it in an obit or posting in [[/r/DeadRedditors]] is a lost cause for most users. How's he supposed to know who might care when I'm gone?

It's like this for most people. It's one of the hardest thing about getting involved in online communities like this. You want to make real friends and really know someone but it's so dangerous to put your real self out there that people almost never do. You really enjoy somebody's content but there's no guarantee it'll be still up the next day let alone get finished ever. One day they'll just leave and never come back, and you'll never know.

I've been on the internet for nearly 15 years now, which I know isn't anything at all compared to some older folks, but I couldn't even tell you the number of people and groups that I made good friends with for a few months or years then never spoke to again. Nor the number of communities that I up and left on my own. I know some of them cared enough to look for me or remember me when they happened upon me later, but unless we both actively wanted to reconnect it won't happen. And how would you reconnect with a dead person? I'm certainly not going to save a list of "who I was" to be posted when I'm gone.

Sorry I got all morbid, my thursday was awful from back to front, but at least its friday now.

** She might just be taking a break, a lot of lesser known authors sometimes take breaks for a few months. As evidenced by the gap between her unfinished first story and her second one, she might be gone for up to a few years. There is also a lesser possibility that she might have abandoned writing, but that's unlikely given her number of words written. :)
