It's brilliant. Wolfstar. It's fantastic. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll cry some more. The OCs make it. Come fall in love with Grant with me.

It's cannon and now my cannon. Follows Remus who grows up in a children's home so is a little rough a round the edges. 1st year to OoTP. There's side plots with werewolves that will captivate you. Werewolf magic that feeds wonderfully into Canon. It's won awards for it's James and Remus characterisations. It's just a beautiful story.

*** I will read it! It is...a lot of words. Also, why would Remus grow up in a children's home? What about his parents?

**** without spoiling it,

His dad suicided not too long after he was bitten. We're not really told why but you can guess. His mum was widowed muggle who couldn't look after him so gave him up...

There's a little more too it but I'm reluctant to spoil it.

But the childrens home is a great story!! Its really fun to see him go from 'posh Hogwarts Remus' surrounded by purebloods like James and Sirius to 'proper yobbo Remus' during the summer in Essex just being a menace to society and really fighting to survive surrounded by the older boys. I dunno, it gives him so much texture and realism and meaning behind everything he does and why he's trying to fit in and why he's an outcast.

Trust me, its worth reading =)

** [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] is beautifully written, and completely canon-compatible. It also has a great explanation of Peter's actions.

  It's nearly the last day of fifth year, and Sirius really isn't looking forward to the summer.Get-together fic (spoiler alert, but really, what were you expecting?) set over the summer of 1976 and into the autumn.

  Summer, 1977. With the full moon approaching, Sirius heads up to the Lupins' countryside cottage to make himself useful. Or to make a complete and utter arse out of himself, because really, that's all he can seem to do around Remus these days.

  In which Lily places a bet, does some investigating, gets in a fight, fixes a broken nose and learns a few things about her friends, that idiot James Potter, and herself. Three very complicated weeks towards the end of the year, because that's the only time anything actually happens at Hogwarts right?
