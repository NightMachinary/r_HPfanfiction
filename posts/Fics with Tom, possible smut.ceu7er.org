i was thinking if such Fics exist, so im asking.

1. Tom being initially a good Person, but might turn dubious/grey during the Fic.

2. Some Tom/Bellatrix fics that contain her having a Crush on him (either they visit the School at the same time/are at the same age or he works as a Teacher and she is the student). Possible that she is a Dark Lady and whenever he wants to catch her, she tempts him and slips through his fingers, he is attracted to her and i leave it to the Fic if its the same on her or if she uses this affection to manipulate him.

3. same as the above with Tom being a Good Person being being corrupted by a attractive Women (possible Bellatrix), however he wouldnt turn into a Criminal (atleast not the typical one).

4. Bellatrix/Tom Fics that have her in love with him (like in Canon), but he has no romantic feelings for her and sees their "Relationship" nothing more as Friends-with-benefits or Fuck Buddies tops. He might mention this "obstacle" to her, but she wouldnt Mind, if she can still slip between his sheets....possibly.

5. Narcissa/Tom Fics, something unusual i think. Well nothing special to mention here, both share affetion for each other and get intim with each other. Maybe there are even Affair fics with him being with Bella and her with Lucius. Or, if she is single, he was a couple with Bella but over time feels more attracted to Narcissa, because she is more calm, than her sister.

​

1. Tom being a Man that shares his Bed with multiple Women (Bella, Ginny, Hermione, Narcissa or other Canon or OCs).

​

1. Affair Fics, whether he is married and has an affair with a Married Woman or just one of them is doesnt matter. I will put the following in italic, since its a scenario that i have imagined, but its not necessary that exactly that also happens "/Tom is visiting Ginny (or any other Married Woman) and wants to talk and see her. Harry isnt there. While they are in the Kitchen or Living Room and she is busy with something, Tom softly touches her Hips and gets close to her. She doesnt physical reject her, but might tell him to stop it. He however continues embracing her (not so strong that she cant move anymore, but also soft enough so that she can feel his touch) and kissing her Neck. Despite her ought to know better she gives herself into his actions and they have Sex right where they are. When they are finished Tom apologizes for going so far, Ginny touches his Face in a comforting manner and says that its ok, but they need to tell Harry. (Short note to Harry here: he and Tom are actually "Friends", maybe not as good as he and Ron, Canon so to speak, but they do know each other quite well). Tom agrees and at this Point the further going can be split in two Ways. The first one would be Tom let go of Ginny, stand up and leave. The second one would be Tom looking deep into Ginnys Eyes and kissing her. She accepts and replies the action. They continue their Action (possible in the Bedroom) and Ginny gives herself in the Pleasure that her Lover gives her, but conscious that this time it would be the Last time. (Note to Ginny: She and Tom were once a couple/dating. Lets say during School time or shortly after that. Then they separated mutually...probably because of their Work. She is fully in Love with Harry but cant deny a certain Attraction to Tom here. To make a Conclusion, she decides to go one last time intim with him. Whether she and Harry were just married to the Time of Toms "Assault" or they had a Family, i would leave to the Fic. But the Years of Growing did make Ginny even more attractive which might be one Reason, why he was approaching her. But another Reason that i thought about was, that he was suffering from an Illness that not even the Magical Medics can cure.....whether he suffers from Depression from time to time or a Hunger for Sex. So with these Sufferings it was those why he wanted to be close to Ginny, which is why she wasnt angry at him (and because he didnt really raped her, the Embrace wasnt that strong, so she could easily physical rejected him and he would have accepted it, which she knew. Instead she choosed to use a Verbal Rejection, because of their Past and both of them growing more attractive over time, she let him go further./

​

1. Tom suffering from a uncurable cause. As i mentioned in the Point above, he might suffering from Depression...i actually dont want to use such a Word with negative consequences, but right now i dont know of any better Words. But i hope you know what i mean....or "suffers" or spontaneous erections. Yes, that might sound funny, but i would like this indeed to be a Illness. That he has to have Sex with (Stranger) Women just to dont feel any kind of Pain.

​

1. Tom/Ginny fics. Title says Everything. Whether he is in Canonical Age (so he never went evil) just like Ginny or they are both the same age doesnt matter. It not necessary that they are married. Some sort of Friends with Benefits relationship would be enough, but during their "Sessions" both enough each others Passion and shared Feelings and Joy. Depending on the Fic and the Situations, i would expect lots of sex between them.

​

9.1 staying on this Point, i would add a subpoint that have Tom having a rather aggressive or Predatory behavior, meaning he will try to touch and arouse Ginny (or his other Wife, but i think Ginny would fit more) in any Public occassions, so whenever they are out of Home, by their Work or on Family Celebrations. She would try to reject him, but her Body would still react to his actions and when the time is right they have a Quick Round to calm down. This way is a Possible way how Tom will threat his Partner. It wouldnt be rape, but edging on the Border of Sexual harassment, even if she cant be mad at him. After all, he dont want to hurt her and also not want them to getting caught, but the thrill of Public sex and geting caught might be what makes his actions. But this doesnt quite fit, with my description at the Beginning of this Point. Of course i would like a gentle Tom more than a possessive one, but for the said event both would be a possibility.

​

1. Love triangle. Whether its Bella/Tom/Narcissa or Bella/Tom/Ginny or Harry/Ginny/Tom or Ginny/Tom/Hermione doesnt matter, but in this case, all parties should know whats going on, so no cheating or affair Drama.

​

1. Hmm, that could be interesting: Tom building his own secret Crime fighting or underground group and calls himself Voldemort....although....he himself and his DE were alread the biggest (if not to say the only) Group of Criminals who the People need to take serious.

Staying by this another idea comes to mind. Tom is working Undercover in a Crime Business and uses his Canon alias as a Covername. It might lead that despite him being a good Person (which he also sees as himself) its very easy and effective for him using the Unforgivables (atleast Crucio and imperio...i would think that as a good person he would have problems with the Killing one), to his own suprise and shock. The undercover work might also change his private behavior, despite he really is eager to fight the Crimes.....he is adapting this negative Criminal Behavior and uses it involuntary out of his Work. That could be what makes him sick...or even corrupted.

​

1. Tom is with a female Partner (i imagined Ginny) and have a good life, but at some point he cant get an erection, when they are intim. This could lead him having doubts and question his sexual orientation and step by step discovering that (erotic) thoughts of the male Body turns him on. Whether he discovers to have a thing for males actually or being Bi, i will leave to the fic, but i would like if he would stay with his Wife/Partner, but at some points really gets turned on by having such thoughts. Maybe even encouraged by his Partner using dirty or erotic Words to describe scenarios, while pleasing Tom.

​

1. Tom being attracted to Hermione, she dont reciprocate these feelings. She might find him attractive and could imagine to sleep with him, but nothing more than that. Gossip could also be included, such as why such a handsome Man would be attracted to an "odinary" (to avoid ugly, although i dont think that Hermione would look that Bad with her teeth fixes, however this might happen) Girl/Woman in compair to his status....(the media might ignore his Halb-blood status due to his reputation and attractivity).

​

1. Fics with a possible dubious Tom. For this i imagined that Tom in possibly in his young years (although off-age) is might be attracted to older/Mature Witches instead of the ones in his age. The idea to this comes to my mind while reading a Narcissa/Tom fic. Insted of Narcissa it can be any other Woman. She might even be one of the oldest still living witches with Pureblood or magical status and so being married and possible have children that reached their maturity long ago. At some Event he would interact with her and makes the offer that he would like to share the Bed with her. It isnt an Order, just a spoken aloud possibility that could happen and it wouldnt cause any damage if she refuse. She is torn between the possible longing for him and the Marriage and Lovebond with her Husband (who she really loves). Well, as with the Tom/Ginny affair event, that i mentioned above, there could be 2 ways. Either she accepts it (it would be just for one Night after all) or push it out of her Conscious. Well, "dubious" Tom is a bit exaggerated, from what i think, but this term came to my mind, while reading the said N/T Fic, but in my said event, he would more using his charm and good looking to convince his "target" and would keep promise on his Words (meaning, no consequences, when she refuse the offer). If she would get Pregnant by TOm, said Woman could either abort it or claim that its from her Husband.

Well, im avoiding to add a subpoint here, but a good Person and young Tom being attracted to the more mature Witches (married or not) instead of the younger ones in his age would certainly also be good.

​

1. Tom might be an attractive Man and have a longtime lover, but at some Point (after Years with her) he might suffer some sort of erectile dysfunction. The irregularity and longtime span might lead to his Lover getting (sexual) frustrated and being angry at Tom, despite her to know that its not his Fault (atleast not intentional). Or she is ok with it and is possibly even eager to try new things to get him up.

​

​

Ok, i think thats it so far. I know that its much to read, but i will thank you at this Point for being so patient. Not all of the mentioned things in a Points need to happen in a Fic and of course there can be Fics that contain more than one Point.
