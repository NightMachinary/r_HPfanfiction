While they say: "Dudley is just a child, he has time to get into studying", they call Harry stupid and lazy if he doesn't get good grades. He has to learn and learn and is not allowed anything under a 2 so he becomes quite good in Hogwarts since habits don't stop at a new school. This could lead to an early friendship with Hermione and slower friendship with Ron who doesn't like studying that much. He could maybe even come to a friendship with Percy since He and Hermione are likely to ask him for help or what kind of books are a good read and such.

From there he could also find some advanced books in the library and get stronger faster than the other students. Then he has the choices to keep it to himself, share with his friends so they also get stronger or with everyone else in a study group or something like that.


** Or alternatively, the Dursleys want and pressure Harry into getting good grades and once he's away from them at Hogwarts he rebels and decides that he's going to be an aggressively bad student.

*** I like the idea that he would study the stuff, and practice, because well it is useful, especially when you have a Dark Lord wanting to kill you, and Harry is smart enough to see that.

He does his homeworks, but he does not give them to the teacher. He practices the spells, but he butcher them on purpose in front of the teachers (same with Potions).

He got a nice collections of T, but when push come to shove, he is as capable of any other student his year, even more capable sometimes.

And teachers are not fool, know exactly what is going on, and that scratches their head on how to deal with that, and resolves the issue. Guardians obviously won't help matters.

**** Or go the twins route of being absolutely brilliant at magic, just not the kind that is needed for school. Like who needs to transfigure a mouse into a teapot? conjuring up ice that traps an opponent is so much more useful!

So basically you'd end up with a Harry thats really good at what he cares about and probably will have a good career later, but who'll only barely make it through school.

***** Well, not really.

At the end of his second first-year, it's chamber of secrets and all exams are cancelled. So Harry would get to be a second year. Only one year behind Ron and Hermione.

Then, he doesn't have exam in GoF, thanks to the tournment, so he got to be in 3rd year (by the time Ron and Hermione are in 5th years).

Or, once he realised that his plans make him stay at school longer than he wants, he just does enough during exams to get the passing grade.

***** From what we saw in Canon, I don't think it's even "possible" for a student to be held back a year before 5th Year and the OWLs. I mean, Crabbe and Goyle are certified morons and yet they managed to not be held back until these exams. There are also students like Neville who reached 5th year while falling most of his spells and not being able to brew any potion.

I don't know if Rowling wanted to reflect the "English educational system", but it makes me think a lot about the French one (my country), where it's almost an achievement for a student to be held back a year, and one that need the full support of his parents (they usually have to make a strong emphasis to the teacher for it to either happen).

***** End of year exams usually carry. I was pretty close to the prompt's Harry, except for the reasons - instead of trying to stick it to my family I was /really/ into World of Warcraft. I would study during classes and breaks, but I could never be arsed to do homework or study at home. For the entirety of high school, I was borderline failing almost every subject due to a mix of shitty attendance and never handing in homework, but we had end of year exams and I'd pass them with flying colors. My grade average in my senior year was something around 3,89/10, but I managed to pass my finals well enough to apply for full government funding for uni. Although I /was/ the first person in the school's history to get a flat 0 in art, music and PE.

** In the fanfiction community I see that attitude a lot. "Why would he share his advantage with others!? He's so STOOOPID!! I can't stand this, I quit!!"

Seeing that attitude always annoys the hell out of me. Not every fic has to have a lone wolf warrior that selfishly keeps the best things to himself.

In real life people share nice things with their friends. Found a great restaraunt? Tell your friends. Found a nice way to save money? Do they keep it to themselves so they can get that miniscule advantage over everyone else? No, they tell their friends and family. Not everyone has that crab pot mentality where they pull everyone down who is trying to rise up.

So expecting every protagonist to be an amoral sociopath that only cares about themselves is unrealistic and irritating. And sometimes its nice and fluffy fun to read about good characters.

** Could even go some steps farther: The Dursley's hate Harry and loath having him around (forcing him to do chores could not work either because as a small child he is unable to do them well; because the neighbors see a small kid having to work on the garden during a hot day of summer and the Dursley's are then seen with scorn -not so much basic human decency, more along the lines of a bunch of gossiping snobs feeling better than their neighbors; because the Dursley's feel disgust at Harry's very presence; or even the somewhat more original route of having them be human beings decent enough to not be able to force an overwhelming workload on a kid), but they know that they can't send him away permanently because of the neighbors and the blood protections, so instead they try to find the less expensive way of having him stay away for the greater stretch of time that won't reflect negatively on them and find some boarding schools in London for ‘highly gifted students' that offers scholarships for those who pass their extremely demanding acceptance tests and promptly decide that Harry is going to be a genius whether he wants or not, leading to some questionable and even downright cruel teaching tactics like forcing him to study and fill up tests taken from the internet every day without any kind of mistakes before he is able to eat, forcing him to enter a sport team that can help him get a scholarship and then demanding an abusive amount of time spent practicing and perfect scores every game, punishing him every time he gets anything below a perfect grade in school...

Not a thing in the 80s and 90s.

Harry was born 1980, he went to primary school from roughly 1984 to 1990.

I remember working with MS-DOS in 1991, PCs at the time were used primarily by engineers to calculate complicated stuff. Only a few pc's were connected to the internet at all and it was all text-based. The internet as we know it today did not even exist, Tim Berner's Lee invented html in 1989 and it slowly gained popularity in 1991/1992.

In the middle the 1990s (say 1993-1997) the next big thing in education was thought to be CD-Roms. You could buy them in stores like books. They were structured like a mix out of books and modern websites. Big advantage were the great search functions, no more flipping through several books to find what you are looking for and the incorporation of multi-media without waiting for hours to download pictures. But those CD-Roms were expensive so most still relied on books.

You can go the route you described by having the Dursleys using books from the bookstore or books borrowed from the local library. Personally I think that would be a bit too much effort and too much money. IMO they are more likely to dump Harry at the local library with insane demands and come to pick him up hours later at closing time.

***** It would indeed be the most accessible option and librarians could get hold of any book published and available in Britain and would /want/ to. Librarians did then what search engines do now, only they're human and more nuanced and don't need correct search terms (and still can do that job if they have their degrees in librarianship).

Back then, there were a lot more libraries and every schoolkid would have been taken to one at some point during primary school and shown how they work. Other than going swimming, it was the most popular 'field trip' back then.

** 'I know what you're doing,' Lupin told Harry, as he searched for a book in his various stacks of books. 'You're trying to hide your intelligence, to keep your head down. Understandable, but,' he panted, while dragging a book aside containing, according to the title, /The Complete history of Magic. '/You shouldn't hide yourself,' the man who spent his days hiding a large part of himself told him. 'Your intelligence is something you should be proud of!' He beamed, holding out a book to him. Harry squinted. /A crash course to self-defense, by Goderic Gryffindor and Uther Pendragon,/ it read. 'Obviously this is a translation,' Lupin said, almost breathless. 'There are rumors of making it a instructive graphic novel detailing the positions and gestures, but it'll be in two or three books because it's too big to draw all of it right away.'

'Thank you professor,' Harry said with a faint grin.

Lupin beamed. He had heard from some of the younger folks that Harry taught them what to do if cornered by a Dementor, and of course he was quite pleased Harry had had the good instinct to do so; but he rather suspected Harry would stop immediately if he ever found out the teachers knew, so he thought it better to give him more material to teach and watch what happened. James had been a bit like that, and Peter had been the king of underperforming, and this had always helped them to stay challenged with stuff they actually LIKED, although it had taken Remus a while to realise it. James, who was sharp and clever and outspoken, clearly didn't /care/ about schoolwork, but Peter... well, everyone had been worried that he'd fail at becoming a Animagus, but while he /had/ needed some help, more then the others, he had managed, in the end. Quite a feat. And when the war came, though he trembled and hid a lot, he /had/ managed to survive and grown enough backbone to go after the traitor - something Remus hadn't been able to at the time. Harry, for his part, merely assumed Lupin was trying to get him to show more of his abilities in class, and gave him his most innocent looking 'I've no idea what you're talking about, but I'll drag the book with me if you want, and bring it back in a untouched state'smile and left Remus to his remiscining.
