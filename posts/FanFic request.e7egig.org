Hey peeps!

Looking for this fic which is essentially a love triangle (square?) Daphne is a professor at Hogwarts, Gabrielle is involved, and I think the last girl is Susan?

I remember something about Harry faking it with Daphne for her parents or something of the sorts

I appreciate it guys.

Cheers!


** Are you thinking about *The After Years* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6988455/5/The-After-Years]]

Gabrielle, Daphne and Tonks.

*(Post-war) One witch 7 years his junior, one witch his own age, and one witch 7 years his senior. All vying for Harry Potter's affections. Who will win out?*

Harry is a teacher and agrees to be pretend to be Daphne's "boyfriend" for an evening with her parents at some point?

This it? Let me know.
