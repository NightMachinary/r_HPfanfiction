Sirius doesn't die when he goes through the Veil, nor does he go to another dimension. Instead he awakes in the past, and has to live his life knowing what will happen and evading the Unspeakables on his trail.

• Your decision if Sirius is in his younger body or if he becomes Stubby Boardman.

• If he is in his younger body, he is stuck in a time loop. How does he deal with it?

• How does Harry summon him with the Ring? Is it because he isn't truly alive because of the loop?

• Alternately, you can find a way for Sirius to break the loop, and change time, but the Unspeakables have a way of tracing it, and he must ultimately face the consequences of his actions.

• Maybe Sirius becomes an Unspeakable that lives on a Jeremy Bearimy timeline. Or there are Unspeakables living on Jeremy Bearimy timelines.


** Stubby would be hilarious. Especially if Luna calls him Sirius whenever she sees him.
