I've lost passion for a story I was writing and I'm not really sure what to do. Should I just delete it, or do I leave it as a testament of my failure? It just irritates me looking at it and knowing nothing's really going to come of it! I love the concept and I may return to it eventually, but right now it's just kind of dying in my mind! Advice please!


** Readers would hate it if you deleted it. Maybe someone had just started binge-reading it and then boom, overnight, it's gone! Incredibly distracting. No, you owe your readers to keep it up. And post a notice-chapter that it's on indefinite hiatus/probably abandoned so they don't spend months waiting for an update. If you were sure not to return, I'd say post a sort of “epilogue chapter” where you give the outline of what would have happened til the end, but if you think you may finish it a long time in the future you'd best not.

*** Listen to this person OP! There are a ton of abandoned stories that I still read and I'm glad they're still up.

So yeah, don't delete. Maybe mark it as incomplete/abandoned (in tags or summary) so new readers know what they're getting into. If you're sure not to return, an epilogue chapter would be awesome. I think that some sort of brief "what would happen next and how it would have ended" summary is good even if might pick it back up in the future.

*** Yep. If possible edit the first chapter (very clearly if you have extensive ANs) andor summary to say it's abandoned. But leave it up.

** At times, I feel like deleting my HP/SW story because I can't find any will to even edit the chapters I do have done, let alone continue it. But, there's really no harm in just leaving it.

***** Aaah! A crossover then. I thought HP/SW was like HP/GW or HP/HG, and SW was a /character/ who Harry was being paired with.

** This is of course just my opinion, but I find that leaving such stories be is a great way to gain some perspective down the line. Everytime I feel like my writing is shit, I go back to my old profile and look at the first couple of stories. Then I realize that although my writing's shit, it could be far worse.

*** Things don't have to be posted publicly for you to be able to do that though.

The trouble with leaving something you know is poorly written posted up, is that it's likely to deter readers from looking at your newer work because they'll assume it's no better. Fanfiction readers have hundreds of thousands of fics to choose from and limited time to do it in. You have to at least try to give them a reason to choose yours. And (in my opinion, obviously) leaving poorly written material there on your profile isn't the way to do it.
