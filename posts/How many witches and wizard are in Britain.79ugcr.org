In the canon, there is a ministry of magic, therefore we can assume that the magical population is high enough to warrant one. Also, we see that there are quite a few large families (Weasleys, Blacks) while Pottermore hints that there are /many/ magical families and a /very/ organized social structure but Harry's account in Gringotts is number 687 which also according to the Wikia is the Potter family vault while vault 713 which we can assume opened twelve years at the least and /very/ old at the most after it which does not boast of a large population unless if there are many other Gringotts branches with overlapping vault numbers. We must also consider the fact there are many departments in the ministry of magic and as death eaters which implies the population is quite large

Therefore all things, both mentioned here and those I forgot to write, considered I assume the magical British population to be around 100,000. What do you think is the most sensible number?


** The main argumens here are:

- the education capacity angle. Hogwarts would be secondary education, and is implied to be the only institution of its kind in the UK, the alternatives are homeschooling, studying abroad or some kind of vocational training. The stated capacity is 1000 students, which might be a case of writer sucking at giving things a scale, but is actually fairly large for what it is (for comparison a typical central European gymnasium that isn't located in a metropolitan area has about half of that number). Honestly, shopkeepers and such probably don't need the sort of academic education Hogwarts offer, and the headmaster has a status comparable to high government official (minister etc)

- There's an entire government with executive and judicial branches

- There's media and professional-ish sport league as well, suggesting population large enough to sustain them

- There's no stated upper limit of how old a wizard can get (apart from "considerably higher age than muggles") which can skew the perception somewhat

My own guess would be a population in the 20-60K range with the most likely figure in the low 30Ks, or about 0,005% of UK's population (1 in 20K). This figure is roughly comparable to San Marino, for further comparison Liechtenstein and Monaco both have a bit under 40K citizens, Andorra has something like 75K etc..

** Evidence in favour of a smaller wizarding world mostly comes from JK Rowling:

- Hogwarts is the only British school of magic in the UK
- Only 1000 students in Hogwarts

However, the books themselves imply a larger wizarding world. Wizarding Britain is large enough to have:

- Book signings
- Specialty stores and brands
- Highly attended sporting events
- A very large and inefficient government.

And these things are simply not possible with only a few thousand people.

In the end, you have a bit of leeway. If you go off JKR's figures (ever a dangerous exercise), you get 12K to 20K people. But the books imply a larger population a larger population at points (I'd say around 100K, one fifth the population of Luxembourg and a fraction of muggle London). It's up to you.

*** Some of these are I think fairly tenuous evidence for a large population. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Book signings
#+end_quote

Doesn't really say anything about population. You get book signings for all sorts of niche areas with very limited audiences, especially in academia. All you need for a book signing is a temporary concentration of, say, 20+ people who are interested in the author/book.

#+begin_quote
  Specialty stores and brands
#+end_quote

Again, doesn't say much about the population, especially given the very different nature of production in the wizarding world. Wizards do not require large scale manufacturing, complex supply chains etc. With a few notable exceptions (books, brooms), most shops probably sell items made by the shopkeeper.

#+begin_quote
  Highly attended sporting events
#+end_quote

This can be a function of enthusiasm and ease of attendance as much as numbers. See: attendance in small town America at high school football games. The Quidditch world cup can't really be used to determine British wizarding population because it's a global event and magic made travel to Britain extremely easy. There could easily have been a substantial portion of the global population of wizards in attendance.

#+begin_quote
  A very large and inefficient government.
#+end_quote

Well, a very officious government. But I wouldn't say inefficient. We've seen throughout the books that actually the wizarding government uses a large amount of executive power which is a lot more direct/efficient (at the cost of democratic checks) than Muggle government IRL. We also don't really have any strong idea for the size of the Ministry. We know there are lots of departments, but many of the departments could easily have 1-2 people in them, like Arthur Weasley's. Even the bigger ones are likely smaller than the fandom frequently presents. For example it seems unlikely that there are more than 15-25 Aurors.

** I had run some numbers because I was curious - oversimplified as they were probably - and the number I got in Britain was something like 53,000 wizards, assuming roughly 5 million wizards worldwide (which at the time of Harry's entering Hogwarts would be 1 in 1000 being a wizard, globally).

I think that's a decent number to maintain a somewhat complex secret world. That number isn't accounting for sentient magical creatures or squibs though, so add those in and it seems reasonable-ish to me.

**** Basically I took a guesstimate of how many wizards there could be worldwide - it had to be reasonable enough to maintain a society of some complexity but also not be noticeable to Muggles. 1 in 1000 being a wizard sounded about good to me.

In 1990, that would mean roughly 5 million wizards globally. At the same time, Britain's population (sayeth Google) was 57.25 million, and global was 5310 million. Assuming Britain's wizarding population is proportional to how much of the world population it had then it would have roughly 53,000-54,000 wizards in it. Been a while since I did proportions, might have got it wrong idk, but I like this number because of the following:

With a growth rate of 0.1% yearly (Britain in 1980), you'd get (0.1/100)*54000 = 54 kids yearly, which is 14 more than Harry's incoming Hogwarts class size (40 kids, 10 per House). As Draco was almost sent to Durmstrang, you can clearly choose to attend other schools, and some of those births would be squibs probably - so 54 kids a year or so would cover the Hogwarts class size for Harry quite nicely and sprinkle about some special cases too.

Alternately, maybe the extra 14 all just got murdered by various magical bullshit in their childhood. Strangled by gnomes or cursed into topiaries or purged by Death Eaters, idk, something. Or maybe they're Weasleys. Point is, they can be accounted for, and thus this population size covers Hogwarts near-perfectly, and Hogwarts covers this population size near-perfectly without a need for inventing other schools to pick up the slack.

I never intended this to be rigorous so there's a lot of fuzzy bits and I forgot where I stuck the paper I wrote most of this down on so this is a reconstruction. But I think it works. And yeah, feel free to use the number if you want!

EDIT: Doing more math with proportions, Wizarding Britain would have about 120 law enforcement agents - so, Aurors and Hit Wizards combined. There is no wizarding British army - or the Aurors act as it perhaps - so that's the government's sum total of combat troops basically. Counting the names of the Death Eaters on the wiki, Voldemort had 33 confirmed followers, plus however many werewolves Fenrir brought, plus the Snatchers, plus other lesser Death Eaters...his rebellion very well could have straight outnumbered the British Ministry's combat forces at its height, with this population. So at 54,000 British wizards, Voldemort's army is a genuine, massive threat to the wizarding government.

****** I'm literally just googling how many people work in a given field in Britain and setting up the proportion XD But these two fields are kinda exceptions, I think.

I don't think farming is a thing in the wizarding world - Hermione states that you can increase the amount of food you have if you already have some, so basically all you'd need is a loaf of bread and you could duplicate it ad infinitum provided you're skilled at transfiguration. I'm pretty sure they feed themselves through a society-wide Jesus-like multiplication of the loaves and fishes, with those who can't duplicate food buying it off of those who can.

For healthcare, all that we know exists is St. Mungo's and then Pomfrey, and honestly with a population this size I don't see a need for much else. Maybe there'd be a few private healers working for rich houses or catering to the criminal underclass, but for the most part one hospital seems good for a population capable of healing most injuries on their own.

One prison works, too, especially if guarded by eldritch horrors. One newspaper is about what you'd expect with this population (after comparing to Ithaca, NY, which apparently has roughly 54k people) plus a few niche things like the Quibbler. I'm actually kinda surprised by how well this pop is fitting, the more I look...

***** Using the Hogwarts year sizes aren't very accurate for painting the bigger picture though. While it may work for Magical Britain, other countries ought to have a fair amount more children per year, adjusted for the ratio of population sizes. We know that the Death Eaters murdered a large number of people, many of them close or at the age to have children. Outside of Europe, which may have had reduced populations due to Grindelwald too, populations may be even higher, though we don't know of the frequency of large-scale magical conflicts.

** There's no satisfying conclusion from canon. Even if Harry's year is smaller than the other ones due to the war, I think the average year at Hogwarts has a maximum of 60 students per year (otherwise it would need more teachers), which would put the number of Hogwarts students around 400, not 1000, which would mean there are merely 6000 wizards and witches in Britain if Hogwarts were the only school.

The economical and administratorial infrastructure we see in the series implies a much larger community however, closer to the population of a mid-sized town, or a microstate like Liechtenstein or Andorra.

For my personal headcanon, I go for something in between, around 20,000 wizards and witches. That's enough to explain the infrastructure, but few enough to justify the prevalence of Hogwarts-educated wizards and witches in Britain.

2) A significant percentage of the wizarding world died.

I vaguely remember Molly saying that during the war everyone was actually more desperate to love and marry each other while they still could so that kinda leaves the second one.

Which would imply that if there are 1000 people at Hogwarts, and 42 in Harrys year, that at least 70% of the population either died or fled the country.

You can say that again. There's certain aspects of their society that seem more fitting for a size of at least 200k, then there's Hogwarts and other interaction which point towards a size more around 5k.

I don't hate the idea of there being other less prestigious schools where the bulk of the population attend, but for a multitude of reasons that only really works in an AU... nothing in canon really reflects this (everyone seems to assume that people go to Hogwarts).

It kinda annoys me when people write that there's all these other schools, making their population as big as the Wizengamot, pop-stars and Quidditch World Cups suggest, yet don't really show people everywhere (!) who didn't attend Hogwarts and don't really care about Gryffindor, Dumbledore or Hogsmeade (should be at least 97% of the population). Also, please explain why Hermione *and* the Weasleys attend Hogwarts.

** You know I was just going to make this post. I wanted the answer of 'If Hogwarts is the only school in Britain and most wizards go to it, how big is the Wizarding population?'

It would seem to be best to use 'graduating wizards' as your benchmark here, as it lets you avoid issues such as birthrates, earlier kids in the wizarding world, and childhood death rate / accident rate.

Hogwarts is depicted to have losing a student to an accident as unusual. Thus, at graduation (OWL), would depend on your average class size:

Sorted by Average Dorm Size:

- 4: 4 students x 2 gendered dorms x 4 houses = 32 students/year
- 5: 5 students x 2 gendered dorms x 4 houses = 40 students/year
- 6: 6 students x 2 gendered dorms x 4 houses = 48 students/year

I don't know where the 1000 number came from, but that would translate to 17 students per dorm, assuming no students leave after their owls. Seem like the numbers don't match up (surprise).

Taking your student/year number, we can calculate how many wizards their would be if no-one died before their life expectancy. Britain Life Expectancy: 81.6 years. Also using numbers for 100 and 150, assuming wizards magic increases their life more than magical accidents reduce it.

Assuming you count an adult as being 18 years old (Years-18)*students/year = Potential Wizards

- 82 Year Life Expectancy: 4dorm: 2048 5dorm: 2560 6dorm: 3072
- 100 year Life Expectancy: 4dorm: 2624 5dorm: 3280 6dorm: 3936
- 150 year Life Expectancy: 4dorm: 4224 5dorm: 5280 6dorm: 6336

I'm inclined to set it as a higher life expectancy than non-wizards, however, given the lack of ancient people seen in the series, I'd also peg it as not much more than 125 or 150. Even if wizards live that long, a vast majority do not seem to stay in society/workforce. After all, a large part of the governing body seems middle-aged.

So we are looking at a population of less than 10K Hogwarts-educated Witches. I'm going to use 4000, which seems to be a nice setup between dorm size and population.

We now have to adjust for actuarial rates (Death rates over time) and those who are not enrolled in Hogwarts. Even if all Witches go to Hogwarts, it is clear at least some half-breeds do not regularly attend. You can also adjust for the fact the wizarding world had two recent wars.

I'd imagine it'd work out to about 2K active wizards. Which honestly, feels like it fits the series. With 2K wizards, a team of 30 or 40 terrorists is an huge rebellion. A tribe of 20 werewolves is a significant army to recruit.

** I'd say something north of 10,000, and even that is pushing it. Anything larger than that, and Voldemort wouldn't have been nearly as powerful, with an inner circle of - what was it? - a dozen and a half?

As for Hogwarts, something like 300 seems like a more realistic figure for the 90's, caused by war, a steadily decreasing, and mostly elderly population - not to mention the emigration in the late ~'75-'81 and '97-'98. Another 300 make up those going abroad, home-schooled children, those who aren't allowed (Lupin was a special case), can't afford going there, or those who don't get an education at all, like Merope Gaunt.

In my headcanon, the population peaked at about 40,000 some 150 years before Harry was born, but by the turn of the 20th century, it had halfed and it kept decreasing. It didn't start to recover before Voldemort's fall in 1998.

The idea of huge wizarding populations, battlefields with three-figure losses thrown around with reckless abandon, seems unappealing and very unrealistic to me. Both the order and Voldemort's inner circle seemed very small, and they were essentially the "armies" of their times. Even the second war (when the ministry was under Voldemort's control) didn't break the SoS.

I imagine other, more sparsely populated countries like Russia, Canada and the Scandinavian countries, having a larger "wizard density" though.

#+begin_quote
  I'm guessing between 300,000 and 1 million world wide. I'll explain how I got these numbers in the next paragraphs.

  We do have a few solid leads, as Ryan has pointed out. I'm going to take the numbers given by Ryan, and a few other things, and try to get some numbers straight.

  First of all, the biggest point is the size of the World Cup stadium. 100,000. That means there is at least that many wizards in the world, or at least, human-type creatures in the magical world.

  Hogwarts must have between 300-800 students, with a number of teachers as well. But, given that there must be between 40-100 per year, and a life expectancy somewhat higher than a Muggle (Let's say, 80-100 years)^{[1],} I'm guessing the English population to be around *3000-10,000*. This seems to be fairly consistent with the number of shops in Diagon Alley, the number of people working for the ministry of magic, etc.

  Further proof of this number can be found in the Goblet of Fire. It's mentioned there that there is 200 portkeys put around England for people to travel to the World Cup. The one that we see there had a total of 11 people gathered around it. Assuming that the average is about 10 per portkey, that gives 2000 people going to the world cup. That number seems consistent with the number of wizards in England at around 4K-10K, given that at most half of the population wanted to go to the cup.

  In the year 2001, there were about 60 million people, according to UK census statistics. Given the assumption that the population is roughly equivalent in every country, and a world population of about 6 billion in that year, there is about 100 times more wizards in the world than there is in England. That brings the estimate to between 300,000 and 1 million wizards in the entire world.

  This number is consistent with the world cup. Given that transportation isn't much of an issue, but there is no television, it's reasonable to assume that between one tenth and one third of the world population of wizards could in fact attend the world cup.

***** Well then they could have /posted a message/ pointing out the typo, instead of just assumed I was stupid and downvoted. (I naturally meant 10.000).

********* Well, not /really/, but it makes your posts less likely to be read since they appear lower on the page. It's a minor inconvenience, but it's a petty, rude thing to do to downvote someone for no reason.

********** The reason is that you wrote “ten hundred”. Yes it's a mistake, but people downvote for mistakes. That's the reason.

** Messing around with canon clues gave me an upper bracket of 50,000 people. I believe I used the following (but this was a while ago and I may have forgotten something):

- number of students in Hogwarts

- online demographic statistics to get a rough % of 11-18 year olds in the British population

- checking out other demographic statistics with different average lifespans and extrapolating the 11-18y/o percentages to account for this

I doubled this for my own fic, on the following reasoning:

- I wanted to include some kind of wizarding agricultural economy

- I had ideas for other wizarding settlements

- I wanted to ensure that the governmental structure wasn't too top-heavy for the population size

** For my headcanon, I go with 200k since we know that there are multiple schools in Britain (if Hogwarts is the best there have to be others) and fewer people make it difficult to base an economy. There are at least one hundred shops in magical London and each has to be supplied, whether with products or resources. Not every one of those 200k is fully integrated into the magical society however, especially after the last muggleborn cleansings under Voldemort. Just because you have a wand does not mean that you are forbidden to work in a bank or sell Fish and Chips. And not everyone uses Gringotts for the same reason.
