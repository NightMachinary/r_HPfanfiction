** Ok, a foreword. Pairings make people act stupid. Pairings I don't like make /me/ act stupid at times. It's just how it is.

Now, this will be from my POV and experience. People seem more forgiving if you tag or tell the end pairing up front. To me, having the pairing be a surprise doesn't lend anything good to the story. In very few cases is "This is the pairing!" a thing that makes a story better, it's not a good in itself. I don't want the romance to come down to just who is with whom. I want the romance to develop. At least then, people will probably stick around to see how it gets there and how the romantic relationship progresses. That's the most interesting part of a romance for me.

There's not much you can do for pairing preferences. I mainly stick to H/Hr stories, but I can tolerate some R/Hr in those stories, at least for a little while. But since that pairing doesn't interest me in the slightest, I'll probably lose interest in the romance angle much more easily if it persists.

** Hardcore shippers are rarely rational. For example in [[/u/Starfox5]]'s latest [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), some readers raged that Harry dated around and didn't find his ‘one true love' at age 15. When Hermione took one other boyfriend after age 17, they slung all kinds of insults at her character. Those reviews are truly amusing to read.

On our sub, there are often requests for ‘Harry dating around like a normal teen' fics. “The Lady Thief” should fit their needs nicely. This story doesn't end with Voldemort's defeat, but only starts to get really interesting.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Since you are asking two questions here

- Tagging relationships and not tagged relationships with the protagonists:

Basically, those character/relationship tags are the advertisement of a story, the packaging so to say. I like to know what I get before investing time (and money in the case of products) into something. There are things that I don't enjoy and therefore won't invest in. Ron/Hermione is one of these things. Not because I say that it is literally worse than Hitler, but because it is a symptom of a lot of things I dislike (Big Weasley Family, Harry becoming an Auror, Hermione joining the ministry, Ginny as generic sports girl, the R/Hr relationship is almost always written in a way that would fail spectacularly in real life). I certainly won't flame authors for writing trash ships like Snarry, but I guarantee that I'm dropping that story AND leaving a review complaining that there was no warning/foreshadowing. Because the author advertised something different than his product, I feel cheated because his lack of/bad communication cost me a couple hours I could have spent reading stuff that I like.

- Background character ships

To make a long argument short, a lot of these ships will feel like asspulls with no proper build up. The readers won't believe that Neville is Hermione's life mate just because you say so, you need to show us "on screen" (the reason why Ron/Hermione is so disliked, most of their on screen interactions are closer to murder than to love). And in the case of a lot of 2nd row characters (Neville, Dean, Cedric) there are canon reasons why they would not work out. Hermione/Terry Boot is easier to sell with proper build up than Hermione/Seamus.

** Pairings say a lot about the type of writer. People who write Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny are usually way too enamored with canon to write fics that I would enjoy. Case in point:

#+begin_quote
  But since people are SO afraid that it's going to be Ron/Hermione that they can't stand a little bit of (CANON!) romance that they're actually DROPPING the story over it.
#+end_quote

As if canon had any romance between Ron/Hermione besides one kiss. Lots of relationship angst maybe...

#+begin_quote
  In this or the next chapter, the story will begin to diverge dramatically from canon
#+end_quote

Sounds like this story was a canon rehash up to this point. Another reason to not be interested.

When deciding which fanfic to read next I'm investing my time and taking a risk that it's going to be trash (for me). I often enjoy fics that re-work and fix some of the things I dislike in Rowling's writing, are able to take canon with a grain of salt and maybe diverge from it entirely when it suits them. I don't particularly care for the Weasleys. It's almost a certainty that I have to sit through lots of Weasley-wank in a Romione fic.

I could go on, but I don't think it's as unreasonable as you make it out to be. If a fic is tagged H/Hr and they only get together (or have any romantic involvement) at the final hour of the fic it seems a bit deceptive.

Not to mention that there's a perfect way to avoid all this pairing drama: *Just write a Gen fic!*
