I was wondering what year/book of Harry Potter has been redone the most. I've seen people redo/au year/book 1-7 but which would you say is the most common and which is the least common?


** I would say: 1, 6, (8), 5, 7, 4, 2, 3.

- I think people underestimate how many abandoned first year fics there are. They're ubiquitous across genre and premise. Harry Crow, HPMOR and Seventh Horcrux are all 'first year' fics.

- And I think the sub overestimates he number of fourth year fics. Fanfic wasn't big around that time, and aside from the ending, year 4 is pretty low-stakes. Fourth year is very popular for Harry/Fleur shippers, of course, but that remains a niche pairing outside this sub.

- I'd put 2 in front of 3, due to the few first year fics that manage to make it into second year. Also, the author of HPMOR actively encouraged people to write sequels to his first-year fic, which probably helps at the margins.

- Sixth and fifth year benefit from the growth in fanfiction around that time. Sirius and Cedric's deaths, and the generally increased stakes, also provide opportunities for a different, +edgelord+ character arc. Harry's also old enough that the shipping isn't too weird.

- Seventh year depends a bit on how you define it. There were a whole bunch written during the wait for DH, and then some more, but they get very AU (especially since the characters are now old enough to fuck...). The problem is, DH is the least structured and most driven of the books, which makes redoing it quite tricky. That's why eighth year fics are even more popular (although rarely recommended here) -- all the structure of Hogwarts, but the characters are now of age and don't have plot commitments!

*** Am I remembering wrong, or isn't Seventh Horcrux the entire series? Doesn't it end with SPOILER him a professor?

** Surely first year, from every fic that intends to be a 7 year AU but never gets past the first.

*** Ah but does that outnumber the Indy Harry 5th/6th year stories where Harry 'trains' and meets his one true love before correcting Dumbledore and brushing aside Voldemort?

** I would assume Fourth/Fifth year, I think second and sixth would be the least. In my perspective anyway

*** Yeah I have to agree. I've noticed the most fourth year fics and the least amount of second year which is why when I start writing HP fanfiction I'm going to try and do a second year fic just to do something kinda different than what most people do.

** Judging by the sheer amount of bad IndiHarry fics I'd say sixth year, with fourth being a close second.

** Prior to Goblet of Fire, there wasn't much of a fanfiction presence for the Harry Potter series; partly because fanfiction wasn't widely popular yet (Chamber of Secrets is actually older than Fanfiction dot net), and partly because they came out at yearly intervals. Then you had three years for Order of the Phoenix, two years for Half-Blood Prince, and two years for Deathly Hallows.

In my experience, the general fandom disappointment with Half-Blood Prince (and the general high regard for Order of the Phoenix) has led sixth year to be the most common starting point for fanfic.

The least common is probably second year, mostly for lack of relevance - Harry's still too young for independent or romantic plots, and has yet to showcase any exceptional talents. There's very few third year fics, as well, for similar reasons.

I may not have been around at the time, so I'm not sure I really understand this.

From what I've seen, /Half-Blood Prince/ is actually one of the most loved books, despite being controversial within... certain shipping factions (which may be what you are thinking about, but should probably not be conflated with the general fandom). It introduced a lot more light-heartedness, as well as mysteries to be figured out in fanfiction and fandom, such as "Is Snape Good or Bad?" or "Is Harry a Horcrux?" or "Will Harry die at the end of the Series?" and stuff like that. /Order of the Phoenix/, I think, is more generally controversial within the fandom, particularly due to CAPSLOCK-Harry, and being too long-winded (even though it's personally my favourite book, along with /HBP/). /Deathly Hallows/, too, is also more controversial than /HBP/, with the Year-Long Camping Trip and of course the "dreaded" epilogue.

So considering this, I agree that sixth year is one of, if not the most re-done year of all, but not for the reasons you think.

** I read mostly Drarry, so I'm sure that colors my perspective, but of the ones I read where they are at Hogwarts it's mostly eighth year. If it's earlier, it's usually sixth or seventh year, with a few fifth year ones. I have read a few fics that span the entire seven years, but I don't come accross those very often (and they tend not to be to my liking anyway).
