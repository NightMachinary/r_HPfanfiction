:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry is the son of Voldemort and Snape. When he tells Snape he is his son he doesn't believe him so harry has to hide that memory of him telling Snape. Harry tortures and kills Ron and another student and displayes there bodys in the grate hall then kidnaps Hermione and has her use a blood quell then puts her in the Gryffindor hour glass to be discovered after so many points are earned. I think it was a Draco x Harry.
