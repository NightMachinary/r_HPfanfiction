Many people make arguments that Dumbledore is evil because he left Harry at the dursely doorstep and never checked up on him, then they jump through several mental hoops to lay the blame of everything on him.

The thing is the many assume that the blood wards only provide protection from outside forces. I think the blood wards protected Harry's soul from being corrupted by the horcruxes. Also, he didn't check on him because the dursley's had to willingly keep Harry, otherwise the protection would not work, and Dumbledore did not want to give the dursley's a chance to decline to keep Harry.

I am not saying Dumbledore was infallible but many of his supposed evils could be explained this way.

IMO, Dumbledore was misguided in some of his actions but not evil.


** This assumes that Dumbledore knew that Harry was a horcrux from the start. I don't think that's true. Dumbledore first realised that Voldemort had made horcruxes when Harry showed him the diary at the end of CoS

*** He may not know about the horcrux in his scar, but he may have sensed the dark magic in his scar. The point I am trying to make is that people make a lot of assumptions when trying to paint Dumbledore evil. If we make different assumptions, some of his actions can be seen as necessary.

This makes his charector a lot more morally ambiguous than outright evil.

**** The problem is that it's easier to assume he did not know, and that he left Harry to be severely mistreated by his relatives without any real supervision. Mrs. Figg was useless.

And we never see ANY indication whatever protection left in the house was ever needed, Wizards saw Harry on the street sometimes, and he wasn't protected outside of it, someone could just have him followed to school/market/other side of the street and kidnapped/hurt him.

The no-touch protection was against Voldemort specifically and wasn't powered by him staying in the House.

And there's NO evidence that staying in the house shielded him from the Horcrux, since when he leaves nothing changes it, if anything Lily's protection was the one shielding him.

Dumbledore KNEW what the Dursley's were like, and yeah, JK wanted to go for the classic mistreated-orphan-is-saved-by-magic plot.

But inside the story it just paints Dumbledore as neglectful.

And if there was more logic, Harry would be very different from canon, not nearly as well adjusted or well-intentioned, the most magical thing about him is that he was still a good person with 0 good influences on him.

If anything Dumbledore would find out his great plan of leaving a child in an abusive home created Tom Riddle 2.0, but now he's famous, has a good standing with society, and has zero interests in working for the good of anyone that's not himself or those closest to him.

Canon Dumbledore is morally ambiguous, he can be seen either as neglectful, or out of touch, can be even seen as a utilitarian, and this is more an effect of how JK planned the plot and then went from Children's Book to Young Adults. And still left some stuff.

** I mean, him not being around wouldn't stop them from just dropping Harry off in Belgium and not ever coming back. That would be pretty strongly 'declining to keep him'.

And well, yeah. Everything Dumbledore does could be explained as Machiavellian Villainy, Misguided Good-Intentions, Him Not Being As Smart and Infallible as His Mythology States, or Actual Good Ideas Done Out Of Necessity. That's what makes him so appealing, IMO. That ambiguity. It's what makes him the character that most interests me, anyway. :)

** We know from book 5 that Dumbledore knew he was condemning Harry to "ten dark and difficult years", and that Mrs. Figg (who reported to Dumbledore) deliberately made sure that Harry didn't enjoy it when she babysat because she expected the Dursleys would find a different babysitter if Harry wasn't made sufficiently miserable. Dumbledore /knew/ that the Dursley household was a cruel place and left Harry there.

Given what we know for certain that Dumbledore knew about the Dursleys and about the prophecy, his actions and inactions regarding Harry don't make sense as being benevolent. He left Harry somewhere he knew he was miserable and mistreated for ten years, and kept sending him back there. Knowing that there'd be an inevitable confrontation between Harry and Voldemort in which one had to die, he didn't do anything to prepare Harry to actually win such a fight. To my mind, the explanation that lines up best with the available facts both before and at Hogwarts is that Harry was being groomed as a martyr.

** I always find it stupid when a fic bashes Dumbledore for not giving Harry to Sirius after James and Lily die. Dumbledore was told or at least hinted at that Sirius was the secret keeper, he only has reasons to suspect that Sirius betrayed them, why would he take Harry to him?

** I can go either way on evil manipulative Dumbledore. What upsets me the most about these fics is that Dumbledore never changes his plans to adapt to new information or events. He sets up the plan for Harry to sacrifice himself so Dumbledore can kill Tom, and then that's the plan. No change, no deviation, no improvement, no improvisation. For an all powerful master manipulator, these writers just can't write that. It's beyond them. This is, IMHO, why fics with good Dumbledore are almost always superior to evil Dumbledore.

** "Evil" is a very different word then "child endangerment and abandonment". For me, I don't see Evil as a 1:1 meaning of what taking Dumbledore to ask should consist of. It's just a symptom of the bigger problems with trying to define his actions throughout the series.

As many would argue, the books are only supposed to represent Harry's POV for better or for worse. And that's the issue. A lot of adults started this series as Harry's age and now we're closer to the Marauder's, and so it's easier for an adult to have Concerns with how the children we're treated in this series.

Leaving an infant, asleep or not, on a doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter is the definition of criminal. The man starts the Philospher's Stone already with one foot in prison. That's the appeal behind this archetype of Albus Dumbledore, however. Sometimes that "supposed evil" is just a revision in intent with none of his base choices too heavily altered, and the realization is absolutely poignant. He didn't intend the amount of harm he caused, but it's still there.

** If Dumbledore cannot keep a child out of a cupboard, he does not deserve any respect. Hell, if coercion isn't valid just bribe the Dursleys and have then give an unbreakable vow in return (so that they cannot come up with new ways to demand money). Although it should not be necessary to bribe someone not to keep a family member in inhumane conditions.

Also, Dumbledore is a person of authority. It is his responsibility to make sure that Harry is safe, especially since him being at the Dursleys is Dumbledore's doing.

Also, if Dumbledore would be even remotely competent, why does it repeatedly take 2/3 teenagers to save the day? Doylist explanations cannot be used to explain in-universe behaviour in a satisfying way. If Dumbledore can't be there for plot reasons, fine. But then Harry and co should lose any respect they had, because otherwise the story lacks internal consistency.

*** I think a lot of these problems come from the fact that the series goes from whimsical children's books to darker YA books.

Because of that, we have things like Hagrid giving Dudley a pig tail, which fits book 1 perfectly, but when you look at that from the gritty, more realistic worldbuilding of later books, it looks like bullying.

In the same way, the way the Dursleys treat Harry would fit a Roald Dahl story perfectly, but when we are further along in the series, and Hermione is worrying about the way elfs are treated, we have to ask, Ok, and what about Harry? Why on Earth is everyone fine with sending him with the Dursleys yet again to be mistreated?

It's the fact that these two different styles live in the same series that we have this problem.

** Evil? No.

Senile or Braindead? Yes.

It's not like Harry could live under the protection of the Blood Wards, AND have somebody check in on him periodically. That would be crazy. And responsible. This is Harry Potter, adults don't do responsible in Harry Potter.

** Dumbledore is not evil. In fact he wants to rid the world of Voldemort for good and already has another Dark Lord under his belt. He doesn't care about Harry - not at first anyways - more than for a tool that needs to be used for this task. He protects him to the best of his ability from Voldemort and his followers so that he stays safe until he is ready to die.
