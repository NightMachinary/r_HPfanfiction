** It shouldn't be, tbh. The reason the Unforgivables are unforgivable, it that you need to feel them. This doesn't apply for Sectumsempra. I think murder (in any way) also gets you lifetime in Azkaban (unknown, really), so you still don't want to kill someone with it. But just attempting to would just be standard attempted murder.

I think the closest piece of evidence we have is Sirius, who would have been accused of murdering Peter and being an accessory to the murders of James and Lily. Of course, his conviction was a huge mess anyway, so it's not the most reliable piece of evidence.

**** Yeah, it's a huge mess. That's why I didn't quote it.

** It should be declared impossible. Whole series it is repeatedly taught that doing magic is actually not that simple as just shouting the incantation, that's actually whole purpose of the school, and then suddenly Harry finds the incantation (without even the appropriate wand movement), and suddenly it works as intended (I guess) just by shouting it against his enemy.

** I wouldn't think so considering the sectumsempra compared to the other three unforgivable a I don't think the sectumsempra is bad enough to be considered unforgivable as well as it probably not being that well known of a curse.

** I don't know of it happening, and since there apparently isn't any special emotional state required (Harry /had no idea what it would do/), designating it as Unforgivable wouldn't make a lot of sense.
