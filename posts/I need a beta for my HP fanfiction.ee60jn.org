This is the subreddit's list of available betas. I'd give it a look if I were you, as well as checking out the subreddit discord.

*** Oh thank you, not the poster but still a new fanfiction writer. The story I am currently publishing is a bit rough bu okay. The next one I am working on will need a beta for sure though.

I want to publish something first so any interested betas can see what and how I write first.

Happy Holidays and thanks again!

** Can you give a plot synopsis? I've started beta-ing before but it turned out to be something that was a total chore for me to get through that other people might like.

*** yes of course! Its a POA fanfic (i'll write it till the V's defeat no matter how long it will be) there's a LOT dueling and battle transfiguration and when i say a LOT it's really ALOT and i dont think there will be any bashing (ron maybe a bit but it's more laziness than bashing) There's alot mentor!McGonagall and mentor!flitwick and some mentor!dumbledore in a few years , harry is not OP but he is powerful and no romance till 5th year at least
