Have a weird craving for a powerful, politically minded Hermione set to take over the world. In the vein of Do Unto others Before they Do untto you. linkffn(8625440)

Thanks in advance


** It's a tall order...

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) counts, kinda.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/682335]]) is a one-shot that has Hermione taking over the world, though it's pretty mediocre and has some unintentional bashing. At the same time, it has this amazing line: [[/spoiler][It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed.â€‹]]

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

  In which Hermione takes over the Wizarding World.

You don't have to particularly like the pairing for this story to work, IMO. It's definitely what you're looking for.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE
