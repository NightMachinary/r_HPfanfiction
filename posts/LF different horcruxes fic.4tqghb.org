In most fanfiction, the horcruxes are the same is they are in Canon. I'm looking for a fic, any fic, where the Horcruxes are different, something like (Dare I say it) HPMOR, where the horcruxes are different and more well hidden.

Thanks


** If you like MoR's approach --- try linkffn(Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin). It starts like your typical cringy Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived, but derails fast enough into a very logical and rational AU with competent characters and interesting divergences from canon. Year Two onwards it's like MoR, if only accessible and without weird philosophy.

It's not really at the horcrux point yet (third year begins this September), but I have a feeling they would be vastly different or at least better hidden and more powerful. The Riddle of the Diary was much more terrifying and tragic, for example.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** I try to vary how Horcruxes are used and treated in my stories.

In "Patron", Voldemort's Horcruxes are - with the exception of the diary, which was a kind of "proof of concept", very different from canon.

Horcruxes have different requirements in "Divided and Entwined", which means they can't be hidden that easily.

*** I like how horcruxes were implemented in *Patron*. They were basically impossible to destroy with conventional means, but also opened up a new venue for attacks.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Isn't it a huge spoiler if you tag a story as having different/no horcruxes?
