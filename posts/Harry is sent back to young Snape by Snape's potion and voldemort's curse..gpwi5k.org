:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Snape used a time turner to give harry a potion, so when later voldemort attacked and cursed harry in hogwarts, harry was not Killed but sent back in time where he met and fell in love with young Snape. He also met his parents and the marauders but they didnt like Each Other. Also the people in harry's time realized harry was the boy they remembered from the past and i think lupin realized they in fact bullied harry. I think in the end harry returned to his own time to older Snape. I Have been looking for this fic for ages and maybe I am just an idiot but i really cant find it. If anyone knows what im thinking of i would be really happy!


** I would love to know about this fic as well!! ðŸ’–

** I don't think this is the fic you are looking for because, while it has many similarities to your description, there are also differences. But it's similar enough I thought you might enjoy reading it while you wait to see if somebody finds your fic.

*** I honestly don't know. It might be it but I don't think so cuz this is not what I remember and I'm pretty sure it was more than one chapter. But thank you anyway!
