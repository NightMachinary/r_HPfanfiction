I've seen several fics now where people were mentioned to be researching a counterspell to the killing curse but are there any in which someone actually succeeds?


** Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

Harry develops a spell that conjures butterflies to fly around him so they can take the hit instead.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Yeah, one of the few ways to defend against the Killing Curse is to intercept it with a physical object, so having a veritable swarm of objects surrounding you to take a hit in your stead seems like quite the effective method.

** Hmm...I remember a fanfic which had the portraits of the Founders of Hogwarts found, they commented on the hexing going on in the halls and how 'we were teaching a bunch of teenagers, did you think we /wouldn't/ put up wards to reflect spells between classes?', and how those wards had apparently been disabled by a previous headmaster for whatever reason. A part of that scene had Salazar Slytherin's portrait commenting that the Killing Curse's spell matrix could easily be disrupted by the simple Lumos charm.

Hmm...but where was it?

** You can easily do it with canon magic. Here's how: Hagrid made a brick wall conjure up with a push of a button on his motorcycle. So make a charmed watch that makes a brick wall in front of you whenever you press a button on the side of it. Simple, easy, done!

Instant Killing Curse blockage. Entirely in canon. Just touch your watch in a duel and you're good. Just need actual brain smarts to charm the watch, but considering the wall button was added by Arthur he can do it to a watch easily enough too. There are loads of people more talented and powerful than him, so they'd be able to do it too. Mass produce them. Killing Curse Block Watches.

**** Conjured objects are real. Conjured metal is metal, a conjured animal has blood and veins and complex organs and a brain. It's solid matter and mass. Therefore it blocks things that hit it. You don't need to "shrink and hide a wall in a dimension space" or anything else. Your headcanon is just needless sidestepping because you don't want to believe the "all powerful killing curse" is actually not so all powerful. And that's on Rowling. But you don't need to literally make stuff up to justify Rowling's shitty worldbuilding skills.

The death curse just isn't that much of a threat if you apply even a bit of intelligence in how you utilize the magic system she has, and that's okay.

** Well, canon shows Dumbledore blocking it with solid objects.

For an actual counterspell, there's the controversial but thought-provoking linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). YMMV greatly; many people adore it, many others can't stand it (usually because Harry is frequently arrogant and abrasive, or due to the lectures on rational thinking interspersed with the plot). I do recommend trying it to see for yourself what you think, because it's complete, intricate, has lots of humor, very few typos, and an impressive antagonist.
