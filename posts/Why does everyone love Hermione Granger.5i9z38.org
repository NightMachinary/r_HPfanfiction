I'm sure we have all found ourselves asking this question. Hermione is easily the most wrote about Female Character in the HP fanfiction community. It is not uncommon for people in this very subreddit to ask for Hermione fics, and I am curious about why.

What makes Hermione Granger so damn readable? There are entire stories with nothing but Hermione goodness, she is shipped with I believe every single male in the series, and 90% of the named females (I have not found a Hermione/Umbridge fic that was more than a smutty piece of garbage), has participated in Harry's Stead (in every single event from the books, and more), has time traveled, Has become a Dark Lady, a Sith Lady, A Time Lord, and The Doctor. (no I am not kidding). She has also become OTHER CHARACTERS ENTIRELY.

Hermione Granger quite literally has taken over the fandom and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Is it a character trait thing? Is it because Emma Watson is an attractive person? Is it because everyone has known a nerdy girl that would be great as something more? You tell me. Oh, and if you have a weird Hermione Story why not drop it here, and tell us about why its good?


** Well, for a first, she is the most prominent female character of the fandom. She's a sidekick to Harry, so basically the second most important character in the book alongside Ron. That gave her a lot of scenes, a (more) detailed character and therefore a lot of angles where authors can start of their stories from.

Then there is Emma Watson, of course. A lot of people have her in their minds when thinking about Hermione Granger. I dare say a big chunk of Hermione in the fandom is just straight up Emma Watson with no trace of Hermione's actual character, let alone her bad traits.

Adding to that is that she is very relatable to a lot of people. She is the nerdy bookworm. I was the nerdy bookworm in my teenage years. She and Harry were fixtures of my teenage life, with Hermione quickly becoming this idealized idea of what kind of girlfriend I'd like to have, while Harry became someone who grew up alongside me, with all the problems that entailed. Hence why I was beyond pissed off when she didn't get together with Harry, the second character I identified with. My first fanfiction ever, written only days after the release of the last book, was the epitome of Ron bash and Harmony crap.

Hermione is also presented as this Uber-woman in the movies. It is rather easy to expose stories of authors who have only seen the movies (or let the movies color their perception of the character). Especially without her bad traits she is a perfect heroine. Kind, compassionate, prodigious, loyal and, thanks to Emma Watson, beautiful. But on the other side you can take her bad traits and just let them rule her. She is arguably cruel to people she perceives as worthy of punishment. She has a fanatical nature about her once she is convinced of a cause. Plus she has the skills to back it all up. Hermione is as easily steered in the direction of Bellatrix Lestrange as she is written into a saint. She is very versatile in her options for character development and I think that is the main reason why authors love to write her.

** I think it's because of this: Hermione is The Female Character in the series. How many other females have some character-defining traits? Even Ginny, who is the MC's love interest, gets almost no attention and, basically, we don't know anything substantial about her. In fact, we don't know a lot about Hermione either. We don't even know her parents names. Why I love reading fics about her? Because I like when protagonist has to work to achieve something, while Harry is basically doing nothing and survives thanks to sheer dumb luck.

** I like Hermione because she is smart, brave, willing to stand up for what she believes in, and has ideals I share.

The idea that she has taken over the fandom is silly, though - Harry remains the most used character. Just about everything you said about her goes for him as well, but doubly so. Shipping included.

*** I wouldn't call it silly. Misguided, to some extent, but there's point in dismissing it. In and outside of the fandom, the sentiment that Hermione should have been the heroine of the series is by no means a fringe opinion. A couple of members in this very subreddit have arguably implied it.

There are GaryStu!Harry writers abound - I won't argue against that. But in regards to warm reception across canon and derivative works in their entirety, Hermione is where it's at. She's been practically deified by a sizeable contigent of the fanbase, and I say that as someone who loves the character.

** Hermione is, at heart, an activist and a more proactive character than most; this makes her a natural focus for attention, as she is the driving force of the action. In this way she is also more heroic than Harry. She takes a stand on what she considers moral absolutes and even rushes boldly where angels fear to tread. By comparison, Harry is a cork in the ocean; easier to identify with but harder to predict in terms of driving the plot.

Also Emma Watson has some really amusing reaction faces, so it makes visualizing her in-scene a bit easier for the writer.

*** True, but the same can be said for any major character in fanfiction. Right? I mean it's super rare to read any FanFic that features a flawed protagonist. I don't think this is particularly egregious in Hermione fics. In H/G fics, Ginny is the most beautiful, smart and amazing person who always knows the right thing to say to get Harry out of his moods. In independent!Harry fics any idea that Harry comes up with is brilliant and he can do no wrong.

** Many reasons, the most important being that she is the most prominent female character in the series. Males identify with Harry, females with Hermione. She is also conventionally intelligent, which is the kind of character a lot of people identify with (note that most Harry-centric stories make him more conventionally smarter than canon too). The way she's presented in canon means that she can be shipped with a large number of characters in a way that someone like Molly Weasley or Minerva McGonagall can't. So that too.

#+begin_quote
  Is it because everyone has known a nerdy girl that would be great as something more?
#+end_quote

Possibly, but I think it comes down to her being very relatable (like Harry), that other characters (like Ron) lack. As a muggleborn it's very easy to identify with her, especially because she brings many ethical/moral considerations into the mix that most of us (should) share. It's not Harry's fault that he lacks such strong convictions, because of his upbringing, but often Hermione gives voice to these things when Harry just goes along with it. Judging from her behaviour she comes from a 'normal' upper-middle class household. I can relate to that better than to an abused child like Harry.

She can be a great voice of reason and a good source of conflict between characters to bounce opposing ideas (I notice people who don't like Hermione seem to have problems with friends vehemently disagreeing with each other). I think JKR understood that and the basic idea of her doubting Harry about Malfoy in Book 6 was a good one. IMHO JKR just went overboard there by her not supporting Harry anymore, which I always considered quite OOC for her (especially if she truly believes that Malfoy is harmless; there is always soemone trying to kill Harry, she wouldn't just ignore danger, judging from all the other books and her constant worrying). Hermione can have an intellectual disagreement on important points without storming out or abandoning her friends if she is used well.

And that's just one aspect of her personality that I personally admire... don't even get me started about her incredible bravery and loyalty. No one could fault her at any point during her Hogwarts years to get out of dodge. As opposed to most other characters she has no particular attachment to Wizarding Britain and she could live a pretty content life in Australia or France or anywhere else. Fiction is often about wish fulfillment and I guess to me it's just an amazing thought to have such a devoted friend. Deathly Hallows is IMHO a flawed book, but there is amazing symbolism in her sacrifice of memory charming her parents and sending them to Australia: She becomes a de-facto orphan, just like Harry. That this is one of the things that Hermione-haters usually obsess about the most as something /against/ her character is a constant source of consternation for me.

Her archetype characteristics relate closely to a fanfiction pet-peeve of mine: *Putting Hermione Granger in Ravenclaw* (I always wanted to make a discussion post about this). It's okay if you're writing an AU and give her a slightly different upbringing or personality, but it drives me up the wall when people imply that this is where she *actually* belongs and Gryffindor was the /'wrong'/ House for her, because she likes to learn ("The Hat just put her in Gryffindor because she wanted to be there" - or some such bullshit). Really, I just wish you'd kill her off and not write about her at all if you miss the point of her character so much. It's like putting Neville into Hufflepuff, because he's shy. It's such a blatant disregard for the theming JKR was obviously going for when putting characters like Neville and Hermione into Gryffindor. You don't even have to read any further than Book 1 to understand this, with Neville standing up to them and Hermione blatantly lying to a bunch of teachers to protect her friends (at a point in her character development when she is still fairly naive and ... socially inept). Why would Hogwarts need a magical Hat to decide House-alignment if the most superficial examination that you could possibly come up with would suffice? I know my anger at this is probably a little irrational, but it completely ruins a story for me when this happens.

As a final point I like to read stories about Hermione, because she has so much unfulfilled potential in canon. I'm pretty outspoken about my distaste of the Ron/Hermione pairing and also I can't see someone like her working for a corrupt Bureaucracy (the Ministry). If you want to change policy and go into politics as an activist you don't become an office clerk handling day to day operation of the government. I know the Ministry is structured a little bit different than Muggle Government, but it is still for the most part an executive branch of their government. Hermione managing to gain a Wizengamot seat to affect change or going into research to prove that blood-purity is bullcrap sounds much more interesting, but is rarely done. Harry's main arc is complete after the final battle, but Hermione pretty much suspended her life for a year and I really like to read EWE stories that have Harry return the favor (yeah, I'm a sap).

**** Oh it's not like I've written some kind of essay about it... I'd have to look through my looong post history to find something relevant.

It's just that I *loathe* that pairing so very much. I'm actually pretty chill about them trying to date at some point (physical attraction and why not...), but the whole idea of them being happily married is just absurd to me. There's some great fics out there that tackle Ron meeting Hermione's family and the unbridled disaster that such a meeting would be.

Honestly, I can't even see Ron and Hermione being friends without Harry as a buffer. Of course Hermione would be Troll fodder without Harry around, but putting that aside they'd just try to ignore each other.

It's called social graces. It's very easy to be smart and witty and cool about it. But Hermione doesn't seem to know how to be social and I know if she were real or in my class I'd be so fed up with her. I don't care how smart or dumb you are if you can't handle social situations, such as school, and you can't understand that people are sick of you showing off then you're not a person I want to have anything to do with and I'll drop you a second.

What kind of school did you go to? At the ages of 11 to ... maybe 16 I found those who only lacked social graces and "cool" much more pleasant to be around than those who considered themselves the arbiters of coolness. There's only a very certain age span in which you can impress people by slacking off, listening to gangster rap and wearing a cool jacket.

You can do so much worse at that age than lacking social graces or being a teacher's pet. For example by making fun of people who don't know any better... at least they can still learn how to behave (pretty important part of school besides the book learning)

Pretentiousness and pedantry (both traits which Hermione has demonstrated on multiple occasions) can be socially exhausting at best, and downright nauseating at worst.

Harry has his arrogance and temper, while many of Ron's issues stem from his inferiority complex. All three present an inability to keep their mouths shut, which is why they play so well with each other, and not so well with others.

The whole fan-wank that the enslavement of House-Elves is completely benign seems to be exactly that... just fanon. Is there anything in canon that contradicts the notion that House-Elves have been brainwashed/domesticated into slavery?

Of course Hermione goes a little bit overboard with her enthusiasm for freeing the house-elves, but to me that's amusing/endearing. I'd love to argue with her about whether or not her approach is really such a great idea.

Actually, that's pretty spot on for someone raised the way Harry was. He was always told how unwanted he was, called a burden, and basically held in very low regard. Once he got friends, he would do /anything/ to make sure that they liked him and stayed liking him. You learn to placate and avoid conflict. You tend to make only a few friends and be fiercely, intensely attached to those friendships. You become dependent on the approval of those friends.

I instantly related to Harry because besides the magic and the cupboard under the stairs, we had very similar childhoods.

If she is saying that Harry only accepts Ron back because of his desperation for friends, then she is also saying that it is a mistake to do it (at least in the way Harry deals with it) and then she should come back to it at some point. I think it's just lazy writing and we retroactively try to make sense of Harry's easy acceptance with such explanations (similarly to fanon theories of Dumbledore leaving Harry unprotected at the hands of the Dursleys in order to turn him into a martyr with low self-esteem, because that's really one of the only ways that it all would make sense in universe if we can't account for "JKR didn't think this through, didn't she?").

********** I agree that JKR touched on some sensitive topics and then half-assed through them, and both of your examples are valid. I always was bothered by how easily and quickly Harry rebounded from his treatment at the Dursley's almost as soon as his butt hit the seat in the Hogwarts express. It takes more than removing a person from that environment to make them happy and emotionally balanced once again.

It does make sense out of the fact that Harry was instantly attached to Hagrid though. Hagrid, bless him, is an idiot and probably shouldn't be allowed around children (follow the spiders my ass...) /But/ if you look at it from the angle of 'Hagrid was the first adult Harry met who was kind to him' that dauntless loyalty makes perfect sense. Same with Ron. Harry met Draco first, but Draco made a bad impression. Then Harry met Ron and hooray! Ron wanted to be Harry's friend. Harry latching onto that is realistic.

My criticism on the writing is apparently JKR at least halfway knew what she was doing, and touched on the subject, but it seems that doing it correctly and showing /all/ of the side effects of his upbringing was too much trouble, so we have Harry moping about miserably during the summer, and immediately becoming another person once he leaves for school.

********** Harry avoids confrontation with Hermione all the damned time. He ignores, deflects, and lies to her to avoid confrontation. And he is needy. Think about his tantrum in book 5 when he finds out Hermione and Ron have been hanging out without him (obviously having tons of fun) and didn't write all summer. Think about how he immediately agreed to move in with Sirius (a man he only officially met like half an hour earlier) despite knowing jack shit about him other than "he's actually not the one who caused my parents' murders." Harry is needy. That's not a bad trait, it's just a result of his upbringing.

Another thing I just remembered is how he's pretty much lost when he, Ron and Hermione are fighting. He doesn't really have any other real friends. Luna and Neville and whoever else you might name are acquaintances, not really friends. You never see them hanging out and Harry only seems to talk to them when he stumbles across them in the hall or something.

****** It was mostly caused by the Locket Horcrux anyway. Minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted his decision, but then he ran into a snatcher squad and was held up. By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and their protections were too good for Ron to find them again.

And it was Harry who got that brilliant idea to wear a Horcrux around their necks. It was utterly insane IMO. Why the other two didn't object was beyond me. Harry had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself, and he seemed to feel partially guilty about that. In the subsequent weeks, he was constantly worrying that Hermione would leave him as well.

So when Ron came back in such a spectacular fashion (saving his life, destroying the Locket), he was more than happy and relieved.

That's really the biggest cop-out in the writing though. Conveniently he comes back right at the time to save Harry's life, so now everyone can forgive him easily. It's hack writing to be honest.

Yeah nah, it's still really lame. Of course he arrives right in the seconds after Harry jumped in the pond, so we can have that sweet tension. Fast enough to save him, but not fast enough to make his presence known beforehand... sure. An empty forest is astoundingly silent by the way and Ron says he saw Harry before he jumped in the pond. There's no way Harry wouldn't have heard Ron wildly scrambling after the patronus through the forest - especially if they were in sight range before he jumped in. I just re-read that scene and JKR even has Harry intently listening for an attacker or ambush after the Snape doe disappears.... the whole scene is just a giant mess.

********** There are several other things that I find ridiculous in DH:

- Why not give the Sword to Harry directly?
- Dumbledore should have known about the possibility of Taboo. It was only through an insane amount of luck that the Trio was not ensnared and tortured to death. If Voldemort had been there during their capture, one simple legilimency scan on any one of them, and it would have been GAME OVER.
- The Order was woefully underprepared in case Dumbledore died (he was >110 after all) and the Ministry fell. The Weasleys were completely blindsided by the Wedding attack. Had Voldemort been more rational, which was to liquidate your political enemies ASAP after a coup, the Order would have been demolished and the Trio would have been emotionally destroyed.
- Moving Harry back to #4 Privet Drive was another case of utter stupidity. Why not create two additional Fidelius Properties where secret keepers mutually protected each other? Side-along Harry right after stepping off the Hogwarts Express would be the easiest solution. Given how quickly Arthur and Bill Weasleys setup their Fideliuses later, it shouldn't be too hard.
- The Trio went into Horcrux hunt with minimal preparations. Harry spent almost an entire month at Dursleys doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. He could use that time to learn, to plan, and to train. He could disguise himself, go to Diagon Alley, withdraw enough cash, and transfer his vaults into a secure foreign location. He could go under disguise, board a Chunnel Train, and go procuring important supplies in France (with Delacour's Help for example).
- Finally, holding the Wedding at Burrow was both going against the tradition and common sense. Wasn't it the tradition that weddings should be held at bride's place? Shouldn't it be obvious that with security situations deteriorating rapidly in Britain, that the host family should not subject bride's family to additional risks? The Delacours were supposed to be influential in France, and they could certainly provide even better security than the Weasleys at Burrow. If Death Eaters still dared to attack, wouldn't that cause a major international incident and bring France as an ally in the war?

--------------

Of course, the above would make things TOO EASY for protagonists, so they conveniently forgot to do all those simple activities. On the other hand, when the plot required, it was Voldemort's turn to suddenly behave like a blood idiot.

I agree with the whole common sense thing, but is the tradition thing maybe a U.S. custom? I've only ever heard this complaint in fanfics. At lest in central Europe (not 100% sure on the UK) nobody gives a crap. But it's also very unusual to have the actual wedding anywhere, but in a church. I think US authors are a lot more familiar with that scenario than JKR was when she had to come up with a magical wedding.

****** I think what makes it so bad is just the way of it happens... I mean, it's pretty obvious from Harry's character that he'd never ask Hermione or Ron to go with him they didn't want to.

He'd probably be disappointed, but Ron could have begged out in a civilized manner (maybe they all decide to try something different than living in a tent, who knows). Telling Harry that he doesn't care what happens to Ginny or the Weaslys and expecting Hermione to leave with him by default, to leave Harry all alone, is pretty harsh. Maybe I'm too angsty, but when he's asking Hermione to go with him he's basically asking her to kill Harry. I'm almost convinced that either consciously or subconsciously Harry would have commited suicide by Voldemort sooner rather than later if he were alone.
