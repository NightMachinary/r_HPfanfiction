I love Sirius, but so many stories have those traits with him, even though he's more than just a troublemaker, from canon doesn't seem to hate Authority (Even though he should hate everyone for not giving him a chance to share that he was innocent). And womanizer is overplayed in stories.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have character bashing, characters disliking or hating characters is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is normally a no go.

I'd rather Sirius either A: Be proven innocent somewhere along the story, or B: Never put in Azkaban in the first place. Would be nice if Sirius doesn't die in the story, but while it'd be nice, that's not mandatory.

The Horcruxes can be a thing or not I don't care.

Would rather be completed or regularly update, but if not that's fine.

** linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) features Sirius escaping from Azkaban several years earlier and without the burning desire for revenge on Peter - so he checks in on Harry first, finds out about the situation at the Dursleys', and offers to take Harry himself. It's really long and has quite good world building for the Marauders' generation, fleshing out a lot of the adult characters (Gawain Robards, Marlene McKinnon, Lupin and Tonks, etc).

** I'd recommend anything by the Divine Comedian if you haven't read their stuff yet. It's all fantastic, and most of it contains some amount of Sirius. For instance: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13095258/chapters/29959323]]) or linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852/chapters/28558256]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]]) is a really nice fix it time travel with Sirius, Hermione, Ginny and Luna. It's finished save for the epilogue. Sirius is paired with Hermione (she's in her twenties).

My favourite Marauders era horcrux hunt is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) It's got elements of Sirius the rebel and womanizer, but there's a lot more to him than that. It's a long and finished fic with lots of characters.

Montparnasse has a lot of good Sirius and Remus fics with beautiful prose. Lots of them are a little melancholy and sad. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13092516]]) is a first wizarding war roadtrip and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3895552]]) is sort of a story about Sirius from Remus's point of view.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4978138]]) is also a melancholy Sirius/Remus with lots of music and beautiful prose.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

** A Black Comedy - nonjon (on FanFiction.Net)

It has Harry going through the Veil in the DoM 2 years after defeating Voldemort, to find out that his godfather is alive, and that he and Harry were both killed that night in Godric's Hallow, and it has Lord Harry Black and Lord Sirius Black both giving the Wizengamont a big middle finger and having all kinds of fun and debauchery on the way...

It's one of the funniest fanfics I've read, and there are scenes in it that have me laughing for 10-15 minutes at a time.

*** Isn't the Sirius in this story pretty much a womanising troublemaker who hates the authority?

** Ok, I cant remember the title but there was a Haphne fic, where GoF Harry was possesed by older Dark Lord Harry. One of the minor plot points was showing both Harry and Sirius as Slytherins at heart that went to Gryffindor. While Sirius doesn't get much attention he certainly fits your wish.
