I found [[https://blvnk-art.tumblr.com/post/152663349319/ive-had-enough-trouble-for-a-lifetime-harry][this]] fanart of an older harry and realised I'd never read a fic where he features as an old experienced wizard like 60+ and wondered if anyone had found one worth reading


** That's such a nice picture! Is it just me or is Harry's right eye (our left) is a bit milky looking and droopy? Looks like he's blind in one eye, which is just cool.

It follows the canon story when Harry is around 60 and couldÂ´ve been easily written by J.K. herself.

  Amazing banner by Carnal Spiral at TDA

  Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in a battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world they worked so hard to build.

*** I haven't read many older harry stories unfortunately, I wish there were more, the vast majority seem to be set in hogwarts or just afterwards

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] and several others by joe6991 technically feature Harrry as an old and experienced wizard, as does [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] and its sequels by the Wayland Smith, but I don't think Harry really looks or feels his age to me in them.

  On a cliff sits a lonely grave, with four simple words engraved in it. But their meaning is far less serious, and far more personal than Ruby expected. Her father explains its true meaning, both sad and joyous. Thus Kindly I Scatter.
