Recently I've read the whole mischief heir series in AO3 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4629198/chapters/10555032#workskin]]) and am looking for fics with a plot like this one, with Harry and his friends from Hogwarts learning advanced magic and using it to find a way of space traveling, I'd especially like if they had them managing to take the whole magic world to a new planet, like in mischief heir and in Xerosis.


** Invincible linkffn(13161929)

2012 crossover. The world is ending and Harry leads a team that builds an Ark to leave Earth.

Then they run into Cylons.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

*** Thanks for linking that one. It's the 2nd HP/Galactica crossover I've seen that even has the pairing I prefer. Looks intriguing.
