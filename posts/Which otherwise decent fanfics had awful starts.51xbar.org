I'm usually pretty harsh with new fanfics, ditching them in the first few chapters if I see a trope I don't like.

But recently I ploughed through the terrible, terrible start of Travel Secrets and found it was actually a fun read. Any other fics like this?

linkffn(9622538) for those curious, but it seems to be abandoned now.


** Yeah, I now usually just plain skip the intro chapters of time-travel and dimention-travel stories because all they do is crappily try to establish how the protag found themselves in the TT/DT environment.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][/Princess of the Blacks/]] --- the story has good writing style, interesting plot, and good characters (though also Potter and Dumbledore bashing). It has sexual content, but nothing over the top --- at least in the parts I've read so far. It starts, however, with fem!protag working several years as a child prostitute and with Narcissa Malfoy being her (favourite) client.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/HP & The Natural 20/]] --- great story, writing, characters, knowledge of D&D mechanics. It starts with an OC arriving in the middle of a clichéd cardboard ritual, lying face-up on a hardwood table. The first time I tried to read it I dropped it on the third paragraph because, as you said, I can be pretty harsh with new fanfics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- starts as your generic WBWL \ Potter bashing story, develops into a story with pretty decent and original plot, good writing and characters.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][/Reverse/]] --- “Something, something, Hermione gets transported into an AU where good people are bad and bad people are good.”

- +Firebird Trilogy+ --- starts with first-year Harry groping several girls from his class at their first meeting, and the harem elements only get worse after that. Still, technically, the story had rather original plot and world-building.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Ugh, Travel Secrets. All I wanted from that story was an explanation of the first chapter, because that never made sense.

Two sequels later and it still wasn't explained.

***** I feel like a lot of the reasons the start came off so poorly was because it set up so many tired tropes, but since it set them up specifically to sub-vert them. Going back and re-reading it after isn't quite as taxing, at least for me.

Linkffn(8149841) - this one is Dumbledore bashing & slash. But overall a decent read.
