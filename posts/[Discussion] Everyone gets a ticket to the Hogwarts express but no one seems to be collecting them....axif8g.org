is this a plot hole or something I'm missing


** You didn't miss anything and it's not a plot hole. The children receive tickets but there is no conductor, nor ticket gates. That's all there is to it.

It's easy enough to speculate as to why they get tickets. Firstly, tickets still could be required to ride the train, even without anyone checking them. I've been on plenty of trains in the Muggle world where my ticket was never checked (this is quite common in rural train services). It just operates on an honesty system (and who would be trying to get a free ride to Hogsmeade when you can just floo/apparate/knight bus much quicker...).

But even if the tickets are completely non-functional, there are still plenty of possible reasons for their existence - tradition, just a bit of fun, etc.

*** There is a conductor, or, Remus Lupin and Hermione Granger believe in his existence.

Edit: I read the books in Spanish, then, I translate words when I write here. (conductor vs driver)

**** If you're discussing the Dementor incident in PoA, Hermione says she's going to speak to the driver, not a conductor. Would need to see the Lupin quote but I suspect the same.

Edit: just checked, Lupin speaks about the driver too.

(I'm checking the US edition so it's possible this is a British/American difference).

** Maybe the Tickets have a Charm on them so Dumbledore knows if Students are missing/not on the train, or if someone isn't supposed to be there because they don't have a ticket.

** I think a ticket is just another beautiful, old fashioned object of the magical world, that transports us to another era, that the HP series makes such effective use of. Collecting them serves no purpose to the story. One can read more into it, but I doubt Rowling gave it a second thought.

And when in doubt: magic!

Where the heck do you live that tickets aren't a thing?

** The ticket is for lost kids. They can show it to the workers at King's Cross Station who will help the poor confused muggleborn to platform 9 3/4. Unfortunately in Harry's first year, in an effort to prevent his nemesis from going to school, Quirrelmort used the /Imperius/ to turn the workers into assholes that scoff and scare a clearly lost and confused 11 year old.

** The ticket is like a key to let them through the barrier the first time. After that, the barrier "remembers" them.
