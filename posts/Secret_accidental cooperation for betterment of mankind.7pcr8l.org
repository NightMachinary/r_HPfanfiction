I reread Enter The Dragon recently, and it left me with want for more stories with the trope presented in it.

What I mean is normal humans, getting by accident or handed in secret magically created (but not magical on their own) things, substances, materials etc. that they use for the advancement of the humanity. For example, from the mentioned story, light, durable and heat resistant material used in coating space shuttles.


** Please could you link to that fic?

It's awesome but unfortunately it's quite dead.

PS. If you want to read it for the trope I mentioned, it's only a snippet in one scene, and not much plot around it.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
