Swedish Chef replaces Snape for a Potions Lesson. As ludicrously over the top as you can make it without killing everyone in the room.


** "Bork Bork Bork Bork!" Neville felt a pudgy furry hand slap him as he was about to add the Bat Spleen out of his grasp.

"Is something wrong Sir?" When the substitute professor noticed that his instructions were indecipherable he started taking out his aggression on the student with the poorest performance. Some things never change.

"I think you're supposed to add that when it's at a rolling boil," Hermione interjected. It wasn't that she understood Swedish (if she had, she would know he certainly wasn't speaking it) but she had already memorized the dorections for the potion last week before Snape mysteriously disappeared.

While no one was sure where the Potions Master had fled, Harry couldn't help but wonder if it was because of Voldemort's return last year. While Umbridge was making it impossible to learn Defense, their unnamed substitute from Dumstrang was making Potions intolerable. At this rate, it would be a miracle if most of the students passed their OWLS.

Ron scowled as his potion was beginning to corrode his cauldron. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm beginning to miss that greasy git."

In a flurry, the orange mustaches man started flailing wildly, continuously screaming "Bork Bork Bork," in what Harry assumed meant /no talking/

Eventually, his mustache caught on fire. As he was running around screaming, he tripped over Ron's cauldron causing it to topple over. As the vile sludge trickled out, it dissolved holes into the stone floor and walls, allowing the water from Black Lake to seep in. As the classroom began to flood and catch fire simultaneously, the Swedish professor kept flailing his tiny meaty hands. Thinking quickly, Harry grabbed Neville, and urged Ron to help swim Hermione to safety despite her insistence she could finish the assignment on time.

As the students tried to salvage their books, some nicked the priceless potion ingredients floating away. No one bothered to save the Swedish professor as he somehow was floating away on his back, unable to move upright, flailing his arms as he disappeared on the horizon screaming, "Bork Bork Bork!"

** "Attention everyone," Professor Dumbledore, audible even over the din of the Great Hall. "I felt it best to let you know now, before classes start for today, that Professor Snape has taken ill. It appears that he has an unknown ailment. Madame Pomfrey does not believe him to be contagious, though she has placed him under Quarantine."

Harry stole a glance with Ron. Ron shrugged, but further down the table, Fred and George were stifling their laughter.

"What did you do?" Harry whispered.

"A Skivving Snackbox may or may not have found its way into his steak-and-kidney pie last night," George choked out.

"You can't do that," Hermione looked scandalized. "He's a teacher!"

"He's a right bastard is what he is," Fred retorted. "The slime ball was the perfect guinea pig."

"Guinea pig?" Hermione's eyebrows furrowed. "What did you two idiots do?"

"Well, Hermione." Fred answered. "You know the Muggle saying? You can't have just one crisp? Same basic principle with Snackboxes."

"Blimey," Ron whispered. "What'd you give him?"

"Some Fever Fudge," Lee Jordan answered back. "Some Puking Pastille, some Nosebleed Nougat, some Fainting Fancies...a Canary Cream...a Ton-Tongue Taffy..."

--------------

*/Cut To Hospital Wing/*

Madame Pomfrey, dressed in a full hazmat suit, stared down at Severus Snape. The Potions Master's tongue had swelled to the size of a small car, and then fallen out of his mouth. Boils covered most of his body, and vomit and blood and feathers were everywhere.

"Mgggmma."

"I highly doubt that James Potter has anything to do with this, Severus." Madame Pomfrey's voice caught. It wasn't funny what had happened to her colleague. Not funny at all.

Okay, maybe it was a little funny...

"Awwrpvo."

"Oh, really? Well, I'm sure they will be dealt with accordingly."

"Bmlpwedsc!"

"Severus! That is quite enough! One more insult towards another student, and I will splash you with Shrinking Solution, place you in a vial, and then owl you to St. Mungo's!"

--------------

*/Cut back to Great Hall/*

"I. Am. Writing. To. Your. Mother," Hermione growled through clenched teeth.

"You can try, Hermione. But be careful..." Fred warned. "You never know when somebody might slip some less-than-sweet sweets onto your plate."

Hermione huffed and crossed her arms. Harry turned his attention back to Dumbledore.

"Taking the place of Professor Snape will be an old acquaintance of mine. Please, give a warm Hogwarts Welcome to Professor Chef!"

A short man with huge eyebrows and a mustache that would be the envy of Vernon Dursley stood up and waved. He was wearing white robes and a chef's hat.

"Never heard of him," Ron answered before Harry could ask. "But I reckon he can't be worse than Snape."

*** *Part 2*

"I changed my mind...I think..." Ron whispered.

"Shhhhhh," Hermione hissed.

Harry stared blankly at Professor Chef's rambling. It was nearly impossible to understand a word he said.

"We-cer ster-ders, I er Chef. Wer Wer Po-cher ta-der. Per at-cher pler. Yer ner twr rar sprs an fr...."

The new professor stared at the next ingredient--boiled frogs, and then gave a great roar of outrage that sounded even louder than Hagrid's.

"Kermer! Kermer! No ckr! No ckr!"

"What's he saying?"

"I'm going for Dumbledore!" Neville turned and ran.

"Er, sir?" Harry asked.

"Mer Potr?"

"What's wrong, sir?"

"No ckr froger! Froger fren! Froger fren!"

"Froger fren?" Harry hesitated. "Are you friends with a frog?"

"Yeh! Yeh! Kermer the Froger!"

"Well, these weren't frogs like him. These were regular little frogs from the Lake."

"Oh. welr god jb, Mr Potr. Tin poyts ter Grffinder!"

--------------

Potions class was somewhat calmer after that. Unlike Snape who was more than willing to "supervise" the students, and insult anyone who wasn't a Slytherin, Professor Chef took a bit more of a hands on approach.

"Ner, ner, Nevla. Yer muss strr an ad ingrudunts toggetter."

Neville, still uneasy in Potions, did as he was told. Stirring the potion, he poured the bottle of pine juice into the cauldron.

"Godd werk!"

Ron patted Neville's shoulder and Harry flashed a quick thumbs up. Neville smiled, and Harry realized he hadn't seen that happen in a Potions class before.

"Hey Longbottom!" Malfoy called, a sneer on his face. "Think fast!" He tossed a rat's spleen towards them and knocked over Neville's cauldron. The potion spilled everywhere and the floor began to sizzle.

"Gah!" Ron shouted, pushing Hermione behind him.

/"Protego!"/ Harry and Neville shouted in unison. Harry pointed his wand at the spilled potion. The Shield Charm erupted from his wand, over the fluid.

Neville swallowed hard, and even through the blur of Neville's own shield, Harry thought he saw a tear in Neville's eye. Malfoy gave a bark of laughter.

"Hw deer yer! Yer cood ah hert sumun!" Professor Chef looked absolutely livid. "Yer no lesun. Yer sho ner respec! Ter hunder poyts frm Slytherun an Ah'll see yer experld!"

***** I watched reruns of the Muppet Show as a toddler--and by that I mean I remember watching it rather than the show itself. The only thing I ever remembered with distinction was [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ODTf9R4I2w][The Lion Sleeps Tonight.]]

I watched a lot of Sesame Street as a kid, so I was familiar with Kermit and Miss Piggy, but not so much the other Muppets. I may have also watched Fraggle Rock as well, but I was about three. Memories blend together over time, I find.

But my best friend is a Muppets fanatic--he's one of the admins on the [[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Wiki][Muppets Wiki]] and has actually made his own puppets in the style of Jim Henson. When my brother and I went on vacation with him to Washington DC last summer, we made it a point to take the train to see a Jim Henson statue.

As a result of his influence, I've seen the last few Muppets movies, and recently bought the soundtrack to the original film.

But the bulk of my inspiration came from this fanmade video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ6Q_B-5DGQ][Muppets Days of Future Past]]

**** *Part 3*

Over breakfast the next morning, it seemed everyone was exclusively discussing the events of the previous days' Potions lessons.

"It's ridiculous!" Hermione snapped. "He's impossible to understand, and he barely follows the instructions in the textbooks."

"He helped me," Neville said quietly.

"Blimey, Neville, I know he's better than Snape, but that's not saying much," Ron answered.

"How do you think Umbridge is taking this?" Harry asked. "The...Chef doesn't seem like he'd be up to 'Ministry standards,' or whatever it is."

"And that's another thing," Hermione interjected. "How is this going to make things easier? The Ministry is only going to crack down more and more if Dumbledore doesn't stop picking professors who don't 'measure up' to their ideal."

"I wouldn't want to be taught by a professor who measures up to the ideals of the Ministry," Luna Lovegood piped in, squeezing in between Ginny and Neville. "Fudge has done such terrible things to the goblins. And the limits he sets on experimentation in the Department of Mysteries--"

"Would you just shut up?!" Hermione snapped. "None of that is real!"

Luna looked stricken, before her eyebrows furrowed. Before she could say anything, Ginny nudged her.

"Oy! Mail's here."

Indeed it was. A hundred or so owls was hovering overhead. An elderly owl landed in front of Fred and George, with a large, red envelope.

"Quick!"

Fred grabbed the envelope and made to tear it in half, but it was too late.

BOOM!

"FRED! GEORGE! I WANT TO KNOW...WHY?"

Harry jerked. He doubted he'd ever get used to hearing Mrs. Weasley's voice through a Howler, but this was worse. She wasn't even angry. She sounded disappointed.

"YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO TEACH YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WERE WE NOT ENOUGH?"

All four Weasleys were blushing deeply. Ginny, for some reason, in particular looked ashamed.

"WE WILL DISCUSS THIS WHEN YOU ALL COME HOME THIS SUMMER. I AM DISAPPOINTED."

Wait a moment, that was Mr. Weasley's voice. And he wasn't usually one for shouting.

"Daddy..." Ginny whispered, sliding so far down in her seat that only her nose, eyes and forehead were visible. Luna patted her vaguely on the back. Ron was redder in the face than Harry had ever seen him.

"Why are you and Ginny so upset?" Neville whispered. "You two didn't do anything. You didn't even know about it."

--------------

*/Cut to Hospital Wing/*

Madame Pomfrey was running out of ideas. Severus didn't seem to be improving much. Any malady that she cured only seemed to trigger a new one.

Gone were the feathers and blood and tongue, but now Severus was covered in furry, pink spots. And his nose had grown to an even more absurd length.

***** *Part 4*

"I went too far, didn't I?" Hermione asked, as they walked down to Herbology a few hours later, after a Charms class where Ron had refused to acknowledge her.

"Damn right you did! Telling Mum and Dad!" Ron's embarrassment had left and he was furious.

"I'm not sure why they included you and Ginny...all I said was that Umbridge would love an excuse to throw out all of you..."

"You didn't think!" Ron snapped. "You never actually think! You're too busy convinced of your own moral superiority to ever consider anyone else's point-of-view!"

"Fred and George could have hurt Professor Snape!"

"But they didn't! Madame Pomfrey thinks she can sort him out--and besides, has any of the kids they gave the Snackboxes to been hurt in a way that couldn't be fixed?"

"Apart from Katie with the nosebleed?" Harry asked. "I don't think so."

"Harry! I was trying to help!"

"I'm not saying you weren't! And I don't want to be caught in the middle of this! Not after all that with Wormtail!"

"Who's Wormtail?" Neville asked. "Did you mean Scabbers?"

"Gah! Neville, how long have you been standing there?"

"An hour," Neville answered. "So was Wormtail what you called Scabbers when you were annoyed? I kind of miss the rat, even if he did chew my bedsheets."

"Er...." Harry, Ron, and Hermione said in unison. That was something Harry hadn't considered. Wormtail had rejoined Voldemort and had actually been the one to kill Cedric Diggory. Except for Ginny, none of the rest of the DA was aware of that. But with the escape of the Death Eaters from Azkaban, it may become necessary to let more people know.

"Er...." Neville repeated. "Wait, don't tell me. Let me guess: This is something to do with one of your End of Year Near Death Experiences, right? Let's see...Scabbers vanished in third year, with Sirius Black and the dementors...did that have something to do with something? What was Sirius Black trying to kill Scabbers? Was he really Peter Pettigrew and he faked his death and Black was out for revenge?"

"Er..."

Neville's eyes widened to the size of Galleons. "Oh Merlin?! I was right?! I was just joking! Oh dear..."

"What?! Ginny was walking up the path, Luna trailing behind her. "You told Neville?! Mum and Dad said we weren't supposed to talk about it!"

"I? What? No! He guessed! And keep your voice down before Loony--"

"Her! Name! Is! Luna!"

"You called her Loony!"

Ginny's shoulders tensed and she turned to Luna.

"I'm really sorry about that. I should never have called you that horrible name."

"I don't mind so much," Luna said. "It's not a very nice nickname but I've been called meaner things. I find it too tiring to pay much attention to things like that. But do you think Daddy would like to interview Professor Chef for /The Quibbler/?"

"Er...I think he would like that," Harry answered. "What class do you have next?"

"Defense Against the Dark Arts," Ginny answered. "And then Luna has Potions."

"Um, I have a question," Neville asked, raising his hand.

"Look, Neville." Ron answered. "I promise, we'll tell you everything. Come to the Burrow this summer, it'll be easier."

"Oh, sounds good but...um, why do Ginny and Luna have Herbology together? We have our classes with the Hufflepuffs."

"Because...." Hermione answered. "Um....."

"Oh Merlin, Hermione doesn't know the answer to a question."

"Nice going Nev," Seamus joked as he and Dean walked by. "You broke Hermione."
