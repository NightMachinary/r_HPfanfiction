I've read many fictions, watched many anime's and superhero movie's, but I've never come across a protagonist as unique as Luffy. Although he has changed considerably throughout One Piece, his character, personality and values has always been same and consistent (through the sheer brilliance of the author) . He is my favorite protagonist across all genres of fiction.

I wanted to know if there are any fanfic writers who are considering to make a harry potter fanfic with a main character who is very similar to Luffy? I've read some small hp, one piece crossover fics, but they are very bad. I also want to ask if there are any good hp, one piece crossovers which take place in the harry potter world.

P.S.

I know the moment you decide to make a character like Luffy, all kinds of shipping or pairings will be destroyed.


** Incredibly dense and obsessed with food?

Ron.

But seriously, while i don't get whats so great about an idiotic mc(i did follow naruto but much prefer non/semi-canon fanon takes) I'm not sure what you mean by this? Being unwilling to give up on a dream and pulling miracles out of their.. butt is pretty much a shonen protagonist staple... along with being clueless about women, obsessed with something(ramen, being normal, food), etcetera, etcetera , etcetera ....

While i'm not a writer it would probably be a good idea to give potential authors of this fic you'd like written an idea of what you think makes Luffy... Luffy. Otherwise it's possible that someone who takes you up on this will have different views and you'll end up with another "bad" fic(in your opinion at least)

*** You are right. Maybe sometimes I ask for too much in mc's that I get very easily dissapointed. And yes majority of shonen characters are goofy kinds of people.

Ron I believe is the most relatable and human character in hp, he gets jealous easily and wants to outshine others, and I like him a lot. However he is insecure and he maybe dense but he is not like Luffy. Luffy is dense, brutally honest, and the most distinctive thing that separates luffy and ron is that luffy is dangerously adventurous, he is like literally not afraid anything at all. And also Luffy always believes in his friends regardless of the circumstances.

I've read a lot of hp fanfics and many of them are very disappointing, not that I am trying to make fun of the author's hard work. Its just that maybe I am too used to these shonen type MC's. The only fanfic's in hp I truly enjoyed were Umbrus shade and Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again). If you have any fanfic recommendations with these type of mc's, I would appreciate it very much.

**** Right i didn't mean for you to focus on that first bit, it was mostly a joke.

It's not a bad thing to have opinions on what makes a good mc or a stories quality. They are your opinions. My point was your original post didn't explain WHAT you were looking for other than Luffy-esque... and the I pointed out that at least you and I seem to have different views on Luffy's character...

So, to clarify, You would love to see an HP fic with an mc that is:

shonen protagonist(unwilling to give up, "goofy")

dense

brutally honest

dangerously adventurous(could you define this?)

Not afraid of anything

Incredibly loyal

***** Dangerously adventurous can be anything actually. I am not good at describing stuff.

Well actually even a mc whose body is made out of rubber will also do the job. The personality and other details can be considered a bonus.

** I'm not that familiar with One Piece, can you give a description of Luffy? I've read quite a few fics but I can't think of any particularly shounen-y onea

*** Ill try to give a brief description

- He unbelievably dense.
- if there is any chance of having adventure he will rush to it immediately. Like he won't even flinch at rushing into the forbidden forest in middle of the night to ride a unicorn.
- Not afraid of anything and I mean literally anything.
- He has unbreakable faith and trust in his friends.
- He is very bad at lying.
- His body is made out of rubber.
- His friends are also very loyal to him.

Well there are more but I don't think I will be able to properly describe them without creating more confusion.
