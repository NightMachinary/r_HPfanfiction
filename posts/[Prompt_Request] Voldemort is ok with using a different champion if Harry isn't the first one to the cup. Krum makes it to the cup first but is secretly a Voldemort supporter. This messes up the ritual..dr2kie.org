Krum believes in Voldemort's cause but keeps it secret due to the fact that it would ruin his quidditch career. Krum is nocked out as soon as he arrives in the graveyard and doesn't come to until they take his blood.


** Well you better make Krum not being able to talk when they retrieve his blood or he will just say he's not an enemy

*** And after that, voldie!baby tells Peter to torture Krum until he's an enemy again. (And then takes the blood before actually starting the torture)

** He saw the cup gleaming in front of him. Viktor raced towards it, ready to escape from this blasted maze. His fight with the manticore has somehow left him mostly unscathed, and none of the enchantments he had to break through had killed him, but damn if the sting from that horrendous blast-ended skrewt didn't hurt.

He heard someone running behind him, but they were too late. The cup was a mere two feet away- he lunged for it, his fingers curling around the handle of the Triwizard Cup. Viktor Krum had done it- he had defeated the other champions, even the famous Harry Potter, he had won the Triwizard Tournament, he had won the honor of-

A jerking sensation behind his navel stopped his thoughts, as he was yanked through time, space, and color. He landed somewhere dark, and eerily quiet...

“Vat is this?” He called out into the darkness. He squinted around, and made out large stones... he appeared to be in a graveyard.

“Sire- sire,” Viktor heard a terrified whimper. “It is not him- it is another!”

He peered through the darkness and saw a short, gaunt man holding a large bundle. Viktor could not see what was in it, but it appeared to be an infant. He made towards the man, who was clearly very frightened, to attempt to offer him some help.

A voice replied before Viktor had taken two steps. A voice filled with such cruel, raw anger that it hardly sounded human at all.

“We will make due,” the voice hissed, in an almost snakelike fashion. “Capture him!”

Viktor grabbed for his wand, but to no avail. The man yelled “Incarcerous!” And Viktor found himself bound in thick ropes on the ground, his face in a pile of freshly dug earth. The short man approached him. Viktor did not recognize him as anyone he'd ever met.

“Vat do you think you are doing?!” Viktor yelled loudly, his face darkening as the man got closer. “Release me at once!”

The man put the sack-like pile down by Viktor's feet. There was certainly something alive inside the bundle. Viktor's eyes suddenly dialated in fear. The evil, horrifying voice- the wrapped up child- he had heard tales of this man, this creature, as a child...

“Torbalan,” he whispered.

The man slid his grubby hand into his robe pocket, and pulled out a scrap of black fabric, which he promptly shoved into Viktor's mouth. He noticed the man had only 4 fingers on his hand, and that his nails were yellow and so filled with grime that they looked more like claws.

Victor was dragged upwards, towards a large headstone, and bound tightly to it. He could not move even a centimeter in any direction. He could sense the infant on the ground below him fussing and moving around in its bundle of robes. Viktor felt sorry for it, sorry he could do nothing to help it or let him escape. A rush of pity and desire to protect the child welled up so powerfully inside him that he could barely breathe.

The man- was he truly the demon Torbalan, or merely possessed by him?- reentered his vision, carrying with him the largest cauldron he had ever seen. It sounded as though it were filled with liquid. He placed it near the foot of the grave, and ignited a fire around it. The firelight lit up the area, and Viktor thought he saw a large snake slithering away into the darkness as the cauldron quickly came to a steaming boil.

“Hurry!”, said the high cold voice, as the cauldron became alight with sparks. The man lumbered towards the baby, and pulled it out from the pile of robes. Viktor let out a muffled yell of indignation, which quickly turned to horror as he saw that the thing wrapped inside the bundle of robes hardly resembled a baby anymore.

It was as if a toddler had been skinned alive, and never died. It was unnatural. It was a demon. Viktor's anger surged so strongly that he nearly managed to loosen his ropes by thrashing violently against them. How could anyone have done that to so innocent a creature? The man carried the pitiful remnants of the child to the cauldron and dropped him in.

Viktor let out a sob. Not knowing what else to do, he prayed for it's swift and painless passing, and that it may suffer no more.

“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!” The man's voice shook in fear as the tomb below Viktor let out a loud crack, and a trickle of dust rose and fell into the cauldron. The contents of the cauldron immediately turned a painfully bright blue and sent sparks shooting out in all directions.

The next time the man spoke, his words were barely able to escape his mouth. “Flesh of the servant- willingly given- you will revive your master!” He was openly sobbing as he held a dagger in his left hand, and stretched out his right arm. In a swift movement, he sliced his hand off at the wrist and dropped it into the cauldron. His scream pierced the night so loudly, Viktor was sure someone would hear them. The potion now turned a vivid red.

“The blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe!”

“The enemy?” Viktor thought. Who exactly did they think he was? He supposed, however, that many Bulgarians would call themselves and enemy of Torbalan.

The man plunged the knife into his forearm; Viktor's yell was muffled against the fabric stuffed in his mouth. The wound began to bleed profusely, and the pain doubled as he soon felt the same burning sensation that had happened when the skrewt has pierced his skin mere hours ago.

Pulling a glass vial from his sleeve, the man collected the pouring blood then dumped that into the cauldron as well. It immediately turned a blinding white, and the entire graveyard was illuminated. The cauldron simmered, and threw sparks. Viktor could not keep his eyes on it, it was so bright. Thick steam was now pouring from it, so dense that he could hardly see through it...

Then, through the mist, he saw the outline of something alive crawling from the cauldron. Something equally as inhumane as the child has been- a horrifying, sentient worm-like creature. It was pale, and ghastly, and screeched on the ground. The man, who was on the ground holding his bleeding stump, looked at it in horror. Something had clearly gone wrong.

The venom from the blast-ended skrewt must have interacted with the potion. The creature writhed in agony. It did not have the armor or development of a full sized skrewt, but looked rather like an oversized maggot.

The man stood up, mouth agape. He looked rapidly from Viktor to the creature, almost as if asking him what he should do. Finally, he reached for his wand, pointed it at Viktor and said “Releashio!”.

Viktor fell to his knees, mere inches away from the grub.

He heard a voice screech, “Obliviate!”, and remembered no more.

--------------

Viktor blinked. He was sitting against the headstone of a grave. How had he gotten here?, he wondered, bemused. Hadn't he just won the tournament? Why wasn't anyone cheering for him? He looked to his left and saw the Triwizard cup sitting in the grass. There must have been some kind of malfunction in the portkey. Trust the British Ministry of Magic to not get their transportation right.

He stood up. A gurgling noise caused him to search the ground surrounding him. A large, disgusting maggot was sliming around on the ground right in front of his feet. Wrinkling his nose, he stomped a heavy boot onto the maggot and heard a very satisfying squelch as the creature burst into a pile of goo and died.

Viktor went to pick up the cup and collect his winnings- as well as (if he was lucky), a date with Hermione. He was the Triwizard Champion after all.

I couldn't bear to make him a true Voldemort supporter, so I had him inadvertently support Voldemort lol.

Torbalan is a mythical man/demon who steals children and puts them in a large sack and carries them away. He from a Bulgarian tale meant to scare children into being well behaved.

Sorry that there may be grammar mistakes and mediocre sentence structure. Typed it up on my phone pretty quickly.
