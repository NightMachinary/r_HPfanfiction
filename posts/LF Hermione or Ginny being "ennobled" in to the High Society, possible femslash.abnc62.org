What im looking for is that Hermione or Ginny gain the possibility to have access to the High Society of the Wizard World (or a pure blood community), by getting invited by their Best Friend or Partner. Lets say she is dating Malfoy and he gets a Invitation and the message, that he can bring Company (they didnt often would let "outside company" gain access) or she gets it by Ginny or vice versa.

At the Party however is a Female, who gets instantly attracted to Hermione/Ginny and flirts with the newcomer. I leave it to the Fic, if Hermione or Ginny might Lesbian or bi and accept it or reject it politely, because they are not into that stuff.
