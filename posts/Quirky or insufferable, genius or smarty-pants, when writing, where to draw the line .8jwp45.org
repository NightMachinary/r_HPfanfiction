- Luna “A Snorkack told me that your name is really Tom. You know, you have a lot of Nargles, Tom. You should accept that it's not your fault if your mummy died and it's okay to cry. Don't you get snot in your mouth when you have a cold? I cry all the time, sometimes just for fun. I wonder if you would like to have some pudding with me.” Lovegood.\\
- Hermione “Honestly, Harry, the four steps to remove Horcruxes from cephalic scar tissue can easily be found in the third chapter of the sixth volume in the 1243 print of the Spelldamagis moste dark encyclopediae” Granger.\\
- Albus BWP “Mah boi” “Oddment, blubber and twinkle” Bumblemore.\\
- Harry “Wizards are all morons are here is why, a very public presentation to a captive audience by Lord H.J.P-B-S-G” Potter.\\

From the mildly annoying to the outrightly outrageous, all these characters -and more- have had incarnations in fanfiction that were defined as eccentric or antisocial geniuses.

I wonder, as reader or writer, where would you draw the line between genuinely intelligent (original Sherlock Holmes?) and second-degree smart-ass played for laughs (House M.D?).\\
And most importantly, when do we fall into the muddy pitfall of genuinely smart-ass ? /cough/ ^{HPMOR?} /cough/

This redditer would be curious to know your thoughts on writing Intelligent! MC.


** Those sorts of characterizations are nearly always stupid. Luna isn't a seer, she's a quacky conspiracy theorist, Hermione holds books highly but never to the level of infallibility or omniscience. (etc.) Some characters can work as smart-asses in their universe, but they can't be so exaggerated that the reader can't help but see that no person would ever act that way. It breaks suspension of disbelief.

As for how to do it, well, a few "don't"s would be that it doesn't make your characters intelligent when they have a simple solution to longstanding problems. Because then all that really ends up happening (/cough/ ^{The Arithmance}r

/cough/) the author dumbed everyone else down so their desired "intelligent" character looks smart. Longstanding problems (especially those of an academic nature) remain because solving them is difficult. Hell, oftentimes they're so difficult we don't even know what the full scope of the problem is, much less what the solution would look like. There has to be a sensible reason.

So the Intelligent!MC needs to have something that's novel, and their needs to be something in their history and/or characterization which makes them the sensible one to have done it first. Like if you were writing a Dumbledore story and you covered his life where he helps discover the 12 uses of dragon blood, have that justified by the fact that A) Dumbledore is exceptionally powerful so dragons are much less a danger to him to study and B) Make up a fact like "He always had a deep fascination with dragons", which is why he studied them in such depth.

Basically, things need an explanation beyond "They were just that fuckin' smart." Tony Stark didn't invent the Iron Man armor from out of nowhere because he's that good. The arc reactor already existed (courtesy of his dad), he miniaturized it and needed to make a suit to escape from terrorists while keeping shrapnel from his heart.

*** Yes, one of the main point -I think- is consistency and believability. If Dumbledore just ends up being approached by an injured dragon as a first year in the forbidden forest and uses his madz skill to heal it and become friend with it en then just develops a whole theory by himself out of nothing but a few drops of blood and his interactions with his buddy, that's just silly (although if done right and second-degree, I could see a fairy-taily, fluffy little story being written out of that) .

When writing a genuinely smart character, it is important to consider where they come from, what information already exists and why they would be the one to develop the new idea first.

But on the dumbing down everyone else point, I think it's a really a difficult line to draw, and it can be quite subjective. I remember seeing a video from Numberphile about the first problem in Good Will Hunting, where they exposed the fact that it was a very simple problem that was chosen more for it's visual appeal and the fact that most movie-goers wouldn't necessarily recognize it as a basic graph-problem at least in the few seconds that it appeared in the movie. And yet in the movie, everyone looses their minds when the MC solves it in moments... [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW_LkYiuTKE]]

I think that's the thing when you deal with real actual science in fiction, you have to make a bet based on your estimated target audience and what could possibly look adequately impressive to them.

The safest thing would be to use a lot of magic stuff instead, because when you make the rules, it's impressive when you say it's impressive. Then, the challenge becomes to present the system in a digestible and entertaining way...

Not really. Even in your example "a basic graph-problem" isn't really simple for an average reader. The challenge here would be expressing ways of thinking of other not stupid people who couldn't resolve if because of inertia of thinking.

Intelligence of the MC is more about intelligence of others than his/her own IQ.

Well, it's a bit broader than that. You might encounter issues like:

- The people you need to do the work to solve the problem benefit from the problem.
- Other people benefit from the problem and interfere with people trying to fix it.
- The amount of work required to fix the problem is large, and the problem isn't causing much day-to-day pain (or at least not yet).
- The affected people have learned a workaround, and it's sufficiently engrained that they just don't think about fixing it. This is most likely with a small community.
- Nobody is specifically responsible for it.

But none of this really lends itself to 12-year-old Lord Haraldr Iacamo Potter-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Gaunt-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff shouting a few words at Dumbledore and the entire Wizengamot shouting: by Jove he's right! We've been so blind all these years!

Specific to /The Arithmancer/, the only thing that bothered me was guessing right about basilisk eyes, and that was required for the plot. Her other feats were (as far as I can recall) telegraphed far ahead of time, but she didn't exactly have time to study basilisks to come up with the solution she did.

*** Some of this is true, to be sure, but I don't think /The Arithmancer/ is particularly egregious in this regard. But you disregard one important point.

Another way characters solving long-standing problems can be justified than "they're just smart don't question it" is that they bring in a novel /insight/; in Arithmancer!Hermione's case, her unparalleled-in-generations ability at maths combined with a Muggle scientific upbringing. Similarly, /some/ of the instances of "Smart MC solves problems that stumped the WW for decades" in HPMoR are abusive, but his destruction of the Dementor is perfectly justified, because while his intelligence enter into it, the core of it is that for simple statistics reason Harry is the first intelligent Ravenclaw who is also an ardent transhumanist.

It /can/ be easy to go overboard, as too many sorts of "novel insights" end up making the character just as much of a Mary Sue in a different way than they were before; but it's perfectly justifiable.

Also, slightly O.T., but Dumbledore and Dragon's Blood: I don't think he and Flamel need a particular justification to have "studied Dragon's Blood in such depth". Marie Curie or Stephen Hawking didn't need any sort of "backstory" with radiation or astrophysics to research them and make groundbreaking discoveries. They were /researchers/, by taste and by trade, and the same is true of Dumbledore and Flamel. They're magical scholars whose job and hobby it is to look more deeply into how magic works and what potentialities remain unfulfilled. Between 1945 and the Rise of Voldemort, and likely between 1981 and 1991, he likely spent most of his time studying this and that, with or without other skillful sorcerers as partners; it so happens that out of all the stuff he experimented with, it was with Dragon's Blood that he made a truly remarkable find.

**** Well, as far as wikipedia can tell, Marie Curie was looking for a thesis subject and there was a big hype on x-rays at the time, so she decided to observe "Uranic Rays", as in the radiations emitted by Uranium, that turned out not to be specific to Uranium at all but the garden variety atomic radiations we know and love today. And before that she decided to have a higher education and to go into science for reasons that are perhaps not entirely known to us today. The point, I think, is that people don't live in a vacuum and there is /always/ a story.

I think one of the main problem that people have with first-degree "genius" characters is that they are often idealized and taken out of the context they evolve(d) in. Which can happen in a fiction when everything around them seems to have no real modifying effect on their personality or life and the world only seems to exist to witness and be transformed by their brilliance.

It's a hard balance to maintain, to be sure.

***** I suspect one of the problems with folks writing genius characters is that they aren't geniuses themselves, have spent little time around true geniuses, and only have bad fiction like /Big Bang Theory/ to provide a template of what pop-culture thinks a genius is.

I'm a theoretical physicist by profession and I find that most portrayals of physicists in fiction make me want to hurl. Science just ain't done the way it shows up in fiction. And yes, while I have a few quirks, they're benign and I'm nowhere near the predictable and inauthentic weird of a Sheldon. Similarly, genius!Hermione written by a B student is rarely going to feel authentic.

****** Well, let's not forget that in the end, fiction is all about smoke and mirrors.

I don't think it takes an actual physicist to realize that the characters from BBT are mostly arseholes who don't really do anything remotely related to the pursuit of a new scientific enlightenment. That's probably because it's not the hook of the show.

Now, to write an interesting genius character, do you have to be a genius yourself? Well, surely it can't hurt (or now that I think about it, maybe it could, mostly because of the difficulty to relate about certain things with a wide audience). But most probably, you have to play a trick.

The advantage of being the writer is that you virtually get an infinite amount of time to craft your illusion and, if you have an audience that is actually reading your stuff of their own volition, willing and able to be entertained and/or intellectually challenged, then everything is stacked in your favour.

Could one possibly write a story about a genius physicist that would be entertaining and interesting to an actual physicist whilst being only marginally knowledgeable of the subject ? Heck yes, I think. It's not like actual detectives make a habit of burning the works of Conan Doyle on a regular basis. And we must consider that we now have Wikipedia and all the wonders of the internet. With a bit of research, a good amount of plotting and a certain amount of writing talent, I don't see why it should be impossible.

Not easy, surely, but not impossible. In the end I think that what can possibly fail a B student writing MathGenius! Hemione is not the maths skills, but the writing chops. But to be fair, is that not the point of fanfiction, to learn to write, either as a practise ground for a professional career or purely as a hobby?

You don't, but you should at least understand something about the nature of genius if you want to write it belivably. It's the same with any mental disorder. A writer should do some research or something. Read a book, or at least a web page, as you suggest.

Yes, as one who has written a bit (professionally and fanfiction), I recognize that you can't always just write what you know. But it's entirely possible to do enough research that you don't come off as a trying-too-hard wannabe. "Genius" has been sensationalized so much in popular twaddle means that to trust same to inform one on what it really is is stupid.

And maybe I just really hate /Big Bang Theory/ and can't resist bashing it.

My problem with the Intelligent! MC, is when they only have that as their defining feature. They are 'Intelligent person #1' and the writer doesn't characterize the character any more than that.

** If quirkiness, insufferability, ingeniousness or smarty-pantshood are part of the characterization and believable written then so be it. The problem comes when this person is supposed to be one of the main characters and this one trait dominates their personality.

When any trait is way over-the-top you are left with a predictable one dimensional character. Fine for a side character, not fine for a main character.

As far as extent, it shouldn't become so exaggerated that my immersion is ever broken. If I ever get the impression mid-paragraph that the author is either trying too hard (in the case of humor) or up their own asshole (in the case of genius), it's gone too far.

** The Intelligence is an abstract thing. You can't tell if a person is intelligent without comparing him or her with some average. This is where the most fanfic authors take an easy way and make this average IQ negative.

In other words it doesn't really mater what traits you give to your genius MC. What really matters is how much effort you put into others characters intelligence.

Show that your MC is brilliant not because others are dumb, but because common sense, average intelligence and real life experience fail to resolve problems and your MC can do it.
