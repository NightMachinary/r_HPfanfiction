Can anyone recommend any good stories where Riddle is a politician rather than a terrorist? Preferably a longfic, Volds doesn't need to be the focus, no pairings are off the table...

I've read two such stories so far. Love the concept, can't seem to come across more.

Please and thank you!

  "O, isn't this what my mother never wanted?" - Analicia Sotelo, 'South Texas Persephone'.Tom Riddle was not the only strange child to come out of Wool's. After eleven years of self-imposed exile, Amy Benson returns to Hogwarts to protect the only thing that matters: her precocious daughter, Mae. Offered the position of Potions Master, her alma mater seems like the safest place to keep Mae away from the darker elements of their world. But the wizarding world of 1957 is not the one Amy remembers, and while the threat of war may be over, she quickly discovers that peace in magical Britain is far from assured. As a radical new faction led by a charismatic Tom Gaunt rises to power in the Ministry, and a rapidly expanding Hogwarts braces for a post-war generation determined to leave its mark, Amy and Mae find that the secrets they keep for and from one another may be their undoing.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

** What are the two that you've read?

He's not a politician in this one but have you read linkao3(the imposter complex by notus_oren)? It has a super awesome and unique take on Tom Riddle. I just started reading linkao3(in the bleak midwinter) and I haven't gotten to grown up Tom yet but judging by how his upbringing is shaping up, there will definitely be lots of politics in his future! The Riddle family is very ambitious with lofty plans for the wizarding world despite being muggles.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.Originally posted on ffnet, now also updating here.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Tangentially related story idea: Tom Riddle founds a rival school with the intention of eventually dealing with blood purists: linkao3(26333881)

Sadly it's still in its beginning phases, but I think this might fit the core of your request: Tom Riddle deals with society and power in a different way than just bloody murder and mayhem.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.
