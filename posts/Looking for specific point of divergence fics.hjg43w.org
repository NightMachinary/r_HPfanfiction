Hi! I'm looking for fics that diverge in some way from canon right before, during, or right after the Shrieking Shack confrontation with Sirius. I've read linkffn (And Before The Door of Hell Lamps Burned), as well as an assortment of others, and I'd love something similar to that. It really has the feel of the original works and I need more! Any pairings are fine, het, slash, whatever, but I'd like the pairing to flow naturally. Please let me know if you know of any. Thanks in advance!
