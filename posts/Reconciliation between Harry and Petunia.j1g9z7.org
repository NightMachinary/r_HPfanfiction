Does anybody know such stories? I know few ones where they got somewhere close to some communication (e.g., "Petunia Snapshot by Meester Lee" linkffn(12551744) or " Petunia's Letter by mzzbee" the linkao3(11676102)), but not the one where they would sit down and really talk. Does anybody have stories where the reconciliation is more developed?


** An Aunt's Love » Harry comes home from school and Petunia is upset at the change in her nephew. Petunia decides to do what she should have been doing all along. Dumbledore had better stay away. Petunia Dursley is upset. Warnings on profile

*** Except there is not real reconciliation there: Petunia is just one day enlightened by the Holy Spirit (or whomever) and makes that “D'Oh! That's the mistake: to /love/ Harry, not to /hate/ him!” and then everything is perfect. Moreover, Lady Petunia is even worse trope than Lord Potter ever was. Sorry, that was “Petunia Takes Charge by Leath1” linkffn(4067744), even worse solution to the same problem. “An Aunt's Love” shifts to super!Harry, doesn't it?

**** I agree with you for the most part but I think the explanation as to why Petunia made a sudden 180 turn was explained in later chapters. Apparently Dumbledore saw the abuse going on so he basically decided to obliviate Petunia to make her less nasty towards Harry. Harry realizes this in the later chapters and has to make the decision of forgiving Petunia and questioning whether her niceness was due to the obliviation. Which is something he has to live with for a very long time. Petunia learns of this too and by this time everything gets a little too fucked up for them to dwell on it too long. I'm not defending this fic definitely has a lot of problems and I think all of your points are valid. The only way I can justify the super!Harry aspect is how much his mental health might balance it out. Ptsd, panic, attacks, mental blocks and a whole can worm of identity issues etc that throws him back as a character. Granted I haven't read this for years and I still agree with your points but I guess I found the aspect of reconciliation with the obliviation going on interesting enough to recommend. Who are you if a chunk of your memories are cut off from you? How much of your actions and love are sincere when all of these experiences are taken away? How genuine of a person are you? And how much can be forgiven or when the abuser doesn't even remember what they've done. Anyways I'm not trying to change your opinion at all but I just wanted to share my own perspective (:

Yeah, but it is just a lazy in-story solution of a lazy author, who didn't want to work his way through proper reconciliation.

****** No no what I meant to say was Harry has the same reaction he is like wtf you obliviated her so why should I even reconcíliate with her ? Since that makes all the nice actions she does towards Harry mean absolutely nothing. Its like obliviating your abuser your abuser suddenly becomes a good person and now you're in a dilemma Do I stay with the better version or do I acknowledge that it doesn't make anything better since all the wrong has already been done essentially absolving responsibility from the antagonist. Its kind of an ongoing moral dilemma in the story because it questions how much of our memories shape us to be the person we are and if we alter that does that make it a cheap artificial version of ourselves that's not genuine or does that make us a new person in total? This story went towards the you become a new person route but they never excuse Petunia and while the suspicion of how much of her actions remain authentic to herself remain Harry just decides to reconcile regardless because he's always fed off that familial validation even in canon. Of course you can question on whether that makes him a weak character or not which I might be inclined to agree too. What I'm saying is while there is reconciliation the past hurt and trauma linger throughout the story and there is never a full blown forgiveness from Harry who still lashes out. Idk does that make sense? I just felt that there was more nuance to it than meets the eye on first glance. Though I still respect your opinion.

******* BTW, subplot with Petunia being repeatedly obliviated is also present in stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer is before Winter), which are one of the best post-war stories I know about.

** This sort of happens in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) after Petunia goes to jail for child abuse, has counselling there and reflects on her attitude towards magic. However, it's a pretty short scene at the end of a massive fic so I'm not sure you'd want to read it.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
