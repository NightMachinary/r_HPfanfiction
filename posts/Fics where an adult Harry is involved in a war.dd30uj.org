No H/G or H/Hr Doesn't matter what war, just a war. Preferably grey Harry or atleast one that doesn't insist on only stunning


** Hmm, maybe linkffn(Beyond the Curtain by Bobika)? Not exactly a war, though...

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide Neville's team through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* stars from DLP.

*** Thanks for recommending this, I'm halfway through and it's already the best post-apocalypse fic I've read. Surprised I hadn't come across it before.

**** I am glad you liked it! It's still newish, so I don't think that many people know about it. But I believe it deserves to have a place among the HP fanfiction classics, maybe it will get there with time:)

** You will need to forgive some dialogue and grammar. The idea is fresh though, with a plot that actually moves.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

**** They published 100k words in under two months. Odds are good it will continue in another big dump. Realistically though. I haven't a clue.
