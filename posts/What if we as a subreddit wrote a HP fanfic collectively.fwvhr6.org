This (admittedly stupid) idea has been running around my head for a while. What if we wrote a fanfic together? Personally, I haven't ever wrote anything longer than a 30k word fanfic that I only ever posted 19k of and then abandoned ahaha.

So? Ideas? This has the potential to either become th most crackiest of crack fics or actually something interesting (if this post doesn't go ignored)

Edit: heres a discord server for anyone interested! [[https://discord.gg/FRd5YVz:]]

***** That's a fair point, but as a counter Cauterize linkffn(4152700) is probably the most unanimously well liked fic on the sub. A good idea and good writing matters more than using the core characters or not. And the Harry Potter series gives hints of a lot of potentially interesting stories for the side characters. The project idea would be what would interest most people or not anyway.

** I've read a worm fic where the author posted a chapter, then took all the forum comments after posting, and had them be audibly given to the protag. In this way, the audience was directly communicating with the main character and guiding them, but there was always an in story time lag, as the character is doing stuff for hours, gets an info dump from the readers, then does stuff for hours. Etc.

Purely giving each person here a chapter to write would go off the rails quickly. It's like the ouiji sub.

** I love it. I wouldn't take any organization, just do it as a round robin story. One person starts: “Hagrid was very excited, because today was the day his new pet arrived. It was the cutest, sweetest, most adorable creature ever. He removed all the heavy chains holding its sturdy box closed, and opened it to free---“

And then the next writer takes over.

** Had a similar idea once. Never actually got it down, though. First chapter, a prologue, is the same across multiple writers, like a prompt. It ends with Harry and someone else getting Isekai'd. The second person is NOT LABLED in the Prologue. From there, multiple people write stories in different areas, or different worlds entirely. Different characters coming with him in each one, and, eventually him falling for his partner.

How would this fit your idea? Simple. At the end of each Journey all of the characters go back to the last scene of the Prologue, as if nothing changed. Except: EVERYTHING changed.

All versions of Harry Potter in this group get slammed into the same body, with the minds meshing together. All companions get slammed with the memories of every one of said in the group. All Daphne Greengrass get slammed into the same target. All Luna Lovegoods added in get slammed together. All Hermione Grangers involved hit at once, too. And I'm certain there are people that will pick Ron or Malfoy, and they get slammed in the same manner.

And from there, we continue in the Harry Potter Universe with these compiled characters. From there, it'll most likely end up turning into a crackfic filled with more Insanity than most writers can handle.

*** I would be down to do something like this, since the portal part has a common entry and exit point, but authors would also have a good amount of freedom in what to write. I think it would probably work best with some kind of group standards set for the portal part, that way the relative amount of time and attention this part of the story receives would be relatively standard across the board (though outside of the collective portion, authors should be free to post as little or as much as this part of the story as they want). While I know having some (loose) standard isn't completely freeing, there would likely be the issue of people progressing at vastly different points, which would make the collaborative part of the fic harder to reach, if it ever got to that point (I say this based on my own experience from roleplaying).

On the flip side, though, I think it would be more interesting if Harry didn't fall for his companion. Though I feel like more people would probably go the shipping route, if someone wanted to veer away from this, it could give some really fun dynamics for some of the characters. Like, what if two Dracos had to reconcile with the fact that one was in love with Harry while the other was one argument away from murdering Potter? At the same time, this could open up the field for more companions to go along with Harry for those that aren't into writing romantic pairings, or who would rather explore a different type of bond. I don't know, just wanted to sort of expand a little on this? I still think it would be fun doing it as you suggested, however.

**** Honestly, the Romance point probably wouldn't be mandatory. I know full well that some writers can't do Romance to save their life. Mostly, I just came up with the idea trying to figure answer a question:

What would happen if multiple versions of Harry Potter were slammed into the same world, in the same body, just after second year?

It kind of expanded into this.

That there would most likely be a Harem is what had me put it away, because I can't write a decent harem fic for the life of me.

***** Fair enough, and if this were popular enough, I think it would result in a gen/shipping mix.

How you got to this idea from your initial what if question is why I love "what if" fanfics, because two people presented with the same scenario would come up with widely different responses. I would have turned that idea into a super cracky fic filled with the most overdone tropes, and Harry's psyche would have turned into a Battle Royale as different versions of him fought for dominance. I wouldn't have even thought about adding companions.

I can't blame you for that. I tend to steer clear of harem fics because it would be harder to do well. But going into it knowing that there's a high change it turns out as a crackfic would help with that particular issue.

** I'm interested in joining, but I just want to point out that the google doc seems to be view mode only, with the ability to request access. Is this intentional, or not? I think it would be nice to put all the ideas in the document and have the people who intend to take part vote on there - with the votes, there's no telling if that's people interested in writing, or if that's just what people would want to read. Though I think the sub's input could be nice to incorporate within the fic, I think the plot should be agreed upon primarily by the writers, that way people are writing something that they would enjoy.

That said, this isn't a plot idea, but I do think that it could be a lot of fun to have the sub request a specific trope/item/character/theme be incorporated in the story? Like, if the CYOA idea is most popular, maybe the trope could vote on what the initial choices would be. Or if the ship war fic was more popular, maybe the sub could vote on what characters should be excluded?

That way, the writers themselves agree on the plot, but the sub can still have influence if they aren't writing?

** Definitely going to join in when this takes off. Could be interesting if everyone got assigned a chapter, then tried to link it into some loose plot? Give every user a word limit, and a small chapter description and you could probably get an okay(ish) crackfic, or perhaps even something serious if those involved decide to properly cooperate and create a fic.
