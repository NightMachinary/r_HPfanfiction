For example I don't want magic explained using scientific terms and such, no incorporating gravity, etc. I was reading something about string theory on Reddit this week and it stuck with me somewhat. Don't look at string theory as the complex one we know. How about, matter or objects for wizards are just made out of strings and different colours and that is basic knowledge for them (for clarification I know string theory doesn't mean that matter is made of strings). That is the way that wizards know it but to muggles it's been leaked as how we know it today, basically.

The story doesn't have to be about string theory, but anything with similar themes is what I'm looking for

Thanks

** I know you have probably heard of HPMOR but one of the behind the scenes factors per word of God is magic is how the universe actually works and the laws of physics are artificially/magically enforced rules which wizards/magical beasts have an inborn exception to So even though the character is exploring through legitimate scientific principles the results of his experiments usually nullify his hypothesis because of an inverse/incorrect prior assumption
