*** Because ffnbot doesn't list fics in the same order they were called for, there's no easy way to map your descriptions to the links. I would recommend including the title in your descriptions so it's easy for people to see which one you're talking about.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] (login required)

Has a great wizard's duel where fiendfyre is used (part: Harry's Mentor). Also used earlier in fic in a cursebreaking scene (part: Tom's Curse). That fic also has heavy use of parselmagic by multiple people, not just Harry and Voldemort.

** linkffn(Getting Too Old For This) HPxMass Effect crossover where Harry gets recruited to help stop Saren. Ends up stealing the spotlight multiple times in awesome ways. Personally, I enjoy it as I'm a fan of the whole badass-devil-may-care type of character, but as others have pointed out, it's better read as crack.

  Immortality is a hell of a lot less fun than it sounds, especially when all you want is to be left alone but your conscience won't let you. Harry Potter and his usual bipolar luck live on into the 22nd century, his saving-people-thing meshing nicely with the galaxy's pressing need for a hero. Rated M for unrepentant coarse language, innuendo, and eventual sexy shenanigans
