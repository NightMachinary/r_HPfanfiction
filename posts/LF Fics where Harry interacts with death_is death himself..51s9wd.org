I am looking for fics where Harry has some sort of relationship with Death (not slash or ship). He can also be Death himself or be anything else according to the interpretation of the title Master of Death.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)

** linkffn(Stand Against the Moon by Batsutousai; Xerosis by Batsutousai) have both relationships between Death and Harry. One is warm and caring, the other is distant, but he's there. Disregard the slash warning, it's basically non existent.

linkffn(Death's Son by Little.Miss.Xanda). Harry is the son of Death. Peggy Sue and abandoned, but I enjoyed it.

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

  He was lying in the mud dying, the world was already dead. Voldemort must be in his grave laughing, he had been right all along and now it was to late to do anything about it. Death didn't quite agree with that and now Death's son was going to make the muggles pay for everything they had done. This story will contain slash

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
