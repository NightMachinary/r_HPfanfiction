I saw this and I wanted to know....has there been any fanfics that expands on Bellatrix's childhood into insanity and to her death? Like people's own headconnon's on what she was like before Azkaban without changing her overall fate. What headconnon's would you apply to her youth?

** Depending on whether you accept 1951 as her birth year (I don't because this date is solely based on Black Family Tree used in the movie, in which her father's birth year was listed as 1938. Lol), either [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855;12511998), depicts a well characterized pre Death Eater Bellatrix.

--------------

I personally see lots of similarities between her and Ginny:

- Aggressive and violent
- Devoted to her cause
- Fanatically and unconditionally loyal to her hero; that and a strong dose of hero worship.
- Reasonably cunning and intelligent
- Magically powerful
- Physically beautiful during their prime age

Ginny's wand is Yew (Voldemort's) and likely Dragon Heartstring. Based on [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][JKR's wand lore]], it's a very powerful combo and its user can become either a great hero or terrible villain.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
