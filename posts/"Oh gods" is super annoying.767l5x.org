Does that bother anyone else? It annoys me especially. Not even out of a religious thing, but it seems so out of for every character. That's the kind of thing where you're raised in a world with a religion with multiple big boy gods. You know, Roman and Greek business. Do any of you say it IRL? Most of us are raised with the knowledge of god even if we don't believe in it, and it's such a popular saying to use. It's used by purebloods too in the books. But "gods" always pokes me in my brain that makes me really annoyed.

** I find "oh my god" to be super annoying, because it's so over-used in the US. It's the standard response to just about everything. I don't think your god appreciates being called upon for trivialities. British culture may be based upon (mostly) the same religion, but I don't think the expression is nearly as popular there. Church attendance is low, and religion is a private thing.

"Oh gods" would be much more natural for me. I come from Scandinavia, which is more atheistic than religious nowadays. We don't really have a (single) god, so why not refer to [[http://www.godchecker.com/][all the gods?]] There are lots of them, and the question of which one is the true one has been debated for millennia, without any firm conclusion.

I was surprised that Draco said "God, this place is going to the dogs" in Prisoner of Azkaban. A racist pureblood using a muggle reference? Strange. Not that "Merlin" is preferable. A muggle-born like Hermione or a muggle-raised like Harry using "Merlin" as an expletive is beyond out-of-character. Take note, fanfiction authors.

******** They can, but it doesn't mean it's going to be enjoyable to read! In many ways I feel like it's quite fundamental - if you get the register right and manage to write dialogue in a way that is reminiscent of the novels and is appropriate for what is essentially a group of teenagers in 1990s Britain then you can do whatever you like with the setting or plot as far as I'm concerned. Nothing is more jarring than little things like this for me.

I really don't buy all the discussion in this thread about "oh when Malfoy says 'God' it's really weird" or "Witches and wizards are probably polytheistic anyway" - there are thousands of books about witches and wizards about, we're talking about a very specific group of witches and wizards here and they happen to be English and they happen to talk like most people did in the 90s and early 2000s.

However, all that said, I am reading The House of Sleep by Jonathan Coe and a character (albeit a character who is notable for his officious and elitist use of language) just said "Ye Gods" so there's a first time for everything!

** Because saying "Merlin's saggy ballsack!" is just /so/ much better, right?

Wizards, on the whole, are very unlikely to worship a Judaic religion. I could probably write a whole rant on it if I had the motivation, but words are hard and I don't want to, so I won't. Suffice to say, magic and belief in a One True God are /probably/ incompatible due to the fact that God is supposed to be omnipotent and wizards are a challenge to that omnipotence. If you disagree, I don't care, I'm not putting much thought into this and I don't want to argue about it.

Moving on from religion; "Oh My God" is an integral part of modern western culture, to the point where even people who don't believe in any god at all will still use the phrase with feeling, purely because it an incredibly concise expression of emotion. Magicals will use "Merlin" in place of that, but we, the writers and readers, are not magical and didn't grow up learning that culture. We can't use OMG because Judaism, and I can't use "Merlin" because I feel kind of stupid saying it, truthfully, and somehow I find it weird that a human would be revered as a god-king rather than actual mythological gods. Thus, the compromise of "gods" is used. Close enough to the first to be familiar, close enough to the latter to not be out of place, and already has roots in mythology and history.

** I say it. Never really thought about it, just happens. I also use "(oh) gods above" (in which case the "oh" is more of a preliminary sigh than an actual word). I use gods as often as god, though I'm more likely to use Merlin (started using it when I went through a "Fuck religion!" phase, got into the habit), or to use some phrase using Jesus/Christ. (Current favourite is "Christ on a bike".)

But it isn't all about having multiple gods. In some dialects, pluralising it is just the way it comes out and the people that say it are going to write it. Some people have picked it up from media, like [[/u/InterminableSnowman]]. I've seen it said that saying "gods" is less serious than just "god". I've also seen it said that an atheist would say gods to distance themselves slightly from religious implications, though I admit that argument seems a bit flat. It may also be that a phrase like "oh God have mercy" gets shortened to "oh God's mercy" which gets shortened again, but is misinterpreted as plural instead of possessive and you end up with "oh gods".

For another thing, Christian doctrine was transmitted through the church, not peasants.

Finally, there's [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7&version=NIV][a biblical example of that exact thing]] (continues into Exodus 8). The Pharaoh is unimpressed by feats wizards can replicate, so God moves on to things they can't.

Magic being real was part of Judaism, and was incorporated into Christianity. They've stepped away from it in recent years, obviously. In the world of magical realism, we would expect the miracles validated by the Catholic church prior to the Statute of Secrecy to consist of things that are beyond the powers of wizards.

I'd actually say in the case of fanfic the usage of a singular "god" peeves me more for precisely that reason. I just can't parse how a culture that is capable of using magic and breaking physics doing so could ever realistically be monotheistic or hold a belief similar to the christian "one true omnipotent god" dogma.

I can imagine muggleborns saying "Oh God"/"Oh Jesus" and wizards being more partial to "Oh Merlin" but I can also imagine all three being interchangeable. I don't know the origin of "Oh God" but you have to remember that the SoS wasn't in place until the 17th century, so wizarding culture/language would have been very influenced by their muggle counterparts, including religion.

You add in the fact that muggleborns have provided an uninterrupted stream of muggle culture, language and religion throughout wizarding history, I can definitely imagine "Oh God" becoming a permanent part of the vernacular, even if, like in a lot of western countries, its usage is now completely divided from religion.

It's like you said --- using them seems so out of character for /anyone/ in the Harry Potter universe. I've honestly read very few books that manage not to use cuss words --- it's rather a talent to write it that way. I think northumbrian's fics hardly ever used cuss words.

No one in canon (that I know of) ever says "Oh gods" or some other reference to plural deities.

** Line 3, "god" should be "God". Anyway, I agree with you. I see it a lot in Charlie/Hermione fics where the two are engaging in wild sex acts and Hermione utters the jaded "oh gods, Charlie, that feels so good!" line. Whenever that comes up, I roll my eyes but continue on anyway.

*** Yeah, my autocorrect doesn't change the capital G. I can't be bothered to manually fix it. Well, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It's so popular in sex scenes. Immediately just makes me irrationally angry.

**** And I'll repeat, in line 3, "god" should be "God". I care if there are capitalization errors in a Reddit post so your first point is moot. Have a great day! :)

****** Except the fact that 2 billion people (yes there are that many Christians in the world) believe that in line 3, "god" should be "God". But thanks for your insight! Double cheers!!
