I occasionally make supplemental materials to flesh out the VP universe, which are linked on my AO3 profile.

This is one that I think will be of general interest beyond just VP readers. It is a list of all the Departments and Sub-Departments of the Ministry, in many cases down to the individual job title (a total of 1,561 jobs).

** Committee for Placating Paranoid Elderwizards

M.E.D.D.L.E.R.S.

Loch Ness Monitoring Station

Ball Fondler

Holder of the Long Poking Stick

Regretful Volunteer

This was a lot of fun to read. Great work on the alliteration, but there's not enough acronyms.

** I think this is insanely interesting and a great example of real dedication to world-building. I imagine all of these documents serve as really useful scaffolding making it a lot easier to write stories. If the world is already established, then you think of the characters, their actions and the reaction to these is already implicit in the prebuilt world.

It's awe-inspiring to see such devotion to the craft. However, it does make me feel unmotivated since it makes me realize I'm not "just a good plot idea away" from potentially writing something. I wouldn't be surprised if this pdf gets used by other writers still; you may have just made thousands of people's worlds a little deeper. I sincerely appreciate you sharing this.

*** The vast majority of writers do not create documents like this and it does not prevent them from writing good stories - don't think this kind of world building is at all necessary!

Very little of this document will ever make it into the story; I just like knowing the detail. Plus it's quite fun coming up with all the Ministry sub-departments and job titles.

  Vampire Hunters Guild (2)

Percy would be dispointed

#+begin_quote
  "That woman's got it in for the Ministry of Magic!" said Percy furiously. "Last week she was saying we're wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness,when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn't specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans
#+end_quote

All kidding aside, its a good document, though I think there are too few liaison offices for beings, Canon gave me the impression that there are a lot beyond the Goblin Liason office with the Centaur Liason office just being the least used one(since Centaurs actively avoid wiazrds).

*** The goblin one is intended as a bit of a joke - you have barely any wizards in the body devoted to maintaining friendly relations with the goblins, and then a ton of wizards in the body devoted to suspiciously monitoring what the goblins are up to.

Also, re: vampire hunters, my line is that the moment they drink human blood, they're legally fair game.

**** If a vampire wants blood, why not just go to a shop and by some blood favoured food.

#+begin_quote
  Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.

  "Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I expect," Hermione was saying.
#+end_quote

I mean, I doubt Gamps law considers human blood to be good food.

** Completely forgot that Hitwizards existed. I'm curious as to know what the difference is between Hitwizards and Aurors. My headcanon for Aurors is that they're a hybrid of special forces and an intelligence agency.

·Aurors do direct action, as seen by Moody killing Rosier and Dumbledore stating that the Aurors are on their way in OOTP.

·Aurors also do close protection detail, as seen with Kingsley and the Muggle PM, Tonks/Dawlish/Proudfoot and Savage protecting Hogwarts in HBP

·Stealth and tracking mentioned by Tonks suggests that there is some form of reconnaissance done. Moody says he's been tracking Karkaroff for six months in the Wizengamot trials of the Death Eaters.

·There's likely some form of additional training given that Kingsley can pass for a Muggle and not be detected at all. An alternate explanation is that Kingsley took Muggle Studies while in Hogwarts which made him ideal to guard the PM.

·Aurors could operate in different countries. Kingsley is misleading the Ministry by saying Sirius is in Tibet in the beginning of OOTP. Harry also notes that in Kingsley's office there "was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels." Its possible Kingsley would travel to those locations and falsify evidence to make his claim credible.

·Auror selection is competitive, like military SOF units they only take those that are capable as McGonagall comments that there hasn't been a recruit in three years. Meaning that like SOF units, Aurors cannot be mass produced.

Or perhaps a real life comparison is too limiting. Aurors could be seen as magical 00 agents.

** What's a Thesean?

Is welcome witch just a wizard term for secretary or something else?

Suspiciously Muggle Importation and Licencing Executive: This makes sense with how bureacracy-heavy Brit wizarding culture is. Probably stop most imports directly or by levying massive tariffs.

*** Theseans are named after Theseus. Essentially they are like the Aurors of the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures - elite wizards who specialise in tackling XXXXX magical creatures.

Welcome Witches are receptionists/secretaries, yes, with Dogsbodies being the administrative assistants.
