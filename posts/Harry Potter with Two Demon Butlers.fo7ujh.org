^ if I remember correctly it was a crossover with Black Butler, as it has Sebastian and Claude as the two butlers for Harry. I also think that they were summoned to him during fourth year, another scene is that while they have a stay at 12 Place the twins prank Harry but he has a bad immune system (something along those lines) and one of the butlers tares them a new one and Harry has white hair after it as a side effect.

Please if anything reminds you of this message it, I haven't read it in months and I could have gotten a few things mixed with other stories like this as I binge a lot of fanfics at a time, sorry if this isn't enough info.

thank you!
