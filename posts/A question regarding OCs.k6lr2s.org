Here's the thing: I've read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377][Rose Petal Red]] a while ago and, while it didn't completely blow me away (personal preferences in a few things) it did inspire me a crap ton. It inspired me so much that I've had this idea with my own Weasley OC (a twin for Ginny) who is a Seer (not like Trelawny though). I want to branch out divination a lot in that fic and make it like a genuine thing in that world. I even asked the author of that fic if they would be okay with me borrowing that particular premise a while ago. Most of what I would do would be very different still.

Now, I know that OCs are regarded with a lot of scepticism in this fandom and rightly so. To do right by this OC I would like to ask you guys for a few dos and don'ts when it comes to OCs in this particular fandom. I know all about Mary Sues and whatnot, but what is it with OCs in this fandom in particular that bothers you? What should I avoid? What would be something you guys enjoy about OCs in HP fics?

Thanks in advance!


** I probably won't be much help since I really dislike fics with OC as the main character, but what I dislike about those fics is that the OC is always special in some way. They either are super-(powerful, smart, funny, skilled, talented) or have some unusual skills (parseltongue, legilimency, prophetic dreams, wandless magic, whatever).

The best OC (in my opinion) is someone who blends in. They should have an interesting personality, backstory or family situation that would make me want to read a story with them as the main character, instead of a long list of skills and talents that just makes them so unique they seem more like a cartoon character than a real person.

*** And there's the first issue, lol. I mean, this OC will have a divination skill, though it does come at a price. But that'd be it. Not super smart, not super skilled, not anything beyond that one skill. And even that won't be like something OP, because it would take away the whole tension if she'd just be like "this and this and that will happen at this and that time." I mean, I get where you are coming from. Personally, I want OCs as MCs to be special in /some/ way. I'd find it boring otherwise. However, if it becomes too much Anime then I nope out super fast.

**** I don't mind that they have the skill. It's when they don't have to work on it, that bothers me.

By all means, give your main character something that makes them stand out. They are the main character after all. Just, don't give them a perfect plot power. Divination should be like any other branch of magic. One that takes time, determination and skill to see it made useful.

** It is as with anything else: you must have true plot-given reasons for having OC. There is nothing wrong with Maria in ‚ÄúTen More Minutes by Litfreak89‚Äù linkffn(9566537) (actually, she is not OC, but only almost). She has her own story (actually, in this case, she is the main heroine of the story) and it wouldn't work without her.

Disastrous OCs are those girls clinging to The Golden Trio (or ‚Äúwhat would happen if Harry had a sister?‚Äù stories), who don't have their proper story, and only reason for their existence is that the author wants to project herself into them.

What would happen to your story, if that character vanished? Nothing? Then save the world of her presence. (BTW, this happened to JKR with Ginny to some extent: what would happen to DH, if Ginny vanished just after Harry broke up with her? Absolutely nothing).

She has her own story, she has her own purpose and it has little to do with the Golden Trio as such. Granted, because she would be a Weasley -- and Ginny's twin -- she'd have interactions with them but I would insert neither her nor Ginny into the Golden Trio.

** I love OCs! However, here's what you asked for...

I dislike OCs who are...

1. Superhuman powerful
2. Voldemort's target
3. Hermione's sister, because let's face it. Ron and Harry would never ignore Hermione's sister. They're too nice for that!
4. Oh, woe is me! type characters. Honestly, I would say to them..."Like, have you /seen/ Harry? The guy has to defeat a Dark Lord! While his parental world is crumbling around him!

I love OCs who are

1. Kind
2. Healers
3. They have their flaws
4. Not from a family mentioned in HP, or from a well-known family from HP. That ruins the OC thing for me.
5. I prefer OCs who are Pureblood or Half-Blood becase Muggleborns seem very curious, and to have 5 chapters dedicated to how surprised and suspicious they are of the magical world is too much.

It could go either way; readers could be annoyed by a new addition to the magical world that isn't in Rowling's books, OR, readers could be interested in a new family and background of a brand-new character!

** Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people).

I'd also recommend doing a search of this sub on the topic - there have been some really good discussions on this that I've seen in my year here.

This I like in particular. I can already promise that she's going to be very different from Ginny because that was super important to me. Where Ginny is spunky and fiery and sporty, she's going to be pretty much the exact opposite. There'll be reasons for that, obviously. Thanks again!

** Linkffn(Green Eyed Monster) has a seer oc as a slytherin twin. Nice characterization. You will want to be less canon compliant. A Seer who is unable to make tangible changes to canon events leads to a fundamentally uninteresting story.

It would actually be nice to see a different sort of seer like in the Alex Verus series. Someone capable of short term precognition in fights and dialogue.

Linkffn(Felix Fortuna) is a good example of a interesting story even with extremely overpowered precognition for the MC.

** Generally, an OC works best when they do something an existing character couldn't or wouldn't fit - and where they might bring something interesting to the plot/situation. IE, there needs to be a reason for an OC to be there for people to like/accept them. Pseudo-OCs - taking an existing background character and essentially making them into your OC - tends to be a lot more accepted.

The skepticism comes from OCs often being OP, Self-inserts, or not particularly interesting to read about - or just being a version of a canon character that didn't need to be replaced (eg, slotting an OC in to play Harry's best friend instead of Ron just feels like bashing).

So in your case, I'd ask what the benefit of the OC being Ginny's twin brings you - is there a dynamic that you think that would add that would be interesting to explore? What is the benefit of having this OC be the seer rather than Ginny, or another existing character? What kind of impact will this OC be having on the plot - will we be following them around, will they be joining with Harry/Hermione/Ron, will they just be in the background? What kind of personality will they have?

For OCs that I enjoy, it's difficult to say. Like I mentioned, there's a ton of pseudo-OCs - Daphne Greengrass would be a prime example - and those often are enjoyable - but do they count? Otherwise, OCs that are in areas not covered by canon have typically been better in stories that I've seen (though that by no means prevents them from being good) - eg, focusing on a different magical school/country, or time period, or age.

** I think one of the important issues, in addition to the usual power stuff, is one of agency and dramatic moments.

Is the OC stealing a protagonist's agency and defining moments? Hell, it doesn't even have to be an OC, it just happens more often there. I remember one fanfic I was reading, it was an attempt to 'redeem' a really questionable non-OC character, so they put him more in the forefront. Until the character started stealing the spotlight at points when it's supposed to be the protagonist's shining moments.

As an over the top example: A new OC joining the "Golden Trio" to make a "Golden Quartet" is fine, if handled properly and they mesh. One who drives away the Dementor Horde in book three instead of Harry? Not fine, it's stealing Harry's agency. One who defeats the basilisk while Harry is unconscious? Not fine. And so on. Don't have the OC steal the protagonist's thunder.

It's fine to change things up, and have the OC do some stuff, but one must be careful.

** Why not just make Ginny a seer?

As evidenced by the Daphne Greengrass fandom, there are so many unutilized characters you may as well grab one of them and plaster your OC over them and get a better response. Demelza Robbins can be a seer. Jimmy Peakes can be a seer.

Lavender Brown turning out to be a real seer sounds pretty great, actually.

I personally don't mind OCs at all.
