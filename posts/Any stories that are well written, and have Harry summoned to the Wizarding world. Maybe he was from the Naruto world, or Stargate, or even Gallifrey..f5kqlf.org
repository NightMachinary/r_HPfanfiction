Basically what the title says. I've read one's where he was Kabuto(i'm not a fan of harems, but damn was that story interesting enough to ignore it for the most part). I've read one where he came from the FF series, and all sorts. I just want a story where Harry grew up in a very different environment, and is using different powers, or altered magical abilities, because of it.

I can't stress enough that I want it to be well written. It doesn't have to be perfect, but after the One Piece crossover where he was summoned by the GOF, I could only read up to the first task, because of how janky it was. It did not flow smoothly at all, and that, for me, ruins more stories then bad grammar in my opinion(although I do want the stories to have decent grammar as well).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  Sequel to Fate's Gamble. Harry has finished with his original world (aside from a few visits) and now it's time to follow through on his promise to Fate to set right another world that her meddling didn't have quite the same effect as in his own. Summoned to fight Voldemort once more, Harry decides to have some fun while he's there. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
