I Have read a lot of FF where is Harry doing the same again and again... where they force Harry to be part of the Plot vs Voldy but after he's dead they only write one chapter for epilogue where he has kids with whoever whas his pairing or his super awesome harem I want a story where after all is fixed we read about Harry studying (either in Hogwarts or for his mastery with someone) or Working (idk probably wizengamot) Like for example: [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Awesomegoblin/works/8171473]] I love this one-shot but Voldemort was Killed so there's no more story i would love to read about how the changes they made to the staff affected the kids, and the whole society I would totally read a story were for some reason or other Harry became the Heir of the Four houses and became lord Hogwarts in Secret and The Spirit of Hogwarts (or Lady Hogwarts) tells him who to fire who to contract as the new teacher new classes (obviously muggle ones, like math,science, physics, etc) and read about it the day to day class, Harry studying, reactions of wizards-raised etc...


** In linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower), Harry ends up losing his memories and sorta, throws himself into school. Once the main plot is done, the whole second half of the fic is him and Severus just fixing Hogwarts. Making it a legit school with proper teachers and classes and textbooks. It's really good actually ðŸ˜‚ I dont know if it's exactly what you want but it's very much a "well... I guess the dark lord is dead, better go do actual life now"

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
