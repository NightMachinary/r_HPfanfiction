So I am writing another fanfiction about an OC in Percy's year, but the only ones I can find in that year are Oliver Wood, Penelope Clearwater, and Marcus Flint.


** You won't find more. I've had a quick look on the HP Wiki for you and this is what I found:

On [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1987][this page]] only the ones you already found are listed.

On [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sorted_in_1987][this page]] however Penelope Clearwater is missing.

This is confirmed by [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Penelope_Clearwater][Penelope's article]] which states she actually arrives at Hogwarts in 1988, one year after Percy.

There are however a few students whose year of sorting is unclear. Those that could have been in Percy's year include:

• Gemma Farley (Slytherin)

• Robert Hilliard (Ravenclaw)

• Gabriel Truman (Hufflepuff)

• Technically Scabior (Slytherin), although he was very likely older

• And my personal favorite: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Girl_whose_quill_was_taken_by_Cedric?mobile-app=false][Girl whose quill was taken by Cedric]], I'll be very upset if she doesn't end up being a main character in your story.

Is "Technically" this guy's first name, or have you been done over by autocorrect?

**** Haha no, Scabior has no first name (or maybe Scabior is his first name and he has no last name?).. either way I just mean technically Scabior would be eligible

** To add onto beliber's comment, someone made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7lq6dy/discussion_hogwarts_student_list_for_harrys_time/][list]] a while back the compiles all students across various HP media. It's 3 years old (so probably slightly outdated), but likely suits your needs.

According to this list, the students in Percy's year would be:

Gryffindor:

- Boys: Percy Weasley, Oliver Wood, Peter Jones
- Girls: Eleanor Birchgrove

Hufflepuff:

- Boys: Gabriel Truman, Robert Hawking, Eric Murley, Myrven Wynch, Luke Cholderton
- Girls: Not available

Ravenclaw:

- Boys: Robert Hilliard, Damian Perriss, Ryan Westrup
- Girls: Penelope Clearwater

Slytherin:

- Boys: Terrence Higgs, Bowen Duffield, Simon Dedworth, Gordon Pummell, Marcus Flint (JK Rowling retconed Marcus' start date to be 1987 in newer printings of PS)
- Girls: Gemma Farley
