Prior Incantato can be used to check the last spell used by a wand. However, is it possible to be get off scot-free for crimes like murder via non-magical means?

Let's say, someone - most likely a muggle-born - is especially skilled in covering up their tracks. They purchase a gun and use it to kill a wizard/witch, maybe with additional non-magical modifications (e.g. the bullet dissolves when it comes to contact with a reagent). Wizards/Witches don't have surveillance systems, and I don't think wards exist in canon like they do in fanon. Plus, let's say that this skilled witch/wizard somehow managed to bypass the magical security system. How would magical authorities search for any clues behind the murderer? For one, most witches and wizards are clueless about guns and a lot of the non-magical world, so they wouldn't know where to start looking.

They would definitely search for /magical/ evidence, but what magic do they have in forensics? If they find a sample of the murderer's hair - or rather the hair of the polyjuice disguise - does the hair return to its original form? Is there any forensic magic for fingerprints - if they even know about fingerprints? Or does an individual's magic have their own unique signature? As shown throughout canon, the legal and justice system in the Potterverse either makes little sense, is utterly corrupt, or both.


** Well, we're not shown much in the way of "magical forensics" anyway. I've always assumed they've used old fashioned detective work, not "murder solving magic".

*** Yes, but the Vanishing Spell does not undo the item being vanished. One example we have is a mouse that remains as a /wiggling/ tail after the spell was used on it. This indicates the spell has more to do with splinching than truly destroying an object, and items can be un-vanished.

It's probably safer just to transfigure the corpse into a piece of scrap paper and burn that.

**** There may be limits on how much you can transfigure a dead body, after all, Barty Crouch Jr turned his father's corpse into a bone and buried it, and Fang eventually dug it up.

***** That is not an entirely unreasonable assumption. Though, the example also indicates that wizards are mentally rather lazy. Even if magic were limited to turning corpses into bones and not easier to dispose of materials his reaction to having these bones was not to further crush them or to leave them where a lot of other bones are but to use the most traditional and conventional disposal method for a murder victim - a shallow grave in a garden for a dog to dig up. Can you imagine how much harder it would have been to figure the murder out even if only he had buried the bones in an actual graveyard?

** Well, if they find no magical trace, they might as well let the muggle police at it. But I generally assume that some way to detect traces exist - after all, Dumbledore reconstructed what had happened to the Potters.

** None at all, especially considering that you can make a body disappear completely with ease (transfigure into pebble and then dump in a river 500 miles away).

But if we are staying completely away from magic for the murder, there will be no evidence for magical authorities to find. A bullet alone does not betray the offender, and simply vanishing it afterwards takes care of any evidence they could find. Easy as pie.

** Canonically, it wouldn't. If we're just making stuff up though I bet they could jigger up magical targeting array for a pensive that shows the past of a location without having to use a memory.

** The only evidence of anything nefarious happening would be the disappearance of a person, if the culprit uses the full range of magic.

Then it's just a matter of good ol' investigative work. Motives, Alibis, possible suspects, witnesses,... and probably to look for the traces of magic. Impossible angles, unopened doors, a piece of carpet that is just a bit too clean, and so on and so forth.

The legal and justice system may be corrupt, but the executive branch probably works fine as long as a case isn't entangled with politics.
