Don't misunderstand. I don't mean she isn't intelligent. She is but a lot of fanfics gloss over the amount of work she actually puts into learning and doing her work. That and the fact that is surrounded by people who aren't that academically inclined. And the whole “brightest witch of our age” crap makes no sense has she done made some amazing discovery or innovation that we are unaware of to deserve that title? Or was there a census where they measured everyone's iq and then bestowed that title on her?


** That's probably because the actual quote is "You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione," and Hermione immediately says that she isn't.

Lupin is saying that she's the smartest 13/14 year old he's ever met. It's a compliment, sure, but it's hardly a title she can wear for the rest of her life, and she never tries.

**** Yes, Lupin is impressed that Hermione picked up on Snape heavily hinting that he was a werewolf. In total fairness to Hermione, nobody else figured it out, including the Marauders (until Lupin told them) or Snape as a child (until he saw Lupin transform at the Shrieking Shack), so she actually is smarter than a large number of characters. On the other hand, we have no idea how many people figured it out and just stayed quiet.

******* Snape does appear to believe that Lupin is a werewolf, even before he finds out for sure.

Lily says that "[she] knows his theory," which suggests that Snape had mentioned it before.

Given that Lily says she also knows that James saved Snape from whatever is really in the tunnel beneath the Willow, Snape was still harping about it after being sworn to secrecy by Dumbledore.

As for Lily herself, I'm inclined to believe she knew, or at least privately agreed with Snape, but had the common, or perhaps uncommon, decency not to mention it.

Throw in some random cases in which the illness act-up with some potions and put some extra nights without being in a full-moon night and he gets a petty solid excuse. Using the whole sick family member, while a classic, would fall petty fast.

** Yeah, I agree. I mean, I like Hermione, she's one of my favourite characters, but the "brightest witch of our age" seems a little too unearned. Most of the time, Hermione just recited answers from the books, word for word just like Snape pointed out in HBP.

Now compare her to Sirius, James or Snape. The Marauders made a map of Hogwarts that shows everyone and where they are, and it still works properly years later. Sirius and James made two-way mirrors so they could talk to each other during detention. They became animagus at 15, and Snape created his own spells.

Hermione doesn't really have anything like this to show her talent and skill except that she knows the answer to every question. Most of the time, she's the first one to do a spell properly but still, compared to other characters we know from canon she looks rather weak.

Either that, or i'd take a Diffindo to it at the length i'd asked for and then mark it as if that was what she handed in (Which also would likely end up as a super poor grade, as it would likely be missing a lot of key points)

Either way, she'd probably be failing my class.

***** (This is a long one)

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). And these communities on FFN have some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Hermione-Bashing/123454/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/]]) has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to her about her long essays. Hermione ignores her.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. Its more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical.

***** Not so much in the modern world, when everything is done on computers, and they tell you the font to use, font size, and margins. That pretty much levels the playing field.

That said, I've always thought "feet of parchment" was a ridiculous metric to use. They make it sound like a foot of parchment is so terrible, but it's just a single page.

For me, the worst part about parchment would be the lack of lines. My writing slopes badly if I don't have lines.

***** It's lazy, but it achieves two results, in a system where word count isn:t practical due to people not wanting to count words on a page, when they can just take a ruler to the damn thing.

The first thing it achieves, is letting students who struggle to fill the space know that they're missing something. There are obviously exceptions for students that can be concise, and points lost for a too short essay should be marked down on the basis of kissing information, not a failure to fill the space. If they've managed to get the correct information across in half the space, either because of neater than average handwriting or concise covering of the salient points, they shouldn't be penalised for such.

On the other end of the spectrum, it helps students like hermione, by forcing them to learn to summarise, rather than just regurgitate the textbook,mor worse, everything they've ever read on the subject. As it dosen't show that they've understood the subject, but rather that they've memorised the textbooks.

That said, the students on the longer end of the spectrum, if questioning about their poor grades, should be reminded that as the teacher you know the topic, and are instead asking them to write a short summary that shows that they understand the topic. Because students like that often need a reason they can understand, and would struggle to accept “because i only have so many hours in a week to read essays”

*** And Hermione brewed a potion that is difficult by Newt standards and created a functioning messaging equipment. She did both those things with little to no help. And marauders had James, Sirius and Lupin, all of whom are considered very skillful wizards, with James being an 'effortless prodigy' (not exactly in those words) as McGonagal puts it. Marauders had all the time in the world to invest in projects they wanted to work on. Hermione was always in the thick of a war that she and her two friends practically ended single-handedly.

I'm not saying that she deserves the title mentioned above, but you have to give credit where credit is due.

Besides, Hermione's own achievements aren't that incomparable to the generation before, are they? Pointedly, Hermione does overcome Snape's potions riddle in Stone. Additionally, she brews poly juice potions at 12, figures out its a basilisk in the chamber and that lupin's a werewolf before anyone, and is essentially the inspiration behind DA! The list goes on and on, but it is evident that Hermione's talent is arguable w that of Sirius, James, and Snape, even if she might not have the physical tallies to to signify it.

** Don't flame, but Snape is more of a genius than Hermione is imo because Snape has rewritten an entire published /and/ verified textbook at the ripe old age of 16 that has been used by many older and more accomplished witches and wizards. He's also made his own curses and counter-curses. You need to possess a creative mind in order to accomplish these things, and though Hermione was very clever, she wasn't as creative. The people with creative minds are usually the ones who are the geniuses.

The Marauders are also geniuses because they created a map which can track everyone's movements in Hogwarts, and they also became Animagi at the age of fifteen.

Hermione, on the other hand, just regurgitates information (like Snape points out) and just has an excellent memory. Even though she may be very clever, she hasn't done anything that merits the title “Genius.”

Frankly, if Hermione were a student of mine, I'd have a talk with her to point out that simply regurgitating information isn't enough and that she has to actually be able to /apply/ the information she's learned to different situations. Unfortunately, Hermione doesn't really think outside of the box, which is the first trait geniuses have. Snape and the Marauders, on the other hand, /have/ thought outside of the box, which helps them do things that merit the title of “Genius.”

Hermione is a very good student, but she's the type who reads ahead and is few years ahead of her sort, not some otherworldly prodigy like Dumbledore or Tom Riddle. Then there's her mind, which limits her magic because she refuses to consider the possibility of a lot of things which don't have a sound proof; she looks for instructions for every act rather than applying her own mind, meaning she has little to no creativity and originality.

Not just Dumbledore but many others outclass her - Snape (spell creation and altered Potions recipes), McGonagall (prodigy in Transfiguration - won an award, became an Animagus at 17), James and Sirius (got Outstandings with ease, became Animagus at 15, created an incredible tracking map).

** It's dumb because Ron is so intelligent but he's brushed off as the idiot. To play and win a game of chess at 11 years old against pieces who were essentially a computer player on extreme mode is incredible. Do you think Hermione could have done that? No! Ron has the brains for strategy, decision making, and general intelligence, but after book 1 he was always the idiot sidekick friend. Not saying Hermione isn't book smart, and there's definitely times where what she's read has helped them out, just saying that Ron is intelligent too and it's so overlooked.

There must be a /reason/ for her to be a genius. A payoff, if you will. And since she is a main character and that would be one of her core traits, multiple payoffs. There need to be multiple plot points where a literal genius is /needed/ to progress through the plot. And that's not exactly easy to do, seeing as we don't really have any examples of what a genius witch student should be able to do.

The most genius characters on the books, that Remus knew, in my perspective, are: Albus Dumbledore (dragon blood, awesome OWL/NEWTS) → Snape (Half Blood Prince book, potions modifications, creation of curses as Sectumsempra and charms as Muffliato) → Marauders (Marauder's map, animagus at school, call mirrors).

(Tom Riddle, horcrux creation at sixteen, and memory modification at sixteen, would be on that list, but Remus doesn't know him).

The point is... all of them are men, not women. Maybe Remus doesn't know too many witches, but the acomplishment of witches are not shown to us in the books.

For exampke, she was able to brew a polyjuice potion at age 12, she figured out that Slytherin's monster was the basilisk and hiding in the pipes and that people were petrified rather than killed because they looked at it indirectly. She figured out that Rita Skeeter was an animagus, she got all Os on her owls which was a big deal, could perform 7th year spells as a 5th year and knew them well enough to teach to others, she duelled Bellatrix, Voldemort's most powerful follower, as a 17-year-old.

** I dunno - it depends on what you class as intelligence.

An argument can be made that intelligence is knowing a lot about a lot of subjects.

In that case - Hermione is certainly very intelligent. She has an appoximate/good knowledge about many things.

Some people think that intelligence is knowing the most about a particular subject. Hermione hasn't proved to be in this category at all. She's not the best at any particular subject in Hogwarts.

She's very well read, which means she knows a lot about a lot of things.

As a 11-15 year old thats (in my opinion) a pretty good indication of intelligence, but its not necessarily going to carry over to her adult life.

She seems to remember a lot of information after only a single reading, which further bolsters her claim on being intelligent.

Her memory is very good, and she can always remember a lot of information that she's (probably) only read once, which is another sign of intelligence.

I think if you met her as an adult she'd be one of those people who would be very good at whatever she turned her hand too, but if you were an expert in a particular field she would know more than the average person, but not as much as you.

** I get that a lot of people are tired of Hermione as a character because of general fanfiction tendencies to over or under-exaggerate her abilities, but she's definitely a genius. What's she done to merit being called the brightest witch of her age? I mean, if we looked at canon from a non-narrative perspective, the things she's done along with Harry and Ron are pretty genuinely brilliant. I mean, they successfully won a war alone. Of course you can disbelieve on the basis of plot requirements, but otherwise her intelligence isn't super up for debate. If you were just talking about being tired of the exaggeration in fanfic, I can get behind that - but not so much the rest.

Compare to the most brilliant minds of today - maybe one of the best examples is the chief justice of the US Supreme Court, John Roberts. If you read about him, you'll find that from an academic standpoint he was pretty much unparalleled and universally considered more knowledgeable than his professors. Something he said struck me as rather profound, though: he mentioned lamenting being born in the wrong era, that all the great decisions have been made. In essence, I kind of feel that results-based analysis for intelligence just doesn't really work anymore - there's less totally unique innovation than building on the backs of collective knowledge these days, you feel?

I mean, this is true up to the age of about sixteen. But to do any further study, especially at university level, you have to be able to analyse the information not just repeat it. Not just know the what, but understand the how and the why.

Hermione's failure to do this when younger has a massive lampshade hung on it by Snape every time he picks on her for regurgitating the textbook word for word. Now, we don't see Hermione's study abilities beyond the age of 16/17. But her actions in HPB of absolute refusal to accept that any source other than the official textbook could have worthwhile, useful, or even correct, information in it says to me that she never develops true academic reasoning skills. If she truly understood potions, she would have been able to reason /why/ crushing the bean would be better than cutting it, because she would have understood the principles behind the creation and development of that potion. Like how in the Muggle world to do chemistry at a higher level (A level and beyond) you need to understand not just which substances react, but how and why they do so and what variables can affect that reaction.

Basically, yes I agree Hermione isn't the smartest witch of her age. She's incredibly well read and she's clearly smart and logical. But ultimately she's a jack of all trades and a master of none. Snape at 16 was far smarter than Hermione. As were the Marauders. We never see her create or improve anything, or question beyond the textbook. Her skill isn't /academics./ Her skill is remembering what she's read and repeating it at the opportune moment.

*** First off canon Ron does not apply himself so it would be interesting to see what could have happened if he had. His personality/work ethic in the books drastically disagree with his grades. Eg JKR wrote Ron to be academically the worst of the three in terms of classroom performance and homework basically making him look lazy and stupid but then suddenly all of his "performance" issues disappear and he does well with his O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s, which is not very believable.

In terms of chess, trying to make Ron be a fantastic strategist (for fighting deatheaters etc,) because he is good at chess is ridiculous as chess is a very structured, rule oriented game where the pieces have a finite number of ways they can move, and war/fighting really has no rules. It's not for nothing that the saying "no battle plan survives contact with the enemy" exists. Ron may be an expert at devising a strategy in chess where his opponent can only chose to move in very well known restricted patterns. But that "talent" does not lend itself to the fluidiness of a battlefield.

Ron might be a chess prodigy but that truly is the extent of his "gifts". And does nothing to suggest he is strategically gifted. Based on what i saw in canon Hermione is the smartest (academically) of the trio, Harry is the next smartest but is the best in the practical application of magic, and Ron is just the friend they have to drag along. Eg he is third in academics and third in practical application of magic.

I would agree that Hermione is very driven and works hard for her grades. Even though I like her alot, I'm not sure I would call her a genius though (in my mind I would think a genius would not have to work quite that hard to achieve those marks).

I do see her as the "smartest witch in her generation" but I take that to mean that she is setting all kinds of academic records that no one else is even close to.

*** She seems to have an almost, or actual eidetic memory for things she has read, if not heard. Not quite photographic, but with magic who knows.

** You're forgetting she made the Polyjuice potion, a potion that is so complex that even 7th years have to read it from the restricted section. Hermione may not be a complete genius but she was certainly ahead of many of her seniors

Me too, unless she has great abilities at connecting the points, has Holmes ability at pissing off people, and smokes three packets of Winchester every day, otherwise she's a THOT.

** Why is Hermione being bashed her so much if OTHERS call her the brightest witch of her age? Did she herself ask for such a title? Does she go around flaunting it? Her learning methods may be flawed...but why is she being bashed so much here? Did she kill a rabbit or something?

What is her biggest fear? Failure. Let that sink in...this is something none of us experience. It is because we have never thrown ourselves in genuinely alien and discomforting situations. A muggleborn witch being part of a magical environment, and many feel she shouldn't even be there thanks to her blood status...🤷🤷🤷

Considering all of you have such varied perspectives of what constitutes a "genius", let us look at the other side.

How would you define a "failure"? And would you regard Hermione as a "failure" just because she regurgitates word for word??

Would Harry and Ron have managed on their own without Hermione? If yes, then blame both the boys for being plain lazy...how dare they seek the help of a needless annoying muggleborn, who knows nothing more than regurgitating answers? Why didn't both boys ever do research on their own even once?

Or is everyone just venting out their frustration towards book Hermione simply because movie Hermione and even some fanfics regard her as a Mary Sue?🤦🤦🤦

The last time I checked, this was the HP FANFICTION sub-reddit...why is book Hermione being bashed so much here??! I am genuinely confused now.

*** THIS ISN'T BASHING, this is challenging the way she's written in fanon because she is a real flawed character in cannon, just as much as any of the Golden trio. No-one is making the argument that she's a failure, just that she's not a Dumbledore / marauders/ snape level genius. "would harry and Ron have managed with out hermoine", you're responding to a strawman here, nobody's saying Ron and Harry would've (and even so that wouldn't be a crappy rebuttal) done the same or better without Hermoine. Why are you attached to this character,to the point that saying she isn't a genius to the level of Albus Dumbledore is bashing?

Hermione wasn't registered for Divination or Muggle Studies, and she got an EE in Defense.
