I never really got the point of them. Yes there are a couple that do actually try to explore how the plot and character dynamics would have changed if Harry were a different gender (for example: how his relationship with Snape of the Dursleys would differ), but I find most of them don't try to do that all that much. It leads me to seeing them more as a cheap way for a female author to live their self-insert fantasy. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, what are your thoughts?


** I like seeing women being badasses, which is why I enjoy reading them. I think that's it, really. I dislike seeing fem!Harry used as an excuse to pair her with Draco, Snape, or Voldemort though. I get people changing the gender to avoid writing slash, but for once, I'd like to read a good fem!Harry/Ron.

Some authors do use it as a self-insert fantasy. Some, I imagine, do it because it's easier for them to write from a female perspective. Some do it to avoid writing slash. Some do it for sex scenes. Some do it as a way of tossing Harry's personality out the window. Some do it for my reason for reading them, to see a girl be a tough, defiant little shit.

** This year marked my first foray into the world of Fem! Harry fics.

I have only read a few, and those seemed pretty decent to me.

Personally, I dislike how the majority seem to name the character Harriet. This is followed by shortening the name to Harry, or the ever irritating, Harri. I can understand why this choice is made, but I still do not really like it all that much.

I am of the personal belief that if you are going to change something as drastic as gender, you should go all out. If I wanted to read a canon rehash, I have so very many to choose from already. I just mean that Fem Harry stories tend not to do anything at all with the change.

Some people have a problem with how OC Fem Harry can be, but I usually do not mind all that much.

The couple like the most are 'The Pureblood Pretense", and "The Long Game".

They both offered a fresh take on something I had not quite read before. The long game in particular was quite refreshing, Charissa is a fantastic name for fem! Harry in my opinion. Some people have problems with the use of Eth and Thorn, but I really like languages and it is a neat bit of world building personally. The fic does change a hell of a lot, but that is really what I want to see in fanfiction. Canon is already there, I want to see someone create something crazy awesome with the established characters.

Now, nothing wrong with Canon rewrites. I am certainly not saying they are awful and people should stop writing them. I have just read so many over the years that it is nice to see something else every now and then.

*** Have you read Yule Ball Panic and its sequels? Has Jasmine as Harry's name. The plot moves slowly in the sequels though.

Or, if you like the whole over the top OP!Harry crackfic thing there's "The silent world of Cassandra Evans", which is my all-time favourite crackfic.

***** Another story you might like is Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, which has Harry thrown into an alternative universe where the Potters lived and he gets turned into a girl. The first 4 Chapters are heavy on the bashing (Dumbledore, Sirius and slight James and Lily) but afterwards, it is a pretty sweet Harry/Tonks story with Harry/Jamie adopting Sally-Ann Perks and running tea parties.

***** The sentence structure does not change much but once there's more dialogue (chapter 8 onwards) it is easier to read and also takes a turn towards more humour. Years 3 and 4 are perhaps the best example of an OP Harry who doesn't give a shit about social expectations while still being caring towards those who are close to him/her and how Harry Potter comedy is supposed to be. There's a manipulative Dumbledore, Harry is shunned by Hogwarts, she has been massively abused and yet the entire fic is hilarious.

*** Yeah, I always thought if Harry was female, they'd go with the flower theme of Lily's family. In terms of going all out, I think there's a careful balance which I find authors often fail at. The character ends up either being a practically canon copy or a completely different character that could not possibly have had the same upbringing.

** I want to like Fem!Harry, but it's hard for me to get into it. I like the potential of exploring how canon would be different if Harry were female. However, I seem to find Fem!Harry fics that are basically just canon rehash fics where Harry happens to be female. I also find a lot of Fem!Harry/Voldemort or Snape or Draco (because the only thing keeping Harry from falling for one of those three is the fact that they were both dudes) or other cross gen romances. Other fics seem like the could be good if they weren't crossovers which defeats the purpose of why I read Fem!Harry. So I haven't really read a lot of Fem!Harry because I just have trouble finding one I'm interested in. Wow, that turned into a bit of a rant, sorry.

Anyway the one's I've found I do like so far are Victoria Potter by Taure and Iris Potter and the Goblet's surprise by Autumn Souls, because they both have Fem!Harry with her own distinct personalities and I can already see some important differences from canon.

I'm waiting on reading Victoria Potter until there is more of it, as Taure isn't exactly known for finishing stuff. Which is fine as we aren't paying him(her? not actually sure), but I don't personally want to get invested in the story and then not have any resolution.

** Being a woman, it's easier for me to connect with a girl than with a boy, so I can enjoy them if they are written for the comedy factor (because, you know, comedy), for character development (because a well-written coming-of-age story is a tasty treat), or as an AU thing where the change actually has realistic consequences and is well-thought-out (because ... should be obvious why). Well, that or if the author is capable of putting together a good enough “well, you see, the character was actually trans” thing, but if they're good enough then they're likely both AU and coming-of-age stories so ... well, that.

But no, if you give me a fic in which Harry was changed into a girl just to get romance with someone, I won't read it (I'd rather read honest slash, given that it was written well, than read something in which Harry is changed into a girl because and just because the author wants to pair him with a boy), and likewise with fics the authors of which half-ass it (i.e. the change is only an excuse for some other changes, which are neither necessary nor actually require the gender/sex/whatever change to exist nor actually make sense most of the time---like the thing with Snape suddenly liking Harry because he's now a girl and looks like Lily ... like, the fjord, that's not at all related to why Snape hates Harry and it wouldn't change much it anything on that front) because half-assed settings and plots are just painful to wade through.

** Several of my favorite fics are this so I am perfectly ok with them. Sure the character is usually basically an OC, but that doesn't bother me, its still interesting to read the HP events and world from the perspective of a new character imo. Also if an author is more comfortable writing a female character, which I assume is often the reason for it, then that seems like a valid reason to me. I like self inserts stories too though, so if you hate those I guess these also wouldn't be your cup of tea.

Anyway the specific ones I really like if you are interested are Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus (plus all the spinoffs), and The Pureblood Pretense. Both of which have radically different Harry's from canon, but both of which are also very AU in general, so I don't see why it would expected for Harry to be the same.

** I like them since they spice things up a little. Considering that I only read fem!Harry fics if they are femslash (the MC pining after some dude and describing how "hot" he is really not my cup of tea) they are really not that different, just with different tropes. I mean, stupid names happen, but Haradian is really not better than Harriet so they are really everywhere. But in most cases the atrocious "I will not be controlled" speech is replaced with some ass-kicking so that's a win in my books. And the majority of them have some sort of struggle between social expectations and Harry's wishes that is not resolved by Harry being completely OOC and acquiring a Harem. Harry might not give a fuck but at least he/she does it in style.

I never really noticed the self-insert aspect but maybe because I avoid the fem!Harry/Slytherins by default.

Never got the "Fem!Harry because I want to ship him/her with some guy, oh and with a 95% probability it is a bad crossover" type of fics. But then again, with the exceptions of "Blue Magic", "Harry Potter: Geth", "Ex Astris Gloria" and "I still haven't found what I am looking for" I have not found many decent crossovers in the first place. "Is your great-aunt an AI?" was nice but the sequel fell off somewhat and "A witch and an Amazon walk into a bar" was nice until the "I will not kill war criminals" became attitude offputting.

I couldn't see canon Harry in A Black Comedy eventually develop that personality ever, but I'm still perfectly fine that we got that kinda Harry.

**** That said (because I do agree with what you wrote), I will note that comedies do get a bit of leeway in the character accuracy department. And as far as I see it it seems that most stories in which the gender or sex (whatever, I know there's a distinction but when it refers to stories it seems interchangeable anyway) of a character is changed do it for the sake of (often poor in quality) romance, and romance is not comedy so ... that.

I mean, if the fic you mentioned focused on romance, most of us wouldn't be able to get through it because of how changed Harry is even if the story happened to be good. But it focuses on comedy, so all is fine in our kingdom instead.
