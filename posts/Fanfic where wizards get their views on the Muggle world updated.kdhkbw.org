** Linkffn(Exile by bennybear) Draco spends some time living muggle. He slowly adjusts to it.

Linkffn(Coven by Naidhe) Only a short section in the fic, but Pansy's description of escalators is adorable:

#+begin_quote
  Pansy's gaze went up and up and up, following the people that stood still and yet moved. They approached, fast paced, and her confusion grew. What was that contraption? Stairs were materializing underneath people's feet, and then went upwards. It was the exact opposite of Hogwarts. The direction was fixed and the steps moved you up. It was... It was way fucking more practical!
#+end_quote

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) Voldemort decides to gain power more politically by influencing the Ministry. Discrimination against muggleborns becomes worse with disturbing parallels to 1930s Germany. Hermione and a few other muggleborns decide to demonstrate what muggle chemistry can do, by casting a lot of duplication spells on plastic explosives and brute forcing through the wards on ancient pureblood owned manors.

Linkao3(Super Bowl Breach) Super long fic about a secrecy collapse. Wizards and muggles learn to live together. Voldemort gets his hands on nukes. Things go way out of hand.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle) Starts as a muggle AU where Harry and Ron are police officers, then turns into an epic dimension travel story, featuring technology and magic combined. Sirius really wants a flying invisible tank.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
