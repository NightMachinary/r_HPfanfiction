I'm looking for any fics where Voldemort returns again after Harry supposedly defeats him a second time at the Battle of Hogwarts. Maybe Voldemort found another way to cheat death or he had another Hocrux no one knew about

Although the Trio managed to seal away Voldemort Prime, this soul piece merged with the spirit of the sunken Bismarck, and came back with vastly new powers. Fortunately, HMS Hood was recalled to fight her once again. It's one most unlikely crossover, but it works well!

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
