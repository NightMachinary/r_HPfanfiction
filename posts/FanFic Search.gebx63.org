I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry is put into his father's body the day James would hang Snape upside down.

From what I remember he says no. He and Sirius are mad at eachother. Harry apologises and befriends Snape, still in his fathers body. The last bit I can remember is Snape and Harry in a friendly-ish duel and snape cast secumseptra. Snape expects it do make a bunch of small irritating cuts, but instead it cuts Harry open and he was bleeding. heavily. Yeah my summary skills suck.
