So is there any stories where douchbag harry gets verbally or physically smacked down? I have been trying to find good superHarry fics lately but it all seems to be him being a raging douche every time he gets a little power and i am sick of it.


** I think it's hard for people to write a main character that isn't either a complete douchebag or completely spineless. Also, most people that are writing super!Harrys are doing so for wish fulfillment purposes -- and having Harry get the smackdown doesn't jive with that.

** Because power obviously makes you an asshole. Just look at Dumbledore, strutting around and showing he's better than everyone. Gosh, what an ass

***** It was power. Dumbledore himself admitted it in DH. That was the reason he never ran for Minister of Magic -- he never trusted himself with power again.

******* Don't forget Supreme Mugawump, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Leader of the Order of the Phoenix, and master of the Elder Wand. I reckon he doesn't trust himself, but he doesn't trust other people /more/.

******** And yet none of those positions hold nearly as much power as the position of Minister. The minister removed him from the Wizengamot and the post of Headmaster in OoTP. The ministry could influence public opinion by putting pressure on the prophet, not Dumbledore. Dumbledore has influence, yes, but nowhere near the kind of free power he could have as the Minister of Magic.

  Rufus doesn't know why Harry Potter thinks him such a villain, but he certainly does not appreciate the churlish attitude. Canon scene from a different POV

** I think that the reason that a strong Harry quickly becomes unlikeable is because, when readers write about a powerful protagonist, they want to see him triumph over his enemies. There is a modicum of author surrogacy in this; it is extremely cathartic to see Harry attack Dumbledore/Snape/the Weasleys/the Dursleys/Voldemort etc. etc. because that is what we always want him to do.

However, we, bold denizens of the Harry Potter Fanfiction Subreddit that we are, have become inured to these cases of character bashing; we no longer become filled with glee when powerful!Harry stands up in the Great Hall and starts shouting at all the teachers and, generally, being a douchebag. Perhaps, in our earlier, more innocent days, we did- I know that I, for example, once actually enjoyed reading robst. I know, I know. I shudder at my juvenile behaviour. We look at authors who use Harry as nothing more than a mouthpiece to spout their opinions of characters and despair, knowing that the protagonist in the story is becoming more and more unpleasant with every invocation of "Bumblemore" or "Dumbledork".

TL;DR: Strong!Harry is a douchebag because the people who write Strong!Harry stories are douchebags.
