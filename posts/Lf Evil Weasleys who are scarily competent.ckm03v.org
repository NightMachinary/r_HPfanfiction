*** No,fuck that trope. I want them to be villains who are actually major threats

Bill raised from birth to be an elite assassin for Dumbledore and the Order

Charlie having an mental link with dragons and using them to raze his enemies

Fred and George being disturbed on a level of Hansel and Gretel from Black Lagoon

Ron having no human emotions and seeing the people around him as disposable pawns. A master manipulator as well

Ginny inventing dozens of dark hexes using Luna as a test dummy

****** I was rolling with the prompt, In an alt universe where the weasleys are bad guys

percy would become the person who is torn between family and the law

Only in this universe choosing the law would be the right answer

******* its cool I had written a really good response

I was rolling with the prompt, In an alt universe where the weasleys are bad guys

percy would become the person who is torn between family and the law

Only in this universe choosing the law would be the right answer

which is rather ironic, so Percy chosing his family would be the dark moment in the story

Or him chosing the law could be the heroic one

** Sadly abandoned, but the Weasleys are scary. Fred and George are the Order's top-ranking torturers. Everything's topsy-turvy.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
