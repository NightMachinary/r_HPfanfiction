:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember this fic where harry comes into his creature inheritance in where he is a demon, angel, elf and vampire. He can't die which he finds out during the time he went into the founder's time. He's also a vigilante I think. Also there was this snake who gave harry some scales that would help Frank and alice. He also gave the weasley's the family clock.


** Sounds like Linkffn(Basilisk Born) in many ways that you described. I think that's the one you're looking for? If not it's extremely similar.

*** Kind of close but that's not it I'm basilisk born harry is travels in time to where Merlin was and has to go through the entire timeline. But in the one I'm thinking of he only goes back in time to the founders until he travels back to his own timeline. Also in the one I'm thinking about harry and draco polyjuice themselves as ron and Hermione during their trial. Also grindelwald is pretending to be Dumbledore while the real Dumbledore is in prison. The elves had placed fawkes with grindelwald to keep an eye on him. But thanks anyway.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
