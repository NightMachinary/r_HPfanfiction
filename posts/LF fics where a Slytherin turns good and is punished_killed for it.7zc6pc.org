Looking for something where a Slytherin student or even a young death eater turns good or does something to help the order (Rescuing prisoners or something like that) and this leads to them being punished/tortured/killed by Voldemort or death eaters, could also feature the Order trying to help this person. Anyone know any fics like this?


** That happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things,]] as well as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past.]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]

*** Regarding Nightmares of Futures Past; the Slytherin in question is [[/s][Melissa Bulstrode; she's first introduced being used to revenge-prank Fred & George on Valentine's Day,]] as I recall.

Later, in chapter 28 (near the end of year 2), [[/s][Harry gets a note from Melissa warning him about the ambush the Slytherin Quidditch team was planning against him and his friends.]]

Then, in chapter 34 (during the Quidditch match interrupted by dementors), [[/s][Melissa is assassinated by someone unknown in the Slytherin part of the Quidditch stands; over the next few chapters, when the investigation into her death is impeded due to the remaining Bulstrodes being threatened by the other pureblood families, Harry arranges for her younger sister, Millicent Bulstrode, to be offered a scholarship to Beauxbatons to get her away from danger.]]

I hope those spoiler tags work.

*** I find it interesting that all three fics have the H/G pairing.

**** Is it? I think it's more indicative that that's what I prefer to read and so that's what I know off the top of my head.

** This is a oneshot with alternative endings that I wrote! It's not long, but fits the bill almost to a tee. Involves Draco, Hermione and Luna.

  In the bleakness of the Malfoy dungeons, Hermione and Luna's only chance for survival is a small ferret. But will he save them and, if so, at what cost? A sad story with alternate endings.
