Like Aberforth broke his Brother's nose. Edit: clarified object of nose breaking.


** I keep reading this prompt as Harry breaking his own nose, and I can't quite picture it clearly. “So,” said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him,“so does that mean that... that one of us has got to kill the other one... in the end?” “Yes,” said Dumbledore.For a long time, neither of them spoke. Then Harry pitched forward and slammed his face against Dumbledore's desk, crying out with a wordless bellow. Harry's nose crumpled inward and blood started streaming down his face as Dumbledore looked on in alarm.

*** Like you, I thought OP was asking for something where Harry would break his own nose and I was thinking, "Why would he do that?" After reading your comment, I realized that the OP probably meant Harry breaking Dumbledore's nose.

*** I have been a mess of tears all day. I've been laughing at this for on and off about 20 minutes.

**** It's pretty funny to imagine. I just enjoy canon Harry's sass, I just wish he wasn't a lazy idiot.
