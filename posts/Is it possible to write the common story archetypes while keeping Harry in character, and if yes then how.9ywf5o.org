In the dark Harry/Hermione thread [[/u/inquisitorcoc]] pointed out that in most stories Harry (and by extension most characters) are OCs with canon names. That got me thinking if it is at all possible to write a somewhat canon compliant characterisation of Harry (and friends) in the popular archetypes. So is it possible to write a "true to character" version of, for example:

- Indy!Harry/Lord Potter

- Marriage Laws (especially of the pureblood/muggleborn or half-blood variety)

- Harems (or at least polyamory)

- Fix-it timetravel (do-over of Harry's Hogwarts time)

- Time travel to the 70s (be it the political Black-family stuff, Marauder wank or Snape revisionism)

And if yes, how? Feel free to mention any other common concept you can think of.

#+end_quote

I think it is possible. Harry is canonically a rather independent thinking character, and not the blind Dumbledore follower people somehow think he is. He very much questions Dumbledore about his trust for Snape, about leaving him in the dark during OOTP, and about doing nothing about Draco during HBP.

#+begin_quote
  Marriage Laws (especially of the pureblood/muggleborn or half-blood variety)
#+end_quote

No, definitely not. Marriage laws are a ridiculous plot device which, if taken seriously, would result in a horrific dystopia, and Harry and friends fight those kinds of things canonically.

#+begin_quote
  Harems (or at least polyamory)
#+end_quote

I don't think so. Harry doesn't strike me as someone who is particularly adventurous in romantic and sexual relations. Of course, you could change this aspect about his personality and still keep him canon Harry otherwise, which would make a polyamorous relationship possible. Harems are ridiculous wish fulfilment for horny guys.

#+begin_quote
  Fix-it timetravel (do-over of Harry's Hogwarts time)
#+end_quote

Sure, why not?

#+begin_quote
  Time travel to the 70s (be it the political Black-family stuff, Marauder wank or Snape revisionism)
#+end_quote

Sure, why not? The challenge there is rather giving Snape, Lily and the Marauders well-rounded characterizations and to take into account that they're not yet the people they grew up to be.

But he did also forget the "ten dark years" admission a few days later. He never really did anything about Malfoy either (arrange a PR meeting with the Minister in exchange of arresting Malfoy and leaving him alone with Moody for a few hours).

as sfu69 pointed out, we have almost nothing on adult Harry and I really doubt that an adult could fit in with 11-year-old children without going mad. It would certainly not be the average "Harry befriends Ron and Hermione again" thing.

If he did something like that, he wouldn't be canon Harry. Someone else would have to take the initiative to plan that and try to get him to do it.

I think it's absolutely possible. Harry would just be like every clueless shy, modest anime dude with a harem of impossible girls competing over him. It's the personalities of the /girls/ that would have to change if you want to keep Harry in character.

** You can definitely write a compelling canon Harry that turns towards a darker path. "Sum of their Parts" did it pretty well, but even during the Hogwarts years you can imagine ways in which the golden trio could have thrown some moral considerations out the window:

What if Ron had died? Or if Luna or Hermione had been raped and tortured to death. What if Voldemort had captured the Wesleys and sent Harry their bodies one limb at a time via owl?

A terrible war can bring out the worst in people. 99.9% of Dark!Harry fics just do it in a cartoonish villainly evil kind of way, where characters turn Dark for the sake of being edgy /dark/ and have ridiculous conversations about how dark they want to be, sometimes monologuing about their new evil ways.

*** Don't forget the inevitable bashing. I can see how Molly "let's imply a fifteen year old girl is a slut" Weasley would oppose any radical change Harry makes, but Hermione? Canon's most ruthless non-war criminal?

It would certainly be possible for canon Harry to turn "dark", but it would be ruthless vigilantism, not mass murder.

*** Haha, but true. Harry is nosy, but not subtle or astute enough to figure out mysteries until 'gasp' it's the final few chapters and he either takes a massive leap of logic or the answers are fed to him.

If you keep Harry's character the same but change how other characters act (Figg reports abuse, Dumbles actually intervenes, Hermione reports abuse to parents and they intervene, Pomfrey/McGonagall notice abuse, etc.) that would still change Harry because we are a product of our environment/experiences.

*** You could do time travel to the 70s and keep him in character, provided it's a 'weird time accident plot device' as opposed to a deliberate attempt to fix things you can just dump canon Harry there and make sure he stays in character.\\
Time travel to the 70s can easily just be dumping a canon character as is into a new scenario.

** Yes. The Lord Potter stuff can just be written exactly as how politics works IRL - very slow going, dragging and with elements and plot-devices that otherwise make for boring reading. Canon HP would get ripped apart in a political front.

Marriage laws, no. Never had those in history - but maybe you could incorporate depopulation into the fic, and make it severe depopulation (as in wizardkind itself is dying out), but this is still unrealistic because different societies in the world have different rates of fertility, and the same problems wouldn't affect two different regions.

Harems, no. HP isn't a Muslim sultan to get away with those.

Fix-it TT, yes. Just throw enough monkey wrenches in the grand plan to save the universe, that's all. Same goes for travelling to the 70s, although I hate Snape. There was one Harry/Daphne story where an older HP and DG travel back and ensure that their younger selves found their way to each other, although I can't recall the name of the fic now.

Apart from the laws culminating in the Lex Papia Poppaea of the early Roman Empire to name the example I know off hand. Albeit that those laws didn't go nearly as far as you see happening in fanfics - disqualifications for public office, extra taxes and restrictions on inheritance for the unmarried and/or childless over 25 - were massively unpopular, dodged around by all manner of legal devices and largely irrelevant to anyone below the upper crust of roman society.

**** Those aren't the marriage laws fanfiction uses. "We have to marry so we get a tax break/so I can get promoted" doesn't work to force two people who hate each other together "so they can discover that they love each other". The "forced to marry someone they'd never, ever, pick if they had a choice" is the entire point of the fanfiction marriage law trope.

** I find it quite hard as someone who is not Rowling to write a character she has created and defined. We can certainly attempt to imitate her work, but we never will reach the original. - Is it so bad if the character grows with its challenges and developes other or new characteristical traits? - At least if the character is challenged we can allow for leeway in his subsequent behavior. -Which means, a Harry that really has to think, has to use his barely used brain instead of relying on luck and happenstance [...], - a Harry that grows and follows logos and ethos rather than pathos, - he could understandibly be someone who will do anything to survive rathern than accept his fate and do as he is told. - Because I find it doubtful that someone of the calibre of Harry Potter would willfully accept a law that would disallow him a choice. Because I cannot see a Harry that would create a harem.

Does that make sense?

*** I am by no means opposed to character grow, but there is a difference between a gradual charge with some form of cause and Harry waking up and deciding that it'd be sweet to bang 58 bitches that day.

I can see Harry growing into a bitter "only a dead Slytherin is a good Slytherin" type of person if the war dragged on for a few years. But him reducing Hermione to tears because she "dared" to talk back?

  Harem
#+end_quote

Definitely not as done in fanfics. But eventually end up in a m/f/f/f relationship? Unlikely for sure, but would it really be impossible to sell Harry/Girlfriend who decide to expand their horizons and find a f/f couple looking to do the same? Where everyone slowly grows attachments to the others (basically two couples getting together). I mean, it would be unlikely, but not violate canon characterisations like, for example, a Snape pairing.

**** Huh, I think people write Harry way too one-dimensional if it seems out of character for him to blow up every now and then.

​

Regarding the Harem, - I know a three-way relationship group in reallife. While that seems like a distinct possibility for Harry and whoever-else, I agree that Harems as displayed in most fanfictions are not only unhealthy but also surrealistic. The true issue I see is that people write romance and Harem-romance/smut fictions always on the classic "falling in love and rutting like rabbits" scheme. - Students declaring their endless and dying love after knowing each other for a few weeks. Sorry to say, but you are not in love but rather enamored. If you are older than 14-15 you might even have the hots. But love? That takes time. -- One of many reasons why I dont like to read romance fanfictions. Even Twilight had a better love story. There I said it.

Uh.... Snape-Pairings... the one true evil.
