I am looking for fics where Harry (male or female, bwl or not, whatever) is raised by someone other than the Dursleys and where they are not nice. This does not mean that they have tobe horrible and abuse him constantly though. Examples of the sort ofthing I have enjoyed in the past along these lines include for include: Blood Crest and Antithesis (unfortunately I cannot link them at the moment).

Thanks i advance to anyone who reccomends anything whether they provide a link or not.


** I remember one story, it is abandoned though.

In linkffn(12005755) /The Daring Win/ Harry gets raised by Dolores Umbridge. Pureblood wank ensues.

There was also a fic where Harry was raised in the woods and trained as an assassin.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** I think noddlehammer's For Love of Magic has this. Harry is raised as the trophy orphan/child of a wealthy couple. However, even though it satisfies your criteria I do want to let you know that the fic is kind of shit. It's basically 60% porn and a lot of that it just done to spite the readers.
