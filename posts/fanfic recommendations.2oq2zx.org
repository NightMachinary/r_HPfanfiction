** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]] by The-Caitiff is one you might check out. It's about as zany as Susan's fic.

Harry Potter's father is alive and assists him in Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][The Life of Brian: A Super-Harry Parody]], also a time-/dimension-travel story played for laughs.

*** Life of Brian is just... stupid. I love perspicacity's works as much as anyone else but that's just stupid.

Although I love the 'lovus shieldum' reference.

**** Not particularly highbrow, true, though I did laugh out loud a couple of times.

I guess it's one of those "different tastes for different folks" things.
