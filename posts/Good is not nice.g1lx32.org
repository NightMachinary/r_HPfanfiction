In these interesting times, I am once again requesting you for fanfic recommendations. This time, I am specifically asking the community for fanfics that prominently feature this one specific trope: Good is not nice. Or, as Remus Lupin puts it in book 7, "We are at war. At least stun if you are not prepared to kill."

Someday, I intend to make a nice, long discussion post about this trope and its application to canon and fanon depictions of war in HP. For the moment, I am tired of reading stories where the bad guys throw /Avada Kedavras, Crucios, Imperios,/ bone-breaking hexes, internal organ damaging curses, blood-boiling jinxes, and god knows what else, and good guys respond with Stunners, Disarmers, and some other jinxes that /can be blocked by a well-trained fourth year!/

So what I am looking for are stories set during any of the three canon wars (Grindelwald, First Blood War, Second Blood War) or some new war in the pre-Grindelwald or post-Voldemort eras, where the good guys /don't/ do that. I am not saying that they should not be trying to capture the enemy alive, or that they don't use Stunners, Disarmers or the like, but they should not be limiting themselves to just that. /Especially/ if it's a war, and not just "protecting yourself from an ambush" kind of situation.

I am looking for stories set during a war where good guys, at the very least, shoot to maim if they don't want to kill outright. Where they use transfiguration to trap enemies under the earth, elemental magic to burn them with fire or suffocate them with water, and other nastier curses if they feel they need them.

The good guy characters need not be all jaded, shell-shocked veterans, although the trope of younger characters having to face these kinds of choices and their consequences is pretty much expected for these kinds of fics.

Please don't recommend anything that has any sort of bashing, of /any/ character, or any of the following relationships: Harry/Hermione, slash relationships among Marauders, any of the Marauders apart from James with Lily. All other pairings, as well as gen fics, are fair game.

Some examples of the type of things I am looking for:

- Wind Shear, linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/]] ) [I am actually not sure if there's any bashing in this fic since I just started it, but I really hope not];
- the Innocent series by MarauderLover7 [which is my new favourite fanfic series that I will recommend from now until the end of time] which has a lot of this trope, especially in the later fics, coupled with judicious usage of "capable bad guys";
- That one fanfic where Harry goes back from a failed future to the day of the Third Task, but he has only 12 hours to beat Voldemort and wrecks absolute havoc. +[I am so sorry, but I forgot the name of this fic. I will link it if I find it+ It has been found; courtesy of [[/u/SubspaceEmbassy][u/SubspaceEmbassy]]! The fic in question is The Unforgiving Minute, by Voice of the Nephilim, and may be found here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]] ];
- The old venerated grandfather of Harry Potter time travel fics: Nightmares of Future Past, which has a /lot/ of this, especially in the titular "future past". Too bad S'Tarkan seems to have removed it, but those who remember it will know what I am talking about.
- Divided and Entwined, linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined]] ) . I think this one's pretty well known in the fandom, especially since the author herself is active on here? Yeah, this one also has a /lot/ good guys are not nice, plus great use of muggle weaponry with magic, and my only complain about this one is how useless Harry and Ron are for a large part of it. But that, for the purposes of this post, is neither here nor there.

Anyway, with respect to the above requirements, please hit me with your best recs.

Thank you in advance to all who respond.

Harry goes full magical Jack Bauer/Mitch Rapp and brutally speedruns the Death Eaters and Voldemort's Horcruxes.

FFN removed it because it had "song lyrics". And they won't answer any questions on that fact.

Does Harry's connection to Voldemort count? Eh, it's a good 10k word time waster.

*Stepping Back* - linkffn(12317784)\\
This follows it. Hell, there was even a speech about it.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

Yeah, I learned that when I went hunting today to see if any copy of the fic existed anywhere. I am not impressed, to say the least. I wish he would put it up on AO3, to be honest.

Yes, Harry's connection to Voldemort definitely counts, especially if he tried to , or even better, was taught to, actively use it, as opposed to the passive use on canon.

Thanks for the recs, gonna go check them.

** I have not actually read many fics that fit what you want exactly. But I am recommending fics I think you might like.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654/chapters/28221378]] Men of War, Harry travels back in time to the period just before Grindelwald War.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19889305]] Outrages so hideous. Harry acts outside of the law as a last resort. This is a post war fic but I thought you will like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12676941/1/The-Howler]] Harry goes vigilante in 5th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820209/1/A-Serious-Hunt]] The war is stopped before it can even begin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]] The death eaters really should not have gone after Hermione. Another fic set in the post war era

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
