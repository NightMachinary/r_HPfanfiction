I don't remember much of it but I do know the main plot centers around the fact Harry keeps dying and coming back to life:

- Harry has like a redo type of ability wherein when he dies, he goes back to a certain 'checkpoint'
- He keeps thinking someone is going to kill him, like all the time
- I think he was in Slytherin
- He got a tutor in Slytherin who was an upperclassman, not sure of the name but the dude ends up dying in Harry 2nd yr if I'm not mistaken
- And at some point, the goblet of fire time, Harry was super paranoid about something going to happen to him
- His name got called and he was raving smtg like "I told you but nobody listened!"

Literally don't remember anything else.


** linkffn(12388283)

** I'm a bit late to this thread, but if you liked "The Many Deaths of Harry Potter" specifically because of its checkpoint-like time travelling, you may be interested in: linkffn(Harry Potter Temporal Beacon)

Hermione somehow comes up with a "beacon" where, if they die, they'll be sent back in time to the point where the beacon was created. This happens /a looooooooot/.

Just a fair warning, though, the author abandoned the story. I think his reasoning was something along the lines of "This is a concept that really never has any end at all". I can't remember if, after 400k+ words, the story was actually /resolved/, though.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
