I love the Wolfstar ship, because Sirius is my favourite character and I would love to read more about him.

Most of the time (all the time in my case), I was able to find all the Gay fanfics written by women, or teenage girls I think. It does a serious injustice, and feels like reading the same straight story from a girl's perspective, only here the man is feeling it. I'm not sure men operate/feel that way. It would be great to find some written by some guy.

**** I got you a mix of fics.

Break is the only fic I can rec with Wolfstar meeting what you are looking for :(

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]] is pretty much set in the real world as far as the characterizations and relationship goes. It also has a funny subplot - Hermione and Ron are married to each other. They are fan fiction/gay erotica writers with a lot of fans. Harry, who is actually gay, is their editor. He is constantly complaining about how Hermione and Ron's idea about gay relationships is totally opposite to what the lived experience is.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione and Ron wrote gay fan-fiction in a way that baffled gay men. "The demographic composition of writers and readers of gay fan-fiction is overwhelmingly female," she had informed Harry, many a time. "Hermione?" "Yes, Harry?" "This isn't how it works." "Nobody cares," she retorted.
#+end_quote

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/34560][Auld Lang Syne]] is a long fic which deals with Harry and Ginny trying to make their marriage work even though he is gay.

** Omg, thank you for pointing this out!

Gay guy here, and wolfstar is my otp, but I can hardly find any fics I enjoy, mostly for the same reasons, and they tend to be written in the Marauder Era. My favorite is Stealing Harry by Copperbadge, and what do you know, it was written by a straight guy!

Remus and Sirius in wolfstar fics just end up feeling like some girl's dolls she likes to play with. "Now kiss! Mwah mwah mwah! Remus blushed as Sirius ran a finger through his hair. Sirius was wearing a black leather jacket, a pair of shades, and smoked a single cigar at the coffee shop." I don't know, just hokey stuff like that.

Don't even get me started on the tumblr androgynous, pretty boy fancasting, Andrew Garfield and Ben Barnes, blah! Give me some DILF Gary Oldman and David Thewlis any day (plus they're leagues ahead in acting talent).

I prefer a more mature take on their relationship. I'll take two handsome, thirty-something bachelors realizing their feelings for each other and raising a kid over the Marauder Era.

Anyway, I don't want to be too hard on female writers, because I'm really thankful for how much content they put out there. I think it's more of the fandom vision not meeting my vision of wolfstar that's the problem, so take what I say with a grain of salt! I've seen some of the same tropes played out by gay writers too. Just the other day I came by a Drarry fic where Harry was a wimpy crybaby getting gay bullied by Draco.

Rant over.

**** My bad for misleading you, I don't read Drarry, it was just one obscure fic I checked out out of curiosity. Play to your audience. Drarry probably doesn't have as high of a gay male reader raito as Wolfstar does, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

The fic I read was written by a guy, can't recall where I found it, but it was so overdramatic and over the top that I found it kind of funny. Maybe it's more of the age of the writer that's the problem rather than the gender.

***** Agreed, it has to do more with the age. Its funny though, in that case I should be looking for more mature stories, actually written by gay men, with less porn and more character development (I'm 24). But the reason I look for HP Fanfiction is the comfort, and it's easier to picturise and accept. I would be open to suggestions about stories you earlier mentioned, with men in their 30s, and of course, written by someone with more experience.

**** I usually read post DH Drarry which has less rules and usually smooths out both characters as they are adults.

During Hogwarts it is very tricky. Partly is because canon Harry's perspective of Draco isn't a complete character, so adding that he is sarcastic or secretly lonely or a nerd can feel both out of place but also normal. The other part is that you need to do a lot of work to get them to even start the process of feeling feelings. Which is why I prefer AU's where either Harry is Slytherin or Draco is Gryffindor, or the Voldemort tension is different so they aren't instant enemies.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045][Bound]] which is a great Wolfstar series and I find it rather unique. Smut/graphic sex scenes are a part of it and there is some fanfic werewolf lore written into it, but I mainly love it for the great characterizations!

An AU in which Sirius emerges from the veil, when Remus is already married to Tonks. Brilliant characterizations, a lot of hurt and raw emotions with a hopeful ending. *Summary of the first work:* “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

** This post and some of the comments really make me slightly uncomfortable (as have others I've seen in this sub along these same lines). Fandom - and specifically slash fandom - has traditionally been a “safe space” for women, and if teenage girls, or older women for that matter, want to write out their Wolfstar fantasies, what's the problem with that? Why is the “female gaze” on this entirely fictional and imaginary relationship less valid or worthwhile, particularly when the reading audience is understood to be largely (though of course not entirely) female? What is wrong with the emotions of teenage girls, and why are they so often minimized and belittled? Why is so much of what women/young women write dismissed as the author “satisfying [her] fantasies” (implied to be silly or embarrassing fantasies) when the same type of patronizingly disparaging language or tone isn't applied to equally pornographic het stories written by men (harem fics, etc)? It also shows such a lack of understanding, or interest in understanding, the many driving forces behind women writing slash to reduce it to “titillation” (much less, in this day and age, to say “ewww, sex between men”!)

I feel like issues such as these are often raised in the subtext but never addressed here, and it bothers me.

But setting that aside in favor of the OP's actual question....there are in fact many, many Sirius/Remus stories out there, written by women, that very accurately convey /human/ emotions, and that have a more “mature” sensibility. But if you're looking for one written by a man, try Wolf, Wolf, by SebastianL (felix_atticus) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862/chapters/37676804]]) - this unlike anything I've ever read. It is agonizing to read at times, definitely not light and fluffy, but the writing is absolutely amazing.

*** Just my opinion but

1) I'm not a fan of Wolfstar because I feel many FF authors don't appreciate the meaning of platonic friendships. This applies also to other relationships such as HP/LL, HP/HG, SM/ASP etc. But that's just my opinion.

2) Nothing wrong with female gaze, in fact I try to cultivate it myself to write female POVs, but IF applied to Wolfstar it is exactly as cringe as the equally-lambasted males-and-lesbian-porn meme. So I think the issue of female gaze is not really relevant to Wolfstar. Consider most FF by demographic is "female gaze" dominated so how can it be said that Wolfstar /in particular/ suffers from a negative impression of female gaze? Doesn't make sense.

3) FF should be a "safe space" (sigh) for all. I don't see why it should particularly be identified with women. As a corollary, I don't see why FF should particularly protect any genre/pairing just because it is supposedly more popular with teenage girls. (See point 2). In plain english: if it is bad call it bad, don't make excuses.

4) Harem fics of any stripe are /way worse/ than Wolfstar, you're going off the rails there mate.

*** I say this as someone who spent most of her teenage years in fandoms, just because it's a safe place it shouldn't mean people can't be called out for problematic behavior - and fetishizing gay people is problematic and very prevalent in the slash community.

**** I want to respond to this one comment specifically. I am so, so tired of this so-woke, but so-misguided, “fetishization” argument about slash (and m/m romance). I always wonder when I see it: Have you ever gone beyond parroting the words? Have you ever read any of the amazing academic literature, much of it written by amazing women, many fans themselves but also academics, professors, brilliant, thoughtful women, about slash and the reasons women create and read it, and the misogyny and hypocrisy inherent in dismissing it as fetishization and arguing that women's fantasy/fictional m/m relationships are bad, wrong, illegitimate?

If you're actually interested, in academic spaces (journals etc), Dr. Francesca Coppa's writings are probably most extensive, but in the meantime, here's a place to start, with a meta tumblr post from someone else: [[https://olderthannetfic.tumblr.com/post/179699430439/i-just-realized-its-fandom-first-friday-and-the][I just realized it's Fandom First Friday and the topic is meta!]]

***** I always appreciate arguments supported with academic sources, so thank you! The quoted excerpts sounded very interesting but I disagree with some of the takes from the Tumblr user, I think she conflates some entirely different things ( bringing drag and fujocourse into the argument) and is flat out wrong in some cases:

#+begin_quote
  Frankly, this sort of fujocourse boils down to thinking that sex and desire are dirty and that m/m sex is the dirtiest of all. 
#+end_quote

I don't think at all that desire or sex is dirty. I don't think m/m, or threesomes, or kinks are dirty. I don't think slash is bad, I would be a huge hypocrite if I did; a lot of my all-time favorite fics are slash fics and the main character in the fic I'm writing is gay. I don't think there is a problem with projecting onto male characters in itself either, even if the only goal is sexual gratification.

I do however think that stripping male characters of their masculinity to force one of them into a feminine role to mimic the heteronormative relationship model is creepy; I would think it's creepy if there was a proper equivalent of the "slash-phenomenom" in male-dominated fandom spaces, but as male fans generally project onto male characters the closest thing I can think of in terms of fetishizing and objectifying is probably the shitty harem fics, and I find those equally gross.

Asking authors to give characters personality behind " cute feminine bottom UwU" isn't calling women's fantasy illegitimate or being "not like other girls", it's asking them to do the bare minimum for decent writing

** Because that's what they are. My deep suspicion is that most slash/femslash are written by female/male writers to get more mysterious porn. It seems to me that a substantial part of lure of pornography is gratifying of our curiosity. Yes, part of that is compensation for our failures: my sex life is far from perfect, so I would like to experience perfect sex life at least by reading about it. However, I think other motivation is just curiosity (I am a man): how it would be if I experienced sex from other side (fem!Harry and genderbend!Harry)? How it would be if two blokes went for it? (Ewwww ...) How it would be if two girls did it? What about threesome? Etc.

Just very small share of slash/femslash, trans stories are written as a personal testimony of people who deal with their own story, I am afraid most of them are just for increased titillation.

*** While I definitely agree that most slash is written by women, I would argue that most femslash is too. I almost exclusively read femslash (I'm a lesbian) and know a ton of femslash readers and writers are queer women. Femslash in general is such a small percentage of all fan fiction that's written that it more or less correlates with the percentage of queer women out there. I think because there aren't nearly as many lesbian books out there compared to ones with straight main characters, lesbians and bi women tend to gravitate to fan fiction as a reading outlet.

That being said, Im positive some men read and write femslash too. I've definitely come across a few fics that I could basically tell wasn't written by a bi woman or lesbian.
