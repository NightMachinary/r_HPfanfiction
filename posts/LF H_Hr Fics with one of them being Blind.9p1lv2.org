I asked this in the H/Hr subreddit and got a Rec for a Fic, but maybe some people know more fics?

â€‹

Preferably post- War, so for example, the Killing Curse left its traces and he become Blind over time (or suddenly. Something similar happens in "Notebooks and Letters" by chemprof). Whether he is right from the beginning with Hermione or she takes care of him/nursing him (more than necessary) and breaks up with Ron doesnt matter.

I cant imagine a scenario that would have Hermione having blindness, but im open for recs.

Also them making Love together would be very welcome as i can imagine this very sweet. But Fics without this, but intimate moments are fine too.

The Blindness doesnt have to linger for the whole Fic (or the rest of the Persons life), but it should be for a certain Part of it.


** linkffn(Blindness) has Harry blind from the killing curse

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  What if the road to hell isn't paved with good intentions? What if good intentions that go awry sometimes lift us higher than we would have ever thought possible? After the DOM, Harry bears his soul to Hermione in a letter, provoking the incident that gave them a chance at true happiness. Damn the consequences, because their love is worth it, and who needs that pesky vision anyway?
