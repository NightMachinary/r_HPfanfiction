Using the Diary as an example that the Horcrux's don't need to be powerful magical objects, how would things change if Harry's crib had become the Horcrux instead of Harry?


** Probably, Dumbledore would find and destroy it basically at once, since it wouldn't be sealed or protected by anything and would just be hangin' out there clearly marked with Tom's power.

If not, it would probably sit untouched for decades, until Harry found it when revisiting Godric's Hollow and took it out then.

But if we're going with what could be remotely possible rather than the most likely scenarios, I think it would be most fun for Mundungus Fletcher to steal and sell it as a relic of the Boy-Who-Lived, only for this cursed cot to end up cycling through wealthy purebloods who want to be able to brag how their children sleep where the Boy-Who-Lived once slept, and in the process warp an entire generation's outlooks on life through the frequent contact with so powerful a dark object.

** Well if nobody realised this and Dumbledore still thought Harry was the horcrux, surely, everything would have happened the exact same except Harry would have died in the forbidden Forest

********* Wasn't Nagini made a Horocrux after Voldemorts revival? I'd assume that instead of Nagini he made the tombstone the Horocrux. His thought process being to remind himself of his greatest failure and biggest win.(him dying and "beating" death)

*********** Was Godrics hollow under any protection or being guarded? The ministry had no reason to be looking for him because the believed Harry was lying. If anyone was protecting the graveyard it might have been the order of the Phoenix. They were busy guarding the prophecy and Harry. Worse case scenario and it's found out how could the order explain destroying the headstone of Harry's parents. It'll be a PR problem for Dumbledore publicly and how would Harry take it after being left alone.

Storyline wise if you want this is a good time for Harry to breakaway from Dumbledore and his friends.
