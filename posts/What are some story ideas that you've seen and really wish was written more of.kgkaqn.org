Maybe a plot idea or theme that you read that you really love, that just isn't written as much if at all compared to other ideas.

Feel free to link the story if you remember it.


** Just some more good Percy Weasley centric stuff

And by good, I mean where he isn't bashed or referenced negatively

I've read this one story (super short and hasn't been updated in years) where during the 2nd book, Percy was more focused on family and it was really good. Just, like I said, not updated since. Which is unfortunate, I really liked it

*** I went on a Percy binge a couple years ago if you want some recommendations! I really loved linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky) which follows Percy during the war when he's on the outs with the rest of the family. linkao3(Percy take the wheel by kittySmith) is an AU where something terrible happens to the Weasley parents and Percy has to step up and take care of his siblings. It's really good but hasn't been updated in a little while.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** Good Percy Weasley

Tom Riddle time travels to the future instead of someone going to the past without it being about shipping

More spell creation/original spells because that idea is really interesting but often it's over complicated rituals or overpowered.

Where the Dursley's are good

Percy Jackson crossovers that are both good and finished/still being worked on

Stories about Andromeda or Andromeda and Ted. Honestly underrated characters imo

Hogwarts being a better school more focused on the students safety and happiness where they actually hire good teachers and the adults are more useful.

Good Dursley's without it being some Weasley/order bashing fic.

Cross-house friendships that aren't just keeping canon friends together despite an AU re-sort.

Legilimency that's actually explored as for a POV character-the good and the bad.

Forbidden magic that's not just dark and brutal. Magic for sex, religion, protection, that's unique.

Didn't realize until I was an adult how problematic this truly is to not address in the books at all. Like it was just accepted that his home life was his home life and the wards were more important. Like ANYONE could have gone to the Dursleys and told them to knock that shit out?

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** Moving action set pieces. As a case in point, the Hogwarts Express has a ton of potential. In linkffn(Time, Mr Potter?) there is a fantastic battle where Death Eaters attempt to ‘cleanse' the Express of muggleborns and the moving battle around that is fantastic, but nobody ever seems to use moving set pieces.

Most wizard fights I come across are more or less stationary where each side just throws spells at each other from behind cover, and honestly that gets boring after a while.

I do however have a plot bunny that I'm going to incorporate into the fic I've been working at intermittently for the last two years, so I at least plan on doing something with the express.

Imaginary Fiend by Jaygwen23

Has a plot similar to that, incomplete but updates regularly. Harry and the Horcrux in his head start plotting to kill Voldemort. It's marked Tomarry but so far it's more of a mentor relationship.

I agree I would like to see more Harry's Horcrux plays a bigger part, fics.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

But I would love to see them react to Black comedy, once upon a freakin' time, the Seventh horcrux or Harry the Hufflepuff. Especially if they don't know what a fanfic is and think that everything is real.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Real comedy or adventure fics. Like Make a Wish. There are too little fics out there that don't involve Hogwarts and Harry explores the outside world, or goes to a magical university. A fic where completely new concepts of magic are explored like in "Café" or "A second chance at life". A time travel fic where Harry is past school age and doesn't end up back in Hogwarts like Araceil's Fantastic Beasts & Harry Potter crossover which she deleted because she felt the reviews on fanfiction.net became too toxic.

Frankly I am happy with a a smart/clever or adult Harry Potter that does something preferably outside of the UK that doesn't involve Hogwarts and where either Voldemort or the Dursleys are an afterthought.

For this reason I don't mind crossovers that drop Harry somewhere different. It is like a fresh breath of air.
