Basically this:

linkffn(11607795) - Harry wakes up one time, with a letter from his mother, and grows wings, horns etc. He's not amused at all... It's a one-shot but I really wished littlewhitecat had developed it more. It's a decent premise that is realistic, as in the characters treat it as extremely unusual and it doesn't grant any immediate super powers.

I know it's a stretch, but perhaps someone, somewhere heard of something similar.

Thanks in advance.

P.S. It's an awesome fic, really check it out, it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.

*** Yeah, I know that one, it's fun, but not exactly what I was looking for. Creature inheritance in that fic is quite common. While a fun fic and quite humorous, it's not what I was looking for. More in line with Small (Creature) Comforts, with the cliche puberty(birthday)->inheritance or something similar... More in line with HP canon, that's what I meant.

Still, a very good rec, all things be told. Thanks!

**** yeah i sadly don't know any creature-inheritance fics that don't have a ton of romance involved, it seems that it pretty much all does, usually cause it makes for a good excuse for some romance either cause their form is monstrous and the whole inhuman romance genre existing usually for adults but not always (looking at you Sherrilyn Kenyon and Stephanie Meyer) it's it's really rare that any sort of creature fic doesn't have romance as a plot point and even then it's basically never inheritance but just turned into a creature out of nowhere, usually animagus hijinks but not always....and even some of those end up having alot of sex

I thought you were describing Outcast Alley there. linkffn(5621051)

EDIT: It is abandoned though, and the second warning does not apply, luckily.

*** Outcast Alley is one other fic I know that fits my requirement, but it's so old and kind of strange. I don't really mind the Snape mentorship thing, even if only comes to life late, but it's not really an HP fic, it's more of a young parent with a child fic. Still good, though.

EDIT: I wish it was complete. I remember I enjoyed it quite a lot, even though I never reread it.
