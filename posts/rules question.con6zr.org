** You can use the prompt flair to write up a suggestion I guess?

*** The thing is, I plan to pay the writer. Not suggest and hope they do it. It's just a matter of it following the sub rules. I've posted it on other subs and it gets deleted because it goes against their guidelines.

**** It's illegal to make money off fanfic. If you want to commission an original story, that's fine, but I guess it's off-topic here.

***** Lol right? There's a reason people are so careful to say they don't own anything or are making money. Honestly OP, no one's gonna want to accept your money for a fanfic. It's /illegal/, as in they could actually go to jail.... just make a prompt. If your idea is interesting, someone will take it up üôÑ

****** It's bizarre that people are downvoting you. They must be forgetting the Anne Rice debacle, when her lawyers caused so much trouble so many fanfic writers.

******* They must also be forgetting what illegal means. üôÑ it doesn't matter what any website's ‚Äúrules‚Äù are about this, because it's literally against the /law/. But sure. Go ahead and get yourself arrested, op. You're a moron if you think its okay to buy fanfic, but whatever üôÑ I did my civic duty in reminding you.

******** Is it actually illegal to buy it, or only to sell it? I know selling it is definitely illegal, but I'm not sure about the other side.

********* Good point, my point still stands though. No author who remembers what that shitstorm of lawyers was is gonna touch this.

***** Is there a black market for paid fanfiction? I guess if someone pm-ed an author a gift code nobody would notice anything...

**** In that case you should try [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] to search for writers that would be in that sort of thing.
