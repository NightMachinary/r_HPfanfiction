...I should have put this one in my fics-to-read list. I remember that the scene I was thinking of, Scabbers was revealed as Peter Pettigrew, /possibly/ in Gryffindor Tower, he's all nervous and apologetic and admits to making 'some mistakes', but explains that Sirius Black is innocent, but probably driven crazy by Azkaban, and I think he offers to help, either apprehend him or clear his name or I'm not sure.

...But yeah, I am pretty certain it's a fic where Peter Pettigrew willingly reveals himself to Harry & co, and isn't immediately arrested and sent to Azkaban like so many other fics do.


** Now this I want to see. I thought I was the only one with a plotline like this.

*** In The Parselmouth of Gryffindor, right? That's another one I should put on my fics to read list.

~does that now~

But no, I think it's actually a different one.

**** Yup, that's right. But I'm quite confident it's a different one, as in /Parselmouth/, while Pettigrew does reveal himself, things don't go down quite the way you describe.
