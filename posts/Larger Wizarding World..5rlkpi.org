Most stories, even canon compliant ones, tend to make the world a bit bigger than canon (canon seems to be about 5000 or so Wizards at the most.) I'm looking for stories with a much larger Wizarding World, a 100,000 at least in Britain.


** I would estimate canon wizard population to be closer to 15 000, but it's really hard to tell with this small amount of rather inconsistent information we were given.

Anyway. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) - ongoing, but rarely uodated and slowpaced. Linkffn(Lords of Magic) - Dead

*** Whatever you do, don't read lords of magic. I've read a lot of abandoned fanfiction but these few chapters here completely took me by surprise and made me very sad that it's a dead fic. Someone please pick it up!!

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** linkffn(10210053)

I think 400k in the UK is mentioned somewhere in the earlier chapters. There's also about twice as many Hogwarts students.
