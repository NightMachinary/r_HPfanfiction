I find that a lot of popular fics, like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, and even some those with my favourite ship (Harry/Ginny), like The Unforgiving Minute are fics that really don't do anything for me. I can't get into them. I find them boring, and lose interest.

So I was wondering, are there any popular fics that you just don't get or like?


** Seventh Horcrux. Every time people ask for a funny fic it gets recommended. It was mildly amusing for a couple chapters and then got stale really quickly. I think there was only line that actually made me laugh.

** In terms of highly recommended fics in the style I tend to read: Black Comedy, Bungle in the Jungle, Wastelands of Time, Skitterleap, Song of the Trees.

I think On The Way to Greatness is ok, but don't have it as highly rated as some others do.

**** Yeah, I went into it because people kept saying that the plot and some unique magical system features made the poor characterizations worth going through.

I was shocked when a fic based around rationality and science got science wrong. And that the author advocated his own (unsuccessful) organization in a Harry Potter fanfic to solicit donations.

*** My problem with Haphne is it's one of the most hit-or-miss fandoms ever, which I assume stems from the fact that every author pretty much molds Daphne into whatever the want. With Harmony or Hinny or even Larry I generally know what to expect from the characters. If you have 100 Haphne fics you have 100 Daphnes, and most of them are lame characters.

** This thread has certainly made me feel better about the state of this sub. I'd started to think everybody loved these awful stories.

- Seventh Horcrux - a one-joke story spread thinly over 21 chapters and 100k words.
- Novocaine - a story about accountancy set in the HP world.
- A Marauder's Plan - endless pages spent talking about stuff with hardly anything ever happening.
- Harry Potter and the Runestone Path - every cliché going as Harry ends up with half the witches in Britain.

And that's without even mentioning robst.

** On The Way To Greatness

It does nothing for me. Until the end of year 4, it is completely canon rehash. Even after that... it just doesn't stand out in any area for me. I'm not bashing it because it is well-written from a technical standpoint, but I feel like I could read the books for the most part and just insert a green tie up until fifth year. And even then, it failed to pull me back in, even though it did get better.

** The Seventh Horcrux. I enjoyed the beginning but quickly lost interest.

On the Way to Greatness. It has been a long time since I read it, but the impression I remember having was Harry struggling while being miserable and mediocre for years and then the fic dies. Not the sort of thing I'm likely to enjoy in general, but especially not when the title is what it is.

** I attempted to HPMOR however I immediately dropped it after reading Harry's last name in the first chapter; "Potter-Evans-Verres". While I was impressed with the 'Prince of Slytherin' series at first I stopped reading only to skim through the important chapters after I learned that it hasn't even entered the 4th year after almost a million words. I really like the world building & plot twists it introduced.

I powered through "A Cadmean Victory" it has some good ideas but it's overshadowed by the cringey moments so my general opinion of it is: meh. I initially had a really good opinion of Sarcasm & Slytherin after I blew through it on ao3, after re-reading it I found myself cringing at the 'pure blood culture' dialog.

Most of the fanfic's I've really enjoyed reading are either dead, in-progress, or a oneshot, I think I may be a masochist.

After several attempts, I finally made it all the way through Wind Shear, and very happily closed the window when I finally slogged through the whole thing. My final reaction, "That wasn't as bad as it felt at the beginning," but really I didn't enjoy the story.

The others I've never made it all the way through. Rune Stone Path is still on my list to maybe try again; the others are not.
