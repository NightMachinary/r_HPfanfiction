*Requirements:*

- Peter Pettigrew aka Wormtail is caught by Harry Potter/Sirius Black/etc as fanfics are prone to doing. In third year or in first year or any time is good.

- Things go to trial, but Peter has a really good lawyer, one who is fastidious about testing evidence and facts, addressing every possibility from the Imperius to love potions and especially Obliviation/False Memory Charms (or alternatively, one who's just really good at distracting the crowd).

- Maybe Peter is exonerated of everything (to Harry's/Sirius's astonishment), maybe he's still found guilty but has supporters, or maybe he's found innocent but targeted for assassination.

- Feel free to focus on the trial itself, the aftermath, or have a character in the future do a recap on what happened afterwards.


** I never thought about wizards/witches being lawyers. Like where do they go to study? Do they have a 3 year course like muggles? Is it the law school of witchcraft and wizardry? What courses do they have to have in N.E.W.Ts to go into law? Or is it like a learn on the job kind of thing where you get a related job at the ministry and ascend?

So many possibilities!

I guess it could be a guilty plea/plea bargain in case of pettigrew unless they go to age old imperius curse. Other than that Peter's actions speak a lot to.be defended.

*** According to JKR there is no post graduate schools. You get Hogwarts and that's it. You're tried by the Wizengamot if your crime merits it. I think everything else is just dealt with my the DMLE

In Taure's fic Victoria Potter, she models wizard legal education to be the same as the British system but more whimsical (like everything else in the Wizarding World) Instead of studying in the Inner Temple, Wizard Barristers study at the Lower Temple

*** I'd imagine that contract law would be even more complex with magic in the mix.

*** Interesting question. I am sure that there is some lawyer as in the fifth book there is a defence position. Interestingly you don't have to be a lawyer as Dumbledore could be the defence. (But I am not sure about the Anglo-Saxon system of who can be defender in the court) But there were no lawyers in the trials of the death eaters in the memories so I can imagine that there is no designated defender. The executor of the will was the ministry in case of Dumbledore will. But there was not real execution in case of Sirius will. So it's possible that the answer is MAGIC.

Personally, I can imagine a trainee system where the old lawyers just took some young interested person and teach them personally without any formal education. The same system works in other cases: aurors, healers, Gringrotts...

*** This is purely an extension of fanon, but it could simply be that legal studies are just part of a 'pureblood' education. In canon, I think every named member of the Wizengamot is a pureblood.

**** I like to think of it as entrepreneurial spirit. Someone saw a need that nobody else was filling and decided that would make for some good money. Probably some 4th child with no chance of inheriting the estate or businesses.

** So the OJ defense? Or maybe remus and sirius get false imprisonment charges against them for having peter in the shrieking shack. Maybe some wizarding assault and battery for using the spell to turn peter back into human form.

*** You could write in that general direction if you wanted.\\
After all, Peter stayed hidden as a harmless pet rat for over a decade, never harming a hair on the Weasleys' or Harry's head, and when he's revealed his 'friends' promptly attempt to murder him. Evidence of good character on Peter's part, evidence of bad character on Sirius and Lupin's part.
