Could anyone recommend me some angsty Percy fics? Preferably where he's the main character, but if he's a relevant side character that's also fine.

I just can't find any good ones anymore.


** Twenty-nine, by Endrina, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523]]), long, completely Percy focused and makes him an interesting and complex character, plenty of angst, well written.

** I remember one [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel][Percy Take The Wheel]] on fanfiction.net

I cant entirely remember what happens but basically there was an explosion at the burrow that kills Molly, puts Arthur in St Mungos and Bill and Charlie cant come home to look after the younger Weasleys, so Percy takes over. He also pretty much adopts Harry for good measure.

Set Harry's 2nd year.

It's been a while since I last read it and I cant remember much else (slow WIP) but wasnt bad.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7670511/1/][The Unlikely Pair]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3264843/][GinaMcKnight]] is kind of angsty. It's Percy/Hermione with a really interesting Percy.

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. COMPLETE. Sequel now in progress: An Inch To The Left.

** This one's a little unpolished but it's post-DH and about how Percy handles his guilt about his role.in the Ministry under Fudge, Scrimegour, and Thicknesse. The Collaborator, linkao3(6916483) (also on FFN).

  He's officially cleared of all wrongdoing, but Percy Weasley still puts himself on trial. A Percy/Audrey fic if you squint. Post-DH.
