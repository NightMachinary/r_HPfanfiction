By supporting character, I mean anyone that's not Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, or Voldemort.

As an example: take Uncle Vernon, and have him behave like he's [[https://ranma.fandom.com/wiki/Genma_Saotome][Genma Saotome]].

  Professor McGonagall flies into her classroom, doing some loops in her broom over the heads of the students. Then lands on her desk and turns to point abruptly at Neville. "This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost passed Transfiguration, Mr. Longbottom."

  Voldemort looked over the bedraggled defenders of Hogwarts as they stood in the courtyard, silently watching the Death Eaters file in. "Students and Professors," he began, "we need not be opposed. There is no more cause for bloodshed. Harry Potter is dead!"

  The gasps of heartbreak and shock from the crowd took only moments to die down in the face of the most powerful Dark Lord in Britain's history.

  "Your 'Chosen One' was killed, trying to flee for his life," Voldemort continued. "So from now on, put your faith... in m-"

  "Hey! Snake-Face! Lose something, eh?" The frankly jolly tone flabbergasted the assembled crowd as both sides looked to see the source. A staggering figure tripped its way into sight from one of the holes that had been blasted in the walls of the ancient castle. Minerva McGonagall - Professor of Transfiguration at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - swaggered into sight, waving a silvery object in the air before interrupting herself by tripping, falling onto her face, and reflexively turning into a cat. The onlookers exchanged concerned glances in the several silent moments it took for her to put herself back in sorts.

  "Come to negotiate, have you, you slimy git?!" she cackled, dancing in place as she sang taunts at the brutal dictator. "Look what I got! I got an old ti-/ara!/ I got an old ti-/ara!/ And guess what's inside it?"

** Daphne is now replaced by Jane Shepard (Mass Effect, preferably part 3). A 30-year-old super-soldier from two centuries in the future who has been through enough shit for ten lifetimes and stopped several galactic annihilation plots.

How would things change? She'd probably be pissed off at being surrounded by literal children. If she'd get in the DA, well she has more than a little combat experience which includes space magic. And Malfoy's plot would be over after 5 minutes, with him dead (at least with renegade Shepard).

Malfoy: You fight like a Muggleborn!

Ron: How appropriate. You fight like a Muggle.

(When Malfoy attempts to draw his wand, Ron punches him in the nose.)

Ron: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

**** And here I want Neville to start wearing a green corset and trying to kiss people to bring them under his control.

Meanwhile, Ginny and Daphne are locked in an epic battle for dominance as their alter-egos, Kira and Zero, while maintaining a genial friendship as their civilian identities. They make plans to hit up a beach in France, since all of Britain's beaches were mysteriously cleaned of sand a few decades before.

Well. That's a terrifying idea. I'd say Genma is actually a worse person than Vernon. For all that they're both abusive(in different ways, mind you), Vernon, at least, is a productive member of society.
