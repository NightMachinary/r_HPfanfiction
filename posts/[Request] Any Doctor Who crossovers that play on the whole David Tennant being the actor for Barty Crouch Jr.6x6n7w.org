Not sure if it's been done before, but I think it would be a fun fic if the Doctor wakes up as Barty Crouch Jr before the events of GoF. Are there any fics that have this premise, or just have the Doctor in the HP Universe?


** Well, I'd like a SW//HP crossover in which General Hux meets Bill Weasley.

  "I'm not him," the Doctor insisted once more. "And no matter what he-we look like I can assure you, there's only one of me. I've counted," he said desperately. - Or the fic where the Doctor gets mistaken for notorious Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr, interrogated by auror Potter and- spoilers.

  A criminal whose soul was sucked out woke up and escaped. The TARDIS was missing and the Doctor didn't know where or when he was. Voldemort was back, and Sirius Black had a few more secrets left... To top this all off, there was a watch involved, and a very good reason for Barty Crouch Jr and the Tenth Doctor to look identical.

  Barty Crouch Jr. has made a mistake that is going to cost him his soul. The Ninth Doctor is regenerating; as the Tenth Doctor emerges, he realizes immediately that this is not a normal regeneration. Through a series of flashbacks the Doctor figures out who this man was and how they are connected. Has some Greek Mythology that is explained. Rated T for future chapters, may change.
