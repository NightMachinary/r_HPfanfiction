From the last two years. Read most of the good ones. Can be anything (time travel, next-gen, etc.) but please indicate if there is slash (not into it, but if others are, I won't stop them from reading).

Thanks!~


** They Didn't Know We Were Seeds linkffn(12386916) is a really good Snape-centric fic. It doesn't have slash.

#+begin_quote
  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Voldemort is dead but Harry Potter's problems are far from over. Indeed, the very day after the battle, Harry Potter looks into a mirror and finds himself staring at a stranger and an old secret is brought to light. And what does this have to do with Severus Snape, still alive (unfortunately, as far as Snape is concerned) after being dragged out of the Shrieking Shack?

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something.If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into.Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power.But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them.(Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

#+begin_quote
  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

** The Serpent's Gaze linkao3(The Serpent's Gaze) is an excellent slytherin AU which features a bolder, smarter Harry as a main character. Snape is in each of the books (5, so far) although we don't get his perspective until the fifth book. But boy, is it worth it. This Snape is reluctant, tired, regretful, and repressed, but he also has friends, humour, and a hint of kindness.

  There are poisons that blind you, and poisons that open your eyes. The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. At Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns to value pride, loyalty, and poison over mercy. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, shipping later. Featuring ambiguous heroes, equivocal villains, and original and canon characters alike.
