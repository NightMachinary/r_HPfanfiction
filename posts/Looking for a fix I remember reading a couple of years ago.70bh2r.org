It was about an adult Harry taking care of a younger female Harry, with the man having a drug problem. As in, he was constantly high on calming potions and had to go through withdrawal. I don't think there was romance, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was. I think he was a teacher too, but I really can't remember. It should have been on fanfiction.net


** was it linkffn(8145130) ?

*** Just the one, thank you. And I just realized autocorrect changed fic to fix in the title, how appropriate.
