Because at least once a week there's a Fem!Harry/Tom Riddle request and I'm feeling contrary.


** linkffn(Departure From the Diary by TendralUmbra) is excellent, the author intends to return to a regular updating schedule sometime next month. fingers crossed.

Can't link it here cause of the rules, but Power is Control is another decent one.

Another one I can't link is Datura on AO3 it's okay with really just a wild premise.

That's about all I can think of at the moment. Happy Travels.

*** Oh man, Datura. The author does an excellent job of depicting a terrifying Riddle, but reading that fic made me want to pull out my hair at times. It's like...

Riddle says hello.

A jolt goes through Harry, and he drops his book, attracting the attention of nearby students. He finds Riddle standing a hair's breadth away, grazing his legs with her skirt, and recoils in shock. She tilts her head with an inscrutable smile and a wicked gleam in her eye, and he flushes in embarrassment. Blah blah blah, three paragraphs of introspection and sweating.

Harry finally asks her what she wants.

Her eyes narrow as if he just told the most amusing joke, and his breath hitches as he feels as if she's peering right into his soul. Blah blah blah, four more paragraphs of dramatic body language descriptions until she speaks again... and I realize I'm 2,000 words into the chapter and so far they literally just exchanged two lines of dialogue.

**** Not really. The relationship is convoluted, and she mainly just wants him to be taken care of and treated with respect. And, unlike a lot of the Harry fanfiction readers, she's sane enough to remember she's 70 something years old, and doesn't want to fuck a mentally compromised teenager.
