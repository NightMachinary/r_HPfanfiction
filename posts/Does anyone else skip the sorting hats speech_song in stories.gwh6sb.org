I have been read Harry Potter fanfics for a while now and I have probably read the sorting hats song all of 2 times. It it almost always irrelevant and too long.


** I'll skim it when I see it to check whether it's an original version or one of the many fics that just copy the entire thing straight from the book. The latter is a pet peeve of mine, a subset of "fics that spend extended periods just rehashing canon".

*** Is there a reader of fanfiction which didn't read the books/see the films? I don't think so. So, why in the world there is this freaking need to repeat things which are in the books? Whenever I read McGonagal's speech on ‚ÄúThere are four houses at Hogwarts ...‚Äù I start to scream, and the story is getting quite higher on my killing list.

I love seeing the originality authors dish out with their songs and how they invent new lyrics, it gives me fuzzy feelings as if I were reading PS again.

*** This is why I make my canon scenes in italics, surrounded by ~ symbols, so anyone can skip it if they remember, and read the scene if they don't.

That said, I have yet to publish a fic that copied a part of the canon, I think.

I have yet to publish a fic in general except that one fic and 2 one-shots.

*** What I really really love, but is very hard to find, are things that look like the same but are subtly different.

It can be just a few details that will make a huge difference latter on. For example with the sorting ceremony, the sorting Hat take 10 seconds with Draco (instead of the decision being immediate), or with Neville (instead of taking a long long time).

Harry, even if he ends up in Gryffindor isn't so against Slytherin in his conversation with the Sorting hat. Or Percy, and the twins ignoring Harry.

Things you could miss if you're just skimming, because on appearance it's just like the books, but if you read it, you sees it.

I acknowledge that you can write relevant and cool pre-Hogwart Arc but at some point the story needs to start moving forward in its plot or it becomes less interesting and people tend to drop this kind of fictions.

** I skip them, because the majority of the characters in the fic (canon inlcuded) ignore it too. Christ, in canon the hat practically warns them every single time and tells them to get along, and they ignore it. And things get progressively worse.

I interpret quite a few of the songs as the hat chastising everyone for not living up to the name of their house. You have the Slytherins who aren't very cunning, the Gryffindors who shun the actual brave in their house, the Ravenclaws who don't show it, and the hufflepuffs who shun people for the flimsiest of reasons.
