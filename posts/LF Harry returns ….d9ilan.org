:END:
Do you know about some good story where Harry is for some reason out of picture and grows up somewhere else, Trio doesn't happen, and thus Hermione is alone and slightly pushed to the side as a freak and know-it-all (not sure about Ron, he probably finds his niche as a Qudditch maniac and part of the Weasley family, no need for bashing him).

Unfortunately, linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion by Vance McGill) goes haywire into weird fields of polygamy, and linkffn(10101403;12548959) turns to some weird stuff as well.

It actually doesn't have to be a Harmony story, because with Harry presumed dead, Ginny and all other girls in the world wouldn't develop crush on him, and they could start their relationship from the reasonable start.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

  Sequel to Fixing Past Mistakes. Now that the past mistakes had been fixed what of the future? Will Harry be able to secure a growing legacy as he ages? Will Dumbledore find out who they are and make life uncomfortable or will he only realize who they were when they are gone never to be seen again...what about Voldemort? Has he already returned working in the shadows or not?

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?

*** Hmm, thanks for suggestions, but neither of them is what I hoped for. The first turns out to be more or less a lemon, and the second is uckly-duckling-Hermoine-is-kissed-and-turns-into-lovely-swan. Too much Venezuelan telenovela to my taste. Could I have a Hermione which is actually smart and slightly more active in the fight against Voldemort?

**** I have to apologise to "What We Are Fighting For", yes it is too smutty, but there is an excellent story beneath it. Thank you very much.
