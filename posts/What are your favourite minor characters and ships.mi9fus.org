I like Lavender, the Patil twins, Colin, Cedric and of course Cho. They're all very underrated in canon and fanfic.

I like Neville in canon, but haven't read much fic about him.

Lockhart is also brilliantly written in canon, IMO. He's not a nice person, but he's a great character.


** Aberforth. He's brushed aside but offers such a great proper insight into Dumbledore and the parts of him we don't normally see. Ab really grounds dumbledore in reality.

The Second String nailed him, and since then I've loved him.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Viktor Krum. I adore him because he was so awkward and sweet. Krumione is my favorite ship of all time. Their dynamic in the books was just great, and I love seeing it explored in fic.

Both the character and the ship are pretty rare, so it's always a great experience to find ships featuring them.

TheDivineComedian has absolutely NAILED Regulus and Remus. I adore all their stories.

Age of Lies especially for both. Also the one chapter of They're Hiding Inside Me that Regulus is in is the best Regulus. All regal and coy and clever and smart and tricksy, eugh just perfect!

** The Dursleys have always been a favorite of mine just for sheer potential for fanfics, a few examples: the trope where Harry gets stuck to another character by the wrist and then they fall in love yada yada(I'll use drarry as an example), these fics would be so much better if the spell lasted over summer break and -draco- met Harry's relatives and discovered the abuse that went on -he- could then go on to do a multitude of things like getting revenge for Harry, trying to get Harry out of the dursley's custody or so many other things. Example 2: if mcgonagall, snape, sprout, any of the defense teachers(literally any of the Hogwarts professors) decided to check up on Harry's home life when madam pomphrey informs -any of the teachers- that Harry had come back from a Christmas break with bruises(make up circumstances for Harry to go home for Christmas) then the rest of the fic is one or multiple of the teachers fighting to get Harry away from the Dursley's(you could even have the professors argue over who would fight for Harry's custody.) I have so many more ideas, so much untapped potential!

*** If you haven't read it, linkao3(the family evans by dirgewithoutmusic) is my favourite Dursley fic. It's kind of an alternate take where Petunia leaves with Harry and Dudley. But it does a great job of keeping Petunia in character while still giving Harry a family. Cannot reccomend it enough.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** Since you like Lavender you should read this fanfic (if you haven't already), it's really interesting. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]]

I would say Regulus but I don't see him as a minor character anymore, probably because of the amount of fanfics I've read about the Blacks lol.

I love Percy. And Charlie, but I think everyone likes him.

I like Blaise Zabini because he looks down on literally everyone including Malfoy lol. And Theodor Nott. I wish we saw more of him.

** Depending on the line for 'minor' characters... Luna, Fleur, and Tonks are three that I am always happy to see good fics involving, they have a lot of potential - though obviously, as more than just a prize for Harry to win (Fleur in particular suffers /heavily/ from that).

Lockhart is a lot of fun as well, like you say.

Fanon Daphne is also a fun inclusion, I like the role that she plays in many stories - again, if it is well written it can let us explore a different part of the wizarding world (and purebloods) than we typically see, which I enjoy. And she's the most minor character of all, being referenced what - once in canon? ;)

** I mean I wouldn't say he's a completely minor character, but I love Percy-centered fanfics. There's just so many avenues writers can explore with his character. I normally ship him and Oliver, and surprisingly there's a lot of great fics for the pairing.

** I usually like to read about minor characters that appear around the school be it students (Ernie, Justin, Anthony, Michael, Terry, the Patil sisters, Lavender, Cho, Collin, etc.) or staff (Flitwick, Binns, Sinistra, Vector, Filch) and the dynamics between them throughout their daily lives in school.

** I like reading fics about Pansy, Regulus, and the older Weasley brothers Bill & Charlie. For Pansy, the fics are usually very OC since she hasn't really had any development in canon, but the modern fanon Pansy is pretty great.
