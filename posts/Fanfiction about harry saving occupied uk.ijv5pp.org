Okay. So it's been a while since I read this. But it's something around this. Harry is dead. Volde won. He has taken over the uk in a very WW2 style. Hermione is forced married to ron. And she every year on the time harry died get together with friends wishing for him to come back.

They get attacked and is saved. I think by Neville. That lives with harry and Neville's wife/gf. Where they are planning on freeing uk.

Plz help?


** Pretty sure it's The Lost Horcrux.
