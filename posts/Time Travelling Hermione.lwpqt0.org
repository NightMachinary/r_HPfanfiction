:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I hope someone can help, I've been searching for a fic where Hermione goes back to the time of the marauders with a heavily featuring moody. All I can remember is the ending where she goes forward in time again to make sure things have changed. She doesn't know she will be coming back until she gets there and I'm fairly certain Sirius was meant to meet her at a tree in the garden of James and Lily's home.

Bit of an oddly specific memory but I would really like to read the story again! Thanks ima stance for any help!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.
