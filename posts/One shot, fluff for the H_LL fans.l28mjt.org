The Harry/Luna discord server set up a Valentine's Day challenge, and since Luna's my all-time fav HP character....

My first attempt at fluff. Valentine's Day isn't that far away, after all....

*** I'm always open to more oneshots, though I'm not sure where I'd go from here in this particular fic. I'm so glad you liked it!

** Ahhhh this is amazing! Chef's kiss on the fluff! This was my first ever fic for Harry/Luna Lovegood and this honestly made me fall in love with them! I loved the ending. I loved how Luna is introduced here and rightly said, this needs to be continued. Kudos!

*** Harry/Luna is the OTP in my opinion; they're just so perfect together!

As for this fic, I'm not really sure where it would go from here, but I of course am always willing to consider more oneshots. So glad you liked it, and what an honor to introduce you to this pairing!!!!
