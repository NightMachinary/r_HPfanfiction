I read a story a long time ago, that involved the founders children coming to present day, and being sent back. I remember the Slytherin heir's name was Gareth and was described as looking like Draco.

It was novel length, and I think there was a sequel. I believe the story was complete.

Any clues? I can't remember the title, author or where I read it. Although I am 90% sure it was not FF.net.

EDIT: I know I read it sometime before 2009.


** I think I remember reading something like this years ago over on harrypotterfanfiction.\\
Can't really remember much more than that though, sorry.

****** Oh I know. I remember the Cassandra Claire mess. That's why I was disappointed when I realized it was the Trilogy that I was thinking off. I had thought it was a different story.
