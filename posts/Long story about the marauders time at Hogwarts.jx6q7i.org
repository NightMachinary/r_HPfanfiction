It was definitely over 100k words and IIRC had about 60 chapters. Started with the train ride to hogwarts and talked about all the stories we've heard of the marauders, lily, and snape from their time. James and Sirius originally hate each other.


** Maybe this one linkffn(Against the Moon by Stoplight Delight) ? Sirius and James have a fight on the train and they hate each other in the beginning
