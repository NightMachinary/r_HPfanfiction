I have, through my years of reading HP Fanfiction, seen two common shortenings of Hermione's name. The first one is Mione; I assume it's pronounced mine-y. The second is Herm, which I quite dislike. I just think that Herm sounds... ugly? Not very good nickname for a bright young witch. Mione, on the other hand sounds affectionate and cute

What are your thoughts? Have you heard any other nicknames for Hermione?


** 'Mione would be pronounced "My-oh-nee."

I don't care for any nicknames for her. She doesn't strike me as someone who would appreciate being called a cute name.

*** That's why I can't stand when Harry and Ron call her “Mione”. Perhaps that's me being petty, but that's just how I feel about it.

** I've read some where her nickname is Queen(ie) on account of Ron being "King"

** I've seen many other fanfics with different nicknames but most stem off of Herm, or Mione. I've seen Mine (idk why but most common), I've seen Hermy which is what Grawp calls her and in some fanfics (to make fun of usually), and in a Krum/Hermione fanfic its My Own, I think the author thought it stemmed of of how Krum pronounces her name is Hermyown.

** I've seen Mia which makes no sense if pronounced Mee-uh, and I've seen Mia specifically noted that it's pronounced Maya, which makes a little more sense pronunciation-wise but I don't get why it would be spelled like a different name... I also recall a fic which had her nicknamed Neenee, which makes just as much sense as any other nickname.

** I went for Hermes once in a fic to play around with some Greek god puns but I'll admit it's fairly weak
