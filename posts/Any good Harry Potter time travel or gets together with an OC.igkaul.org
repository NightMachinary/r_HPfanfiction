I remember reading of an hp fanfiction where harry goes back to the marauders time and joins the auror corps, kills the horcruxes and saves Regulus. He also gets married to an OC and tells james, sirius and remus that he is the owner of MoD enterprises. Does anybody remember the title of that story or even the author?

Also, does anybody recommend any good similar plots like the one I stated, they can also be crossovers?
