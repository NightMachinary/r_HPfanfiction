** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/11198][Coulsdon Eagle]]

Hermione's PoV. Was originally on Portkey.org. She does some magic that makes her name come out of the goblet instead of Harry's. Why I will always want more of this fic: it simply ends at the end of book 4. There are changes to the timeline due to the different name coming being selected, but we never get to see how the larger story unfolds.

#+begin_quote
  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
