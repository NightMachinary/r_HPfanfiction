A few months ago I posted a discussion of wether or not there existed a WBWL fanfiction in which cannon Harry gets Transported to an alternate reality with a twin, is the Real BWL but people think its his brother, His parents DO NOT Neglect him, and he is working in the shadows to stop the war before it even begins. Found out there is no such fic with this concept, so I'm trying to write a fic with this premise. Any suggestions will be appreciated, and as this will be my first fic ever (if I write it Lol), then I'll link it here amd hope I get positive reviews. What do you think?


** I usually don't like twin fics, especially the ones where harry gets neglected or such, but your story sounds promising. And hopefully you'll give Harry his own set of friends (since the BWL is going to befriend Ron for sure and perhaps Hermione). One thing though, please don't name the other twin Nick. I saw one fic with that name and I cannot fathom why "Nick". Anyways, I'll be looking forward to the link!

*** Nah I'll probably be using Henry or something understandable and not outlandish like Justin or something else xD

** What I would find interesting would be if Harry and his twin come from a reality where no one could find out who was actually attacked that night and instead of reaching a conclusion they're both declared the boys-who-lived (or some such) get transported to an alternate reality were his twin is the actual bwl and their reality's version of Harry and his twin who were super incompetent were replaced by these hypercompetent ones.

** The idea bouncing in my head is more along the lines of harry is an immortal soul, someone who's soul bounces from life to life maybe due to a curse or something in a previous life so he technically lives forever and as you'd expect of someone who's lived that long he's a tad well versed in magic from other lifetimes and when voldy casts the curse to kill his twin he casts a protection spell that causes the whole explosion and stuff, gives harry a bit of amnesia and kind of stunts his magic power..like compared to his twin ( the boy who lived) he's not as magically powerful but he more than makes up for it with versatility and knowledge from working with various kinds of magic from his pasts.

Then I'd have him do his own thing, like maybe a different school like in harry potter and the boy who lived, like have him actually explore the magical world and things that could've been a result of magic, maybe some holiday's would've have an uncharted style adventure in lost tombs/ ancient cities..because learning new things helps keep most of his sanity in tact, of course he'll still help with the Voldemort stuff but it won't really worry him till voldy comes back in fourth year .

*** I like this, but the whole premise is for him to be reincarnated (Isekai'd lmao) and so he could destroy the Horcruxes early on, so he could target the death eaters amd bring reforms through the wizengamot. I honestly think I should have him travel after destroying the horcruxes as a treat, and maybe he gets into shenanigans like in Make A Wish, like for the summer breaks or something. Maybe he finds something in his travels to take down Voldemort's forces more effectively and kinda (accidentaly) forms alliances with magical creatures to stunt his Forces. It'll be cool, that's for sure.

**** True, it would be nice, but you'd kind of be making Voldemort look bad, as one of the most terrifying wizards of his time most fanfics don't do him enough justice.

I'd probably leave out the horcruxes till like 4th or 5th year and either make them harder to destroy or harder to find, so along his adventures he may find something that helps his brother destroy thereby playing a major part in the war.

Alliances would be nice, I feel a great deal of magical creatures are never represented properly.

And lastly I'm not thinking of an isekaid protagonist, my version of harry isn't coming into that world with Harry Potter knowledge as I feel that is overdone and a bit too cliched as it won't really present adequate challenge if he's jumping into the world with an almanac of everything.

***** Alternate reality, so horcruxs are in a different location

or this voldemort is far more sane then his counterpart and much more cunning as a result

** quite a few things come to mind:

1. Go to [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and go to their (Harry potter) beta section, go to the end of the listings (people who joined later are listed later and are typically more active). Try to find one for you (if their profile hasn't been updated in a year they probably won't respond)
2. This rose so, so many red flags. This type of story is the kind that I am hyper-aware of Harry being able to breeze through all his problems, and while I love charter bashing sometimes, I tend to find it comes along with more outlandish and black and white uninspired writing of the charters. Be aware.
3. Story's don't continue because there is conflict, they continue because there is some event that the reader desperately wants to see happen (that isn't a foregone conclusion), and it hasn't happened yet. There can even be multiple of these and they something like 'what crazy thing will this charter do next?'(pretty weak) or 'how will the charter secure this alliance' or 'what would Harry's parents do if they knew blank' figure out what the reader wants to know, make sure it's not a forgone conclusion and when there are none of these (that aren't forgone conclusions) the story is over.
4. Read some stories similar to the one you're trying to write, see where some of them go wrong and where the others go wright.
5. Accept that it will turn out poorly. It might be good for a first story but only practice makes good writing and you don't have that. Just have fun with it and learn from it.
