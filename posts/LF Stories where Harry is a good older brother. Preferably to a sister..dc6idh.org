  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Twenty years after a falling out with the rest of the Marauders, Remus Lupin has completely cut himself off from the wizarding world and opened a restaurant in the muggle one.

  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!

Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.\\
So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

** Linkffn(12597395) is a MoD Harry and the sibling relationship between him and his brother (who's older in this universe but uh, Harry's been around the block a few times so he's definitely the older brother) is just wholesome and sweet. Definitely one of my favorites!

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** It's crazy angsty (and dials up the Dursley abuse a /lot/; plus it's got the whole "Charlus and Dorea Potter were Harry's grandparents thing which drives me nuts), but linkffn(Charlie Potter and the Irritating Older Brother) is a twinfic oneshot in which Harry isn't the BWL, was sent to the Dursleys by his very much alive parents for nebulous reasons, and is (framed as) a good older brother.

Edit: same author has some twincest fics that are, ironically, less offensive.

*** They're the only Potters ever shown in the original canon, and were the only available names for over a decade. So good luck getting people to start using the new names.

**** I'm aware of that; it doesn't make it any less of a pet peeve for me.

Edit: I find it interesting that my complaining about this particular piece of fanon got downvoted on a sub that tends to rail against fanon.

****** I gotta be honest here: I hate pottermore on basically every level and have never sought out any of the information on/from it, but I really like Fleamont as James' dad's name, just 'cause it's so stupid.

  When Voldemort is restored to full power at the end of their sixth year, the Potter twins are finally reunited, ready to fight Voldemort together. Alive!Potters, jealous(but not evil/stupid)!Ron, Harry/OC, OC/undecided (not Hermione). Oneshot for now, but I'll be adding to it somewhere in the distant future.
