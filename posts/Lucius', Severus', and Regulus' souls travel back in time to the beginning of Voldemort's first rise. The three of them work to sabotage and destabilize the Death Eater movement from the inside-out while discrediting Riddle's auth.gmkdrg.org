They may also sniff out a few rats, send some anonymous notes to anti-Voldy persons of interest (plural), and gratuitously roll their eyes at the needlessly reckless, ostentatiously dramatic, and - at times - short-sighted and altogether Gryffindoorish acts from the Order of the Fowl Flambeyed. Some overdue family drama may also appear as an unwanted distraction at the worst possible moments.


** I imagine lucius would actually want to help voldemort rise because he would benefit from it and as the oldest of the three he would be in the best spot too with him being several years older then both servus and regulus being six years older then the other too

I imagine regulus and snape would be surprised by how different the timeline is by the time they are old enough to change stuff

** The big issue is that no one of them has any hope of surviving an encounter with Voldemort. Of all Death Eaters, the only one whom I'd give a chance at fighting their way out would be Bellatrix, and even that would be far from certain. And we are not talking about defeating him here but merely escaping. If Snape or Lucius tried a smear campaign, they'd be killed pretty quickly.

Voldemort had one equal, Dumbledore. He was able to take on the best of the Order on his own and fight them at least to a stalemate. He wiped out entire families single-handedly. He is an one-man killing machine whom Harry only defeated through deus-ex circumstances.

Honesty, the best possible outcome would be for Regulus to die publicly and become an anti-Voldemort martyr. Snape is too irrelevant (no family connections or influential friends) and there don't seem to be any other Malfoy's around.

At least with the Blacks, there're a dozen or more of them, quite a few with marriage ties.

*** I would argue that "Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin" doesn't fit at all. Regulus doesn't even get introduced until nearly the end of "The Secret Enemy" and they don't all three of the characters I mentioned come together until the beginning of Book 3 "The Death Eater Menace" (which I love, btw). ;]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Lucius does not have to suddenly be an all-inclusive teddy bear in order to decide he doesn't want himself or his family to be under Voldemort's thumb. He doesn't have to be anti-bigot to be a 'good guy' in the sense that he chooses to fight on the 'right' side because 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend', and all that. It's canon that ol' Voldy did not care so much about the pure blood as he claimed. Case-in-point: disciplining his followers with torture tactics and hand-waving or outright ignoring the attacks on and guiltless killing of purebloods who were politically against his tyrannical regime, and sending his Death Eaters to kill a Pureblood toddler from a Pureblooded family.

*** He was never really a blood purist, he just backed whomever he thought was most powerful. The Malfoys have muggleborns on their family tree. Now that he knows he backed a loser, he'd grab a chance to back a winner instead.

*** Lucius is a Slytherin through and through. If he knew of the future, he would probably try and help the winning side, if he realized with absolution that the dark side would indeed lose.
