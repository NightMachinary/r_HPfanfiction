:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic I read years ago and the only thing I really remember is that about mid way through Harry makes a crystal tower that turns anyone who touches it into stone. Im pretty sure it just sort of sprouted from the ground. And I'm almost certain that it's not the only magical building he created. If this rings a bell for anyone I'd really appreciate a name for it. I've tried Google searches and keyword searches on both FF.net and ao3 and I can't find anything.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.
