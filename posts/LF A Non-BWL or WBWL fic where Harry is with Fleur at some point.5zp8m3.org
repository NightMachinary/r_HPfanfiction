Thanks, hope this isn't too repetitive of a request.


** Well, there's Deprived, which I'm sure everyone knows about. Linkffn(7402590)

There's Feral, which isn't that good but it's a fun guilty pleasure fic. Linkffn(10831723)

There's A Veela's Gateway, which is pretty much Quiddich player Harry meets Fleur at Beauxbatons. Linkffn(8526663)

*** Man, one day I will finish Deprived. Every year or so I pick it, can't remember why I stopped. It's decent but not too cringy... and then I get to the part where his Rage is a giant armored man. I nope out so hard every time.

  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?

**** It's one of the best fanfics on the site, and pretty much the best WBWL fic ever written. I don't know if it's abandoned, since the author is still writing other fics, but it hasn't been updated in a while.

**** I'd say it has a good chance of being abandoned considering it hasn't been updated since 2012 bit it is one of the best fanfics that I have read, even better because I'm not usually a WBWL fan
