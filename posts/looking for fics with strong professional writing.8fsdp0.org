Is there anything on a par with rowling's writing?


** The Changeling! I love the writing style in it, I think it's better than the books (but that could just be me). I feel like everytime I comment on this subreddit I always end up recommending it because I think it's the best.

** I'm not sure if you want something that captures the tone and whimsy of the Harry Potter world or that just is professionally written. If you just want professional and well written stories that opens things up.

** The top 3 best, most professionally and exquisitely written HP fanfiction stories that I've managed to find so far were

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] by Lightning on the Wave (~3KK WL, complete);
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][/Elizium for the Sleepless Souls/]] by Voice of the Nephilim (52K WL, Complete);
- and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/The Well Groomed Mind/]] by Lady Khali (190K WL, incomplete).

/The Sacrifices Arc/ has such beautiful prose that the simple act of reading of some passages was a pleasure of its own. Even if the story has some problems (with plot design, with some parts being overly stretched out, with some characters being so frustrating that if you're not careful they may give you blood pressure problems, etc).

/Elizium/ is a shorter story that nevertheless adheres to high enough standards of writing to be a published book of its own (if it wasn't for the whole derivative fanfiction thing).

/The Well Groomed Mind/ --- excellent prose quality, but unfortunately unfinished and with some other issues as well.
