** I cannot read Harmony. I can't do it. I slogged through a Harmony fic recently, and it was harsh. However there are a few exceptions to this such as when they naturally become best friends and the relationship is a slow burn. (The Cupboard Under The Stairs Series is my favorite of these).

Harry/anyone else is normally okay. Drarry normally is all about how taboo being gay is, and with Draco to boot. Snarry is again taboo and not really interesting. HP/LV is normally about how Harry turns to LV for some reason falls in love with Voldemort and goes from there.

Honestly, my opinion of Slash in this sub is not very high as I can't think of one that doesn't make it a massive deal that Harry is with someone who isn't female.

That being said, my OTP is Harry/Daphne (for fanon) or Harry/Ginny if done correctly. Nothing is as satisfying as finding good stories featuring these two.

*** It's not the slash that I dislike, it's who it's with.

Drarry is like Harry / Annoying Pansy

Snarry is like Harry / Umbridge in my mind.

And these are the two most common pairings. Harry / Neville I can live with, Harry / Ron: Probably too, never seen it before. Sirius / Remus: Not my favorite, but why not? But I still dislike Snarry and Drarry.

**** Well said (I still don't like slash, but this voices exactly my problem with those exact pairings! Harry would probably rather string Draco up by his entrails than have a relationship with him (remember this asshole tormented him for years in school and his family supports Voldemort!) and the same goes for Snape who is guilty of telling Voldemort the prophecy and so got Harry's parents killed!)

*** Harry/Ginny is great when people write it well, as you say. Whenever I write Draco/Harry I try to write them without *pointig out* that they're gay. I mean, if they're in a relationship it's clear that they're attracted to each other. I extremely dislike Harry/Hermione. They're frankly boring, even in the better written fics.

**** I normally agree with you that Harry/hermione is boring. But there is in my mind a difference between Harry/Hermione and Harmony fics. Harmony fics are so predictable that it isn't worth reading. While Harry Hermione could actually be interesting. I read a fic recently where it was Harry Hermione and by the end of it Hermione and Harry weren't even dating due to what happened in the plot. But when it started it was a major plot point, thus the pairing was a thing.

*** linkao3(2457953)

The title is cheesy as all get-out, but it's a Slash fic that is completely canon compliant, including the epilogue, with two exceptions. One, Snape doesn't die, he's just horribly injured and in a coma for years. And two, Draco's wife, Astoria, dies before Scorpius starts at Hogwarts. The characters are very true to canon characterisations.

I will agree that /many/ Slash fics play up the homophobia or the taboo or whatever. But not all of them do. And many fics make the characters completely OOC. But again, not all. You have to dig through a lot of crap, but there are good ones out there.

** Harry/Fleur- I feel the dynamics of mutually misunderstood creatures getting together would be interesting, more so than most people make it out. Next there's the fact that Fleur is a Veela, which makes for some interesting Smut scenes.

Harry/Daphne- Most Common in Edge Lord Potter fics, though, when done well it's done well. I've read several Haphne fics that dwarf most Harry/Hermione fics in ability to evoke general emotion for a relationship. Mainly because a walking plot device is hard to put into a relationship.

Gen- GENreally my favourite one, I like the idea of Harry being too into the War or too into himself to really want a female companion to bring into his extremely dangerous life. Harry himself thought it was for the best in the Original Series when he broke up with Ginny at the end of HPB, so I would just assume that, like in reality, he would have realised all of this much earlier in the graveyard.

Bonus Round- C-c-c-c-combo breaker

Harry/Goblin Princess that for some reason just looks like a green human with pointy ears

Harry/Natasha Rominov

Harry/Lily Evans Potter's Ghost

Harry/Elder Wand that manifests as Human Female

Harry/Hogwarts that manifests as Human Female (I could just imagine this in a crack fic where it all turns out to be Magic Mushroom (literally) induced hallucinations and he just ends up humping the side of the school and probably sticking his wanker into some poor Hufflepuff first year's dorm window).

There are a few where I enjoy it, but those tend to be rare. I don't think I have ever read one where I felt like the lack of romance affected the fic negatively though.

Do you have any fics that you feel do romance really well? I would be interested to read ones that are good. Any pairing is fine, as long as the romance is developed at least somewhat realistically. Thanks!

As for recommendations, id have to go through my giant list and pick some out, but one I recently read that imo was done quite realistically was Days to come linkffn(10728064) It had one of those slow developing friends who don't realize they are falling for each other deals (although to be fair there is a small bit of Ginny bashing but its treated right and doesn't ram your head into it and well at the end.... you will see if you read it haha)

**** As long as it's not the main plot-point (relationship? Fine, I like that and I also think something is missing if the main character basically doesn't seem to have any hormones (damned, Harry is a freaking teenager! Most of those do like the opposite (or same) sex and they will have relationships, not that they last long in most cases!))! It can be an important plot-point, but not the single most important one!

ps: That's one of my peeves: Harry (or other fanfiction character) getting together with his/her one true love without flings, without short term relationships, no one-night-stands etc....this isn't realistic at all!

** Harry/Fleur --- my absolute favourite pairing. As a certain (in)famous DLP post teaches, it's devilishly difficult to get right for all sorts of reasons, but when it's done right, it's absolutely amazing. Probably more than half of my favourite stories are H/F ("A Cadmean Victory", "The Lie I've Lived", "Deprived", etc.). The bad ones are too reliant on "veela-bonding" bullshit, mostly because I think their authors can't be arsed to properly solve the challenge of bringing the two characters together and making them interested in each other (I will admit that I'll probably still read all but the worst fics).

Harry/Gabrielle --- we are seeing a pattern emerging here... (which I swear has nothing to do with me projecting my IRL four-year-long crush on a rather charming and intelligent blonde French girl I know into fanfics!) In general, I like it for much of the same reasons as H/F, though Gabrielle is a sufficiently distinct character and perhaps more 'at Harry's level', so to speak. Most authors will age her up to deal with the obvious age-gap problem, although a good way of getting around that is to have a fresh-out-of-school or final year Gabrielle with an older war-veteran-Harry. Here the quintessential H/G story is, I think, "Hope" by Jeconais, which is often criticised as too "fluffy" or cloyingly sweet---though perfect for a hopeless romantic such as myself.

Harry/Daphne (or Harry/Astoria) --- since in either case you are creating a character from scratch (practically nothing is known about the Greengrass sisters canonically), I tend to see the two as more or less interchangeable. I guess I like the pairing as I vastly prefer stories where Harry is powerful and intelligent (though not necessarily dark) as well as Slytherin!Harry, and it tends to work well in those.

Other than that, provided it's not slash and well written, I'd still give it a go, though that starts to be the point where I judge by fic quality first (whereas I would be willing to read even mediocre fics with the above pairings). I find H/Hr has a ridiculously high shit-to-diamonds ratio, at least on FFN, and I don't like H/Ginny because of the disastrous way it was done in canon.

Also, since I am somewhat of a traditionalist (and because writing a proper relationship between more than two people is practically impossible), I tend to stick to monogamous pairings. H/multi (even the rather tantalising idea of what someone once described as "Harry in a Delacour sandwich") I find makes for good smut but poor drama.

** I will always read Harry/Hermione as it was the pairing I wanted in the series but never got. For that same reason I often don't like Harry/Ginny pairings but really well done ones get a pass ;)

As for other Harry pairings I like.... well to be honest I am pretty darn flexible when it comes to the main pairings.

Harry/Luna or Harry/Fleur are usually my favorites outside Hermione and usually I like them more than Hermione, but it does heavily depend upon how the writer portrays them. Sometimes its great, other times disastrous.

I also have always had a thing for Harry/Daphne because of how flexible a character she can be (because of her blank slate nature). She can literally become almost anyone.

I also enjoy Harry/Multi but only if the author doesnt go overboard. Harry/Luna/Hermione or Harry/Fleur/Tonks, or Harry/Daphne/Tracy are fine. Harry+2-3 others max is about my limit before it starts getting a bit annoying.

I also do tend to enjoy usual pairings like Harry/Bellatrix. And Gabriel or Astoria being aged up a bit and thrown into the mix either with others or alone with Harry can be fun if done right.

Note* I don't read main character slash so usually Harry/Male is not remotely interesting to me.

** I don't really care, tbh. The only pairings that will make me actually ignore some glaring problems with a fic is anything with Bellatrix (timetravel Black or present time Lestrange).

I just love the character of Bellatrix and a lot of the fanon added to her.

** I could say everything but Harry/Ginny-the-chest-monster ;) but that wouldn't be totally accurate!

I can't stand slash either!

Other than that I read everything with a preference for Harry/Slytherin-Girl (or Ravenclaw-Girl) and Harry/Fleur or Nymphadora Tonks!

Also: Harry older witch is also something I love :)

** I like Snape/Lupin, when the writer keeps them as damaged and somewhat difficult adult men, rather than making them cute and sappy. I also have a weakness for Dudley/Millicent and Oliver/Percy.

I will give most pairings a try, but I do tend to avoid anything involving Bellatrix or Voldemort.

** I like Sevmione, Myric and Pinch stories, so long as the romance is a subplot and not the raison d'etre of the fic.

Story is king and I prefer a meaty plot if it centres around a pair of characters I like so much the better.

** I'm wary of Harmony. It's not that it /can't/ work, it's that I really don't enjoy how the characters are usually depicted by Harmony shippers. I'd trust such a story more from an author who also writes other ships.

I do enjoy Dramione a lot, although not the ones that try to make Draco some sort of cool bad boy. I prefer him overly dramatic and struggling to come to terms with serious shifts in his self image and understanding of the world. Similarly, I like the idea of him with Luna (although she's absurdly difficult to write), or Astoria.

I have an incredible soft spot for rare pairings. And I like to see Hermione in relationships that encourage her Slytherin side.

Drarry can work (they're certainly obsessive enough in canon), but there's a lot of dreck.

It might be because my OTP (Hermione/Viktor) is so rarely written that I'm far more concerned with the implementation of a ship than what ship it is exactly.

** I LOVE Draco/Ginny. I can't believe no one has mentioned this pairing!

There's just something about the forbidden fruit aspect and the fact that they both have such strong personalities (in the books) that I loooove. I especially love it if it's a Harry/Ginny/Draco love triangle.

Ron/Luna - I feel like they're both pretty funny and laid back people. I don't like it when it's the MAIN pairing in a fic, but it's nice reading them as a fun little side couple.

Harry/Luna, Lily/James, Sirius/OC, Snape/Hermione, Lupin/Hermione are all pretty fun too if done right.

** Harry/hermione/ron or Harry/Hermione. Though, that is if none of the characters are reduced to a mockery of themselves.

Though, I prefer next to no romance at all if possible. So gen?
