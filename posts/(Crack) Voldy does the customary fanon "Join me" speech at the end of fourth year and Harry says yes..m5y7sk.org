*WARNING: CRACK PROMPT! Also Bitter!Harry after people turned against him in 4th year*

"Potter, join me!" Voldemort said importantly.

"Yes." Harry said without hesitation. "Now please, let me down."

"We can be great together and-Wait, what?" Voldemort wheeled around to stare at Harry, his expression mirroring those of all the death eaters. "You're joining me?"

"I did say yes." Harry retorted in a matter-of-fact tone. "Now please let me down, these ropes are uncomfortable."

"Wait, why are you joining me?" Voldemort asked, now overcome with curiosity as the death eaters all stared still.

Harry snorted. "Have you seen the wizarding world? They turn against me with the cue of a single word. First because I'm parseltongue, then because I was entered into this tournament that your people placed me in."

Voldemort stared dumbly as well.

"If they wanted me to be their savior, they really should have more confidence in me. How am I supposed to defeat you or whatever when they could randomly hate me for using an-" Harry turned sarcastic. "-an evil, wile disarming spell to defeat you?" he followed that up with an overdramatic gasp. "Now please, free me so we can talk this through."

Voldemort blinked a few times before the words "free me" registered. "Oh. Um... Wormtail, release him?"

Peter Pettigrew, also very confused, untied Harry but kept his wand.

"Now," Harry said as he rolled his shoulder a few times. "I assume this isn't recorded?"

Voldemort and several death eaters nodded, utterly confused.

"I'm willing to work out a contract of working beneath you, just don't give me the Dark Mark, the Boy-Who-Lived can't have that or he's suddenly the new Dark Lord." Harry laughed bitterly. "So, how about it?"


** "Firstly, do you have biscuits? Mrs. Weasley always makes the best biscuits and she'd be part of the Order for sure."

"Don't be ridiculous, Potter, we are Death Eaters. We do not have -- what /is/ it Avery?"

"Sir? My wife makes us biscuits every meeting. You, erm, you insist I bring them."

"Do I? I don't remember that."

"Well. It wasn't so much insisting as throwing /Crucio/ around when they didn't show up."

"That does ring a bell...."

"Sir!"

"What is it, Rosier?"

"Can I bring toffee?"

"Why in Merlin's... Sure, Rosier, bring your toffee."

"OH!"

"Not you, Crabbe. Please."

"I've almost got my meat pie recipe down. Muggle spices, that's the secret ingredient!"

"Why.... What the... there are no such... UGH! Okay. Let's get back on topic. Potter. You will be my apprentice in exchange for, what? A potluck at the meetings?"

"Well, that's just part of it. I really just want to be in a cool club where I'm not ridiculed --"

"Fat chance."

"-- Or ostracized or have any undo pressure set upon me for circumstances outside of my control. You know. You leave me alone and I do the same, like real people."

"Have you met us?"

"Secondly..."

--------------

"Potter! Do you like the treacle? It's my house elf's recipe, but don't tell anyone." Goyle offered a conspiratorial wink.

--------------

"I'm sorry, Bella, you simply can't be part of the Lord's inner circle without proving yourself."

"You... WHAT?! I'm the Lord's most /loyal/ servant! I've slain hundreds of Muggles and dozens of wizards!"

"Sure, but your strawberry jam was obviously store-bought and lest we speak of beef stew disaster..."

"That was /NOT/ my fault! Who knew Coriander and Cilantro were the same plant!"

** /For the inevitable Dumbledore-Harry confrontation-/

"It's over Harry," Dumbledore said calmly. "I have the bigger wand."

Harry stared at him, his emerald orbs filled with hatred. "You underestimate the size of my magical core."

"Don't try it, my boy"

Harry slashed his new seven core wand. A fiery basilisk emerged from his wand, advancing upon Dumbledore with the intent to kill him.

Dumbledore sighed heavily. With a flick of his own wand, he dispelled the Fiendfyre knock-off. A thick set of ropes emerged from his wand almost simultaneously, flying towards Harry with incredible speed.

"Oh shi-," Harry could barely blink before the ropes binded him. A particularly vicious coil tripped him, even as he looked up to face Dumbledore.

"You were the Chosen One, Harry," Dumbledore said, his twinkle™ suspiciously absent from his manipulative blue eyes. "It was said that you would destroy Lord Voldemort, not join him."

Harry glared at Dumbledore with his AK green eyes. A lesser wizard would have collapsed under his ocular assault; Dumbledore simply sighed.

"You were like a son to me Harry. I loved you."

"I hate you."

Dumbledore's eyes hardened. "Well, tough luck, you lil' shit. I'm not going to let you become an edgelord like that Voldemort fellow. We'll be paying a visit to Madam Pomfrey first. Molly would never forgive me if she saw that terrible contusion on your head."

** Harry Potter was in pain.

Voldemort's siege on Hogwarts had been a disaster. The Death Eaters had been routed and slaughtered by Dumbledore's forces. Harry and the Dark Lord himself had both been captured and taken to the dungeons to await the inevitable destruction of all their Horcruxes.

He wanted to cry. He still remembered the look of hatred and fury on the faces of his former best friends as they dueled, defeating him with far less effort than Harry would ever admit. In a fit of childish pique, he had aligned himself with monsters and lost everything.

Students would occasionally come by his cell in the Hogwarts dungeons to "give the Golden Boy a welcome back gift." Harry's face often had a new bruise or welt by the time they left. The food they gave him was raw and the students would often throw it at him rather than hand it over.

The latest "meal" had been delivered to him by two girls - one with long, blonde hair wearing Ravenclaw robes and the grimly smirking Ginny Weasley.

"Wake up, Potter." spat Ginny "Can't have you dying just yet, you traitorous bastard." Ginny's brother had not been to see Harry. Neither had Hermione. Seamus Finnegan had come and gone into extreme detail about Weasley and Granger's torid affair, following his abandonment of the light. They were having their "own private victory celebration" in the Gryffindor tower and seemed to have forgotten Harry existed, if Finnegan was telling the truth.

Ginny's companion set down a tray containing what looked like putrid gruel. It would be all Harry ate that day. Injustice burned in him. With Voldemort, he had been given feasts in the Malfoy and Greengrass manors. Now he was reduced to this.

"Filthy Mudblood fucker." spat Harry. In a split-second, Ginny's boot had connected wirh his face. The tears came running down Harry's face as blood gushed from his nose and teeth tumbled out of his mouth.

"Pathetic shit." snarled Ginny "Let's go Luna."

Luna fixed the sobbing Boy Who Lived with a look of pity.

"After all the stories, I'd have thought you'd be somewhat impressive." she said dreamily as the duo departed, leaving the snivelling bastard they had once admired, alone in the dark and cold cell once again.

**** Yup, unless it is an AU extreme enough to not actually have Voldemort, just an OC with the same alias, which is kind of a waste.

Personally I feel that Harry just breaking off with the order/Dumbledore and doing his own thing about the war -not necessarily creating his own faction, just, like, trying to find out Voldemort's plans or just wait for him and duel him (no chance in hell of Voldemort leaving him alone even if Harry was somehow willing to excuse his parent's killer and without Dumbledore Harry has no way of knowing about the Horcrux).

Alternatively, if he absolutely /must/ make nice with a dark wizard then Grindelwald is a much more realistic option. Yeah, he is also a genocidal maniac who committed unspeakable crimes against humanity, but he never really went after Harry or his family so it wouldn't be quite as personal, specially when we consider that Harry neither grew up around people who spoke with him at length about the havoc Grindewald rained on Europe nor studied at length the war. Plus, considering his experience with the Dursley's and his neighbors in relation to how he feels about his mother and his friendship with Hermione, plus simple rationality to debunk the whole Blood Supremacy argument, I can see Harry be more willing to side against muggles rather than muggleborns, comparatively speaking that is.
