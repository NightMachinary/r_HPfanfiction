What it says on the tin ... Functional, appreciable anti-heroes in hpfanfic?


** That seems to be something really hard to pull off. Either people pull up too short and you end up with a "woe is me" tragic hero, or go too far and you end up with Sasuke Uchiha circa Itachi's death.

** I actually like main character of Echoes by BlackDeviouseRose ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11763334/1/]]). It's semi-insert-ish original character who, upon realising where she is, didn't want to have anything to do with it, at all. She wanted home and her loving family of previous life, but it was unreachable to her and started slow descent into madness. Enter Cedric Diggory, who doesn't really understand the apathetic young student and decides to befriend her, worming his way into her life. I don't want to be throwing spoilers, but she is antihero in her own right, not wanting to help, not planning on doing anything, later only driven by her own goals that have nothing to do with rightness or greater good. You can also see that the construction of character is pretty solid there.

** Knowledge is Power by Fettucini/Oblong/whateverhisnameis. It's reposted by Defenstrable.

There are cliches, yes, but this fic is well over a decade old.

Harry in this fic often does the right thing but most times for the wrong reasons. He's mainly motivated by self-interest, revenge and a bit or narcissism.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
