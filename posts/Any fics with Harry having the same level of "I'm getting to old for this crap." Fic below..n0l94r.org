It can be time travel, dimensional travel, or even a SI(never seen that combination). I just want Harry to have the same, or as close to, mindset as Harry in this fic. Stories only 1500 words, nowhere near enough in my opinion, but I want a full story like this so bad.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
