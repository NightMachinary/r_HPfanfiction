** I would say most dark, grey, and indy Harrys qualify.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), does it extremely well. This Harry not only sets up his opponents on the tactical level, but also on strategical and geo-political levels. Of course, he also faces enemies far more sophisticated than that canon monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain in Voldemort.

The Harry in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is in author's own words "a very dangerous young man". [[/spoiler][The Final Battle was planned and setup by the Trio with their followers beforehand. Although they had suffered some serious losses, they killed far more enemies.]]

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I don't think this is exactly what you're looking for, but it might interest you?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]]

It's not a full fic, but I enjoyed it a lot.

I'm specifically talking about the chapters where Harry takes a pragmatic approach to winning the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

*** Not really. Harry reacts, a combat pragmatist would be the one setting up the battlefields, luring his enemies to him. Like using voldemort's name to attack and kill snatchers using a claymore as is displayedcin some fics.

**** Linkffn(His Mother's Love by White Squirrel) He sets up the final battle battle with Voldemort like this.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fate We Make) This is how the Battle of Hogwarts goes down. It only gets reactionary at the Battle of the Ministry.
