I read a story years ago and I can't remember the title. Harry starts the story with a career-ending quidditch injury and returns to Hogwarts as the Transfiguration professor. He and Ginny re-connect and end up marrying at Hogwarts, where Hermoine (now an Unspeakable) gives him the present of the 'shades' of his parents and Sirius returning for his wedding. I don't remember much else, but there were some interesting concepts. Help?


** In a magical world where one can /regrow/ bones, what kind of injury would end a career? Brain damage?

*** Loss of limb? Maybe broom explosion leading to magical injuries? Literally swallowed the snitch (and it ends up in the stomach)? Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus, and since we know that Astronomy is a magical subject this makes it literally impossible for him to see the snitch, and just the snitch? And wasn't there some ref who somehow ended up lost in the Sahara or something during a game?

Possibilities are endless, yo

**** Got a laugh out of that last one but I'm pretty sure the rest would be magically curable.

Seems like damn near everything that isn't caused by dark magic or a magical disease is curable.

But sure, as plot devices go, it's fine lol.

***** Turns out it requires a Virgin Sacrifice to make a snich (fortunately animals work), so they're dark magic. Wounds caused by the snitch can't be healed magically, hence the phrase "Snitches get stitches."

***** What happened to Lockhart shows that a magical object being broken and trying to use it can cause unfixable effects, so I don't see why there can't be career ending Quidditch injuries from things like brooms, snitches, bludgers and whatnot breaking, or having been tampered with. Frankly, as long as the fic is internally consistent, I'm fine with almost anything.

*** Too many injuries? Legs chafing fro being on the broom for so long?
