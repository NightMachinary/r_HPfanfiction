Hey there folks,

I'm looking for two one shots that someone described to me, but they can't remember the name of said fics.

The first one is about how and why Harry cast Imperious Curse on Ron to cheat on Hermione. The explanation behind this was something like this: "Harry wants to be with Hermione because he heard that daughters become like their mothers physically when they grow up. He sees Molly and thus doesn't want to be with Ginny then he sees Mrs Granger and thinks he wants to be with Hermione"

The second one was about both Hermione and Harry giving each other love potions probably unwilling. It starts with Hermione's pov about what happened and then we do everything again but from Harry's pov.

Anyone has any ideas what those two fics could be?

  Six months after the final battle, things change. Betrayal with a twist. Rated for language and sex. One-shot.

  What if Hermione had an unhealthy obsession of Harry. What if she went to the extreme to get him.
