** Grindelwald was a worldwide threat defeated in a legendary duel by one of the greatest wizards of all time.

Voldemort was a British terrorist defeated by an infant.

More seriously, it depends on what you want in a Dark Lord. Grindelwald was a magic Bond villian while Voldemort was channeling Emperor Palpatine.

"Did you ever hear the story of Grindelwald the Wise?"

"No"

"I thought not. It's not a story Dumbledore would tell you. It's a dark wizards legend. Gellert Grindelwakd was a Dark Lord, so powerful and so wise he could use magic to create life... He had such a knowledge of dark magic, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying."

"He could actually save people from death?"

"The dark side of magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."

"What happened to him?"

"He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

"Is it possible to learn this power?"

"Not from Dumbledore."

*** Agreed. Why do you think that Grindelwald doesn't get the same credit as Voldemort most of the time in cannon then? Oversight on JKR's part?

If we loosely compare him to Hitler who was a defining character that's still talked about today, Grindelwald's only mentioned once in book one and four? Then only again in DH. Binns doesn't even cover it and no one mentions his ideology.

You'd think that what's widely considered the greatest magical war would make a blip on the radar in terms of impact on Wizarding culture despite how ‘isolated' the brits are relative to their neighbours.

** I was always fascinated by how everyone described Voldemort in the first wizarding war. We see a lot of his flaws during his second rise after his resurrection, but I honestly wanna learn about the orphan with the muggle surname who managed to get the heirs of the most powerful, wealthy, and pure-blood supremacist families to throw themselves at his feet and beg for his attention.

*** I'm also curious about that. Sure, he gets into Slytherin. How long does it take for him to realise he'd need to lie about himself through his teeth, before he discovers the link to the Gaunts? Does he blunder? What difficulties does he have? Or does he just continue dragging people away to abandoned places to torture them if he doesn't like them?

**** My headcanon says he's not only a very competent sociopath, but that he knew, in part, that he was the Slytherin heir from his start at Hogwarts. If he had an experience like Harry had -- talking to a snake before he knew about magic -- and wore that badge from the beginning, and proved it, then that would garner a lot of Slytherin followers alone. The fact that he was strong with magic and clever and manipulative in his youth could have turned a lot of support to his side. A parselmouth is a rare trait and seems to be uniquely Slytherin. Seeing him talking to snakes, snake statues, or snakes in paintings would all but confirm that he was the heir to their house's namesake and thus an example to be followed.

** Grindelwald because he leaves you more narrative freedom. Riddle is pretty clearly defined, but the canon on G is thin enough to make him into anything you want (from the books, we only know he was dark and that Dumbledore defeated him in 45 in a grand duel).

Want to make him a Lithuanian Noble who began as a freedom fighter against the Imperial Russians and was lead into bitterness by Versailles? Want to make him a Dark Arts mystic? Want to make him into a good figure twisted by propaganda to be evil? Someone who unleashed the Nazis and did not realise that he had opened Pandora's box and then unsuccessfully tried to reign them in?

In comparison, Riddle is a cruel psychopath who was "lucky" enough to have an enormous magical potential to become pure evil instead of simply being beaten up by the other children (be it in the orphanage or in Slytherin).

*** I think the only concession that a canon-friendly interpretation requires is that a younger Dumbledore would have had to agree with his vision of the future. That doesn't mean either character can't change -- Dumbledore losing his sister is an obvious focus -- but whatever concept for Grindelwald you invent, it has to be close enough to big D's personal convictions that it makes the story believable.

I'd personally like to see Albus and Grindelwald sowing revolutions all over the globe during "The Great Muggle War" -- The Bolshevik Revolution, the states of independence from Imperialist nations, etc. The first world war was a great upheaval in terms of Imperialist powers. They would test their "Greater Good" mantra by extending wizard influence in Muggle politics in order to set up independent democracies or socialist governments to further see how the "fast lane" of political discourse works. Muggles live shorter lives, work quicker, and have bigger economies than the magical world, so their examples would set the stage for the future of the magical world. They would depose leaders, sow chaos, install new governments, all in order to see how new systems of governance could benefit the magical world. They treat it like an experiment. Test their government structures with Muggle nations, naturally let them come to their conclusions, and take back the results as tested proof to the wizarding world. This would mean that both Dumbledore and Grindelwald were dissatisfied with how far behind the magical governments were in terms of political expression and felt that changing the system from within the current rules and bounds were nearly impossible. They needed an exampled to point toward. Magical America was hardly without its faults with its witch-trials and native-American genocide.

It's also worth noting that the Great War turned "muggle wars" from isolated conflicts of mostly about borders or self-interested civil wars into an elaborate political game of vested interests and massive economies. That should frighten anyone on the wizarding side to do something about it. If you can drag the entire world into shedding death in the muggle world, then the same could be true in the magical one.

After a personal conflict, a dead father and crippled sister, does Dumbledore find that the game is no longer worth it. Grindy disagrees and continues the work alone, sowing the beginnings of the third Reich, and forces Dumbledore to confront his former friend.

**** My personal headcanon is that Grindelwald was from the Baltic nobility. He came to Britain to gather support and got to know the Dumbledores. G had some form of birthright, he wouldn't just be a random dictator. He fell for Arianna and spun Albus along because he needed an powerful ally/second. Albus realised that he was being played and confronted Grindelwald. Arianna dies and the British public blames the foreigner and not their wonderchild.

Grindelwald swears revenge and runs away to lick his wounds and find other supporters. A few years down the road, Germany is at war with both, the UK and Russia, so he makes common cause with them. Potions and the like in exchange for rule of the Baltic once Russia is defeated. Versailles deposes him and he swears revenge once again. So when the Nazis come along, Grindelwald makes common cause, but driven by bitterness he now doesn't just supply Potions and healing, he modifies V1/2s to be magic homing, he indiscriminately slaughters Russians and so on.

*** It's not so pedantic. The fact that Voldemort made up a new "position" for himself as leader of all dark wizards goes to the core of their characters. Grindelwald felt the need to dress himself in a semi-respectable ideology, whereas Voldemort embraced the fact that he was a dark wizard. Grindelwald was a political threat; Voldemort was a boogeyman. Grindelwald had no ambition to surpass his humanity and was content to be a wizard; Voldemort sought to become more than human and was dissatisfied with merely being a wizard.

*** But the Elder Wand doesn't make a wizard a better duelist. They don't become more talented upon mastering the Elder Wand. There is this misconception that Voldemort is so skilled and held his own against Dumbledore despite the latter wielding the Elder Wand.

What /actually/ happened was Voldemort narrowly avoiding a curbstomp by Dumbledore. Even Voldemort said that Dumbledore wasn't trying to kill him. In the end, Voldemort failed to defeat Dumbledore despite the fact that Dumbledore was holding back and even worse, it was despite the fact he had Bellatrix backing him up. Meaning Voldemort and Bellatrix tag-teamed Dumbledore. Bellatrix got dealt with just as easily as any other Death Eater in her place would have been.

The only notable thing about the Elder Wand is that Harry used it to repair his broken wand. Which is nice, I guess, but repairing a broken wand has no impact on a duel whatsoever. Meaning the Elder Wand's best feat has nothing to do with dueling whatsoever.

I just don't get why people /still/ think the Elder Wand is some top-tier wand that gives its master a massive advantage when it really doesn't. When it comes to actual duels, the Elder Wand has done nothing that couldn't be done by any other wand. Grindelwald was the Elder Wand's master and lost because Dumbledore was more skilled than Grindelwald, not due to wand ownership trickery or being an unexplained exception. Dumbledore trashed both Voldemort and Bellatrix in the Ministry because he was just /that/ skilled of a wizard, and could have done so with or without the Elder Wand.

Dumbledore, using his regular wand, defeated Grindelwald who was the master of the Elder Wand. So Dumbledore never needed the Elder Wand to win the 2-v-1 against Voldemort and Bellatrix, since he never needed the Elder Wand to defeat Grindelwald, who was strongly implied to be much more talented than Voldemort. After all, Grindelwald was "a shade less skillful" than Dumbledore, whereas Voldemort couldn't even beat an older and less active Dumbledore despite having Bellatrix backing him up.

*TL;DR: Dumbledore > Grindelwald > BIG GAP > Voldemort > EVEN BIGGER GAP > Everyone else. The Elder Wand is overrated by the fandom. Voldemort's duel against Dumbledore doesn't make him impressive for dueling the Elder Wand. It makes him pathetic for basically losing his duel to Dumbledore despite outnumbering him 2-to-1 with Bellatrix, despite the advantage of being younger and closer to his prime than Dumbledore, and despite Dumbledore not actually trying to kill Voldemort. Voldemort is far less skilled than Grindelwald because he had so many advantages over Dumbledore and STILL didn't win.*

** Grindelwald probably kill more people, but he did it for what he considered a righteous cause (if you don't know what I'm talking about watch fantastic beasts 2).Volemort on the other hand probably caused people more pain and suffering, and did it because he wanted to. It's tough because we've seen (almost)all of voldemorts story but we've only seen parts of grindelwalds story. I'd say grindelwald is a more successful dark lord but Voldemort is more evil of the two.

** Absolutely Grindelwald, unless we're just defining "better" as whoever was more feared. I couldn't say who was more powerful, though I'm inclined to say Voldemort, but Grindelwald was definitely more successful and capable. He was a threat to the world at large and only lost after a duel with what was at least the most powerful wizard in centuries. Voldemort lasted as long as he did because he ran away a lot, avoided Dumbledore like the fucking plague, and fought a guerrilla war aimed towards destroying everything so he could rule the ashes.
