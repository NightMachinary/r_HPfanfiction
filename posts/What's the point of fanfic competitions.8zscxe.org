I mean, there doesn't seem to be a centralized system for this kind of thing, and most popular fics don't even mention this kind of stuff. The amount of favourites on a fic is no guarantee of quality, of course, but it is a good indicator of exposure. This sub doesn't even mention the things, and no one seems to really care here. So why do people still write for competitions?


** Because it's a way to challenge oneself to write something different, that's why.

*** Don't people have enough idea backlog to last a decade? Because I know that I probably have enough ideas to last years without foreign ideas.

**** Sometimes it's good writing practice to go outside your comfort zone and write something you wouldn't have thought of. I really enjoyed writing a one shot challenge pairing two characters that I had never really thought about before.

**** Perhaps. I'm fine myself, but not everyone has a wealth of ideas, and sometimes, they want something different from what they can think of. They may have a million and one ideas for Remus Lupin stories, but they also like Fenrir Greyback yet have had trouble coming up with a plot bunny to write a story for him. Hence, they go looking at competitions to find one. Then they join it as external motivation to follow through. That's another reason people like them. It's publically out there they've committed themselves to something and even if there's not a deadline on the comp, it's always there, with their name on it, waiting for them to post their final submission.

**** So-So. Some people are really good at coming up with new concepts, while others seemingly rehash the same idea over and over again.

I can understand where people who participate in these competitions come from. Why they do it.I myself would never participate, and I usually dont really like to read stories that were born from such events.

As long as people have fun, no harm done. And some people actually gain quite the experience in writing after "completing" tasks, that have strict guidelines.

Of course, having multiple with different writing styles, use the same base, can lead to interesting results.

** Creative restrictions can lead to some of the best writing. My favourite example of this is the Doctor Who episode Blink, which introduced the Weeping Angels (as well as actually using time travel as more than for getting from A to B). Steven Moffat was told that the series was one episode short, 48 hours before the deadline. The pressure can bring out the best in people. The other restrictions imposed on writing as competition rules can lead to new ideas and clever writing.

More generally, I get the impression that competitions are much more important to the communities that run those competitions. As this sub is a pell mell collection of people from all over the HP fandom, individual competitions don't get brought up as much as the themes won't often appeal to the majority sub (especially since the smaller communities are often based around specific ships).

*** Huh. An in-depth explanation. Thanks for sharing some light for me.

** A deadline is good motivation. If I want to write a story "someday", I'll probably never get around to doing it. If I have to write a 10k-word story in a month, well, that's a lot more specific and somehow seems less daunting.

** It's the challenge to write a good short story to a given situation.

It's quite interesting to see the results of different authors to the same initial situation.\\
It has nothing to do with the fact that the authors don't have a bunch of own ideas. It's nothing wrong to write stories only with own ideas (especially if you are afraid to get into a competition with others. ;-) )

** A competition isn't the same as a challenge, and I'm all for challenges but I'm not keen on fanfiction (or any other sort of writing) being competitive. I know the way the fanfic sites work with comments/kudos/favourites and so on gives the whole business a competitive feel already, but I wish it wasn't that way. Where you have a competition you have winners and losers and it's never much fun to lose.

** Personally, if I see "has been written for X competition" in fanfic summary it's at least +50% chance that I will skip it without entering.
