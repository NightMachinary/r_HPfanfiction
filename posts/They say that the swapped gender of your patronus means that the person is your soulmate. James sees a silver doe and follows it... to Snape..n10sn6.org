#+begin_quote
  So Snape's Patronus is a doe because he's in love with Lily, whose Patronus is a doe because she's in love with James, whose Patronus is a stag... Er, wait a moment, what was that again?

** ok I don't ship them but like...seems like the start of a good James/Snape fanfic. Why don't I see more of this pairing out there? Seems like it would have the same appeal as Harry/Draco.

** Why does everyone always assume James' patronus is a stag?

James' animagus form is a stag.

It is only Harry whose patronus is a stag. So this would be a Snarry fic.
