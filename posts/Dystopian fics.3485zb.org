Fics where society is different from canon (in a mostly negative way)? It could be the subjugation of muggleborns, but doesn't have to be.


** The Firebird Trilogy. Negative doesn't even begin to describe it.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] by LoveHP it could be considered dystopian except that it's Harry of canon HP sent into an alternate dimension.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy]] by Darth Marrs This is the most unique out of the bunch, I don't want to give it away but I will warn that it does take some liberties in terms of magic and such.

    He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

    Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort. VII Ch.8 In which someone is dead, wounded, or kidnapped in every scene.

Your best bets out of these are Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Champion, mostly because these are the closest to being similar to what we know about the magical world. The others take liberties with how magic works.
