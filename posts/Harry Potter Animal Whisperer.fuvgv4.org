/Ever since Harry was young, he always had a way with animals. Every animal he's met (even Ripper and Mrs Figg's cats) before Hogwarts has always liked him and he's gotten along well with them. He also has a few special talents: He can understand and communicate with any animal, can enable animals to speak in human tongue and on occasion, can take on the abilities of an animal (such as the grace of a cat and the ability to swing from trees like monkeys). How will his animal based powers affect his time at Hogwarts and his battles against Voldemort and his forces?/

I was looking through my old fanfiction notes and I found this prompt I once posted on a message board, so I thought I would share it here and see if there would be any takers. I think it would be a really fun read.


** Bloody nice prompt, I can imagine he's learning magic from magical creatures and exploring ways in magical Britain than nobody has ever thoughts

** I think the only one that come close to this is linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them).

For what I recall is not explicit though.

Nice prompt

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** The only one I know of that /isn't/ extremely uncomfortable to read is Likffn(the beastmaster). All the other ones either test their premise to ridiculous degrees, breaking suspension of disbelief, or make me feel so uncomfortable I have to stop reading them.

  Power Dark Lord knows not. Something unique to Harry saved him from an attack by the worst wizard tyrant in centuries. Albus put traumatized boy in a picnic basket, and left him on Aunt's doorstep in the dead of night, note attached, of course. Riiight.

** Not really the same, but this is a SI that interacts with animals as a thing he does... (takes care of Fluffy and stuff)

** That happens in this fic, except it's just magical creatures. This fic is also nice because it's a reversal on the trope where Harry inherits an abundance of wealth upon entering the wizarding world.

*** this was very good and humbling to have a struggling Harry that doesn't blame all his problems on others. Thanks for the recommendation

**** My only wish was that it was wasn't abandoned. The fic stops abruptly at an important part of Harry's story where he may actually make some relationships.
