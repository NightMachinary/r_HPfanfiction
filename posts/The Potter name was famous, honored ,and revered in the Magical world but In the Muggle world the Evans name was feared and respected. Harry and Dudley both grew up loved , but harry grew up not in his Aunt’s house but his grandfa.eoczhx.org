Thomas “C” Evans , the gentleman from Blackmoore was a name that The government would not soon forget he was a man synonymous with “ The Circus” and with power. Harry grows up with a front row seat to The inner workings of the magical and Muggle Ministries.At three he asked his grandfather Like he signs everything with Green ink and the C , By seven he is used to the family name being Whispered when he walked by With his grandfather. He knew what it meant to have power, he was a child used to attention but Watched his grandfather wield his power with subtlety and an even hand. The old man was like a General in the shadow Silently directing a campaign.

By 11 when his letter came , it didn't say under the stairs , It said Cambridge circus Second room on the left behind the statue of William Armitage. The letter launched an investigation , with his grandfather roaring. Heightened security the empire over, while the old man searched for the so called “ Wizards” watch his grandkids.

The end result of the inquiry was rather dramatic, Some Bloke calling himself The Minister of Magic Turned up at Downing Street to complain, The Prime Minister Told him “ go to the circus” if he ever wanted peace again. “ C won't let A perceived threat stand, Not after what happened to his girl at magical hands, You'd best bring Dumbledore With you to plead your case, Cornelius. He loves his grandson and the boy was set to be Educated in France Away from your dark lords and Albus's influence. Thomas won't stand for another dead Evans Especially not in the youngest generation.”

The end result was rather remarkable, Harry would later recall, the Prime Minister ( the Muggle one) , Cornelius fudge the magical minister ( at least he thinks that is what he was called) and an old man With a. great beard , Half moon spectacles In a great purple dress Jumping out from the fire in grandfather's study Followed a get giant in their walk. The resulting cacophony of security Drawing their guns was rather normal , But the old man with a beard waving a stick at them Was rather comical, The fear in his eyes when nothing happened would Stick with him Even though he didn't know the significance of it until years later.

Thomas Evans Watched the chaos unfold From behind his desk in the corner of the room. He regarded The soot covered startled Muggle Prime Minister for a monent , “ Charles ! good God man !what are you doing in the fire! I've come to Expect , Unannounced visits from those magical fool,” Thomas Waved his hand in the general direction of Dumbledore and fudge.” But never from a reasonable man such as yourself. I take it , Cornelius didn't Appreciate the security crackdown . We've had to turn away quite a few arete wizards we can't have Them flying about With my family under threat , Elizabeth Authorized The Activation of the national travel wards No one flies in or out of UK until we know is spying on “‘the Circus”And how they manage to get past the guards. The building all warded No magic spells are able to be cast in this room. “

Thomas looked at Dumbledore and fudge, “ Goblin wards , Remarkable things , They were a gift to the Queen From Ragnarok the Goblin King On the day of her coronation.. Wonderfully vicious creatures those goblins , But they always respect royalty. Ragnarok Has a soft spot for Lizzy, Especially with her namesake being the one to offer the goblins sanctuary On our fair island. Elizabeth was more than happy to activate them after I told her someone was tracking Harry. She's quite fond of my grandson and she loved Lily. Now what's this Unannounced visit about ?“

The following Negotiations were heated and brutal . Albus was backed to a corner and Cornelius May have tried to impersonate a poodle. Both men learned that day, you don't try to intimidate an Evans man in any way, he will rake you over the coals and render you powerless. Your little Stick of wood is meaningless , you do not Tried to steal his grandson away with a Port key Disguised as a letter “ Albus”. At this Revelation Cornelius played the politician, a Formal reprimand From the ministry was issued there and then on Harry Potter's behalf. Apologies were made, Half hearted And idiotic words were offered in explanation. When negotiations came to an end The Verdict was clear, Harry's grandfather was a man they should wisely fear. Harry word attend Hogwarts, with guards in his wake , MI-6 trained Wizards that knew what was a stake, Dumbledore was not to interfere with his grandson with out written permission and a guardian Present.

Harry would look back on that day as one that Shaped his future. It Cemented this place in the word , as a young man called Evans, Potter May have been the name he bared but Evans was the name that protect him all his life.
