At some point they take the Underground, and meet Hermione and her mother. Sirius and Mrs. Granger end up talking well Hermione and Harry show each other their books. Mrs. Granger gives Sirius their phone number.

Afterward, Harry tells Sirius that he and Hermione swapped rainboots, so each now has one that was Harry's and one that was Hermione's.

Harry gets a dragon book.

Harry meets Ron and they hit it off.

Sirius moves to a more kid friendly house.

Sirius sees Hermione doing accidental magic and explains to her and her parents.
