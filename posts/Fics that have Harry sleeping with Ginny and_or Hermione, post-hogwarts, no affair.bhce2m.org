They dont want to date or marry, but consider themselfs as Friends with benefits at best. So Ginny or Hermione occassionally sleep with him, but without any bindings. Just because "hey we are friends and find the other attractive". He can sleep with both of them in one Fic or one of them per Fic.

I would like them to be of adult age, like Epilogue. So no Family founding yet.

For a Harry/Hermione, i would like it (but its not necessary), if her Reaction at the "Morning after" would be similar to "It happened one Morning", but without the "Headache" incident. It would be enough, if she is suprised. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9640085]]
