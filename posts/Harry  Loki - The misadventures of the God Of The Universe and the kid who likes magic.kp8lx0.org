So, I've been developing this for a while. It makes fun of a few tropes and it's really just a fun crack fic. Basically, when Harry died around his mid-twenties because of a dumb reason, he was thrust into a different universe by death who didn't want a master. Harry is left to watch an alternate universe begin, in doing so he becomes a bit mad (more eccentric than crazy) and goes to Asgard because he knew he wasn't going to die and decided to not get attached to humans, who die to easily and quickly. Fast-forward to later- Odin is in charge, (Terrible mistake on his father's part, Harry knows there were quite a few competent and trustworthy people around) Loki is interested in magic and Thor thinks magic is dumb. Harry takes Loki under his wing.

PROMPT PARTS

1. Harry going to Earth to convince them that he is the ‘god of the gods' (kinda like Zeus but with Norse mythology). He thinks it'll be funny when a god goes to Earth and everyone thinks they're on a substance and is really into Norse Mythology. Harry then finds out that he is bi on this trip(?) (Secondary idea)- Harry went to Earth drunk and accidentally says the entirety of Norse Mythology, like an episode of drunk history. Insanity ensues.

2. Harry makes up a /bunch/ of religions. He'll create copies of himself and transfigure them to look different and create stories based on his memories of the religions in his old universe. He also makes sure to place himself in /everything/ to do with religion, including paintings, pictures, books and stories in general. So now there's a random guy with green eyes, a weird lighting, scar, and messy brown hair called Harry (sometimes Hadrian in the stories who claimed it was ‘to improper' a name, and that Harry was just a nickname). He drives historians insane, and there is a thing called ‘The Harry Phenomenon'. The definition is ‘Something that occurs or shows up repeatedly with no clear reason'. Examples of this are - seeing a specific word a lot, common color schemes that do not look good together, a popular name, etc. (For anyone who decides to write this, you are welcome to come up with religions and create theories from a random historian's POV. Bonus points for using ‘The Harry Phenomenon')

3. Harry telling Loki that if he wants to learn magic, he has to curse out those who scorn him for learning it, those who tell him it's girly. He proceeds to teach him human cuss words. Loki makes a ritual using the words. What it does is up to you!

4. Oh, this idea is the one that started it all! While Loki is trying to take over Earth, Thor prays to Harry to save the world. Harry teleports down, looks around at the rubble and asks Thor who could possibly be worth interrupting his chaos for. Thor sums it up as ‘Loki's trying to take over the world by force and we can't defeat him' while everyone else looks at the rando Thor called in. Harry, pissed off because he was about to blow a building up for anarchy, tears into Loki and asks him why he went for dictatorship when there are so many better ways to take over a planet, including overthrow a corrupt government (there was a lot of emphasis on that one, likely because he was in the middle of doing so when he was dragged away). It ends with Harry bringing Loki back to Asgard and giving him a cruel and unusual punishment.

5. Harry writes the ‘Harry Potter' books with a few key differences, seeing as he can't remember them all that well. It turns out to be rather crack-ish, but still becomes popular. It also boosts the popularity of ‘The Harry Phenomenon' via people who looked up the word ‘Harry' on its own.

6. Harry works at Stark Industries as an engineer because he really likes technology and what humans can do with it. He's pretty high up on the ladder, but he's also a massive anonymous donor because he wants to have the funds to do whatever he wants under the safety of patents and a big company. It's an open secret at Stark Industries that he has some sort of electricity power because whenever he feels any emotions to strongly all the electronic in the room will short out. And their laptops, phones and tech never run out around him, making him a very popular group project person.

*TLDR: Harry became the God of the Universe in the MCU, and is a little eccentric and weird. He also makes, and is featured in, every major religion in the world because he was bored. He also lives in Asgard and wrote a more crack-ish version of the Harry Potter books*

Yeah, that's been in the works for a while... *Link it in the comments if you write any of these!* They are all sort of one-shots, seeing as there would be no battling because Harry is to OP and little to no plot to be done seeing as he isn't on Earth much. I'd love some sort of relationship between Tony and Harry, though! I could see them as any type, honestly. Rivals/enemies because Harry doesn't follow the rules of science, friend who can follow along with his rambling, and my favorite, *an incredibly heavyweight co-worker that he can actually stand who was apparently a god the whole time???*


** The Harry Phenomenon sounds soooo funny. I would love to see the reactions of the historians lol

*** Thank you! If you need an editor, I will do my best to help! I've seen and read so many fics with bad grammar and that are just horribly written, i.e. run on sentences, extreme usage of ‘and', extreme OOC-ness, word butchering, misuse of the comma, terrible pacing, stretched out chapters and overall fic, unnecessary twists, trying to cram everything in, etc. I've seen a lot of problems and it would hurt my heart to see my prompt get butchered. (Not to say you will! I just don't know you or your writing style.) If you've already got an editor or don't need/want one, that's fine too. Even if you don't write it, thank you for reading the absolutely massive post I had as a shower thought.
