  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** This one is more cool, than happy, but it's still freaking amazing. Antithesis was amazing tho, and before I found it I actually read Shadowed Malice, which is basically the same story, written by them as a child. But The Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks is really good.
