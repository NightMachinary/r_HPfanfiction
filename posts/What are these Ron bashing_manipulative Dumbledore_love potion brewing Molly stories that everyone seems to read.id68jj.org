** If you want something a bit more serious with love potions then linkao3(8644414;8981179) are quite good. Takes seriously the (fanon?) idea that anyone conceived by parents under the influence of love potions can't experience romantic love themselves.

  When Harry helps Hermione find out the horrible truth - that Ron has been dosing her with love potions - she is furious. She is going to get her revenge on Ron in the most hurtful way she can think of -- dating the one man he hates above all others.

** Big tropes from a few years ago. They'll turn up if you take your stories from the 'most favourites, all time' list on FFN, but don't show up nearly so much recently. A consequence of trope fatigue I think.
