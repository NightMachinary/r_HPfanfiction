** Huh... Weird, there's this other fic I know where the story is awfully similar, but I know it's not the one you are looking for because it's in Spanish and was published in this old fic platform called Amor Yaoi. I think I even had it in bookmarks... (A summary of that fic: at the end of the war, Harry starts to believe the world is in debt with him or that he is entitled to something more because o what he lost, so he strikes a deal with the Malfoys, who have lost their money to the ministry, to basically "buy" Draco for a year and Draco indeed is instructed to call Harry "master" and do chores. When Hermione finds out she tries to help him or tell Harry that it's wrong. I think there was some mpreg in the mix somewhere... Don't remember)
