Does anyone else see something mentioned in fanfiction so much that you start to genuinely believe it to be canon? For example I've seen so may stories where Snape is described as Draco's godfather so when I actually searched it up I was so shocked that it wasn't true.

Has anyone else had this kind of realisation or is it just me?

*** Blood wards give shape and definition to something the books have, but leave nebulous and undefined. In the books there is /something/ magical that is related to the genetic ties between him, his mother, and Petunia, which expires when Harry turns 17. It is not, however, the totality of the protection that his mother left him, as some portion of that remains to help anchor Harry to life when he is hit with the killing curse the second time in the forest.

So calling that protection a blood ward is fanon, but only in a terribly minor sense, because the /concept/ is canon.

**** This is actually a really good example of why using the general fantasy concept of "ward" is bad, though. Because the Charm that protects Harry while he is at Privet Drive is on Harry, not on the house.

A spell on a person which protects a location when that person is at that location - is this a "ward"? When you say ward, most people thing of a magical protection on a location. Which in turn is why so many people forget that the spell is on Harry - because they're using the phrase "blood wards" and thereby forget the actual explanation of how they work.

It's similar to the Fidelius. No spell is cast on the property itself - the magic is cast on a secret, which is moved into a person's soul. All of the physical effects just follow from that. And yet people call this a "ward" too.

Basically: Harry Potter magic works in fascinatingly diverse ways, and using the word "ward" imports from the general fantasy genre a "protection spells are placed on the property itself" mechanism which is often just false, and which obliterates all that fascinating diversity.

***** You don't obliterate anything by adding another term. Adding "wards" as a term for defences usually placed on a location - which is pretty much mandatory for the wizarding world to work; else any wizard could enter someone else's house with impunity - doesn't mean you can't have spells on secrets or people.

****** I don't think so. I could imagine to easily say that Tom Riddle was more powerful wizard because he knew a way more magic (especially the Dark Magic) than anybody else. It doesn't mean I can measure it, and it doesn't mean that the power is something quantifiable.

And, by the way, I am not saying that magical core and different magical power doesn't make sense. Yes, I am less powerful than Arnold Schwarzenegger and it is easily possible that there is similar difference between let's say Harry and Hermione (to follow the most common comparison of them). What I am saying is that this whole thing doesn't have much support in the canon, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger is just so much more powerful than me. Yes, if we get into conflict, I don't think I can last, but he is certainly not immeasurably more powerful, so he won't be holding train or defeating whole army of Death Eaters just by himself.

I have never felt that it is a really big leap though to call the use of an area effect protective charm (or whatever) putting up a ward. It /fits/ with canon - you cannot apparate into grimmauld place (the trio have to do so onto the door step) but the twins can apparate from one location within it to another location within it. This means that the anti-aparation jinx on the place acts like a shield around it, so calling it a ward around it isn't /really/ much of a change.

So sure, technically wards are fanon, but if anything they are just helping to clarify some really sloppy definitions in the magical system we're given by the books.
