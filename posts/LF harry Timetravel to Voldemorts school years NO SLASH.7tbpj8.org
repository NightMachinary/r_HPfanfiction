Really just looking for a doc where he timetravels and he is a kind of rival or not aligned or join Tom and also some romance don't care the pairing except for harry/tom


** He goes even a bit further back in time in this story linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord)

There is also linkffn(Black Coat by Hermione Prime) where I really liked the portrayal of young Tom and his behaviour towards Harry. It just seemed right for me how he behaves in this fic. The end of the fic is also thought provoking, because who knows, maybe something like this really happened.

And last but not least there is also linkffn(Past's Player by The Fictionist) which is sadly abandoned, but I still liked it more than the following fic.

** There is this one called Fate's Favourite where is Tom the one that follows Harry to his time after the opposite happened in a previous fic (that is incomplete). There is no pairing, also I think Tom and Harry like each other but the author keeps on saying it is not slash xD [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite!]]
