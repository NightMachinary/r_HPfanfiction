In this AU, the author has a mechanism where characters can become a sorcerer if they sufficiently master occlumency.

From what i remember of the fic, the last step was supposed to be moving your life experiences from your brain to the soul and then delinking said soul from the body thereby making it a meat puppet.

Characters are supposed to gain incredible mental manipulation resistance as well as significant power boost.


** Was this a self insert where the SI sent hoops through the ocean to collect minute deposits of gold? And was a pairing with Daphne Greengrass? And, erm, he had businesses in Diagon Alley and was more of a collective by the end of it?

*** I think so. Can't remember if it was an SI though.

Edit: can you please post the name?

**** Hn. I'm pretty sure I read this on space battles. I don't remember the name however :<

Edit: Typing many keywords on google came up with this. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-magical-awakening-hp-si.246476/][A Magical Awakening]]. A quick browse makes me fairly certain that this is, at least, the fic that I read so long ago.
