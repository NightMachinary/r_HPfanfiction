** Messer Prongs would like to express his astonishment that Lucius Malfoy possessed the necessary equipment to produce anything other than a disappointment for his bought wife.

Messer Moony would like to express his revulsion to the respectable messer Prongs to put such unholy images in his head.

Messer Padfoot would like to note to Messer Prongs that Lucius Malfoy probably DID produce an adequate, but entirely expected disappointment, if he had to call it Draco.

Messer Wormtail advises Draco Malfoy to use less products on his hair, if he wishes to stop resembling a fairy shit.

Draco threw the parchment down in fury. "wait till my father hears about this, Potter!" new words appeared on the parchment.

Messers Padfoot, Wormtail, Moony and Prongs would like to groan collectively "sweet merlin, he says that too"

*** Since the start of the Malfoy line one sentence has been uttered It brings them great strength and power

wait till my father hears about this

but every young malfoy fails to realise that one day they grow up and the powers of them words no longer protect them

because one day they will become the father that will hear about this

**** It's actually a family curse, one that only the patriarch knows, and cant share with others. The exact wording has faded away into history, and as a result will never be broken, but the gist is the head of the household will hear however many complaints that they have wrought, doubled. At one point the Malfoy line was similar to the Weasleys in the amount of offspring they had, however each patriarch has decided to have less and less kids as the complainers became worse.

If was almost broken until Draco came along.

***** The reason the weasleys are poor is they had invested all the wealth they had acquired over the years into a massive library of artifacts and rare books

how ever one stupid weasley patriarch decided to donate the entire library to hogwarts at once as well as all weasly money

****** They were once master magical architects. It seemed a worthy enough of an enterprise, donating knowledge and their money to the school, before the world wars hit the magical population was in boom and they were busier than ever. However several projects were halted and then the goblins took over warding, making the family business go up in smoke.

**** Sounds like a good, nice hyphenated title, like any good title in the Wizarding World. The-father-who-heard-about-it. I'd read it.
