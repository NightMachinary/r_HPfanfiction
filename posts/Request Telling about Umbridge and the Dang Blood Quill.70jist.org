One thing that got me uncomfortable was the amount of abuse that Umbridge or should I say UmBitch, gave to Harry and likely to other students with the blood quill. She got attacked by Centaurs, which was nice. But still not a fitting enough punishment for her.

Are there any stories where Harry, Ron or Hermione or maybe even someone else tells Dumbledore, Minerva or someone else about the blood quill and they actually take action on it?

I always thought that would be enough to drive Umbridge away from the school and was disappointed when no real action was taken against her. What she did had to have been illegal.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. Would rather see the story be completed, but if it is a bunch of chapters then it's fine.


** linkffn(Lady Archimedes) does end up having Umbridge in Azkaban for a while, but it's fairly minor to the plot.

  If his life at Hogwarts was going to be a living hell, then so was hers. She wouldn't know what hit her.
