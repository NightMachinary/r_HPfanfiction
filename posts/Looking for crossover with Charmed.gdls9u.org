Look for a crossover where Harry is the son of Phoebe and Cole and awakens his half demon powers during the fight at the ministry. Remember reading it awhile ago but can't remember it's name


** Is it *Charmed Wizard* ?

  The Charmed ones' lives collide with one savior of the Wizarding world after Phoebe as a premonition of the boy using demonic powers. What happens when they learn of shocking connection the young boy has to them? How will Harry cope with powers he can't understand, as well as learning he isn't who he thought he was?
