I haven't read any fan fiction in a while but I recently felt in the mood. So imagine my horror when I go to my fan fiction bookmark folder to find it GONE. I don't know how it happened but all the stories I've saved over the years are simply gone. So I'm asking please, any of you guys that ship them, please share what you keep in your saved folder or any recommendations you have! I've done some searching on this subreddit and found a handful of recommendations but I'm looking for more. I just finished Pride of Time, I noticed that recommended on here several times and though I had issues with a couple things in the beginning I enjoyed it. It's made me want to read other time turner stories, if you know of any well done ones feel free to recommend them. I'd love one where she actually changes things, like I swear I think I read one once where she finds a way for James and Lily not to die and it was really good.

I'll take anything at this point, but some that I've enjoyed in the past that I can remember are Unfinished Business where she dies and comes back to haunt his classroom, The Life Unlived where she accidentally activates a charm that gives her a long dream like vision of what life would be like married to Snape, Pet Project I just remember she starts taking care of him and befriends the house elves and Hinge of Fate by Ramos where there was a rape by Imperio and an accidental pregnancy and they end up getting married. I read mostly stories about them after Hermione is out of school and older, but like Pet Project and Hinge of Fate I'm willing to read one where she's still at school if it's well done. There was another accidental pregnancy one (I know it's a trope, so sue me) where her and Snape had a one night stand during the celebrations for defeating Voldemort at the end of their sixth year, Hermione end up keeping it and going through her seventh year refusing to tell anyone who the father is. Snape takes a long time to come around to idea of Hermione having his child and in the meantime Draco tries to pursue her as well.

I've also enjoyed well done Marriage Law fics, like Denial and others. Any recommendations in that area would be much appreciated as well. But like I said, I'll take any recommendations so I can put off having to search aimlessly through stories on archive of our own or ff.net.


** I'm sorry I don't have any recommendations, but are you talking about your bookmarks on AO3 by any chance? AO3's bookmark index is under maintenance for now, so all bookmarks aren't currently visible, but they'll be back in a few days!

** A recommendation for the future will be to keep the title more relevant and less a call-to-arms.

Other than that, it's a somewhat popular request on this subreddit. I'd recommend searching through those, unless you're looking for a specific fic.

The Occluded Soul by Aurette is really good.

I know I have more bookmarked, but I can't search through my bookmarks on my phone lol. I'll try to remember to post some others when I get home ðŸ˜„

Summary: Hermione Granger is given a Time-Turner and instructions to use it. Only, using a Time-Turner can be a little tricky if not used correctly: a mistake made in counting or a slip of the fingers can make the user jump irregularly, and thus she could accidentally alter her time line. And when such an accident happens, Severus Snape uses Hermione's Time-Turner in order to fix a horrific wrong. However, it's his younger self who becomes the one who must ensure that history is not altered.
