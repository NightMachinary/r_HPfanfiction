** I read this kind of substory many times. Mostly it is something half involuntary, something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore (angry, approaching Harry during the meal in the Great Hall): what did you do to the Professor Binns?

  Harry (trying to look innocent): Did? I didn't do anything!

  Dumbledore: He refuses to teach now, and your classmates told me it was after talking with him!

  Harry: I just asked him whether he really likes to teach here! I mean, he is a ghost, so he doesn't teach to provide food on his table or something like that, right?

  Dumbledore: But he left!

  Harry: Yes, after I asked him, he was suddenly very thoughtful, and then he loudly cursed, that of course he doesn't want to spend time with bloody gobblin wars, he wanted to finally make a research of the history after the Grindewald's War, and he left.

Something of that sort.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.
