When you read a fanfic, do you prefer the characters to continuously be called by their names in the narration or dialogue tags OR do think that makes it too repetitive and awkward sounding? If it's the latter option, what would you use besides the basic he/she pronouns? Especially when there is more than one male or female in the conversation?

In my opinion, it just feels awkward to read "Harry said...Harry asked...Harry went to the store with Ron. Harry picked out oranges and Ron picked out apples. Then Harry walked home and Ron ran."

Please excuse my pathetic example, I'm just trying to illustrate a point obviously. If you guys could give me your opinions on the matter that would be great, thanks!


** Use the name once per paragraph, but try not to bunch them all at the front every time.

Do NOT succumb to the urge to poeticize the person by calling them 'the Chosen One', 'the Slytherin Prince' or 'the happiest pair of Pillows in Hufflepuff' unless the viewpoint character is likely to call them that.

*** Yeah I really loathe weird synonyms for people, especially physically descriptive ones. I think that's a good point you bring about not keeping names at the beginning of a sentence each time. I guess it's all about varying the sentence structure.

Recently read this fic linkffn(Never Let Me Go by merrygolds) wherein /orbs/ is used 4 times in 3 chapters. My favorite is /electric orbs/ in chapter 1. The innovation of electrified facial orbs is a great leap forward in the field of unintentional body horror literature.

I think you may be right. In all seriousness and orbs aside, it was a touching story and pretty well done, especially since it is one of the author's first stories.

******* It's really silly to never use a style of writing. In most cases it will not be appropriate, but to make a stupid rule about descriptions based off of inexperienced writers is not appropriate either. Steven King uses them, and so does JR Tolkien. I'm not saying your average writer is either of those two, but pointlessly limiting yourself doesn't make you a better writer. It may make you slightly popular on the DLP forums though.

On reconsideration, 'the Happiest Pair of Pillows in Hufflepuff' may be an in-House competition and therefore an official title rather than some poetical riff about the actor playing the role. If so, Tonks set a record for consecutive wins that some might be able to match but will never surpass.

** Here's my opinion: Do not repeat the name unless necessary, always prefer synonyms. Not ridiculous ones, you're not a 18th century writer wanting to imitate Homer... use logical ones. (try to use neutral one "his friend" "the other" rather than "the brunette" or "the ginger") Here's how I do it: -pick a "main character" of your paragraph, always the POV if possible, if not the more active one. this one is HE (or she). For the other characters use adjectives. -As my English teacher used to say only write "but", "and", "if", "or"... if you have no other choice

let me demonstrates with your example: "Harry said...he asked... and went to the store with Ron. He picked out oranges while his friend picked out apples. He then walked home and Ron ran.

when there are more people try to stay consistent : "his friend" must always be the same person for example, and in those situation you pretty much have to juggle with the pronouns (and you may have to repeat names here or there).

** I would say, try not to fall into the temptation of going for ambiguity over clarity and simplicity. It depends on who you ask, but I think that the general consensus in anything writing is that you should let it be a "seedling" of sorts which sparks the reader's imagination. If you try to forcefully tell the reader too much, it feels like a droning in the head; reading and categorizing information about the story rather than letting the mind run free.

Thing is, as a writer it's not as easy to realize this, because you might spend a few minutes on each sentence, worrying about how best to word it, but often a reader will "skip" over some words in the narrative, while still picking up the information they need. If you clutter the text with too much description, too much detail and overly verbose words, that only has the effect of taking the reader out of it.

This means, no 'replied', no 'questioned', no 'responded', just 'said' and 'asked'. No descriptors like 'the Boy-Who-Lived' or 'the bushy-haired witch', just 'Harry' and 'Hermione'. Of course, there are situations where you might want to use those things, but the general flow of the narrative is in no way made smoother or easier to read if you don't fall into the habit of writing in a concise, simple and to the point fashion.

This is way too restrictive and assumes that we all want to read (and write) plain, direct prose. Epithets are a novice's error, except when consciously used for effect, and no, I wouldn't endorse them. But dialogue tags ought to allow for /some/ variety beyond 'said' and 'asked.' No need to lay it on thick, I don't mean that, but the constant harping on 'said said said' is a modern affectation. I realize dialogue tags can be intrusive or redundant, but that's down to questions of skill, and basically you're telling authors to ignore a whole bunch of tools in the writer's box of tricks. How else can they learn if they don't try them out and reject or adopt them through trial and error?

I like description. I like to write it and I like to read it, and I've backbuttoned out of plenty of fics that bored the hell out of me because the prose was clear, flat, and lifeless, devoid of sensual impressions or sense of place or atmosphere. Easy to read, sure, I suppose you could call it that, but I'm not a beginning reader. I don't need to have the path cleared for me and all lyricism or variety removed in case I'm tempted to 'skip it.' Readers who skip are not very good readers, IMO. They want the bones and will happily leave the rest, and that's fine. I don't write for them, and I won't care about stories that strip everything to the skeleton for fear of making it too hard for distractible readers.

Let people have fun playing with language and learning what works and what doesn't on their own terms. Subtlety is not the same thing as removing all markers, invention, wordplay, lavish prose, and haunting and gorgeous description. There has to be a better way to advise writers to avoid, for example, detailing every article of clothing their MC wears or rhapsodizing over clichés about alabaster skin and viridian orbs without insisting that they all write to the same mass-produced 'transparent' standard.

Also, the point of your last line is somewhat obscured by the use of a double negative, but I think what you're implying is that simple and concise will fetch you more readers because it's so easy to read. If your goal as a writer is popularity, then have at it. But if you enjoy writing as an art or a way of exploring character or as emotional theater, go ahead and plunge into the deep end, don't just paddle in the shallows. In my experience, it's way more fun, even if you sometimes make a fool of yourself.

**** You make a valid argument. In retrospect, I may have made too many assumptions with my comment, and focused too much on my personal preferences without accounting for other perspectives.

I think if I had to specify a moment where I think a description goes overboard, it would be when it feels too much about itself, meaning that I walk away from it remembering the sentence more because of how intricately worded it was, rather than because of what the sentence was actually showing me. It isn't that I am completely against descriptions as a whole, but I am against trying to describe detail in such excess that the reader loses sense of what they're actually reading.

For third person limited, I like to follow a rule by which I only describe what the character is seeing, so if the character is in a circumstance in which they pay close attention to their surroundings, the level of detail increases, but if they're, say, running into a place they don't know, details are very sparse because they as characters would not be catching sight of these details in the middle of the action.

I do agree that my original comment was far from the best way to express this.

Ninja edit: On the topic of 'said' and 'asked', I also should have specified that I believe they should always be used, unless having another verb in their stead is absolutely necessary to express something that otherwise might have been unclear.

** I prefer to use pronouns, or say "witch or wizard", or put witch/wixard into a noun group eg. "the green eyed wizard" - but use these descriptions sparingly. With narration, trying breaking it up by having the beginning of your sentences start with something other than a character's name/pronoun/description.

Examples:

"Looking around the room nervously, Harry then whispered..."

"There was a pause before Hermione began to speak..."

Also, when writing dialogue, once you've done the initial "he said/she replied", you don't need dialogue markers to indicate who is speaking.

Example:

"What do you mean it's a horcrux?" Harry asked, dumbfounded.

Hermione sighed before replying. "It's obvious, isn't it?"

"No, not really."

"Oh, for goodness sake! I am I the only person in the world to have read Hogwarts: A History?"

I guess my main advice is to shake it up a little. Hope that helps a little!
