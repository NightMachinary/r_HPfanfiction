I'd assume that either the Polyjuice would have no effect on a meta, or that it might actually be painful for them, with the potion conflicting with their nature.

My big questions is how would a Polyjuice potion of a meta affect someone who wasn't?

Would they turn into a meta for the duration of the potion?

Would they turn into the meta's base form?

Would they turn into whatever form the Meta was in when they supplied the final ingredient to the potion?


** I think a Metamorphmagus can use polijuice potion like others, just in that hour they can't use their metamorphoses. I assume if one used polijuice potion of a Metamorphmagus, one would be in their "base form" for the time duration.

*** I agree. There's no reason to believe that polyjuicing into somebody would give you their abilities.

The tricky part about a metamorphmagus using polyjuice, is that they'd have to be very careful to always be in control of their shifts. In fanfics, Tonks's hair often changes color when she has an emotional spike---don't know if that's canon, but it would really blow her cover if she was polyjuiced as somebody and then their hair changed color or something.

On the other hand, it would be useful for pretending to be somebody's relative: polyjuice into them and then change the features slightly: voila, instant illegitimate child. This would probably be easier than trying to morph into a specific appearance from scratch. From what we've seen in canon, she can change individual features but I don't think we see her actually taking on another actual face. (Yet another case where JKR introduces what should be a game-changer of an ability, and then doesn't do anything significant with it.)

**** I like your "illegitimate child - idea", that could be used to break up relationships/marriages. Yes, the "problem with controlling their metamorphosis powers" is canon, but I don't think they (like Tonks) would be able to use these powers (not even by accident, triggered through strong emotions).

***** I do like the fanon idea that Tonks's clumsiness is because she makes herself taller (and didn't go through it naturally, slowly so as to get used to it) --- but I am naturally clumsy and not a metamorphmagus. That is also not borne out in canon because Harry and Ron have NO problem with coordination after polyjuicing into Crabbe and Goyle, who are taller than Harry, at least, and not in the same proportions as Ron.

Thanks to the movies, canon is also wishy-washy on whether a polyjuiced person has their original voice or not. It makes NO sense to have their original voice, since they are now using the VOCAL CORDS of the target person. But you can hand-wave just about anything with "that's how the magic works."

****** I think the movies did a bad job here, thinking the viewers wouldn't understand that Ron and Harry aren't Crabbe and Goyle if they had their voices for the hour, although we just literally saw them transform. Then in gof Barty Jr. ofc has Moody's voice (otherwise the cat would be out of the bag, but the inconsistency here...). Clumsiness, yes I read a similar theory in a couple of fics. In one she loses it, after her life partner gets together with her - other than that specific one, I like the idea :)

*** Like with prophesies and time turners, the universe arranges for nonsensical things to refrain from happening. Specifically, someone can be born a metamorph only if they will never take a dose of polyjuice.

** Metamorphmagi are not said to be able to turn into someone else by default if I recall... they are just able to transform their features (Harry recognizes Tonks while disguised as an old lady) but they would still start out in a base form that they can alter. That's what you'd get by polyjuicing into them without having their abilities. A metamorphmagus, while unlikely to need polyjuice, would probably transform into that person but could still use their powers to customize the person they are impersonating. That's my headcanon though because we're never told in the books what happens.

** A metamorph using it would probably have their transformation ability temporarily overridden by the magic of the potion.

Using a metamorph as a source would get you a potion that gives you whatever appearance the metamorph was wearing at the time.

Remember that polyjuice replicates things like scars, age and hair length. That is to say, the subject's current form, rather than their platonic ideal form.

** I like to think that a Metamorph on Polyjuice will turn into whatever the polyjuice turns them into; with the chief difference being that the Metamorph is not constrained or limited by the Polyjuice's 1 hour time limit. In other words, a Metamorph can still morph after taking polyjuice, so they're not stuck in the polyjuice form for the whole hour, and likewise the Metamorph is able to keep the Polyjuice form after the Polyjuice would have normally worn off.

In this way, I see the Polyjuice potion as a potential learning aid for Metamorphs, as I like to think that a Metamorph form of another person is rarely a perfect duplicate otherwise.

Going the other way, as you mentioned, I prefer the idea that the Polyjuice would turn a person into whatever form the Metamorph had when they supplied the final ingredient. AFAIK, the Polyjuice potion doesn't imbue any special (magical) abilities that the original had to the potion taker. As an example, a polyjuice of someone with Parseltongue won't convey that ability, or a polyjuice of a Seer won't give the polyjuiced the ability to make prophecies.
