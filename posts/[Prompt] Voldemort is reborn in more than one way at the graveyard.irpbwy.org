"I'm really sorry that I had to put you through this Harry," said Voldemort, "But I really needed your blood. However, I'll let you go now. This new chance to live again haha opened my eyes to what's my real purpose in life"

In which Voldemort reborns into the most selfless man on earth and tries to do good all around.

"But my Lord, you have to stop," hurried Lucius, "This new side of you is against all you stood for before. And besides, you if you keep using all your magic to use aguamentis trying to stop every forest fire in the world you're going to kill yourself of magical exhaustion!"

"It's a risk I'm willing to make." Voldemort answered, "Now continue helping or I'll end you and any Death Eater who disobeys my commands!"

Dumbledore is of course skeptical of Tom's change of heart and travels the world trying to discover Voldemort's real agenda. In an attempt to reveal him as a fraud to Harry and the world.

Chaos ensues when Albus follows Voldemort to a Climate Change convention in Las Vegas, where Voldemort is giving a lecture to convince the world of the need for tougher emissions regulations. Dumbledore takes the trio there to expose Voldemort publicly once and for all. Suddenly, an anti-climate change legislator is found dead and no one knows who did it. Voldemort and Dumbledore go head to head in the most epic duel of all times, this time with words and scientific evidence instead of wands. Ron tries to make a move on Hermione but is distressed when he finds all of his family arrived in the same hotel as a surprise. Harry is haunted to be on the room next to Lockhart. Meanwhile Neville is hit by a hex from Bellatrix, which compels him to gamble. Ginny and Luna hurry through the casino trying to stop him. And what is Lucius plan to make Voldemort evil again? And why does it require a Las Vegas priest and 5 gallons of premade mango margarita?

Oh and yes it does but it's pretty easy, there's a "get invited" button in the home thing and you'll get an account within a weeks time so it's not that bad, I prefer ao3 mainly because it's not as confusing to navigate as ffn can be.

But then again ffn has some exclusive gems too like Harry Potter, squatter and Harry Potter and the elementals' power

They both have hidden gems so it's a good idea to use both, ao3 is a bit easier to avoid the porn stuff if you just check the tags on the fics

Plus the relationship tags don't show a difference between intimate, and friendly relations. Whenthere an odd dozen of them, it makes it downright confusing on what to expect. So in general, too many damn tags.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
