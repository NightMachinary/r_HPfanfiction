** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on the magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slow paced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.

Does fem!Ron count?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

*** Fem Ron is something I've never seen. I'll have to check it out.

Also was very interested in Forging the Sword until I heard it was indefinite hiatus. I might give it a go anyways though.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

**** As the author, I can tell you that you are wrong. Events are already going off the canon rails (since, firstly, the trio are alerted to the presence of Voldemort early in first-year, and secondly, they already discovered the Basilisk so a rehash of Second Year is right out), and the differences will increase with time, as is natural for a Single-Point of Departure fic like this one.

I fail to see how the summary would give you this impression, also. I'll admit it's not the best summary, but it says right there that "changes pile up".
