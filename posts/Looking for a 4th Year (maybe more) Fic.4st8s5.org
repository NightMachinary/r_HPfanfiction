Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a fic that I read some time ago. I can't remember exactly what it was about, but it likely contained powerful harry/goblins/h-hr etc.

What I can specifically remember is that Harry tricks Crouch Sr into emancipating him during the first task by showing up in the stands and claiming that the magical contract didn't specify which year he was supposed to show up, only the date, therefore he didn't need to compete.

Crouch then modifies the contract on the spot, which voids it and releases Harry, while also emancipating him at the same time.

That is all I can remember,

Thanks in advance for any help!


** It isnt H/Hr but the crouch Sr thing happens.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
