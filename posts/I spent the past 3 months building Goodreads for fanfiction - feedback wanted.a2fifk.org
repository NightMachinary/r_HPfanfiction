Hey [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] - here's my side project and labor of love for the past 3 months - [[https://ficdb.com/][https://ficdb.com]]. I've posted on a few other subreddits, but I think it's time to get some perspective from a wider audience!

​

Elevator pitch - Ficdb is Goodreads for webfiction... a platform to discover, review, and share fanfics and web serials worth reading. Hunting for quality webfiction sucks, but Ficdb can help make it suck less.

Quick tour of Ficdb:

- [[https://ficdb.com/][Home Page]] - search for and exclude fanfics by title, author, genre, main character, relationship, and completion status (click additional filters for power user features!)
- [[https://ficdb.com/reviews][Reviews Index]] - filter and sort reviews by rating and helpfulness - use the <3 upvotes to reward quality reviews
- [[https://ficdb.com/fandoms][Fandoms]] - view existing fandoms - more fandoms are being added daily, but the focus is on Harry Potter and Worm fanfiction to help Ficdb get a critical mass of users
- [[https://ficdb.com/genres][Genres]] - view existing genres - subject to change, would love additional ideas on building a more complete genre taxonomy esp. specific to Harry Potter fanfiction
- [[https://ficdb.com/faq][FAQ Page]] - rules of engagement
- [[https://ficdb.com/fanfics/new][New Fanfic]] - submit the fanfics you think are noteworthy - requires mod approval before being visible to the world

Why I built Ficdb:

- fanfiction ecosystem is fragmented across 10 different platforms - wanted a unifying platform to help readers navigate new fandoms and be notified when a fanfic updated
- no quantitative reviews - 5-star reviews help filter out the wheat from the chaff
- an excuse to play around with Elixir, a fantastic programming language!

Why you should join Ficdb:

- be an early adopter and help guide Ficdb's future development
- spread the gospel of your favorite fanfics to a wider audience
- get a dopamine rush when someone <3's your well-written reviews
- help me get a critical mass of reviews, so I can build a machine-learning powered fanfic recommendation engine

I'd love to hear feedback here or on the [[https://discord.gg/uRrEHfV][Discord channel]]. Thx!

​

I just edited the error messages to be a bit clearer - good call.

​

Mobile is WIP - way better than 2 weeks ago, going to loop back in UX.

​

Right now, top rated is a dumb filter with no weighing - one 5 star review beats 20 4.9 star average review. Once the dust settles, this is a priority.

** I love the idea of this. I currently keep fanfic reviews for myself in an evernote, so I have a lot of stuff I can port over.

One bug I've noticed so far: if you go to submit a review and haven't put in a star rating, it won't respond at all when you click "submit" (I would expect that it would give an error message).

edit: I also think that when you're adding a fic you should be able to add multiple main characters.

** I was always thinking that there needs to be a centralized system for fanfic especially since archives can shut down or fics can get deleted. Often when I read a good doc I Google it to see if it's discussed anywhere. Typically I see this sub/DLP/tumblr/TVTropes. It would be amazing to peruse throughly well written reviews to see if a fic is worth it or not. I definitely want to add to this when I have free time in two weeks!

One thing I noticed that I would change is that in the rating system 1 is at the top, 5 is at the bottom. I would switch the order so that the rating bar is displayed best to worst.

** Great idea, and I hope it gets big!

​

I found that on first sight the home page is kind of confusing, mainly because of the lack of clear separation between the different link categories (you seem to have a top row for major pages, a second indicating the path to the page you are on, a third for filters, a fourth mostly for a few extra random links, and the remainder of the page for actually viewing). Because there are no horizontal lines/coloration differences separating the different rows, they kind of all jumble together, making it hard to see the hierarchy of the rows. I'm no graphic designer, and I don't know what the best fix is, but I'd recommend finding some way to separate out the different rows so its easy to see, for example, that the top two rows are page-wide, while the other rows only exist on the fanfic page.

​

Additionally, for some reason that second row (which shows /Fanfic or /Fandom, for example) doesn't show up on the review page but does on all the others. That could also be a source of confusion. Since it also doesn't seem to be changing in response to any of the pages except the topmost, I'm assuming that's mostly because it is a work in progress.

** This looks super promising! I haven't added anything yet but will definitely do that at some point.

For mobile, everything works perfectly fine for me by selecting Desktop Mode for now.

One thought I had after looking around a bit, it seems like genres can only be added by the person who first added the fic, so whoever gets there first essentially decides on this. There's no process to add more later on or to up/downvote them for relevancy.

This isn't so important for regular genres but as others have already pointed out the genre list currently includes items which should more accurately be called tropes/features/whatever. It's kind of restricting if only the first person can suggest which tags should be displayed for that story.

But seriously, you've done an awesome job on this so far! Very excited to see where this is going :)

** What a great idea!! Is this project open source? Would love to see the repo.

Feedback at a glance: On the Fandoms page, while I think the images/title boxes look nice, I can see that very easily becoming unreadable/impossible to navigate when more and more fandoms are added. To deal with this, consider allowing users to collapse/expand based on category (anime/manga, books, comics etc.) and organizing the content into distinct columns with even spacing. This goes for the genres page as well.

I like the color scheme and layout. User interface is relatively clean and readable overall. The new chapter banner is a nice touch.

For security's sake, I'd look into adding passwords, or at the very least hashing user information. (not sure if you are doing this/looking into it)

Keep up the good work!!

My only critiques thus far are a couple bugs I'm running into with clicking buttons (e.g., the Scrape button for fanfiction.net or the Submit button when trying to leave a review), and nothing happens. :( Weirdly enough, the scrape button worked just fine when I submitted a story from Ao3.

yup, i'm building out a feature so author's can delete the page if they so desire. all the feedback i've gotten from author's has been very positive so far... i'm starting to message individual authors asking how they're listings can be improved.

the main issue with the goodreads fiasco was cultural backlash, hoping to avoid that as much as possible by encouraging polite, constructive criticism and focusing on only the fanfiction community and not the greater literary community. keep everyone happy and my cortisol levels low

Have you thought of a way to "block" re-upload?

** Idk how well this will be received by fic authors. There's an unspoken culture, at least on AO3, of "don't like don't read" -- that is, praise it if it's good and leave if it's not -- because fic writers share their work for fun and fun alone unless explicitly stated otherwise. There was a huge stink a few years back about a college class on fanfiction where students were required to leave comments "critiquing" random fics the instructor picked for them to read, because it's considered rude unless it's from a beta or someone else explicitly invited to find fault with it. Of course, typos or grammar errors are fair game, but major critical analysis is not received well.
