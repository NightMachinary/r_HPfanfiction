** I've generally found the better stories to follow are in the crossover realm because the well feels like it's run dry at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][*Child of the Storm*]] linkffn(8897431) is finished, but it currently has an updating sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12046648/1/Ghosts-of-the-Past][*Ghosts of the Past*]] linkffn(12046648) - both of which are outstanding for a crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][*The Next Lord of Kobol*]] linkffn(8712160) has been reliably updating again, but beware that it may stop for a year or so with little warning. Still an entertaining read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][*The Shadow of Angmar*]] is outstanding, and regularly updated. It's not for everybody, but it's updated regularly enough that you can leave it and come back to it a bunch.

These JUST finished, and I noticed that while writing this up so I figured I'd pass them on: I just noticed that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure][*Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure*]] linkffn(9824342) finished, but it's long enough and a decent enough read to keep you occupied catching up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064) just finished not that long ago, but it's worth a shot as it's fully complete with a satisfying conclusion.

And of course, what sort of author would I be if I didn't [[https://media.tenor.co/images/d0d548db13df7bb5856aeaca5cf48ef6/raw][pimp my own work]] as well, which is reliably updating. It's *The Rezidentura.* linkffn(12334664).

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
