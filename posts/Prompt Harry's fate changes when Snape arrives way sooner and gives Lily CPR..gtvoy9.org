** Of course a muggle medical technique would stop the killing curse. Tbh wouldn't be suprised with no wizards wanting to try such a muggle technique even for a life or death situation.

*** Yes, especially since canon doesn't say how the curse works (at least I don't think it does) so it might be the heart-stopping kind.

*** I dont think its explained in cannon how the killing curse works if it's just stopping the heart then CPR would be a possible treatment that wizard have never heard of before

*** Well canon never said how it worked, it might just stop one's heart.

**** Snape didn't appear at all in the books, he didn't even know where the Potters were hiding.

But if Snape somehow appeared, before or after, Sirius would kill him when he saw it.

***** Oh right! It's been a while since I read the books.

But come on, it's a prompt for a reason.

We can all just pretend Sirius got stuck somewhere along the way and Snape had enough time to give Lily CPR and somehow it worked and now Harry grows up with his mum.
