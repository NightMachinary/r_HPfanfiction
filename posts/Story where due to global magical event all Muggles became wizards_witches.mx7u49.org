Title says everything. I am looking for a story were this event either happened recently and ICW frantically deals with consequences; or where it happened long ago and story explores worldbuilding of stabilized all-wizarding world. Event should take place in recent history ranging from Grindelwald's war to HP epilogue. Nature of event is irrelevant and not necessary explained.
