Is there a site, forum, thread, etc where one can submit a fic idea to be adopted by an author looking for new inspiration? I seem to have more fic ideas than writing ability.

Ex:

"The hell?"

Hermione looked up from her book, and looked at her friend Harry who had a puzzled expression on his face, his mouth doing an impression of a goldfish.

She could hear him muttering under his breath, "/How did I? I was... Peeves threw the water balloons... Then I had to ask Professor Riddle about... how did I get to the great hall? ... why am I.../"

Harry turned to her, "Granger... Why are we wearing Gryfindork robes?"

Granger. Why had he called her Granger, he'd always called her Hermione ever since the troll. "Harry, are you feeling alright? I know you're always upset after your detentions with Professor Umbridge but you're not making any sense."

"Professor who now? What? I was in Runes... and then suddenly I was here... What time is it?"

"Harry, you don't take Runes."

"What are you on about Granger, of course I take Runes, just because Trace and I did better on the last project than you and Miss Bones did is no reason to pretend I'm not in the class with you anymore. /Sheesh, and you claws say/ I'm /competitive./"

Is there a place to put little snippets for others to use?


** DLP has a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=24752][Plot Bunny thread]] - tons of ideas there, but from what I understand they're not "up for grabs" so much as they are meant to be shared, tinkered with, and then written (or not) by the original poster. I might be getting that wrong, though. Maybe a more experienced user of that site can take it from here?

*** Turns out they have a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=22052][Drabble Vomit Thread]] which sounds like what he really wants.

** Can't say I know of any, although this might be just as good of a place as any, call it a prompt and see if anyone is interested?
