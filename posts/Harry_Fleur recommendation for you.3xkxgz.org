I found it to be a believable romance story. No allure or soul bonds or other crap. Also no bashing. Not the greatest of stories, and has enough deviations from Canon to remain interesting despite it mostly being a self-described canon rehash.

**** This is my story. The summary is a masterpiece that I spent many seconds on, and I feel it summarizes the story perfectly.

***** It is appreciated. Can't stand it when I've read 10 chapters into a story only to give up hope that it is anything other than a poor paraphrasing of canon.

*** I'm not sure if good is the right word, but it certainly isn't bad. Somewhere in between, and I hadn't seen it before, so I thought I'd share.
