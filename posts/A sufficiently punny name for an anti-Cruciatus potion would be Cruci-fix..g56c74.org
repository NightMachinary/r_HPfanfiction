Bonus points if you have to stir it with a little statue of Jesus for some overly contrived reason.

** Plus point if the water for the potion have to be from River of Jordan(Jordan river sounds less cool) blessed and a flower of crown-of-thorns. ... ... .. ... Now I'm imagining Harry going "the power of christ compels you" to remove Voldemort possession/ horcrux from him. Just imagine, Remus and Sirius trying this to Harry either to cheer him up from the knowledge of being possessed by V. After a round of drinking, Harry impressively throws up and Sirius jokes about needing exorcism, drags off moony only to show up in a priest garb. They recreate a false exorcism, only for the "werewolf" in Remus to suddenly react and things go out of hand that ends up in kidnapping the pope, surprise baptism via stolen firetruck with "blessed" water and attacking deatheaters in a Spanish inquisition garb(monty python-esque) sowing chaos in the Wizarding world and finally promising not to drink a particular walburga's stash of alcohol.

**** Quarantine is making my imagination vomit out plot bunnies but I can't focus enough to sit and write a full one-shot. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I just type it out to get rid of the idea, who knows someone might adopt them.

***** Most of my plot bunnies come from dreams. Since I was a little kid I've dreamed about war and being a spy. I think that's why my favorite character is Snape. I feel like I relate to him best. Having to watch and participate in horrifying behaviour without bring able to do a damn thing or I'd break cover. Once I became interested in HP fanfiction I started writing them down in a HP AU. One set have become a series starting in the 1960s and spanning to HBP so far. Another is a time travel.

Maybe keep track of your wonderful ideas like you posted here, and when you have a chance to focus later you'll bless us all with these lovely crack fics and whatever else you deign to give us.

******* Thank you and no, the time travel fic has been rewritten 3 times thanks to something not working and I'm stuck because I brought in some characters from a dream that are too O.P. They're like bringing nukes to a skeet shoot. I was trying to tone them down, or take them out completely, or what. The scenes from my multi decade fic aren't connected to be cohesive yet.

********* Yeah. I thought about that, I'm just not sure how. The magic is that dream wasn't Hogwarts compliant. One person is more along the lines of Dr. Manhattan (present tense as I have many dreams featuring this crew). Another is a spy who would put Snape to shame and is the reason I relate to him so well and he's my favorite fictional character.

****** I used to write stories but it took me years to realize that I just stopped. I'm lurking in fanfictions and writing prompts in hopes I'd get inspired to continue writing or get that feeling I used to have with writing.

I mean, After all, one of my original unfinished story started as an HP fanfic. a different "muggle" magic system vs HP magic, which what caused the wizard to go in hiding. An invocation based magic that muggles can use, in short "borrowed" magic, that wizards called "stealing" magic thus the origin source of hate to muggleborn. A war far greater than just V leading a civil war. It was the schism between world's not just between makes and non magic user but between two different magic system. When I realized I literally made a new magic system and hidden society and history for the new magic system that I realized I can divorce it from HP fanfic by changing most notably HP parts and stick with " fractured society of natural wizards vs scattered 'learned' magic users concept.")

** I believe I actually read this pun in a fic before. It was a fic where Harry was studying to be a potions master at Hogwarts. I'm sure it was cruci-fix, 'cause it tripped me up when I read it. Can't recall what the fic was called though... Now I feel the need to go trawling to find it again, otherwise I'll go mad with not-knowing.
