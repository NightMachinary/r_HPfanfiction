I'm always surprised by the number of time travel fics there are where none of the living Potters actually want to find out who Harry is or where he comes from. Sure sometimes he uses a different last name - but he's James' clone. A family as rich and old as the Potters should want to know who he is and where he came from.

So tell me your favourite time travel fics where his parents/grandparents/great aunts/uncles track him down. I'd prefer if this eventually evolved into Harry having a relationship with his relatives but I'll take what I can get. The era he travels back to doesn't particularly matter either


** linkffn(A step to the right) There's a whole bunch of family magic at play in the AU Harry and Hermione find themselves in. Therefore Harry's family /knows/ they're related.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

Also after you've caught up on both I be happy to discuss them with you. Unfortunately, between being on Ao3, being labeled a slash fic, and a pace that,while I'm good with, someone wishing for a more action packed story might uncharitably describe as glacial, the work doesn't get the amount of attention (and therefore the amount of discussion) it deserves

***** For what it's worth, you wouldn't be able to tell it's a slash fic without it literally being labeled as so. There are at most two moments that, if you squinted really hard, could maybe be interpreted as one day being part of the path leading to a Harry/Regulus relationship. And this only with the prior knowledge that the relationship will theoretically one day exist (given that the entire fic thus far [plus its companion alternate PoVs fic] has covered only a few days) Every thing else is just bonding/budding friendship between two people in ridiculous (and ridiculously dangerous) situations.

***** Definitely give it a chance, the writing so far had been phenomenal, I'm on chapter 25, and you can tell the author actually knows where the story is going.

The slash is minimal - its currently nonexistent. It's tagged as gen/pre-slash so I doubt that there will be much slash at all. Don't let the pairing scare you off from a - far - great fic.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
