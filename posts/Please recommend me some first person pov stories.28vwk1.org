Great and often very funny Harry/Fleur.

Harry isn't bumbling or weak and makes for a great ladies killer and wizard.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] is a first-person story. Its also (literally) a self-insert. Thus, it is also not from Harry's perspective.

  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

**** Too true, it's been a while since I read it and I remember it being told from an interesting perspective and just assumed it was first. Still a good story, but not first person. My bad.

*** I tried this story a while back, but it was really hard for me to get in to. I'll probably try it again though.

** I'm working on a 1st person independent Harry story. He'll definitely be dark or grey depending on your perspective later on but not for a while.

Two warnings. One, rather than creating an AU with a highly OOC Harry or writing a time-travel fic, I've taken the more drastic step of magically replacing the original Harry with (the mind of) an adult OC loosely based on myself. Two, this is my first attempt at writing fiction in a very, very long time and it might suck.
