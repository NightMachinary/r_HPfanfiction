:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty sure I read it on Ao3 but I didn't save it and have searched thoroughly and can't find it anymore. I think Harry was a Hufflepuff. I know the fic centered around Cedric Diggory's POV. There was a specific scene where Cedric was in Transfiguration and looked out the window in time to see Harry just walking into the lake, and he sort of freaked out about it and raced down to save him. Flitwick was down by the lake, too, but I can't remember why. I think the Giant Squid fished Harry out of the lake.


** chapter 4 of this fic has a scene very similar to what you just described. linkao3(10519878)

edit: rereading it i'm 100% sure this was what you were looking for!

  It was his second time dying. And soon after, it was his second time coming back to life. Somehow, he was still alive. And he was living his life all over again
