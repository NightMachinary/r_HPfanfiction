I'm looking for works that work almost entirely inside of the canon material that expand upon events, characters, and lore, but especially on either side characters or relationships. (I.e. Other houses, Harry and Ginny's relationship)

Also anything that fits with the lore, but improves upon the canon story would be fantastic as well! (I.e. A work that retcons OotP so that Harry doesn't use the two way mirror for some kind of reason [Random Umbridge paraphernalia raid maybe?], or a fanfiction that elaborates on Tom's/Voldemort's goals and motivations)


** linkffn(An interview with Justin FinchFletchley)

Shows what the Muggles were doing during the Voldemort war, and a whole bunch of other things.

  Ten years after the defeat of Voldemort, Lee Jordan asks what life was like during the Death-Eaters' reign for the Muggleborn son of a prominent Tory family, and what he learned as a member of the commission which investigated how they came to power.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7475914/1/All-Will-Be-In-Order]]) comes to mind. It has two sequels, one complete and one WIP that can be found in the author's profile.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11088406/1/Tea-and-Empathy]]) also fits your request.

  "Lie low at Lupin's for awhile," Dumbledore had said, "I will contact you there". This story takes place later in the night of Voldemort's return. Dumbledore ordered Sirius to stay at Lupin's house. But there is a lot that he and Remus still need to get out into the open before their friendship can begin healing.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
