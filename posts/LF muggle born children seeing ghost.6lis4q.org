I'm looking for recs of a a muggle born or even Harry seeing ghosts. Muggles are either frightened or assume it's an overactive imagination. Obviously they're kids so no romance at all please.


** I'm probably spoiling this a little but linkffn(7453288) is pretty good and sort of what you are looking for.

** It is only a minor plot point, but someone sees a ghost in linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon), and it's probably around 60000 words in.

I only recommend this for the sole reason that I don't know of any other fic that has this concept.
