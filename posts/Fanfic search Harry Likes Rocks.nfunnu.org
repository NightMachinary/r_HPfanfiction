Hello all!

I am searching for a fanfiction I read years ago and remembered enjoying at the time. This post will have spoilers for the fanfiction, so be warned.

I don't remember the name, or even where I found it, but it was about a Harry Potter who liked rocks. A lot. As in, was obsessed with geology or something like that. Additionally he had three random rocks he found as a child and meditated with or something. Found them in a river or something. He gave them names, and they sorta had personalities, because magic. But they were still just rocks. I like to think one was named Thaddeus, but I don't actually remember.

So you have a introverted, geology obsessed Harry Potter. He goes to school and of course at some point first year he steals the stone because... Rock??? I think he becomes friends with Hermione (or maybe it is someone else) but they mostly just study together. Her about whatever and him about rocks. Did I mention Harry potter liked rocks?

At some point his life-goal^{tm} becomes to make golems. Or maybe homunculi. He wants to make rocks think. More than they already sort-of do.

Then second year he gets the diary. Somehow. And he is horrified that someone would make a sentient being out of a diary. WHY WOULDN'T THEY USE A ROCK.

So he eventually transforms the diary into a rock somehow. And because he has been studying animation charms or something for his three pet rocks, he eventually figures out how to make it (and his pet rocks and maybe the sorcerer's stone) into golems.

I apologize for the stream-of-consciousness description, but it was long enough ago that it is more like remembering a dream than anything else. Any ideas of which fanfiction this was will be welcomed, thank you.
