He walked into the usual potions class with Gryffindors and Slytherins. He enjoyed watching Potter struggle and mess up as his teacher breathed down his neck. He take a perverse delight in watching the potion fail and getting to punish the the boy. He takes points and he gladly goes to secure some extra points for his house for the house cup.

​

"Greengrass, Moon, ten points each for showing general competence. Perhaps you can show Potter what it means to not be a complete insufferable dunderhead."

​

Both girls shared a look, before one of them spoke.

​

"No."

​

Snape froze. "...What?"

​

"No, we don't want your biased points."

** This can work in his early career, but not by the time of Harry's schooling. By then no slytherin will go out of their way to piss off Snape. They've got nothing to gain and slytherin's are not known for their fairness.

*** I would say, especially in the time of Harry's schooling it is there.

I mean Snape set Slytherin very much apart from the rest and isolate them from 3/4 of the magical community. And that in very troubled times.

If people decide to look at history and see that such crass bigotry as Slytherin portrays isn't going to work out in the long run and often has to pay repeartions or at least with a bad reputation, it makes perfect sense to say ally yourself with the other side.

Or say it is in 5th year and you have some Slytherins that want to be aurors or anything you need good DaDA grades for and has to deal with Umbridge. And then you hear there is a defense club lead by Harry and you can't even get invited, because Snape and co were such asses that Slytherin are not trusted

**** I think it is a bit unfair to attribute all of Slytherin's problems to Snape. Not saying his actions are excusable or anything, and he doesn't exactly make the situation better, but Slytherins had problems way before Snape became a Head of House. It is known for being prejudiced according to history (Salazar Slytherin leaving Hogwarts comes to mind), had Voldemort himself as part of the house, and was a breeding ground for Death Eaters in the 70s.

*** Slytherin's may not be known for it but that doesn't mean there are none who might prefer it. Gryffindors are known for chivalry and courage but Cormac McLaggen is an ass and Peter Pettigrew is a coward. Ravenclaws are known for being smart but Luna, at first, seems far more airy and misinformed. Hufflepuffs are known for being kind but Zachrias Smith is kind of just a jerk at times. I highly doubt Crabbe or Goyle are cunning, ambitious or subtle at all.

​

So why not some Slytherins who do actually care to be treated fairly? At least one over the years would eventually have some Gryffindor courage in them, just as we know Harry has some Slytherin cunning. Just the one needs to speak up, they'd potentially get in trouble but then they'd get what they wanted by Snape punishing them in this scenario, being treated fairly as the house points are then removed. It might be a rare thing for a Slytherin to do but that would potentially have a knock on effect on the Professors reputation and even if you want to ignore all that:

*** This could really work during Harry's first year. The Harry Potter hype was still really big when he entered the wizarding world, people would run up to him to thank him and shake his hand. This somehow disappeared when he went to Hogwarts (how is Draco the only person to search him up?), but it would be amazing if there were were a bunch of first years that still weren't used to sharing a class with Harry and still saw him as this hero like figure, like Ginny did. And are kinda affronted that Snape would dare speak to Harry like that.

** After that comment, a distance was cast between herself and Daphne. That was fine with her. She danced to the beat of her own drum anyway.

"Come sit with us," she said catching Harry's sleeve as he walked into the room.

He hesitated, seemingly being torn between confused and skeptical. After a moment of trying to land on an emotion, he asked, "Why?"

She could have said it was because she wasn't like the other Slytherins. She could have said it was a way to apologise. Hell, she could have claimed it would be to help him with potions.

That's not what tumbled out her mouth, "It'll drive Snape insane."

In an instant she saw a mischievous fire light behind his eyes. A smirk carved it's way on to his face. "Hey Neville, seat with Ron and Hermione for me, will ya?" Neville looked taken aback before looking at his dormmates. He saw the two bickering and hung his head before heading to the seat between them.

Lilly watch Harry sit in the middle of the table. Daphne just turned and shook hands with him before showing him the notes she had taken from skiing over the chapter. Lilly, now sitting to the right, followed Harry's lead as he copied down notes as Daphne spoke. He asked questions about vocabulary and received answers from both sides.

The trio ignored the looks and whisperings that swirled around them. As if a barrier was set up around the three children and nothing could break through. Surprisingly Pansy was looking back at their table with a smirk. Typical, that girl craved drama.

Snape barged into the room. It wasn't until he settled at the podium did he take notice of their arrangement. If Lilly had to describe the look he gave it would be a cross between finding a dead fish in his bag and finding out someone had kicked his puppy down the hall.

"Oh, I am living for this," Pansy whispered back towards them. Harry snorted.

Snape started the roll call through gritted teeth. Daphne had a small smile up her lips and arms crossed. It appeared to Lilly that Harry was bitting the inside of cheek to prevent a smirk from appearing.

After roll was called and Snape turned to the blackboard, Pansy leaned back, her hair covering Harry's textbook. "I want in."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"This game you're playing? I want in. Snape and his friends use to bully my mother in school. If I can give him a brain aneurysm, I would be able to die happy." Daphne overed her laugh with a snort.

Harry seemed to contemplate something before leaning forward. "How about I join you for lunch. I would love to discuss out future dealings."

"I hope this future dealings involves the twin brothers of you best friend," Lilly mentioned while underlining several words in her workbook.

"I think pulling Granger's brain in to this would be beneficial." Daphne whispered on the other side of Harry.

"Honestly? I think Longbottom could be a great underdog here." Harry pointed out.

"5 points from Gryffindor for talking," Snape snarreled towards them.

Pansy, Daphne, and Lilly all narrowed their eyes but didn't say anything. They worked in silence for the rest of the class. Harry managed to get out of the class before the other Gryffindor's. When his friends poured out of the door to the hall, each were grabbed and pulled into a vacant hall. Pansy had grabbed Neville, Daphne was pushing Hermione and Harry was dragging Ron.

"Mate! What-"

"I think it's time to take Snape down a peg." Pansy interrupted. "We'll show him what it means to be a true Slytherin."

"But he's a teacher!" Granger protested.

"So was Agatha Trunchbull but she still deserved what she got," Pansy argued.

Hermione blinked several times, "You've read Matilda?"

"Anyway," Lilly pressed on, "I have some ideas."

"Like what?" Neville asked nervously. Lilly knew that she would have to help build his confidence but that would be a task for later.

"For one, we need to make it long and sufferable."

**** By the end of lunch, the new mix match group could see Snape twitching in his seat. Minerva was diving her time from staring at Snape and the Gryffindors that took up space at the Slytherin table. The blended group took up one end of the table with a considerable distance from the rest of the house.

It was such an odd sight that a 5th year Hufflepuff named Annie came to ask if everything was alright. She got a round of nods and some nervous giggles. With a raised eyebrow she wandered back to her table.

"Do any of you have an alarm clock?" Pansy asked peeling the crust of her sandwich before dropping it on her plate.

"I have one that my parents sent me," Hermione spoke up waiting for Harry to pass her the spoon for the cut fruit.

"Is it a muggle one?" Pansy contemplated.

"Uh, yeah."

"Perfect. Next question, do any of you know the doubling charm?"

"Geminio?" Neville answered.

"You know it?" Lilly spoke up surprised.

"I've never used it. I've seen my Gran use it when she runs out of teacup when guests arrive."

"Who wants to learn it?" Pansy pulled the attention back to her.

"What are you planning?" Harry eyed her.

"It's going to be a group effort and some people will need to make sacrifices," Pansy admitted. "That includes getting a detention with Snape on a Friday night."

"Why Friday?" Ron wondered. He was sipping on his second cup of pineapple juice.

"Snape locks himself in the classroom to brew on Saturday mornings until 10 am," Daphne answered. "No one goes in, he never comes out before 10."

"What does a clock have to do with this?" Neville dared to question.

"Picture this," Pansy started moving her plate out of the way to get her hand gestures into the mix without sticking her elbow into anything. "Snape, he's peacefully brewing. Suddenly a ringing starts. He doesn't know where it is or what it is. Five minutes later another one goes off. Five minutes after that there's another one ringing. They are hidden in different spots in his classroom. They are all going off at different intervals. Ringing overlapping until he can find them and turn them off."

"How are we able to hide them in detention? He'll be watching over us." Harry pointed out.

"Ron, are your brothers looking to make some money?" Daphne asked.

"You want them to cause a distraction?" Hermione guessed.

"They'd do it for free," Ron commented.

"Oh, I'm looking to pay for their silence. " Pansy informed him.

"And when are we looking to do this?" Neville asked in a low voice.

Pansy head swayed back and forth as she thought over the question. "Two weeks?"

Harry laughed. "Man, I love this school."
