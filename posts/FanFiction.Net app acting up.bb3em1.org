** I've been having similar issues. It's really frustrating. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it's been a little better but I'm still having issues.

**** It's always been buggy for me. Prior PMs not showing and the docs I type up aren't transferring to web and vice versa very well.

** Yes, it's been so buggy! It's still buggy today and it purged about 300 fics from my archive. Not happy. Also won't download any new fics, they're stuck in the download management bit...

** I don't have the app, but as an author I've been receiving double notifications for reviews and favourites on my stories for a few days, too. And then yesterday I noticed there were some favourites I hadn't been notified about. Maybe it's a more general issue?

** I have over 150 stories downloaded. It sometimes freezes at the loading screen. I think they had a buggy update and should hopefully update it soon. Until then I am reading using Fluff which is for AO3.

** Yeah. Leave a review. Hopefully a mass of them will persuade them to fix it
