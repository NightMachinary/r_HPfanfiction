The story's been in progress for a while (with updates on [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/hpmor]]), but it's taken me a while to gather the nerve to post here - I've written in other contexts, but this is my first and only attempt at fanfiction. Partly as a writing experiment but mostly for my own enjoyment. Brit-picks and other copy-editing encouraged, story/writing discussion and random thoughts welcomed. :)

Canon with a few (diegetic) points of divergence, following Hermione as the main character, and trying to portray her with curiosity and creativity proportional to her canon intelligence. It's not going to be a rehash - events are already well off-script - but some things will undoubtedly still overlap, even if the timing changes.

Progress: WIP, ~60k and counting - trying to update every two weeks or so lately, but no guarantees.

Themes: Responsibility, Ethics, Humanism (Sapentism?), Optimization

*** Thanks! I'm committed to keeping [[/spoiler][Future Hermione]] a background character at most, to subvert the [[/spoiler][do-over]] trope and maintain focus on realistically-smart!Hermione. But that plot does help in giving my Hermione a bit more of a challenge than the canon plot on its own might have. ;)

** I have really been enjoying it so far and am always looking forward for the next update! I find your HGPRE!Hermione much more likable and realistic than HPMOR!HJPEV. You went into a somewhat dangerous path with this kind of scenario but, so far, you have avoided all usual pitfalls (mostly, overpowering the character). My only gripe was as a non-native English speaker, with the riddle to Ravenclaw tower from chapter 7; however, this is very specific.

Anyway, great job with this, and I look forward to reading more!

*** Thank you! Sorry about the riddle. I think they're probably more trouble than they are worth, and poorly named besides, since the only canon examples aren't really riddles at all. If I do include any more explicitly, I'll make them of the canon "interesting question" variety.

**** No harm done! I did learn the common meaning of the word “sickle”. It was just a little bit frustrating because I wanted to find the answer myself :-) . Continue doing what you like, including riddles, it's perfectly okay if not everything please me!

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
