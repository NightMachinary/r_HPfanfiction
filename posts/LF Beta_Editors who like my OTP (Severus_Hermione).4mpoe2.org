Hello! I've tried my best to find a beta on places like ff.net, but haven't had much luck. What I'm looking for is someone who loves my OTP as much as I do (Severus/Hermione) and who is up for chatting/editing stories with me. Right now, I mostly go it alone. And, while my stories are (at least in my opinion) mostly typo and awkward wording free, I live in California, so I'm not always good at...er...Britishisms? I'm sure that there are turns of phrase and words that I use that would make an Englishperson go "WTF" or just sip their tea in a condescending manner (I kid, I kid, though I have found that most Brits I've met can do anything in a condescending fashion- it's like a superpower or something).

In general, I like writing about Snape, and I like writing complex plots, but I do also overextend myself and then get discouraged. So basically, I need a super fan who will love my fics to death and encourage me to write more and give me ideas and help me out and basically be awesome.

If you're interested, please let me know or if you want to ask me questions, please feel free to comment here or PM me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3667368/][My fanfiction profile is here, so you can get an idea of the sort of stuff I write.]]

Also, any suggestions for other places to find this specific sort of beta would be highly appreciated. I know I'm asking a lot, but I want to make a friend who will kick my butt and make my writing better than it is right now.


** Hi! You can try to find a beta at [[http://hp-betas.livejournal.com/]] or maybe crosspost over at [[/r/fanfiction]]. They're usually more inclined to help out than on this sub, considering the pairing in your fic.

Good luck!
