I would reeeeelly like to see a cultish horde of fanatically loyal Hufflepuff Death Eaters, for a change. Instead of Slytherins, the "Junior Death Eater" Hufflepuffs are the ones who are feared and scorned. When the "duffers" are not being ridiculed for being too stupid to not have been fighting for the 'right' cause, they are being shunned out of a fear that their stereotypical mindset of unity with one another might be dangerously contagious.

Slytherins coerce. Hufflepuffs convert.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.
