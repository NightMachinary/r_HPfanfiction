I'm looking for some more crossover stories and while i have some stuff I won't read[slash, 99.999% of anime/hp, ginny+harry] I'm interested in most stuff. While I prefer Harry+Hermione, harry/crossover character is good too.

Edit: i dislike Ginny. i also dislike hp/lotr for the most part because the magics are so disparate that harry becomes a major gary stu.

I do completely avoid stories that put harry potter characters into a universe where they don't have magic. I.e., rewriting when harry met sally with powerless hp charas.


** "Blue Magic" - Harry Potter / Mass Effect. Nicely done.

**** While it doesn't nerf the ME technology, it also doesn't make the Wizards pushovers, and the conflict between wizard and Asari customs is in my opinion nicely handled. Magic is discovered on earth, but there are hints of a deeper plotline involving it that reaches to the stars.

** tons of good stories that havent been mentioned, you didnt say what type of fics u want(smut, adventure, angst, friendship, poltical intruige, pardoy, humor etc) but I believe all of these are no pairing/platonic pairing and no smut btw: all also are in HP universe with OC/Xover chars joining them

harry potter and the natural 20: (DND player transported to HP universe, munchking abounds, never played DnD still found very enjoyable//humorous) linkffn(8096183)

the best 7 years: Calvin from calvin and Hobbes disapears to go to hogwarts, meets susie again when hes 18 and tells her about the past 7 years linkffn(2760303)

Then I also read a good sherlock/harry potter crossover where Harry ends up raised by sherlock and watson (might of been !femWatson) but cant remeber the name, harry expermints with magic, is a serious/non silly fic

harveste addams: what if harry potter is raised by the Adams family ?(borderline actual crack, its mainly a Darkcomdey) linkffn(6343441)

something grim this way comes: billy and mandy Xover only without the stupid anoying billy cuz harry basically replaces him only is still harry. Grimm is the best character. another darkish but lighthearted comdey fic linkffn(2666277)

**** While I enjoyed the tale, as much as the author has written and published so far, it would be misleading to say that there is some kind of crossover component in the story. It would be more fitting to say that the author borrows the basic concept of the movie and changes it beyond all recognition; the Harry Potter style magic doing all the work.

That said, I think the closest alternative I know to The Wizard from Earth is a story by Rakeesh called /A Long Journey Home/ linkffn(9860311). It does things quite a bit differently and features a fem!Harry on top of that, but the basics (time-travel into the far past, immortal!protagonist, "ancient" magic, etc) are all the same.

***** I was gonna make it a real crossover, y'know - I just haven't got that far into it. Since Harry's a wizard and can memory charm someone, I figured they'd travel together for a while and eventually Harry would depart back to the Wizarding World & remove the risk of John knowing too much when it comes to magic, keeping wizard from catching on - when they meet again he can just give the memories back and pick up where they left off. I figured that time when John sees someone he thinks might be like him would be Harry, right after the memory charm.

I might get back to writing that fic, but it could use with some drastic pruning.

****** Oh I didn't know you were the author of that story, my bad in trying to correct you then. It was good to read what could be or could have been though!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
