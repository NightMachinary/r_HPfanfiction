The name of the post hogwarts fic where Voldemort had been siphoning off Harry's power, which now returns to Harry, making him more powerful? (There may be quite a few, but I can't seem to find any)


** Seems to be pretty much accepted that Harry becomes more powerful after the Horcrux is gone. You might want to narrow down your selection by pairing or genre.

*** I wouldn't say accepted - at cliche status, perhaps.

But yeah, needs more narrowing down.
