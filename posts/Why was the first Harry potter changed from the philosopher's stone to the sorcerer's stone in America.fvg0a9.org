The philosopher's stone the legend is pretty well known? Why did they change it to something so generic?


** Because scholastic thought we wouldn't pick up a book with 'philosopher' in the title

**** Yeah, lol, scholastic said 'philosopher' wasn't magical enough and that American kids would, instead, associate the book with philosophers. Essentially calling us stupid and deciding not to help matters.

And as an anecdote, I'd like to point out i didn't touch the book until I was about 11 (my mother had purchased it yrs before) cuz i thought it was too thick and only read it cuz my friends were talking about HBP.

** In the United States, "philosophy" is inclined towards schools of thought, rather than magic and alchemy.

The old legends aren't really a thing, culturally, in America. We have our tall tales instead--Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, etc.

"Sorcerer's Stone" is mysterious and alliterative.

**** As an American from a business perspective it makes total sense to me. The word 'philosopher' isn't anything I would associate with magic.

You seem to be basing your opinion due to the phenomenal success of the series. At the time the books were unknown and on no-ones radar. They needed to catch people's attention with the title and philosopher would have only confused the American market.

***** Okay I guess I kind of understand, but I can't really believe every American is so, is stupid the wrong word? I mean the philosopher's stone is huge as a story like Pandora's box or King Arthur.

****** Yes, stupid is the wrong word. There are a ton of American references that British people wouldn't understand and vice versa. It doesn't make you stupid if it's something you've never been exposed to.

The phrase 'philosphers stone' wasn't nearly as known as Pandora's box or King Arthur in America. If the title referenced King Arthur it wouldn't have been changed for the US market because we all get the reference.

********** There are always going to be exceptions that understand the reference. You knew it because you are a fan of a niche animated series that had referenced the Philosopher's stone a few months before the book's release. If you hadn't watched that Johnny Quest episode would you have understood the reference? I'm guessing no.

The publishers were trying to cast a wide a net as possible to get kids interested in the book. In American that meant changing the title to something a bit more recognizable.

*********** Didn't know it was niche, I always thought it was fairly popular, but whatever. I think it was more than a few months too... not really sure.

I don't know if I would have or not tbh. I've heard quite a few references to the Philosopher's stone but I don't remember exactly how old I was with most of them. There were video games in which it was mentioned or other things.

****** It's actually not, which is why the publisher's decision shows such a low opinion of Americans. I can't imagine 1 in 10000 British children had ever heard of the Philosopher's Stone before they heard of Harry Potter. Probably even less. It's a well-known legend as legends go, and certainly not specific to Britain, but it's just not something that gets told to children because there's no story attached to it.

** Some family friend bought me the first book. At the airport before she returned from Wales. The British version. I "Failed" my summer reading because I "couldn't even get the title right" on my report...

So I brought in the book. Teacher called it fake. I challenged her capability to teach a reading class if she can't even read. First time I ever had to go to the office. That's like suspension to kids in elementary school. My dad called her an idiot when he finally arrived.

She was petty and would make snide comments all the time after that. Or mark me wrong for the dumbest reasons. So I got petty revenge by using the British spelling of words.

I still mess up over twenty years later and use British spelling every now and then.

TL;DR: It will always be Philosopher's Stone for me.
