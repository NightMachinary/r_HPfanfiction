All i remember is that it was set in a world with no magic, Harry friends with Weasleys who also have a hard life, Cho was a prostitute, Dean or Seamus was having problems with drugs, and Tom was a leader of some gang taking the city? And harry was trying to stop him? Something like that

Thanks in advance:)
