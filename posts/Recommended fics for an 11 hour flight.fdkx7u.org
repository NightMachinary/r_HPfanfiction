#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

**** If anything, the hidden hero and basilisk-born are gen. In October there's one-sided attraction between males (although Tom got rejected and later he has a wife, so it's really ok to read). I don't know about the Train (I haven't progressed far yet), it seemed like gen (and Harry is 11yo) but it's stated to be tomarry so I don't know.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

** Most of my recs are slash. Hope you don't mind. This first one is one of my favorite Marvel crossovers. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. (Of wizards and heroes) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

A brilliant fic about what Bill, Fleur and Percy are up to while Harry is Horcrux hunting. Linkffn(The Order of Mercy)

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Harry and Hermione end up in the marauders era Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Very sweet. Drarry Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15857595]])

Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini) Brilliant wolfstar series. Highly recommend.

All of these following fics are Novel length fics with either Draco ir Snape as a Mc/focus point Mostly Snarry and Drarry.

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

A Draco/Charlie Weasley fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1907331]])

Snarry once again. Post-war. Harry and Snape swap bodies. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16848688]])

Post-war Drarry fic. Harry and Draco are Aurors. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20309395]])

Drarry. Amortentia fic. Harry is oblivious. (17k) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13818327]])

Drarry. Don't remember much about it tbh but I've got it bookmarked so I guess it's good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15783759]])

A fun Drarry fic (Draco pov) post-war. Where Auror Harry gets deaged. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/391640]])

Linkffn(On a pale horse)

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

A really good tomarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

Another really good Voldemort & Harry story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  Charlie is just trying to get on with life post-war with his beloved dragons and forget. Draco just wants to get out of England and somehow manages to wangle his way into a placement on the reserve. Charlie doesn't expect him to last a week, but his dedication, perseverance, and obvious love of dragons are impressive, and it doesn't hurt that he has a damn fine arse. Charlie's just not sure he can trust Draco.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).
