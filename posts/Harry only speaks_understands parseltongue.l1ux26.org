Hello there. I am looking for fanfictions where Harry only knows parseltongue, even better would be if he doesn't even understand english. It could also involve slytherin!harry, dumbledore/weasley ect. bashing, (tough doesn't have to be), annoying the shit out of everyone, Harry living with snakes/in the wild/where ever... as for pairings: I prefer m/m or none, but others are ok too. If you know any ff like that, I would appreciate it if you could recommend it for me. It doesn't even have to fit any of the other criterias, just the parseltongue one. I have been going mad with searching for these, and have only found abaut two. Thank you anyway :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12754810/1/Monstrous][Monstrous]] linkffn(12754810) is hands down one of my all time favorite fics. It starts with Harry only speaking parseltongue and living in the Forbidden Forest, though he can understand English.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
