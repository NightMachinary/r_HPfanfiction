Are there any fanfictions that are similar to the plot of Harry being the master of death and going back in time and becoming a Peverell? It doesn't have to be Harry specifically, and can be more than one person time travelling. One of my favourites is the Death Trio !

** Technically, it's a fem!Harry, but it's otherwise exactly what you asked - The Last Peverell, by animerocker646. Basically, she keeps trying to save Modern Magicals and they keep fucking themselves over, so she's sent back even further in time to the Marauder's era to get a headstart on Magical Self-Annihilation.

  An invitation to visit a muggle house in Surrey England, the next morning, the 25th July 1991, is received by Director Amelia Bones. It is the home of one Harry Potter. That visit changes everything.

** linkffn(Shards of Time: The Master of Death by Shitsumeishi) apparently has Harry going back in time and becoming Lord Peverell-Black. It's been long enough since I read it that I don't remember much about it.

  Harry Potter is just an eccentric school boy with some unusual talents. Lord Peverell-Black, on the other hand, is a magically and politically powerful man with the world at his fingertips and a war at his doorstep. Time travel, no pairings.
