Marietta Edgecombe is treated pretty harshly by most people in the fandom considering the severity of her Crimes.

Like one thing that crossed my mind is that it took months for her to betrays the DA but If Kingsley real romoved all of her Memorys of The DA apart from the meeting at the Hogs head then in her mind she gave them up when they were having their first meeting. That fact couldn't have been good for her self worth not to mention the boils on her face.(You would think that she would have tried to approach hermione to try and get her the cure but she dosn't, that could be for a number of reasons some of which coud make her seems more sympathetic).

She was also manhandled by Umbridge who her mother told her to trust and Protected from her by Dumbledore someone her mother had convinced her was a bad guy. Really if you go back and read that scene in Dumbledores office even Harry feels some sympathy for her in that moment when Umbridge is shakeing her.


** Marietta Edgecombe goes to Umbridge because she's concerned; she knows that technically the DA's against the High Inquisitor's Decrees, but the Decrees seem cartoonishly extreme. Umbridge is a ministry official; she wouldn't really expel everyone, would she?

Marietta wants to know, hypothetically, if there might be leniency for casual members of such a group if they're not the ringleaders. She cares about her friends, such as Cho. Cho might want to learn Defense and get close to Harry Potter, and Marietta's not going to ruin her education even if she is being an idiot about this.

She goes into Umbridge's office planning to maintain plausible deniability.

Unfortunately, Umbridge puts Veritaserum in her tea.

/Caveats: Snape gave fake Veritaserum in canon./

The only way I could see this working is if Marietta's somehow coerced into what she does, or ignorant of the larger effects. A straight betrayal is pretty much unforgivable given that she supposedly knows that Voldemort's back.

*** Considering Marietta embarrassed her in front of Fudge just what do you think Umbridge did to Marietta. Mabye fire her mother anyway? or Do you think Marietta has a blood quill scar of her own? Or mabye use her Mother jobs to make Marietta accept even worse Punishment with the threat that if she tells anyone her mother gets fired?

**** I definitely think it's believable that Umbridge used Marietta's mother's job security as leverage to get what she (Umbridge) wanted.

***** I think that Marietta's mother could be portrayed in two ways:

1. Is a person unwillingly under Umbridges thumb, like mabye Umbridge already new about the DA because of Willy Widdershins works out who was in the Hog's Head that day and then deliberately targets Marrietta because of the power Umbridge has over her mother.

2. the other is that she was a true believer, and then mabye over the Holidays Marietta lets slip what she has learnt during the the DA and then her mother who knows that Marietta didn't learn that in Umbridge class and sells her own daughter out to Umbridge in hopes of a promotion or (you can also have it be an accident with her taking aroudn the office about how well Marietta is doing in defence thing is because of Umbridges teachings but Umbridge herself knows otherwise) and then Umbridge calls Marietta to her office were Umbridge does something to make Marietta tell her about the DA.

As for how Umbridge would make Marietta talk I believe it was Moody/Crouch Jr that said best"You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone" and I would add that you also dont need the Cruciatus curse at least not for a School girl like Marietta. Umbridge seems to prefer psychological torture anyway. Although she is also not aboutmagically torture( I would almost say that Umbridge jumped to magical torture to quickly to be a person that has never done it before).

** A common way fics do this (if the author wants to make us sympathize with her) is to have Umbridge pressure her about her mother's Ministry job, basically threatening it if she doesn't speak up.

*** Considering the Fact that not only did Marietta Embarrassed umbridge in front of Fudge how likly do you think it is that umbridge took that anger out on Marietta and her mother. For all we know umbridge could have fired Marietta mother anyway. Not to mention what Umbridge might have done to Marietta herself.( I know that The DA didnt end up having to do lines with a Blood quill in the books but for her failer whos to say that Marietta didn't spend a couple of week in Detention writeing for say "I will not embarrass my betters" or Marietta and harry might have matching "I will not tell lies" scars.

Edit: who to say that Umbridge didn't have Filtch get some practice in on Marietta in preperation for when Educational Decree Number Twenty-Nine after all who is Marietta going to tell? not her parent, or any of the other teacher and she can hardly seek help from the other members of the DA?

*** Pretty sure she only joined because Cho asked her two and Didnt she only sell them out after the Holidays, Holidays that she would have spent with her ministry flunky mother who probably spent the whole holidays spouting the Ministry propaganda. when you look at it like that its Honestly not suprising that she eventually cracked.

  she only sell them out after the Holidays
#+end_quote

She was still pretty hostile towards Harry from the start. Lavender and Seamus didn't believe Harry either, but they still didn't tell. Not only did she almost get Harry expelled, but she almost got her good friend Cho expelled as well.

**** So then do the promo from that Angle.

In Trouble her parents for failing umbridge and getting them in trouble

Hated by umbridge for embarrassing her in front of fudge,

Ignored by the other teachers who are subconsciously useing one of the educational decree to ignore her.

Hated by the students on Umbridge side for haveing been a member of The DA

Hated by the DA for betraying them

Ignored by the Other students who don't want to get on the bad side of the students angry with her.

Even hating Herself for being so weak, I bet for A time even Cho abandoned her for a while.( she might think even madam pomfrey hates her and isn't trying very hard cure her disfigurement).

A girl that is isolated from everyone left to stew in her own self hatred and regret of her Own weaknesses. With no to turn to.

*** If i were to try to write something I would most likly write the scene in Dumbldores Office from Marietta perspective, The pain from the curse on her face the confusion after Kingsley modifies her memorys , How she feels when Umbridge starts violently shaking her, the shock when dumbledore defeneds her,ect. the Dispair that she might have cost her mother her job because she emmbaressed Umbridge infront of Fudge.

*** I am not saying that she wouldn't, Infact I would be disappointed if the DA didn't target her. Can you imagine what the weasly twins probably did to her in retaliation. I would not be surprised if she ended up haveing to take a daily trip to the hospital wing for weeks.

And can you imagen how Snape would have been to her, Considering his "I see no difference " line when hermione got cursed, Snape probably had a Field day targeting Marrieta all things considered.
