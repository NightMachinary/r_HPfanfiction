  "The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text."

Just as well Rowling didn't include the incantation for the Refilling Charm or my liver would be in serious trouble.

*** HEY! Tennessee is a perfectly good state... as long as you squint a bit...

My favorite legal decision in the state is the time they tried to prevent Occupy Nashville... and somehow managed to ban camping on state land...

You can only camp in TN state parks right now because of how rental agreements are codified in state law, you technically own the land you rent for the duration of the rental so if you rent a camping plot it is not state land while you are there.
