* Premise
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: premise
  :END:
All three of the Golden Trio flee the Leaky Cauldron on the day they defeat Voldemort, having completely lost their memories of magic and each other. Harry and Hermione both remember their muggle childhoods, but only Hermione was able to go home; lost and alone in London, Harry is left high and dry by the Dursleys when he calls them for help. Ron who had grown up magical has no memories at all, and to boot was also gravely injured, so he ends up in hospital.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
The story follows the trio as they cope with having no knowledge of their past or magic.

Hermione studies Latin and volunteers at The Samaritans as a call agent. Surprisingly her parents pay for her to live alone in her own flat rather than keeping her at home. They also decide to leave her to live a muggle life and will not allow the Weasleys to tell her about her magic. Hermione tries to make the best of her situation but isn't able to connect with anyone.

Harry manages to walk into a job as a pot boy in a pub, which provides most of his meals for free, and he gets himself into a YMCA with the money he earns. He quickly warms up to his colleague Natasha and Jimmy the Irish man who lives at the YMCA, has a gross obsession with sticking his fingers into peanut butter jars and enjoys making the kind of homophobic jokes which I guess were still cool back in 2005.

And while the opening chapters primarily deal with these two along with the Weasleys trying to find them, this story is actually about Ron. After discharging himself from hospital against medical advice, Ron ends up checking himself into a mental health clinic in Eastbourne, where he befriends a girl named Jo and a boy named Dee, who has mysteriously similar memory loss symptoms to himself.

I consider it a fairly minor spoiler to announce that ‘Dee' is Draco. It's revealed officially closer to the middle of the story but hinted at heavily enough when he's introduced that it isn't hard to extrapolate. Without the baggage of their past, Ron and Dee develop a very intimate friendship which largely revolves around Jo. Dee starts dating Jo fairly early on, and the meat of the story follows this trio around as they bond, laugh at their therapist together and grapple with the central themes around mental health.

It's fairly well understood that Dee is fine aside from his amnesia, and Jo is well aware of her crippling depression, but Ron's mental state is in doubt for much of the story, in no small part because he was found with injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. As we the readers do not know the circumstances of how he got those injuries, we have something of an overlaying assumption that they were likely magically inflicted during his battle and the muggle professionals fussing over Ron are simply misunderstanding the situation. As Ron has amnesia he is unable to clarify it for himself, but as the plot unravels the truth becomes more complicated than it first seemed.

Jo wins the boys over quickly with her sardonic humour, creative mind and impulsive sense of fun. She outright disregards the therapy offered by the centre and their main carer Dr Rayner, and Ron finds he resonates with Jo's attitude. Instead of participating in their respective therapy sessions, the three of them talk together about the topics raised in therapy when they are out enjoying themselves, declaring that the therapy of friendship is far more effective than the institutional kind.

These sections are the emotional heart of the whole fic, and clearly the portions which had the author's deepest investment. Solstice Muse was quite interactive with her fan base as she was publishing and acknowledges that there is a lot of her first-hand experience with depression in this story -- especially in the character of Jo. For me as someone who has not suffered from clinical depression, I had a hard time relating to the mentality and decision-making process of the characters, even as I could acknowledge that there was an impressive realism to the way they interacted. Not all of it was due to depression either -- part of it was the age demographic of the characters and what I sometimes found to be a slog through their daily lives.

I often found myself frustrated and annoyed at Ron's attitude to his therapy and easy willingness to label his therapist as a bad guy for just being an adult trying to do her job. I do remember that it's a common mentality in teenagers to automatically make their relationships with adults into an “us versus them” scenario, but I do have to give the author credit here -- she did an amazing job of pulling the rug out from under Ron later in the story and calling out all the ways in which he didn't help himself or his friends. It was an extremely thoughtful way of illustrating the adolescent view of being in a bad state of mental health and growing into an adult learning to cope with it in mature ways.

While this was by design the strongest and best part of the story, I have bones to pick with pretty much everything else. Ron's story does not dominate the page time of the fic and it really should have. Despite at first appearing to be a story about the trio, neither Harry's nor Hermione's stories have any kind of arc to them, and are only important in their relationship to Ron. We also get perspective chapters from the various Weasleys and even some very peripheral characters like Cho Chang once in a while, which largely serve to frame the Weasleys' desperate search for the missing boys.

However, it becomes painfully obvious that the only reason Ron is able to spend an extended period of time undiscovered by his family in a muggle mental health clinic was because the author needed to write a story about Ron being in a mental health clinic -- the set up to get him there and keep him there is so flimsy that it's actually enraging to read. All the adults are grossly incompetent and seem to have forgotten that they can do magic.

Tonks and Moody - who are still fully instated aurors - talk of checking in with the muggle police stations and hospitals on the day the boys go missing, but nothing comes of it. It takes the Weasleys days to find a wizard witness from outside the Leaky Cauldron, then they spend another day fretting about who should watch the witness's memory in the Pensieve as if it were a one-use opportunity - somehow they decided Moody wasn't allowed because I guess he would have been too professional - before they eventually work out that Ron was injured and got the name of the hospital he was sent to.

For Ron's part, after he is checked in to the hospital he has been able to remember and give his full name, but he has no muggle records anywhere. The police come to talk to him as well, and you'd assume file a missing person's report for him given his amnesia. Ron feels like the police are suspecting him of being some sort of dodgy character, so he checks himself out of the hospital against medical advice just in case the police come back and....I dunno; arrest him for being a ginger? It's not clear what he thought would happen, but this sets up why Ron is already gone by the time his family get to the hospital.

On his way out, a nurse frantically begs Ron to attend a clinic at Eastbourne which can take him in and help to treat him. Later, Bill and Fleur (but no aurors) go asking around the hospital on more than one occasion to find out if anyone at the hospital might know where Ron has gone. As we know, one of his treating nurses knows exactly where Ron is, and again I would expect that two very proficient magic users should have been able to find her and get Ron's location pretty quickly, but neither of them get any information from the hospital at all and the nurse is never mentioned again.

We come back to Harry's perspective several times, but the sum of his story is essentially that he has had his job and YMCA accommodation for perhaps a fortnight before the Weasleys track him down, and upon finding that he has a huge family who loves him dearly, a bank account large enough that he wouldn't have to work and a house in London that he owns -- Harry rejects it all outright and declares that he prefers living hand to mouth as he is.

I was floored.

Clearly I underestimated the charm and appeal of Jimmy the Irish homophobe and his peanut butter obsession. Who needs family and friends when you've got that one barmaid colleague who got drunk with you a couple nights ago? Although Harry does eventually and slowly integrate back into the Weasleys, it comes across as something he does reluctantly, and only because they are begging him so persistently. Everything else in his chapters is about finding Ron.

Hermione's perspective is similar. During her time volunteering for the Samaritans she befriends Ron as one of her callers, eventually leading the two back together. I liked this seemingly ‘fated' connection they had despite not remembering each other at all, but it could have been told entirely from Ron's perspective and it would have been just as effective.

The other thing which really bugged me towards in the end was when we finally learn about how the memory loss came about in the first place. I'm going to describe it because it has no bearing on the ‘real' plot; which is probably its first problem.

The trio (plus Draco) all Avada Kedavra Voldemort at the same time -- which works, incidentally - and it links their wands, so Hermione suggests they use a nice, harmless scourgify spell on Ron's spilled blood on the ground to dispel the excess magic and separate the wands. Apparently the wand link caused the scourgify spell to latch onto the magic in Ron's blood, but somehow this leads to the spell ‘cleaning up' all four of their magical memories -- not the blood or even their magic -- they are all still perfectly magical. To top it off, there is even speculation that the effects were compounded because Ron is pure blooded and therefore must have had concentrated magical blood -- so I guess we're also casually justifying blood purity for the set up.

In the past I've read some great (pre DH) post-war fics where we have /no/ /idea/ how Harry defeated Voldemort, because it just isn't important to the story being told, and that's fine. This story would have benefited a lot from some similar pruning, because this set up flat out did not work and was immersion breaking til it hurt.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
I took up a huge amount of page time on the plot itself, so I'll try to keep the other sections short.

Solstice Muse strikes me as a good dialogue writer -- characters have very natural sounding responses and the author is actually British, so plenty of Britishisms everywhere and accents are on point. However, whilst there is definitely heart in the way she writes her character interactions, there is also a sameness which feels like characters can only speak with the author's voice.

The author stated she was having her work beta'd, and some chapters did indeed read very smoothly, however there were a fair few mistakes in others, and it took me nearly the entire fic to work out what my problem was with her sentence structure. It turned out to be a punctuation problem: sentences miss where commas should be, use commas instead of periods to break up sentences, or just leave sentences running too long without commas.

Here is one example, from Luna:

#+begin_quote
  She didn't want to leave the Quibbler offices to that literal sub-editor who always insisted upon evidence and facts rather than suspicions and speculation and she didn't want to be spending her evening away from her who was unsettlingly frail these days but she refused to miss this opportunity to help out.
#+end_quote

That said, it may not interfere with your reading experience at all. I'm fairly particular about grammar myself, but plenty of reviewers unequivocally loved the writing style, so don't dismiss it out of hand.

​

* Characterisation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: characterisation
  :END:
I rarely put this much emphasis on an OC, but *Jo* feels different from average. Jo is the conduit for the story Solstice Muse wanted to tell, and from early on I could feel that a lot of the author went into this character. Whilst she does not at all feel like a Mary Sue, she is almost certainly a self-insert. She feels more alive as a character than not only Jimmy the Irish Homophobe or any of the rest of the cast of peripheral muggle OCs, but also pretty much the entire Harry Potter cast. In my review of [[https://draquiareviews.wordpress.com/2020/10/10/the-man-who-lived-by-sebastianl/][The Man Who Lived]] I wrote in detail about the benefits of writing self-insert characters, and Jo is definitely one of the good ones. Though there is not a single chapter told from her perspective, Ron and Draco come to her as blank slates, and she lets them into her rich, imaginative world and in a way shapes their post-scourgify identities.

*Ron*, who is the real but buried protagonist of the story is also richly detailed, and we see a lot of introspection from him. I won't lie, he annoyed me for a great deal of the story, but I could also appreciate the nuance that went into developing his mind and the narrative around his mental health. I do wish that some attempt had been made at reinterpreting at least a little bit of the canon to back up the characterisation she chose to go with though, because if I'm honest he doesn't feel like Ron.

In fact, *Draco* suffers a very similar problem. Both he and Ron have personalities which feel like echoes of Jo. Even though Draco has lost his memories, I don't feel like it justified how completely different his personality and way of speaking suddenly became. This Draco is casual, easy going, makes liberal use of slang, and despite having no context for feeling this way, he is so ashamed of his name that he changes it to Dee. Even though Draco is dating Jo for much of the story, the author developed a very intimate friendship between him and Ron, and in the last third of the story they share some of the most emotionally intense scenes of the whole fic. I kept thinking this should have been a Dron story, and I don't even like the Dron ship.

​

* TL;DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
Eternal Sunshine was a story which dealt with some very heavy issues with an authenticity that captured and resonated with its audience. It is engaging and in many ways very realistic, but it suffers from certain technical writing problems, a lack of variation in characterisation and poor set up. It could have benefitted from pruning nearly all the character perspective chapters which weren't Ron and just about any attempt to explain the situations the trio were in, as these made the story much weaker than its core narrative about depression. Despite my personal lack of enjoyment with the story and frustration with the characters, I would actually recommend this fic primarily to a teenage audience, and particularly for anyone who suffers from clinical depression. This one gets a *6/10* from me.

** Great review. I agree with your point about the poor setup - Ron goes straight to inpatient treatment on the recommendation of a single nurse, very unrealistic for the NHS, normally you'd be waiting years.

** I'm glad to see this story get discussed. I remember that I enjoyed reading this & Solstice Muse's other story inspired by The Time Traveler's Wife years ago. However, I re-read Scourgified last year and found myself not enjoying it as much as I did before because of the stuff you mentioned in your review. It still has a special place in my heart though.

*** Yes I had a look over Solstice Muse's profile page and it looks like she was extremely prolific for a good while there. Eternal Sunshine was one of her earlier stories and I suspect she was still quite young when she wrote it. I imagine some of her later works were probably much more polished.
