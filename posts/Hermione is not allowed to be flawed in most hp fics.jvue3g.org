Like flawed in a way that has like impact

Ron can be maybe strongly opinionated and biased and then that causes problems people get mad at him and they should. If its not a bashing fic he then apologizes grows from his mistakes.

The same goes for say a character like Sirius its not just people who bash him that acknowledge his flaws. His fans do too. Like I've seen sympathetic likable portrayals of him that show him facing consequences due to his flaws acknowledging that it causes pain for others and then growing as a person. Also pretty true some of Dracos fics even some Snape fics.

But not so much Hermione not unless its bashing. Most of the time its just not a big deal or didn't cause many problems or she was actually right and it not a problem. I know that's a problem that started in canon but it doesn't change much in fanon in my experience. And its kinda a bummer to me because it makes fanon Hermione more boring than other characters to me she gets to be less compelling in fanon than characters who were just meh to me in canon. Cuz she doesn't really get to grow.


** In the Arithmancer her manic hyperfocus causes problems for a bit.

I'm kinda focusing on intellectual arrogance as her flaw to mine for drama in my wip but I'm always looking for more.

The obvious ones are arrogance, self-righteousness, and impulsivity

*** It's my time to shine.

Let me start by saying I don't really dislike her as a character but both fanon and canon seem to gloss over some serious flaws of hers and /that/ irks me.

I think a major one that gets overlooked is that she doesn't really have respect for other people's agency. For examples I'm going to focus on how she treats people in her /good/ graces.

In their third year, while the gang still thought Sirius was a dangerous convict, she suspects Harry's new broom could be cursed/booby trapped and immediately calls for a teacher. The suspicion, in that scenario, is not at all unfounded and getting an authority figure is a good call overall. The problem for me is that she keeps Harry oblivious of all this. She doesn't make him aware of her concerns, nor does she make him aware she's reported the suspicious package. From Harry's point of view, McGonnagall just comes around one day and goes "no broom for u." Did Harry not need to know he may be handling a cursed object?

Another one is her crusade to free the house-elves. What's their actual status in terms of servitude isn't the subject of discussion. Canonically we know that Dobby flourished as a free elf while Winky became an alcoholic out of grief. The relevant info is that Hermione doesn't take the wishes of the elves in her attempts to liberate them. She just makes an unilateral decision and then tries to enforce it. Even if you take that the elves are misguided and misinformed in their desire to serve, wouldn't it be better to talk with them on the topic; make them aware of the reality of their enslavement? For all her talk of freeing the house-elves Hermione doesn't really treat them as equals.

The establishment of the DA in fifth year is a big one for me. Up to that point Harry's faced an attempt on his life, shortly followed by a kangaroo court, and then the most horrid defense teacher to date. It's been made clear the ministry's out to get him and no one will stand up for him the next time he's in trouble. "Keep your head down" indeed. So, in light of that, Hermione gets him to found an illegal school club at a time that, if someone so much as says "Potter," he's going to be in big trouble. And by "big" I mean "potentially lethal." We know Umbridge would administer corporeal punishment over minor infractions. I wouldn't be surprised if she'd use any incident to "facilitate" Harry's eventual murder. Hermione doesn't seem to take any of that into account and puts Harry on the spot to make her idea happen.

Finally, and most importantly, her erasing her parents' memory. I get wanting to protect them but shouldn't they, as /actual adults/, have some say in how it happens? What's more, it seems to me like a rather ham-fisted and ineffectual strategy. What, don't the Grangers have a single friend between the two of them? No extended family? Was the expectation that everyone they know will just go along with them up and fleeing the country out of nowhere?

I /could/ mention on how she devised a plan to infiltrate the Slytherin common room by drugging, abducting, and impersonating three different people, every step of which sounds /illegal as hell/, but she didn't really care about them, so it's not relevant.

I didn't really mean to write an essay on this (except I did) but it's something that's been on my mind recently. Hope this has been helpful and relevant to your interests. Feels good to get it off my chest, at any rate.

**** I've never had this specific flaw be articulated in these terms, and damn you are so right! Hermione's need for control is rivaled only by Dumbledore I think. They definitely share similar ideas about for "the greater good" and knowing what that is for everyone.

As I mentioned in another comment though, this kind of flaw is so HARD to write. Fic writers have unintentionally turned her into dark!Hermione because they tried to explore her penchant for manipulation. It takes a lot of skill to write someone who is both extremely adept at manipulation and has a penchant for ignoring all other obstacles as someone who is ALSO fundamentally good. And that happens to be what Hermione's character is.

This is the exact place that all the Dumbledore bashing comes from, and I really don't want Hermione to misrepresented the same way he (unfortunately) was. It takes a lot of skill to explore the flaw you're suggesting without turning her into Satan's right hand. Rowling barely managed it with Dumbledore, and she definitely failed with Hermione. I seriously doubt fic writers would fare much better.

****** Like I said, she's Dumbledore's heir. All the brilliance and none of the self-awareness.

I'm gonna put the lack of self-awareness down to her being a teenager though. (Pre-teen in the case of her being at her worst in first year).

I'm also going to argue that this would be one of the ways she actually developed as a character. She didn't even bat an eye when Harry said he wanted to drop out of school to go Horcrux Hunting. She wasn't ever explicitly called out sure, but she did get more relaxed around the rules by second year at the earliest. I'm actually trying to see Hermione fussing over broken rules past 2nd year, and I'm having a hard time recalling one.

We can make an argument about the book thing in HBP, but that was really more about her place in the class as opposed to Harry breaking rules. I don't even think breaking rules was one of the arguments she used against it?

Anyway my point is that she stopped fussing at everyone breaking the rules when she started regularly breaking them herself. It's definitely not the usual way to solve hypocrisy but that's what happened here.

(There's a discussion to be had about Hermione's understanding of rules shifting from word of the law to spirit of the law as time went on, and that informing how she chooses when to fuss over broken rules and when to let it slide. But that's not for here.)

****** I'm going to paraphase another user that has since deleted their account.

Canon Hermione is just walking talking bossy exposition at first, then becomes this perfect goddess that never gets taken to task. The movies made it 10x worse.

But fanon Hermione...It's /fanon/ Hermione that I cannot stand. Fanon Hermione, who is practically Einstein levels of intelligence in First Year. Fanon Hermione, who can come up with an immunity to the Avada Kedavra. Fanon Hermione, who is a beautiful Goddess, sexier than any Veela. Fanon Hermione, who is Harry's only REAL friend, not like that bastard Ron who rapes kittens and is just a Death Eater in disguise.

I hate Fanon Hermione because she's just so damn /perfect/. I understand why so many people make Fanon Hermione like that. Guys like her because she was played by Emma Watson, girls want to be her, so that's the image of Hermione in their heads.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

It seems as though every fic I read, Harry becomes best pals with Hermione. Dark!Harry? Hermione is right there getting dark with him. Squib!Harry? Haha, guess the name of the dentists he starts going to. Harry runs away from home? Where else would he run to but the Grangers? Racist Harry calls her the magical equivalent of the N-word? Naturally, Hermione forgives him because she isn't like that bitch Lily.

It's a fucking cop-out. She's used /everywhere/, look no furthur than [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jtvjft/promt_ron_post_book_7_comes_down_with_a_disease/][this thread]] from a few days ago. I'd love to see /other/ characters get the damn limelight for once. Maybe Harry winds up meeting Dean before Hogwarts or something? Harry befriends the Creeveys? Just stop it with this home at the Grangers crap.

And I haven't even gotten started on how H/HR seems to be shoved into pretty much everything, often including Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing.

******* When does she become a perfect goddess in the books? In PoA, she's moody and fighting with Harry and Ron. In GoF, she's insecure and seen as an SJW for campaigning for House Elves. In OotP, she's constantly arguing with Ron and screamed at by Harry. In HBP, she's fighting with Harry about the Prince's book and crying from Ron's insults. In DH, she cries every night because Ron abandoned her and Harry paints her as unreasonable for not talking to Ron after he came back.

Also, I never get what people mean when they say Movie Hermione was a Mary Sue. She was much more annoying than canon Hermione and always jerking herself off for her intelligence. When canon Hermione was complimented for her cleverness, she downplayed it and blushed, but when movie Hermione was called a genius, she started talking about how she wasn't really a genius, just highly logical and observant. Everything interesting about Hermione was taken from her in the movies IMO.

Tangent aside, what do you mean Fanon Hermione is perfect? Looking through ao3, Hermione bashing is more common than Ginny bashing and is only slightly less common than Molly bashing. Even in fanfics where she seems perfect, she's usually just arm candy who spouts off knowledge Harry needs to find. The only Hermione where I could say Hermione was "perfect" was a fanfic I wiped from my mind a long time ago. The reason she's everywhere is because, no matter your opinions on her, the writer has to deal with her somehow if the MC is in her year. She can't just be ignored since she's the top of her class and an ambitious, outspoken muggleborn.

Regarding that thread, I don't think it's because Hermione is shoe-horned in everything. It's just that she has more traits in common with Walter than Ron does. She's clever, ruthless, unsatisfied, knowledge-seeking, unappreciated, arrogant, and believes she knows best. Meanwhile, the only trait Ron shares with Walter is his insecurity, so if we're being canon compliant, Ron could never be Heisenberg while Hermione has the potential to.

******** I disagree with you on this one. If anything, JK does a good job at making Hermione quite flawed despite often claiming that she is a projection of her teenage self. Furthermore, since the story is told from Harry's perspective, I often feel like Harry doesn't like her all that much.

In GoF, when Harry and Ron fight, it's actually stated that he didn't enjoy her company as much as he did Ron's. In OotP she is the constant target of his outbursts. In HBP he is pissed with her for nagging him about the book of the Prince. In DH he is annoyed at her for being a shitty cook, then for crying about Ron, then for accidentally breaking his wand, then for not talking to Ron, then for not believing in the Hallows. As a matter of fact I am surprised that Hermione is always chosen as Harry's best friend in fics, when in canon he is pretty mean to her and Ron is the only one bridging their relationship (but I sort of get it since most of those fics are written by girls/women who project themselves into Hermione).

They use the two rows Harry had with Ron to portray him as this vile, jealous character, while they completely overlook how nasty Harry could be towards Hermione. I think it's mostly the movies that turn Hermione into a Mary Sue because they were made in the era when they were trying to create more heroines and female role-models (and also because probably the director wanted to bang Emma Watson). Then fanon makes her 1000x worse.

****** After the war, Hermione found her parents, but she hadn't spent enough time researching the memory modification. There was no way to change them back. Worse, they couldn't even form new memories of her, because she had so thoroughly erased herself from their minds. No matter what she did, she couldn't restore her relationship with her parents or even form a new one.

She spiraled into depression and self-loathing, leaving the wizarding world for good, locking herself away in a room with only the internet for company, so no one could look upon her, beast that she was for what she did to her parents, and so she could never be close enough to another person to cast magic on them.

In memory of her parents, Yorick and Olivia, she changed her name to Yorick and Olivia's Bastard, and in honor of having destroyed their lives in 1997, added that onto the end.

From then on, she was known only as YOB1997, determined to make sure no one expressed admiration for the sick twisted girl who had done so much evil.

**** Yes yes yes all of this.

I mean I don't mean to suggest that Hermione does bad things so shit on her for it. But she has flaws that can cause consequences and having her face some of them in a fic can push character growth give her a inner struggle and make her more compelling as a character. What flaws depends on the story but you do have canon things to work with. But so often in fics the only ones who point it out only want to call her out not give her character growth and make her more compelling in fic. Basically mostly bashing fics in my experience.

And I really don't think thats true for all other Hp characters. Yes they have bashing fics too but there are plenty of stories that are pro a certain character make them very likable but still call em out and make them grow. It bothers me Hermione isn't one of them because there's imo alot of untapped potential that people don't really touch with her because they won't let her be wrong occasionally unless they bashing her.

Like imagine a story where she realizes her approach was wrong with the house elves and ends up liberating them by learning from her past mistake realizing her approach leaves many issues they have unaddressed. So she changes her approach ( maybe with the help of Ron who i think better at being a people person than her and more aware of the current culture than her) and perhaps that makes her approach other non house elf people differently.

***** A question and a statement:

1. How would you view a (hypothetical) fic in which Hermione suffers the consequences of her flaws and responds by doubling down? That is, rather than learning to respect other people's agency, she learns more effective ways to dominate and manipulate other people---both magically and socially---and get away with it? Would you accept this kind of character growth, or would it have to be her learning to be nicer and more respectful?

2. The house-elf thing is exactly what happened in canon. She learned from her mistake, and by DH, she was able to coherently explain to Harry and Ron what made Kreacher tick and how to win his loyalty. Then, if we are to believe WoG, she used the political system to implement the reforms she wanted. But, that happened over a span of years. There are practically no fics that cover such a long span of time /and/ keep house-elf rights salient.

If the narrative twists the situation to make her in the right then it doesn't have any meaning when she tries to change because there's no real reason for her to thats compelling in any way. Like ya sure she could read more get more smart but its not really meaningful growth.

As for Harry he gets such a wide range of portrayals ( which may or may not seem very Harry like) and people generally tend to look for a specific type of Harry more than anything else. Plus most people even people who like him don't have him as their fav character. So maybe they care less if he gets character growth in fics .

********* There's plenty of Hermione-bashing as well, and I don't think bashing counts as consequences or character growth---usually the opposite in fact.

With respect to canon, to say that Ron (and Harry) get called out, suffer consequences, and grow as a result, whereas Hermione doesn't is, with all due respect, confirmation bias. It's only true if you ignore all instances of this on one side and exaggerate all instances on the other side. (Here, I am reusing some earlier posts of mine, because this argument gets brought up over and over again.)

Harry is rewarded for his flaws (impulsiveness and recklessness) just as or more often than he is punished, starting with the Quiddich lesson. After his disastrous leadership at the Department of Mysteries, Sirius is killed, Hermione is cursed half to death, others get broken bones, and Harry's punishment is to feel bad about it. After Harry breaks the Taboo in DH, Hermione's the one who gets tortured and gets her wand broken, Dobby dies, but Harry gets the Elder Wand. And, doesn't even begin to overcome his most defining flaws.

Similarly, what consequences did Ron face for getting Harry and Hermione involved in Draco's idiotic duel? For badmouthing Hermione behind her back (or so he thought)? (For the record, I don't consider him a bully or a bad person for it, but it was still not a good thing to do.) For exploding at Hermione at the Yule Ball? For turning from Harry in the same book?

Hermione gets called out aplenty by Ron, Snape, and others. (Harry doesn't call people out much in the first place, so it's easy to miss.) As for consequences, and growth, for her hectoring of Ron, Hermione is humiliated and almost killed by a troll; for the Firebolt, she is ostracised by her only friends for a good part of a year. (And, she does mellow out over time. For example, in HBP, she thinks that Harry using HBP's book is cheating, but she doesn't turn him in.) She endures being a laughingstock and loses valuable time for her SPEW efforts. (Again, she learns from her mistakes there, and is able to understand house-elves better than either Harry or Ron in DH.) She does get away with sending birds after Ron---probably the single most impulsive thing she's done in all of canon---so you have that. Otherwise, Hermione grows throughout canon far more than Harry or Ron.

**** Honestly, why does everyone act like Hermione was wrong in the House Elf situation? Do you think it was wrong for America to make a unilateral decision to free all of their slaves? Most slaves were brainwashed and almost never rebelled. There's literally only around 30 slave rebellions in total, and even the few "major" ones had less than 50 people (white or black) participating. You act like a 15 year old girl can reason with brainwashed slaves, which is a bit weird IMO. Also, Hermione's goals were quite reasonable:

*“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented.”*

***** Generally I see the argument as happening in 2 ways 1 is Slavery is something good for elves actually she just doesn't understand their culture and is forcing her will on them. So essentially very pro slavery and uncomfortable.

The other though is there are many aspects perhaps of the magic and culture that she doesn't yet understand that cause complications and make it dangerous or unsustainable for elves to just be freed . There isn't like a way for them to live freely if they are freed and freeing them without changing some things first.

Hermione may have realized that if she maybe talked to them more first instead of trying to give them clothes first which kinda made them defensive and essentially ended the communication with them.

So if she learns to change tactics not just with House elves but in general and the goal was never the problem. And that I can get behind more.

****** "House elf culture", even if it weren't a product of centuries of being magically compelled to punish themselves for even thinking about disobeying, is a distraction.

The simple fact is that we have some house elves who want to be free, who are not permitted to be free. We have others that want to serve a different master, and are not permitted to. That makes them slaves.

Now, one could invent fanon about house-elves needing wizard magic (which is disconfirmed by canon, in that none of the freed elves we see are magically diminished). One could even come up with more sophisticated explanations, such as that without their constant conditioning and binding, house-elves turn into evil imps after a few generations. But, even if one conjures up something like that, it still doesn't address that house-elves can't change masters.

Hermione's only crime was that her methods were initially ineffective, and in that, you have a point. The good news is that she learned from her mistakes.

Like Dobby goes free leaves and then goes to doing the same job he was doing before though he is getting paid.

So either he always liked this job and just wanted to do it as a paying job and not a slave or

The way their society is doesn't allow him to be anything else. So doing this sort of work is really his only option.

I think the situation is more the latter. Which might be why the house elves are so against being freed. Worst case scenario is being treated like Dobby was. If they get freed they will be looking for the same type or work but without the guarantee they will get a employer who will treat them well. They risk having to be treated they way Dobby was by going free and the best option they have in the current system is working for a employer who treats them well like Dumbledore.

You have to do some systemic reform at the same time if you want to free them like truly free them. Again not to say Hermione's motivation was ever really bad but she needed to change alot more things before giving them clothes for this to work and trying to give them clothes that early made them less likely to trust she had their best interests at heart even though she was trying to help.

Its not really a crime but the framing not the greatest it can come away feeling like Hermiones problem was trying to free them. Not Hermione's problem was not considering more aspects of the situation and trying to free them when she did and the way she did.

But that doesn't mean they thought their rightful place was to be slaves. Hell, in the US they would purposefully omit Exodus so slaves wouldn't be inspired by it!

I'm also not surprised that a lot of former slaves stayed at a plantation afterwards. Setting aside how long it took certain areas to hear that slavery was over (and some never really did) - you were just freed. But you have no money, no land, no horse or wagon. The only way you can reliably provide for yourself is manual labor. There may be armed men running around, angry at the loss of their former slaves. It might be easier for a sold off spouse or child or parent to come find you rather than you go looking for them. From a practical standpoint, I can understand why some of them choose to stay close by and become sharecroppers.

Look, I agree that there was a huge amount of dehumanization of slaves in the New World, on an individual and group level. And I agree that the effects of that dehumanization are still felt today, especially when it still continues on a number of levels. I think we have common ground on that. I just don't buy the argument that New World slaves by and large approved what was happening to them. Accepted it, sure. But I don't think the majority of them looked at what was happening and said yes, this is right.

************* There is a phenomenon called learned helplessness, where people immersed in an ongoing negative situation beyond their control just give up and stop trying to change their circumstances, even when they finally do have the resources to change things. The conditions enslaved people were kept in and the way they were treated definitely would caused this in many people.

Is this the case with house elves? We really don't know because the only two elves we're shown had very different home lives and wildly different reactions to being freed. Dobby shows a great deal of strength of character in the way he went out on a limb to defy the Malfoys in spite of their constant abuse, and we're led to believe in the books that it's an unusual trait for a house elf.

I don't believe US slaves were brainwashed at all. Just paralyzed with fear and resignation. If you start compiling and listening to slave music, the vast majority of their songs are about freedom. Getting freed like Moses freeing his people from Egypt is a popular theme. So is looking forward to death because death brings freedom too. If they truly believed they deserved to be enslaved then freedom wouldn't be a such a powerful recurring theme.

That House-elves get any kind of magic from wizards is pure fanon. In my opinion, it's popular because it means that we don't have to confront the fact that wizards practice slavery and can laugh at the awkward teenage antics of the only person who saw it for what it is.

From what we actually observe, neither Dobby nor Winky are magically diminished despite being freed. Dobby is perfectly happy and functional, and Winky reacts like /a person/ who's served a family all her life (and perhaps going a few generations back), even covering up their crimes, only to be betrayed and publicly humiliated and fired.

But, even if we suppose that house-elves get magic from wizards, the fact that Kreacher wants to change masters and cannot means that it's still unmitigated slavery.

***** Because the narrative framing of that particular subplot was terrible. It made Hermione out to be a soapbox Sadie in GoF. And in OoTP, she essentially tried to free the elves, but the elves rebuffed her efforts and refused to clean the Gryffindor Tower as a result.

And instead of people realizing that the flaws of this particular subplot are Doylist in nature (ie. a reflection of Rowling's subconscious biases and politics), they tried to look for Watsonian explanations. They concluded that Hermione was in fact a bad activist and therefore has to be taught how to live with chattel slavery.

As much as I love Hermione's show of heart in the SPEW subplot, I definitely hate all the chattel slavery apologia it spouted in terms of fix-it fic.

**** To kind of touch on a few points, the broom arriving with no card should've been a red flag to Harry. Like seriously, even Dumbledore left a note, and he was giving him something from his father. So while Hermione looks bad for going to McGonagall, it's one of those things where both saw the same thing, just went to different outcomes.

The house-elves are honestly a good topic, cause if that's all they've known, how do we know that they wouldn't enjoy freedom? Winky becoming an alcoholic while Dobby flourished is always interesting, and I agree that her original goals were way too high. She should've gone for something simple like showcasing the abuse some of the elves receive. That starts change and can lead to a compromise.

The DA was, without a doubt, the perfect representation of how Rowling changed everything we knew about the characters. Hermione in book 3 would have laughed and said that he shouldn't be doing it. Or, if he's involved, as someone who couldn't be considered the leader. Granted Fudge was an absolute dick, but there's too much danger there and Hermione would have argued against his involvement. Pretty sure Ron would've as well.

If you think erasing her parents memories of her when Voldemort was going to go to any lengths to get them is bad, you're not even considering how they'd be treated. Tortured--more than likely into insanity--as well as them having a sham trial and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss is all but assured if she didn't do that. And the repercussions are high no matter what. If she fails, it's possible she puts them in the hospital. If she succeeds, whose to say she'd be able to get their memories back?

Her flaws are there cause she tries to do a lot over the entire series. Like in book 3 where she takes every class, tries to help with Buckbeak's case, and can't exactly have a social life so she ends up acting in ways that she normally wouldn't. Book 4, she should've brought it up to the others--and maybe even McGonagall or Dumbledore--before trying to get all the house-elves freedom. Book 5 was just Rowling throwing everything out, so I can't accurately use that for any examples because the characters changed from how they usually act.

Book 7, however, is literally a giant case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situations for all involved. So what doesn't seem right might just be the only thing that can be done.

** Glib answer: Fics or it didn't happen.

--------------

More seriously, for Hermione's flaws to be consequential, her decisions must be consequential in the first place. How many fics do you know in which Hermione's decisions are consequential as opposed to those in which she has no real agency?

--------------

Even more seriously, the problem is that her canon flaws (as opposed to her fanon flaws) are complex and are virtues half the time.

For example, if a character's flaw is that they are impulsive, that's easy to write, and it's easy to show the character suffering the consequences of that flaw and working to overcome it. However, Hermione's flaws tend to be more along the lines of her thinking that she knows what's best for everyone, and being willing to ruthlessly impose what she thinks is best on them whether they want it or not. To write the consequences of that sort of flaw, the author needs to set up complex, long-term scenarios, with complex dialogue and characterisation---all without detracting from the "A" story.

This also comes back to the point about agency. The scenarios in question would require the author to give Hermione power over important characters and events and then have her wield that power deliberately. Again, how many fics actually give Hermione power over others and have her use it?

This is further complicated by this flaw actually being a virtue---a part of what we call "leadership"---a lot of the time, because Hermione does accomplish a lot. Indeed, a whole lot of WBWL/Gray!Powerful!Independent!Harry fics actually treat this very flaw as a virtue when Harry does it.

If you choose one of the other, you will accidentally turn her perfect or evil. Because that is the nature of Hermione's characters.

You already pointed out her propensity for manipulation and how it doubles as leadership.

There is her single-mindedness which had given her blinders, true, but they also managed to get the team extremely important information when they needed it the most.

** I definitely agree. I think half the problem with Hermione is that you need to do a lot of digging to get to her actual flaws. The books had unfortunately never actually deep into her internal life, and the movies are even worse. It takes a lot of effort to build a story where Hermione's flaws feel organic than it would if someone is writing character arcs for Harry and Ron. If you actually want to explore Hermione's flaws in good faith, you'd have to work to even figure out what they are.

Then the other half of the problem is that the flaws you may dig up are actually */very hard/* to write well.

I'd argue that her most obvious flaws don't tend to make for huge character development-worthy problems. She is annoying yes. She can be accidentally insensitive. She's also like a dog with a bone when she thinks someone is wrong. But it takes a whole lot of creativity to turn these things into huge mistakes that would lead to character development. This is especially true if the other characters are her friends and know about said flaws and work with them already.

I'm honestly trying really hard to imagine a scenario where her being accidentally insensitive causes a problem bigger than a minor tiff, but I'm coming up empty. There are more opportunities for her stubbornness like her fights with Ron and alienating Luna, but it's hard to manipulate that in a way that makes way for big mistakes (unless we are talking about romance stories in which yes, that would be a big problem. Watching her learn to compromise might be fun though.)

Her other flaws have a tendency to harm herself more than anyone else. There's her tendency towards overburdening over-exerting herself at the expense of her health. There's her own savior complex that, while much subtler that Harry's, definitely matches if not exceeds his in intensity. There is also her tendency towards self-isolation when a problem occurs for her. Her low self-esteem and insecurities has her putting so much pressure on herself.

Now these flaws can /definitely/ be turned into huge character-building moments, but like you, a lot of people think of character development as causing problems for others. Chances are people wouldn't count these as flaws at all, and many writers don't consider them when trying to write her. Moreover, if they are used, you will have to be ready to fend off cries of "Mary Sue".

And then there is the third category of her flaws which would include her vindictiveness and manipulativeness that, while interesting, are so hard to manage without going full dark!Hermione. They /definitely/ have the ability to hurt other people, but they are hard to pull off without making her look completely evil.

Anyway, all of this is to say that writing a flawed Hermione is arguably considerably harder than writing a flawed Harry or Ron. Her flaws are subtle and complicated, especially as it interacts with her strengths and her role in the story.

Focusing on her being annoying kind of leaves a bad taste in people's mouths when they know full well that her heart is in the right place and the other characters would probably use what she had found later. No one considers self-destruction to be a proper consequence of said character flaws. And her vindictiveness and manipulation are hard to paint as flaws when they are saving their lives.

Harry getting someone killed through his impulsiveness is easy to imagine. Ron blowing up on someone who doesn't deserve it is easy to see too. But */Hermione/* */takes work/*, and sadly not a lot of authors are up to the challenge. The ones who have taken these flaws in stride are unfortunately the bashers who don't actually have to work on being faithful to her character.

Striking the right balance between flawed, perfect, and bashed is a chore and a half given the way Hermione was built a character.

And ya i agree its hard to make her seem flawed in a non bashing way because of how she is.

I think the best way is to focus on relationships. Yes Hermione is smart and usually right about things but relationships including friendships aren't always about being right. You might think you are right but if you use that as reasoning to put yourself in charge of decisions regarding someone else that can only cause problems.

Yes they could make the wrong choice but you have to give them the freedom to make that wrong choice and can't just always take control "for their own good".

It still works because she wants friends she cares for her friends she doesn't want to hurt them but she struggles with relationships I think so it can be compelling to see her navigate them and rewarding when she succeeds. And I don't just mean romance but also friendship.

I think it might have helped if instead of becoming friends with Ron and Harry immediately after Troll incident she got closer overtime. She still helped them but she wasn't as close to them as they were to each other till maybe 4th year. You can see more of her struggle to make friends and get better at it over time and find her people. And be happy because you see how much it means to her.

Hermione is smart and she will always be smart. But she won't always be the most knowledgeable about every subject ever or best at everything regarding like research and studying.

But she's kind of known as the smart one so I can see her face issues if she comes across a situation where someone else may know more than her in a certain thing and come to terms with the fact that not always knowing the most is ok and she has value outside of being the smart one.

****** I disagree with Ron being the self-sacrificing one. He's definitely got a huge selfish streak (but then again, so did Hermione).

But yes in Hermione's insecurity about not being the smartest in the room! I really hate that the fics that address that are bashing ones by the way. They frame it as her not being as smart as she thinks she is and therefore free game in their quest to take her down a peg.

I also find it really sad how much of her identity is being smart, and by extension of that, being USEFUL. I'd kill for a fic where someone sits her down and just spends time to reassure her that they still love her even if she can't solve all the problems in the world. I'd love a Post-War fic where she's dealing with the idea that she's pretty much got nothing to offer Harry anymore, and just trying to make problems because she can't fathom any other reason for why he might stay by her.

I know people got annoyed at the Prince Book conflict in HBP because she was snooty and she annoyed Harry, but I have deep compassion for the kid who was made to believe that she only had value for as long as she was smart and of use. It makes my heart hurt.

******* I was basing the Ron part on his first instinct was jumping in front of Sirius to be like gotta kill me to kill Harry and also sending himself to die in chess game in the first book. Not that he has no selfish interests but he has that self sacrifice tendency in dangerous situations.

And as for the intelligence thing I know alot of people who put their self worth in being the smart one and then struggled in situations where they weren't. Like say when they got to college and struggled in classes.

They took it worse than people who weren't as skilled in school as them. Sometimes that even led to actually doing poorer in classes not because they don't understand the material but because they were too freaked out during the test.

I think it would have been good growth for Hermione not to be the best at a subject that she wants to be good in or even really struggle in it. And then accept that not being the smartest in every subject doesn't take away from her value or intelligence.

Or even like have the half blood prince book not be Snapes or the spells really being useful and come from a unique understanding of the material this person had and Hermione didn't and those spells becoming useful later. Leading people to focus more on Hermione's reaction to the book instead of making the book bad in any way.

******** One for Ron sure. But fir Hermione, I was thinking more in the lines of Neville Longbottom, Buckbeak and Hagrid, and just generally, her part in Horcrux Hunt. Her actions aren't as grand as Ron's, but it's definitely more consistent.

Also, my bad. I misunderstood. (Or more like I didn't want to see it 😅)

Full disclosure, I was that kid. I did well in most subjects without ever actually trying. Not in the level of Hermione, but well enough that doing well was a huge part of my identity.

That said, I'm extremely distrusting when people write those kinds of plots. I'd love to see a well-written version, but for the most part, the current fics just use that detail for "putting her in her place" (again, your comment on how bashers have gone crazy with Hermione's flaws). They aren't compassionate or nuanced takes on how she would react and how she would learn from it. It gets nasty, and my personal investment means that I get very visceral reactions to the nastiness.

Anyway, this is my long-winded way of saying that I have a pavlovian response to those fics (and stories like that in general) now, and I've learned not to touch them with 10-foot pole 😅

I do believe that there is much potential for interesting and complex exploration. Hermione working herself to death to regain her former standing sounds like the logical conclusion of this scenario (along with bouts of jealousy and temper big enough to make Ron proud). Maybe a panic attack or two at the lost standing? Massive feelings of failure too as well as terrifying amounts of impostor syndrome. God, I feel so cheated now. It would have been amazing if done well.

Or if you did like a redeemed Draco story where people called him out for being awful in the past I also don't think that would be considered bashing.

Like sure you may not wanna read those and only want fics that portray them positively and don't really talk about the flaws. But having the flaws won't always mean it gets called a bashing fic.

*** Makes total sense. Especially so, since character interpretations are so polarised in this fandom - it means that bashing is so utterly relative to people. If people actually think Ron is an utter jealous monster who'd basically be a Death Eater if Rowling hadn't pulled her authorial strings, then portraying him that way isn't bashing to those people. Equally, if people think Draco was a little sweetie in over his head, or if Snape was a protective, good person all along, then portraying them as bullies and racists (even to the degree many would consider canon) can come off as bashing.

For the record, I'm not saying those interpretations are right or wrong - I don't know enough about canon to dispute and probably wouldn't care enough to do so if I did - but having those different interpretations does establish bashing to be in a very individualistic perspective.

And not that its necessarily the worst choice you can make or anything but to me personally it's kinda boring cuz the more bashable version of the character less interesting than the regular one. And that's also true for characters I don't like. Like I don't like canon Snape but if I read fic that was very unsympathetic to Snape whether it was bashing or not I'd want it to call out canon Snape so if its too exaggerated then it doesn't really do it for me.

For Hermione's canon (not fanon) flaws to show, she has to be shown wielding power over others (in order to be shown abusing it).

But Ron aside there are characters who do bad things both in the fanon of the story and actual canon or have flaws. Those flaws/bad things are called out and acknowledged. Consequences happen.

And then they improve get better go through character growth and Hermione that doesn't happen unless its bashing where the flaws will be acknowledged but the growth doesn't really happen.

My problem generally with bashing is if I want to call out a character as bad I want that character to be called out as bad. Not a version too overly exaggerated that it stops really resembling the character.

But in this case also I do actually want to see her get character growth because other characters get it and she doesn't. But that can't happen without her actually facing consequences and having her flaws explored.

They are not major flaws, but no more than Harry's impulsiveness is in canon.

There are certainly fics that take the more stereotypical flaws (Tone-deafness and crusading for Hermione, Jealously and short temper for Ron), crank them up to 11, and then have the characters recover/get better, but they are the exception as most fics that crank those up to 11 just bash :P.

** Most of the "flaws that have an impact" scenes I've read feel convoluted and forced to me. I usually have the impression that they are more driven by a need to put a character down than any actual character development. Whether that's Ron's jealousy or Hermione's need to be correct or Harry's impulsivness, it feels forced and not really realistic to me - the big moment when a person changes.

That can work in stories where the main conflict is an inner conflcit - where the main enemy to overcome is the chracter's own falw - but in a story centred on defeating Voldemort/the Ministry/Grindelwald/a magical plague/etc? It feels forced to me - just some side story to check the "flawed character" box.

Further, I often feel such scenes are unrealistic. People are flawed, but we generally can control our flaws to function. Or learn to live with them without some big catharsis or catastrophe and angsty soul-searching.

So, I prefer to write my characters with having flaws, and keeping them - or at least part of them. My Ron will still have some self-esteem issues at the end of a story, Hermione will still have issues admititng a mistake, and Harry's still too impuslive - but on a manageable level.

Also, many of us have family, friends and lovers with flaws, and won't call them out for it. In my current story, Ron's very much aware of Hermione's flaws - the need to be always right, the urge to do everything herself, the way she blames herself for everything that goes wrong - but he won't call her out on it because she's not perfect and he accepts that, Some might not tolerate her - or him - but they do, and love each other. Despite their flaws. And without the flaws having "impact".

Sometimes, growing means accepting that you or someone else won't grow out of certain flaws.

*** I mean for sure everyone has " flaws " and many of those flaws don't go away all the time. Sometimes you just get better at handling them in certain situations.

Do you for example get frustrated very easily at certain things? Has this always been a problem? Well if its yes for both you probably handle that frustration differently now than when you were 11. Many would argue you handle it better now than before. Storywise that would be considered character growth.

That "flaw" may never go away but you did self work to handle it better. The struggle to handle things can be engaging and make a character feel more sympathetic. When you improve even a little its compelling to the reader because they know the struggle they saw it explored they saw you improve. So its meaningful.

But for that to happen you need those flaws to matter. If they are dismissed,not a big deal, and don't really negatively effect you or important people in the story, and all people who call them out are in the wrong, then those flaws don't matter. That struggle to improve at all is kinda meaningless. Nothing really changes if you improve its not a big deal.

There are ways to make it work I think even in big plot stories depending on how its done. But if its done badly, like is overly exaggerated or like the flaw impacts things that don't really matter in the story but suddenly becomes a big deal. I agree it just seems contrived and I do think alot of the time Hermione being called out feels like that in things I've read anyway.

But I have seen other characters get flaws explored in compelling meaningful ways in fics so I do think it should be possible for her too.

Hermione's flaws I agree are more intrapersonal ones rather than like a thing that would impact like trying to overthrow Voldy more directly. But as long as intrapersonal relationships matter in that overthrow Voldemort story that flaw can still matter . Because they still need to work well together. If the relationships or teamwork doesn't really matter in the story then it would be a bad idea exploring Hermione's flaws in that story

***** Oh I think I may have phrased things weird. I didn't mean Hermione necessarily hates to be in the wrong. That could be a flaw you give her and debatable but I mean more that Hermione isn't allowed to be wrong in the narrative in a way that has consequences.

Like for example using a canon example. Hermione is a bit low key jealous of the half blood prince book considers it cheating and isn't all that happy that this other 16 year old ( Snape isn't 16 but the notes are from when he was) is somehow figuring out these weird improvements that she wouldn't even consider. So she kinda sours on that book even before the sectumsempra incident.

So she's basically being salty because she's perhaps a bit jealous and insecure that's kind of where this is coming from. But that doesn't really matter in the story because she's right that author was sketchy because it was Snape. The source of her suspicion is irrelevant. Exploring that "flaw" becomes kinda pointless because it caused no real harm long term.

If she was wrong that book owner wasn't sketchy or that book ended up having useful info but the other two got suspicious of it because of Hermione that would be a negative consequence to a flaw she had.

That flaw would actually be addressed then and maybe you'd get something like Hermione not always the smartest but she is still smart and has worth beyond being the smart one and learning that would help with the insecurity some. As like a potential example.

As for functional I mean they are a bunch of traumatized teenagers trying to overthrow a wizard nazi who hijacks the government and trying to start a mass genocide. I think if they were a little less than functional that would make alot of sense.

Like Ron leaving in book 7 ya him leaving caused them alot of problems. Ya he left due in part to issues in regards to his own baggage. But he was also confused scared just got splinched hadnt been able to be healed properly and scared for his sister being in a school being run by death eaters and being punished by being sent to the forest and was wearing a horcrux. You can see why that could have brought out the worst in him. You can see why that worst would cause problems.

But then can also appreciate that he fought back and the difficulty of that considering his inner turmoil and understand that this might have been something he'd be less capable of when he was younger. And all that doesn't change that he was wrong for leaving. The narrative doesn't absolve him for that just makes it understandable that he did. Maybe even make him sympathetic but still in need of a call out.

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of that moment cuz Ron also left after a big fight with Harry in book 4 so it feels repetitive. But I can appreciate the the other aspects.

  In the same vein as suddenly, no one but Harry suspects Draco to be up to something - plain shitty "The plot demands this" writing there.
#+end_quote

To be fair, Harry was completely wrong about Sirius was being held at the Department of Mysteries. Hermione rightly warned him it was a trap but he didn't listen and it nearly cost them their lives, so its easy to see why Ron and Hermione were less eager to jump on Harry's "Draco is a Death Eater" plot less than six months later. If Sirius truly was at the DOM like Harrry said, I reckon Ron and Hermione definitely would have taken Harry more seriously in HBP.

Also, the main reason people doubted Harry was because they didn't understand Voldemort at all. They assumed that Voldemort:

- Was a logical genius who only let skilled adults become Death Eaters.

- Would deem Draco unworthy of the Dark Mark.

- Expected Draco to actually have a decent chance of succeeding at his task.

- Wouldn't trust Draco with an important task like killing Dumbledore.

- Would want to personally kill Dumbledore out of his own pride.

In-universe, Voldemort was far different than most characters expected. The reality was actually that Voldemort:

- Would give people the Dark Mark regardless of their age (i.e. Regulus, and maybe Crouch Jr).

- Didn't give people the Dark Mark for being competent (i.e. gave Wormtail the Dark Mark despite deeming him weak).

- Didn't give a shit if Draco failed, and hoped he would fail to punish the Malfoys more.

- Didn't care who killed Dumbledore so long as he was out of the way.

If anything, it just proves that Harry knows Voldemort's thought process far better than the vast majority of wizards did; definitely more than Ron, Hermione, Mr Weasley, and McGonagall. Its not so much that they thought Harry was lying, but they assumed certain things about Voldemort that---as reasonable as they may sound---don't hold up from the perspective of the reader.

*TL;DR: Harry wasn't taken seriously because most people assumed Voldemort wouldn't trust a kid to be a Death Eater. Aside from Snape and Dumbledore, nobody who disbelieved Harrry about Draco actually knew what Voldemort would or wouldn't do.*

******* I do think Hermione would be someone who does tie her self worth a bit to her intelligence and being the smart one. She would react not well to potentially loosing that status or it being irrelevant in any way and it would be a good growth for her realizing that she has worth beyond her intelligence and being the "smart one".

That being said...ya I think it was a pretty dumb way to depict it and pointless if it wasn't going to be explored anyway.

** That's where following canon's approach becomes a roblem. In general, I think that if you are a woman in HP, you can get away with murder. And the very fact people's favourite Hermione's flaw is, say, not asking for help shows the kind of characters people enjoy writing. I mean, most people like her precisely because she doesn't mess-up all that much. When they like a character, they someow seem to constantly be in that first stage of falling in love, because it takes some bravery to admit that Hermione might actually be wrong. And her ruthlessness and vindictiveness aren't even seen as flaws. The problem with Hermione is that it's always either 'she's badass'' she is right' or 'Ron did it first/she did that for a good cause.' Strangely, Harry's impulsiveness gets Sirius killed, and he was actually trying to do the right thing, but with Hermione we can't have anything meaningful.

This right here is exactly my problem. I actually really liked canon Hermione but in fanfiction because she has no explored flaws compared to others she gets to be way less meaningful and becomes more boring to read about. And its a shame because there is alot of untapped potential if people just let her be wrong sometimes and explored that more .

Is that why Harry can attack Hermione and Ron with Hedwig, and Ron can attack Ginny for kissing Dean, but Hermione is bashed for attacking Ron? When you're a man in HP, you can get away with murder, not the other way around.

**** I meant the flaws women in HP have as real flaws and that are criticised. Hermione isn't bashed for that attack. People only criticse her. And frankly that's refreshing because she is too much of a victim elswhere or gets to be right in the end because blackmail and revenge are no big deal apparantly. Harry's friends tell him Hedwig attaccked them and he feels guilty. Hermione hits attacks Ron twice, is ruthless and very vindictive, but that is not a flaw that seems to be signficant. I just don't think that would have happened with either Harry or Ron. In my opinion Rowling favours her females, giving them flaws that are lovable to some or aren't trated as such. But let's agree to disagree. Other women, like Ginny and Tonks, get to do stuff that I don't find acceptable and that could be addressed, but in their case it's an advatange. But like I said, let's agree to disagree.

***** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569][People don't bash her?]] Also, why do you expect her to be bashed for hitting Ron, but Ron and Harry shouldn' be bashed for hitting Ginny and Hermione? I have never seen Ron or Harry criticized for that but every thread about Hermione has mentions her attacking Ron. It's hypocritical and you're extremely biased. Also, when Harry saw how he hurt his friends, he said this:

*“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know...”*

That's hardly an apology. Anyway, I know my questions can't be answered, because you already ignored them in the previous reply since they don't fit your narrative. Goodbye!
