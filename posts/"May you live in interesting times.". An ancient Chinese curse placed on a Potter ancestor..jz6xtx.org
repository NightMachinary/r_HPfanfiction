** Would be interesting if the curse backfires and the Potters /can't die/ during interesting times. Maybe they can only be killed in a significant way. But their spirit / wisdom etc. inhabits the next gen, until they come to Harry.

*** Well, let's see...

James Potter's a prankster, a good father, really pissed off Lily a few times before marrying.

Harry Potter survives the Killing Curse twice, his wife/girlfriend he saved from a basilisk, hunted down by Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort, every year in school some weird stuff happens and he can't take a break.

There's also a /Potter/ that founded MACUSA.

Also, one of the Potters created a hair care potion.

*** Depends on how rampant the bloodline is. Given that, from what we know, Potters generally only have one or two kids, so there doesn't seem to be many external lines, and those that do exist don't seem to last long, not really. Hitting someone like Genghis Khan with a curse like that would have fucked over several countries by modern day.

If you meant the other way, that being the bloodline brings interesting times to others, well, that would be true, atleast as a localized effect around suviving members of the family, but the target of the curse would still be the target, so while it would cause chaos by proximity, the Potter within would always have the worst of it.

*** I have never actually seen Last Samurai, so I'm really not sure what you're talking about. I can assure you that it's not a slam on Asians; the fact that a Chinese character is the prospective villain is solely down to the fact that the curse in question is of Chinese origin in this story. Although I am aware that that phrase hasn't actually been connected to China, despite popular belief otherwise, it works for the purpose of exposition.

**** Is there a good reason why the curse is Chinese?

There's actually plenty of western depictions of Asian culture along the same lines basically everywhere if you grew up in the 80s or 90s. Clearly if you haven't watched The Last Samurai, you haven't had to in order to pick up the tropes.

***** I have no how or where the supposed/apparently non-existent Chinese connection to this curse was formed. I do know that I have heard of it referred to in the context of being from that part of the world. No disrespect is intended, and I'm not entirely sure which tropes you believe I have utilized.

Edit; I do believe that the concept of "be careful what you wish for" is easily translated to many cultures, and it's not far from there to say "be careful what you wish on others".

Lol wow. I'm not really sure how you read that and sent it. I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt where a good answer could have been "I've been interested in X region and X fairy tales" but no, it does really seem to be as, as suspected, a mainly aesthetic thing.

Even if you're being sincere, it would be a lot of work to explain all of the even more recent tropes to you. Thankfully, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceTropes][there's a whole wiki network for tropes]] that some awesome people have already rounded up, and it goes pretty deep, and gets pretty nitty-gritty, and is really entertaining to read besides. It's even categorized, so you don't have to read about anti-Semitism when you're trying to figure out how you're writing your Asian characters into boxes.

Frankly, what it comes down to is that it /is/ disrespectful to take something you know is extremely shaky attribution and use it as an excuse to code your story because you think it'll make it cooler unless you're literally writing a crack fic or something. It's disrespectful because it's fucking lazy. Like dude, at least find a verified quote.
