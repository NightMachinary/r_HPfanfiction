Part-goblins, half-giants and quarter-veela are all well-known to us. However, I have been surprisingly unable to find any story with a half-House-Elf, half-human hybrid. Wouldn't such a union be fertile? I find that hard to believe if with magic you can cross /fire crabs/ with /manticores/. This specific query was inspired by the fact that someone mentioned a story involving hybrids of elves and /Dementors/, the ludicrousness of which got me thinking on how odd it is that such a hybrid would arise in the fanfiction community before a half-elf. (The debatably-good linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) has a race of half-goblin, half-elves creatures, who are for some reason called glfs. But that story is so off-the-rails it doesn't even really count.)


** Let's be glad that Grogan Stump defined Beings in the Harry Potter world as "any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws", and not "any creature that has the ability to produce fertile offspring with humans".

Because while that would still cover veela, giants, and goblins, certainly, breeding with house-elves who by just about definition are magically bound and determined to obey every order, has some consent issues. And I hate to think how they would test trolls.

*** Fair point, I guess, but Elves don't /have/ to be slaves by nature. Some unexplained spell at some point in the past /bound/ them. Where would the ethical issue be if, for isntance, Dobby, free elf and glad to be so, fell in love with a human (or, for that matter, goblin) girl?

**** A half-elf-half-goblin that isn't from the Starship Hedwig fic?

Well, if it's a free elf seeking out the relationship, I guess there isn't an ethical issue regarding initial consent.

...Darnit, what would a gobl-elf (elf-lin?) even look like? How would they grow up? We really don't see much of goblin lifestyles when they aren't banking or annoying wizards, what do they do at home?

***** (Elflin sounds better, I think.) My headcanon Goblin society is basically that of the story linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone), which shows the goblins living as a tight-knit community in a large underground city called Underfoot, from which all non-Goblins are banned as part of the peace treaties. They have schools and they have a coming-of-age test to test their crafting and money-making abilities, their wisdom (by Goblin values) and their intelligence and quick thinking.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

** I have a vague recollection of a story where Harry rescues a few young half- human half- house elf girls from a house of ill repute. I skim a lot and don't (can't stand to) finish a lot of stories so I can't do much more than confirm that such a story exists.
