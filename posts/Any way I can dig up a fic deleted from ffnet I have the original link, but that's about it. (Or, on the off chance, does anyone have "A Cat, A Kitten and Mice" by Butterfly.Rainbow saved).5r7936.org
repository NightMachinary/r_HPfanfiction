Hey everyone, so I'm trying to dig up an old fic that got deleted some time after 2012, unfortunately author's profile is gone as well. Is there anything I can do? It's a Minerva/Hermione story, so I would be very surprised if someone here actually had it saved, but I'd be really happy if that was the case. Thanks.

There also seems to be a sequel (?)

** Maybe archive.org has it? At the top of that site, paste the original link and select a date when you know it was available. Good luck!

*** I don't think you can get any fics from ffn on archive.org, specifically for this kind of reason.

**** Interesting, I presume that ffn requested them not to archive it then, as other sites like portkey do work.

**** Yeah, it's probably the same reason why Wayback Machine doesn't work on ffnet, which is a shame.
