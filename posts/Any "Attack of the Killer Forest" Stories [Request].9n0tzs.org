Don't you tell me you wouldn't want to read a short story that builds up to this hilarious LOTR-inspired battle (quoted in full because it's great):

​

#+begin_quote
  The ghastly climax of the 1809 final between Romania and New Spain (what is now known as Mexico) has gone down in wizarding history as the worst exhibition of temper ever given by an individual player. Niko Nenad's teammates had become so concerned by his ferocious outbursts during the quarter and semi-finals that they tried to persuade their manager to substitute him for the final, advice that was sadly ignored by the ambitious old wizard.

  After the game, Nenad's teammate Ivan Popa (winner of an International Wizarding Order of Merit for his life-saving actions during the catastrophe) told an international inquiry: ‘Over the preceding weeks we'd seen Niko beat himself over the head with his broom and set fire to his own feet in frustration. I'd personally stopped him strangling two referees. However, I had no suspicion about what he was planning to do if the final didn't go our way. I mean, who'd suspect that? You'd have to be as mental as he was.'

  Precisely when and how Nenad managed to jinx an entire forest on the edge of the West Siberian Plain is open to speculation, although he is thought to have had accomplices among unprincipled fans and was later proven to have paid local Dark wizards substantial sums. After two hours of play, Romania were behind on points and looking tired. It was then that Nenad deliberately hit a Bludger out of the stadium into the forest beyond the pitch. The effect was instantaneous and murderous. The trees sprang to life, wrenched their roots out of the ground and marched upon the stadium, flattening everything in their path, causing numerous injuries and several fatalities. What had been a Quidditch match turned swiftly into a human versus tree battle, which the wizards won only after seven hours' hard fighting. Nenad was not prosecuted as he had been killed early on by a particularly violent spruce.

If it doesn't yet exist I might give it a go, hah.


** Please do. I love the Tree-Animating Jinx's existence, and the fact that it's apparently permanent (semicanon suggests that one of the trees later took to wandering the Alps and wrote a bestseller). I have included a nod to it in my story, with one of the protections on the Rinx Horcrux which Dumbledore disabled in canon before we got to se them was that the trees around the Gaunt Shack would come alive and attack you. But it was mostly offscreen due to plot constraints.

*** Haha, "Wanderings of a Tree in the Alps". God the extended canon stuff can be a hoot. I think I'm going to do this. Epilogue will probably be someone reading the ending of the book the tree published. xD

** This post got me thinking, and I've got to say, I'm pretty enthused about the thought that there could be Ents living in the deepest recesses of the Forbidden Forest... I mean, it's totally plausible. As book-canon stands, the Whomping Willow is basically a Huorn, so hey, why not?

*** As Achille pointed out in his comment, one of the film props shows that sentient trees exist in HP, which might imply the jinx that brought them to life might be permanent, as a tree wrote a five volume series of books on its experiences trekking through the Alps. Heck, you could infer the author tree was one of the ones from that battle at the World Cup. :) Maybe it left some offspring in the forest... /spooky
