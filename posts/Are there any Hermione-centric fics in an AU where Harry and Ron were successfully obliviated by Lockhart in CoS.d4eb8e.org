  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle.

Had this saved because it mentioned Lockhart succeeding in obliviating Ron and Harry, but I have not read it. I do like some other fics by the same author tho
