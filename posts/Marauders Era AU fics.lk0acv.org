I love reading about the Marauders Era, but half way through I get so depressed because we all know what happens. Everyone doesn't have to live but I would prefer if it was a wolfstar fic and either they live or James and Lily live.

Would prefer a longer fic.

Thanks for your help ðŸ˜Š


** Thank you! I loved ATYD - its part of the reason I'm looking for some with a happier ending. I loved it, but it broke me into pieces. Thank you for the suggestions!

** I have issues with Marauders Era fics for the same reason. I have found a few good ones, though. My absolute favourite is linkao3(Lady of New Avalon). It's an AU where Sirius accidentally turns the entire war on its head by turning into a girl in a misguided attempt to win James's affections

  Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder --- a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy --- the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy --- and above all, lucky --- the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

** Edit:: your good with Wolfstar, how do you feel about MuggleAUs? I've a few that are veerrr good and not tragically sad at the end ðŸ˜Š

If not, linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is really worth the read it is just very good and only covers 7th year I think so it never really hits the sad bits ðŸ˜‹

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

**** I'm assuming you've read All The Young Dudes if you're a Marauder/Wolfstar fan... These are recs along the same themes. I don't read many muggle AUs either but these are good I vouch for them ðŸ˜Š.

linkao3(Dress Up In You by MsKingBean89)-- bloody brilliant. Great characterisations I want to be as cool as Remus!

linkao3(Text Talk) -- also just so wonderful! Very funny.

linkao3(Sweater Weather) -- This one is veery nsfw at times and is set in french canada where everyone is hockey players. I had good fun with it but it felt ooc in my opinion. But I'll rec it because other people seem to really like it so maybe you will if you're into that thing.

Some wizarding fics Marauder AUs linkao3(Someone we used to know by JanuaryGrey) incomplete but so good!! Sirius is expelled and becomes an art thief and it's really great!

linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) -- super underrated. It's the 12 years when Sirius is in Azkaban. Dark at times but so good. Very Sirius/Remus/Grant feels if you've read ATYD. Highly recommend.

linkao3(Marauders Wagers by JanuaryGrey) is an adorable funny oneshot.

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Remus works for the Gryffindor Lions as a physical trainer, and has been half in love with Sirius Black, the Lions' heartthrob captain, for a while now, but he never expected Sirius to return the feelings. Read if you like cute nicknames, slow burn, and pining. Yep. That's it.There's some nice OC's of mine in here, too, please don't take them, thanks!(If you want to see more of this universe, check out 12 Days of Ficmas 2020 in my listed works. These characters also appear (in a very situations) in my work Relic Keel, along with some new OCs)

  After being expelled from Hogwarts for his dangerous prank on Severus Snape, Sirius Black vanished without a trace. The official story was that he ran away from home, but his closest friends always believed something far more sinister must have happened for Sirius to disappear without so much as an owl.Five years later, as Voldemort's attacks grow bolder and more deadly, Remus Lupin spots a familiar face while on a mission for the Order of the Phoenix, the face of a man he believed to be dead. What happened to Sirius Black? Why did he disappear, and, more importantly, why is he back?
