Looking for stories where Dumbledore's Army is used more. Any rating is fine. Would rather NOT have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but I suppose if it's written well/believably I'll allow it.


** Linkao3(dss requirement) the DA changes motivation after discovering a spaceship in the Room of Requirement.

** linkffn(The Changeling) is a great Ginny-centric fic which places a huge emphasis on the DA towards the later stages of the story.
