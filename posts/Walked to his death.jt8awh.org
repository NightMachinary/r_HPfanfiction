In the Book, Harry Potter survived the killing curse because it killed Voldemorts horcrox inside Harry. But what if their was no Horcrox? What if Dumbledore's assumption that the link was a soul fragment left by Voldemort was wrong and the scar was just a magical link that connected the two. Harry Potter is really dead, so what will happen to the wizarding world now?

Alternatively,the scar is really a horcrox. But what if Harry potter decided that he really would rather move on to the next great adventure, if so, would the scar have then survived? Would it take over his body?


** By willingly sacrificing his life for the sake of the people at Hogwarts Harry created a sacrificial protection for these people similar to Lilly Potter's protection. Technically it didn't matter if Harry died or not, his team still won.

*** God that was such a dumb plot device. No one in history had ever sacrificed themselves for someone else before?

**** it's not /quite/ that bad, Voldemort himself recognized what had happened so it clearly wasn't unique.

  “His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. ... This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter. I can touch him now.”

---GoF, ch. 33

If it's something he ‘should have remembered,' it's presumably not some extremely rare knowledge but instead just an edge case or something like that. So instead we only have to explain why the /public/ doesn't know, which is pretty easy to attribute to people not bothering to learn the details of how sacrificial magic and unforgivable curses interact. Voldemort and Dumbledore, as people with an interest in these areas, are both quite confident in their knowledge.

Then, of course, we need to explain why Voldemort falls for it /again/ in the forest, but this is what Dumbledore spends the whole series trying to explain---the sort of love that leads oneself to give their life for another is so utterly alien to Voldemort that he always discounts its power. This is, literally, the ‘power he knows not.'

The biggest hole is the absence of well-read scholars saying “hang on a minute, obviously this was just a case of the Orpheus & Bartleby interaction with type 2C death magic,” but Rowling paints magical society as a place where these sorts of scholars are exceedingly rare so Dumbledore fills that role for us. And, indeed, he tells everyone who will listen that it was the power of Lily's love for her child that protected Harry, and everybody ignores him.

*** Was that ever mentioned? I don't remember it at all.

Edit: A quick search proved I was wrong. Carry on. It's an extremely stupid plot device though.

** The Horcrux was gone either way, and if Harry hadn't come back then he'd just be one of many who died that day, but Voldemort was still finished, the willing sacrifice gave them all the same sacrificial protection that Harry had, or at least something very similar, as soon as Voldemort fired off a killing curse at someone he'd have died for good.

** Other people bring up good points about how he symbolically protects others and effectively gives them the same protection that Lily gave him, but you're also missing Harry's ties to life because Voldemort used his blood. It's not so much that the Horcrux kept him alive, but in making himself immortal using Harry's blood, Voldemort tied Harry to life too. The fiddly bits with the horcrux and elder wand piece are arguably less important.
