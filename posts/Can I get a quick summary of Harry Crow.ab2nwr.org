** Spoiler

Harry raised by goblins, goblins are nice and just want to be equal to goblins, Harry gets sword of gryfindor and somehow becomes “guardian of hogwarts” Harry Hermione pairing whose parents are supporting of an early marriage, Dumbledore gets kicked from the castle and ends up evil, Hermione gets a goblin sword and uses it expertly, Harry can kill dementors, Voldemort is free for longer with a few followers and releases inferi at the World Cup and goblins save the day, the story concludes at the third task with Harry Hermione Padma and Neville killing Voldemort with one other person I can't remember right now. Oh and Harry becomes a baron and owns a lot of land. Probably not the best summary but it's so long that's the major events I remember.

*** Wow uhhh... with that summary, I have no clue why people like the story. I tried reading it, but got bored after the first few chapters.

**** If you like the Harry-Hermione pairing and are willing to read stuff of questionable quality to get your fix of it, that particular author's fics are easy to find and are pretty much all just shrink wrap around that pairing.

Plus, on the technical side their writing isn't that bad, it's using their plot devices and making their romance believable that they have problems with. And when someone is looking for a “guilty pleasure” stuff to read, these things probably are secondary at best.

Or at least that's what I gathered from my time here. I tried to read one of their fics at some point, got a few chapters in, and got bored; meh.

**** Harry Crow is good for what it's supposed to be: feel-good pablum where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average. And, there's lots of it, so you can keep reading and reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

*** I can't believe Harry would treat Dementors like that. Doesn't he realize they have rights just like other creatures?

**** Did I forget I'm pretty sure he was basically royalty and that's partially why the goblins raised him, he could give them more of a say in the government

** Business savvy, warlike Harry steps into a world that doesn't like how he's been brought up, and refuses to treat him as he wants to be treated. As a result, harry will fight and kill to earn a place in the world he came from, while his superiors try and lead him to take his place in the world he's stepped into.

Hopefully that was pretty stoiler free, and it has been a year or so since last I read the fic. I don't remember. How did I do?

** If you're into Harry / Hermione you'd be better served by reading something from Bobmin356. I don't think Robst deserves nearly the amount of hate he picks up on these forums, as I've enjoyed most of what he has written, although Harry Crow did drag on and on.
