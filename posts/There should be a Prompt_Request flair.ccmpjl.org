Most of the times I get an idea and ask for stories that include it it doesn't really matter if the stories are freshly written or years old, so there should be a flair for combined prompt and request threads.


** That is basically the Request flair. There's nothing saying that responses to a Request /have/ to be existing stories; if I posted a Request and someone wrote a few hundred words on the topic, I'd think that was great.
