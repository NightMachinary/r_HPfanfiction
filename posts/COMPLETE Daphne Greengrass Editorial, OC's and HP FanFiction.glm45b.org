I've been a writer of Haphne for almost a decade now, recently I've been working on a video examining Daphne Greengrass' fandom popularity, the Ice Queen persona that has come to be associated with her and Harry Potter fanfiction as a whole. Considering how popular the character is, it's shocking she gets so little exposure in other platforms, I figured it was about time we fixed that. It's finally finished and uploaded, I'll post a link below! It features custom artwork of both Daphne and Tracey Davis, includes some fanfic recommendations and even references this subreddit a handful of times.

Hope you guys enjoy it! If you do, chuck us a cheeky like and subscribe, we need all the traction we can get. If the vid does well I'd absolutely be up for doing more videos on the subject!

EDIT: I appreciate the kind comments! If you guys could help me out against the Youtube algorithm, comment on the video and not this post? Thank you guys!


** You did a great job at explaining Daphne and her origin. I was surprised when you mentioned how little she was actually mentioned in the books. Makes her popularity in shipping hilarious. I really love how the fandom created these charachters and are still adding to them a full decade after the book series ended.

I think a big reason for her creation that you didn't mention is the fandoms desire of a somewhat neutral Slytherin side. Fanfiction writers love sorting Harry in Slytherin and the Slytherin we did have were kind of lacking. All of them were openly bigoted. So fanfic writers took the barely mentioned Slytherin in Harry's year and made them neutral.

I wish the same would happen to the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students, but it's unlikely with how little writers sort Harry in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff and have him actually interact with them. Would be nice to have a somehow universally accepted charachter for people like Lily Moon and Su Li so it doesn't feel like every other iteration is completely different.

*** Very good point, in my next vid planned I actually talk about why the morality of Slytherin characters is great story potential and why JK wasted it all on Snape. Would it be asking too much to ask you to put this comment in the YouTube vid? Gotta appease that bloody algorithm haha!

**** I'd definitely watch that video, too. The Problem of Slytherin is one of my pet peeves about the series.

In terms of story potential (even though she doesn't appear in canon-years stories), one of the biggest points for me is having Dorea Black be Harry's grandmother. JK could have done the series a lot of good by keeping what she'd already implied on the Black Family Tree, and instead, she ignored it and created new characters to be Harry's grandparents.

For that matter, whatever happened to Cedrella Black, Arthur's mother? We never see Ron's grandparents even mentioned despite implying he has a large extended family.

**** An explanation of Slytherin as fan's see it (cunning, ambition, cleverness) and not just how JK Rowling wrote it would be great!!! I see myself as a Slytherin but not according to the type in the books who honestly seem stupid most of the time - the type-cast villains.

** Good video, I think you did a pretty good job in summarizing what makes Daphne so popular.

My thought regarding her case is that, first, it starts by a good aesthetic name, I always liked the name Daphne, followed by the fact she has an already established canon background(Slytherin, not part of Malfoy group, pureblood) and a fanon background(best friend with Tracey, cold/distant personality). Then, we have the fact she can be whatever you want her to be without repercutions, nobody can say your Daphne is OOC because there's no canon character to compare with, authors have free rein in what they can do with her.

She can be the anchor for Harry to the "proper" pureblood traditions, and then, we have the whole Gryffindor/Slytherin relationship, forbidden romances are simply irrestistible. You have tension, drama and conflict that only "true" love can endure. Also, you got post-Hogwarts shenanigans if you take in consideration Harry becomes in-law with Draco, leading to a very awkward family reunion.

Daphne has all the advantages of a fanon character without the drawbacks of being an OC.

I always thought it would make for a fun one-shot where Daphne and Harry get together at Hogwarts and noone gives a shit. Probably set during 6th year so Draco would be too distracted to say anything or care.

**** That sounds fun. Daphne and Harry having this carefully crafted plan of them coming out as a couple, with pre-arranged dialogues, back up plan and everything, and then, nobody cares. Ron gives him a thumbs up and Hermione rolls her eyes with an expression that say "about time."

Also, well, that's the thing too, you can create fun scenarios and do what the opposite of what I said and somehow it still works. Everything is there.

2 words - a name and surname - written in the 5th book offhandedly that gave birth to thousand of stories.

***** The way I imagine it, most people point out that not only is it not the first time a Slytherin and Gryffindor have dated, there are more than one current couple in the school across those houses. And then any Slytherin that hates Harry assumes that Daphne has some plan that involves seducing Harry Potter and they just go on with their lives.

**** Sure, no problem.

I still believe that, above all, beauty is what holds all of this together. Let's be honest, she's the stereotypical beautiful girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. People want Harry to be with someone beautiful. In my opinion, it's not a shallow thing, people just want Harry to be with someone pretty. It's in a way, a "reward" for everything he has been through. Also, Daphne Greengrass is, in my opinion, a beautiful name. The hero slays the dragon and gets the princess, and you can always switch roles; Daphne being in distress(save her from the snake pit) or Harry(help him with his complex situation as the Chosen One).

** The thing I love about this is that the fandom collectively decided to take this barely mentioned character and build a fairly cohesive set of character traits and personality around her completely by accident. I was actually surprised when I reread the books to find that Daphne has no character. I was so used to her having the same personality, even in stories where she isn't the focus. It's pretty amazing.

** Really good video and analysis of the Daphne Greengrass character. One point on her origin I do think you missed however is that Daphne is basically in many ways a replacement of the fem!Blaise Zabini character fans shipped with Harry that was popular before 2005 when her character got revealed to be a dude in Half Blood Prince. That pre-2005 fan version was also a ice queen type character and Daphne basically filled the void that was left when fem!Blaise no longer was usable, and later become even more popular than fem!Blaise.

Also, cool to know your the author of Living Dangerously, as I've recently been starting to read it and am quickly becoming a huge fan of that story. Almost finish with it and then I'll start reading the sequel Living in Secret soon after. Can't wait for that.
