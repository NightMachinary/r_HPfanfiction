I know one where Harry is James' twin. It's sadly incomplete but I will search it anyway.

Easily one of the best Harry goes back in time as it doesn't focus on pairings, and he tries so desperately to not be involved, fails and then begins to realize he might need to invent time travel to return. Ravenclaw!Harry

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
