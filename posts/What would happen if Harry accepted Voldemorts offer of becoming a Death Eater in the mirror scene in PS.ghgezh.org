At least, I'm fairly sure that he was offered so, since Voldemort has this weird thing where he like, tortures and kills everyone, but is also like "oh hey, imma cool, fair dude. See LOOK I'm offering this young child a chance to serve me, ME! See Albus whose the merciful one now? Aren't I awesome?"

Anways I digress. What if Harry accepted? Well, why would Harry want to join Voldemort, his parents murderer? Maybe he believes him when Voldemort says he can bring Harry's parents back? Or maybe he could do something interesting and really show his acclaimed "Slytherin" side, like saying that he would join Voldemort just to distract him and get him the stone. Or he could be like "hey gimme the stone and ill join you", and then like running off with the stone. Or maybe Voldemort throws a crucio at him and Harry's so put out by the pain he's like "stop I'll join you". Alternatively, Harry's annoyed that Snape was such a git, but he's just the normal type and not an /evil/ git, and quirellmort might mention something about snape and Harry's like "tf he killed my parents,, 1! 1!" and that causes him to join for whatever reason. Also Riddle/Voldemort was said to possess a silver tongue. It would be cool to see him use it so effectively he gets the child /he/ orphaned to join up with him.

Anways just my incoherent musings. Though if there are any fics that revolve around this theme, links would be much appreciated ‚ò∫Ô∏è


** It depends on why Voldie never attacked Harry directly with spells. If he suspected a magical backlash is possible, similar to Harry surviving AK, he might be saying it simply to get the stone without cursing Harry, then tied Harry and escape Hogwarts, kidnapping optional depending on if he already planned to use Harry's blood. He could also tell Harry to grab a broom and lead the way out, then disable Harry's broom when they're way higher.

If he actually wanted to have Harry serving him, then there's an additional branch. Would Harry's touch still harm Quirrel? Assuming it still does because Lily's protection can't be canceled, Voldemort might attempt to get Harry's blood for the resurrection ritual knowing the protection is still active. Wait, does a servant have to give a huge chunk of flesh? Ouch. Were Quirrel able to touch Harry normally, Voldemort might still attempt to hurt Harry if only to see just how much Lily's protection is still there.

Harry attempting anything smart won't change much, sooner or later he'd try to flee, Quirrel will attempt to stop him, and it's the pain-fest like in canon. If Voldie can use the knowledge about Snape overhearing the prophecy to twist Harry into his side, Voldie gets an angry kid that's perfect to divide the Wizarding Britain, but nothing more. Canon shows Harry would've died multiple times were it not for Hermione and/or dumb luck.

** In the Resonance series, they visit an alternate universe where this happens. Harry vows not to ever fight Voldemort, I think. Voldemort does indeed restore Lily and James, though James immediately attacks Voldemort and is killed again. Then Lily and Harry hide in the arctic, everyone thinks Harry has died, and Voldemort takes over. Harry is kind of stunted emotionally from being away from everyone except his mother, and physically from only eating whatever they can hunt away from civilization. It was a pretty dark universe.

*** I read "physically eating all of civilization" üòÖ, though I do suppose the reality isn't much better. Anway this looks really cool but also like something that would emotionally murder me üòî
