Hello!

Well, I'm new to Harry Potter fanfiction, and I'm just reading a fic that I'm loving. So, do you know some fics where Harry is interested in becoming powerful and doesn't care much about the means.

I don't want a emotionless Harry, and I don't care if it is a "evil" Harry, I just want him to search knowleadge about magic, even if its Dark. Oh and please, no godlike Harry at the age of 12 please, experience is important. And even if I don't care if it is a evil Harry, I don't want him to be Naruto either please, so don't power of love and friendship crap there, thanks.

The closest I got is the fic I'm reading right now, For Love of Magic.

Thanks!

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

**** The other fics of disobediencewriter are worth reading too. Although usually short.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt]]) could meet your request, too. It's only third year currently, but I like the pace at which Harry learns magic.

Also Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]]) and Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]) feature a Harry who seeks power. Both of them are good read, the merging has a marvellous feel to it.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

I'll admit there are a lot of overly used and rather bad tropes that would make me cringe if I were to discover it now, but I started reading fanfictions when it was being published, and those tropes were new to me, so it did not bother me.

Moreover, the writing style is rather pleasant.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
