I saw a Tumblr post about how someone had a turtle named Voldetort but the mom was embarrassed to tell the vet and said his name was Susan.


** Plot twist: Voldetort is Voldemort who got stuck in his animagus form or was transformed by someone (Dumbledore etc.)

*** Most of the time, Voldetort isn't there, but whenever he is present (at crucial plot moments usually), the story exclusively focuses on him and doesn't narrate anything else.

And in the end, he defeats the real Voldemort by making him trip over the hogwarts bridge.

**** "Hey, Ron, there's a troll in the dungeons!"

"Yeah... Let's leave."

"No, no. We can't just leave her... Ron! I know what we're gonna do today!"

"...Hey, where's voldetort?"

/in a most definitely forbidden corridor on an equally forbidden floor, a turtle finds himself inching past a sleeping Cerberus, through some rather aggressive plant life, etc etc. Before finally grabbing a rather nice looking rock from a dyslexic mirror. Had anyone been paying particular attention to this turtle, they'd be surprised to see a small, brown fedora on it's head./

***** I was thinking more in the way of:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was trudging down the grand staircase, having come from a meeting with the Headmaster, in which he had revealed the horrifying, ultimate truth about his evilness and exotic magics.

  "Harry! Good to see you. So what did Dumbledore say about Voldemort?

  "Keep your voices down! Well, first he had me sit down, we talked a bit about my grades and such, and then he started telling the good stuff."

  Ron and Hermione leaned forwards a little.

  "He began by explaining Voldemort's Childhood-"

  /Voldetort had just awoken from a nap. It had been a good nap, truly, at least as much as a slightly magical tortoise could appreciate good naps. He grabbed himself one of the cabbage leaves, and munched on it./

  /As he was munching, he became dimly aware of Harry's voice outside the bag. Though it was quite audible from his position, he was still a tortoise. And although he could understand english, what was said was not very riveting to him at all./

  /So he kept munching, and Harry kept talking, those little friends of his gasping at some points, and Voldetort moved on to the tomato. It was a little stale, having sat under one of the potions books, but still palatable to Voldetort. When he was finished, he went back to sleep./

  "-shit Harry, that's rough."

** Instead of scouring the countryside for various Voldebits, Harry uses a spell to permanently transfigure ol' Tommy boy into a harmless animal, and tells everyone he's dead. Voldetort the immortal turtle becomes a beloved Potter family pet for generations. Dumbledore is very confused in the next great adventure.

*** I've seen something a bit similar before, where he wiped all Voldemort's memories and transfigured him into a rock, but since it's obviously the ending, telling the story name would be a spoiler.

**** Yes. In English, turtle refers to species that live in the water and a tortoise refers to species that live on the land. Although, people often use the terms interchangeably in everyday speech. In my personal experience, people often use the word 'turtle' for both and rarely use the word tortoise at all, even though this is not correct. The exception is when they are referring to specific species, such as giant tortoises, when they usually get it right just because of the name of the species. If they talk about sea turtles, they mean one of the species of turtles that live in the ocean/sea, not water dwelling turtles generally (and, yes, there are freshwater turtles).
