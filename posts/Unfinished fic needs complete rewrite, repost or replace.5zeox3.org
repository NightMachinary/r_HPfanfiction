Several years ago I started writing a piece and posting it on fanfiction, under the title "The Effect Of Lies". ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9102743/1/The-Effect-Of-Lies]] )

However, life got in the way several chapters in, and it got discontinued while I dealt with some real life things.

I never intended to neglect this story and leave it unfinished, and the ideas and plot are still in my head, however having read back over what I have posted so far, the style I was using is completely whack, and its clear in the latest few chapters just how much I wasn't capable of focus.

My question is regarding continuing this fic, and what I should do. I want to (need to) revist, but have accepted this will result in a complete rewrite from scratch. Would readers recommend replacing chapters within original story with updated versions, reposting completely in a new format or some other options?

*** I was considering something along the lines of what you had suggested, but wasn't certain if it would be considered as spamming the followers. I was thinking to do the rewrite of everything, post with alerts turned on for the first chapter, and a note saying the revisions will be up within a set time, then continuing from normal. Wasn't sure if that extra message would be classed as an annoyance to subscribers, but the edits I'm already working on will restructure the first few chapters completely

** Personally, I'd rewrite. Post as a new story, then make a new chapter in the old story where you explain the change. The people who are still interested will follow you to the new story, and it will be easier for new readers who gets to not start reading a story where chapters gets changed after they have read it.

** Rewrite but post new chapter starting at wherever you stopped. Ad a note to first chapter saying which is the new first chapter and to go there.
