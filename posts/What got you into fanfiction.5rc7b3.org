  Harry gets picked for the Triwizard Tournament. He does not like this. Mayhem, destruction, and HHR. OOC Harry. M for violence and frequent profanity.

** I started with Buffy the vampire slayer fanfic. I wasn't always allowed to watch it as it aired, so I would read the episode synopsis on fan sites. Eventually I noticed that there were other links and learned that fanfic existed. After reading the first book I immediately searched for HP fic and it has been my main fandom since.

** After I was done with Books and Movies, fanfics were the logical next step.

** I think I started reading around 15-16 years ago. Ten year old me wanted more adult oriented stories, mainly about Snape and the Dark, so I found ff.net and so many other sites that closed down years ago. The first story I found was a Snape/Hermione fic and I was sold with fanfiction.

** One of the first fics that got me into fanfiction (that I can remember) was actually a Legend of Zelda one "The Biggest of Lies" by Kasuto of Kataan, and of course, all of its sequels (I really need to go back and read those again.) After getting bored at Kasuto.net I migrated towards Pokemon (the anime) fanfiction at The Pokemon Tower. I frequented these sites until, as a high schooler I decided that I was "too old" for "that nonsense".

I quit reading fanfiction until I rediscovered it in college with, you guessed it, Harry Potter fanfiction. I was reading mostly Harry/Ginny romance at that point, until I discovered Dramione. I really tumbled down the rabbit hole with that one. Dramione has been and probably always will be my biggest OTP. (As nonsensical as it may seem to other shippers)

I'm a fanfiction addict and no one in my life understands, but this has been my crack since my age was in single digits.

** On a current events blog I follow, there happened to be a post about one of the bÃªte noire stories in this sub [[/spoiler][HPMoR]]. I was intrigued and wound up reading everything that had been published up to that point (March 2014). I was a lurker on reddit at the time, found this sub, started lurking here, and eventually started following links, primarily to FFN but also ao3 and occasionally others.

My tastes have changed a bit since I started reading, but that's how it goes.

** I don't know if you're familiar with the author LJ Smith (She wrote The Vampire Diaries, Night World, The Secret Circle, etc) but I was in love with her books when I was younger (I still have a soft spot for them) and I found a website, ttales.net, where people posted stories about her universe. I had no idea it was fanfiction until I researched further and found ffnet and eventually discovered HP fanfic, among many other fandoms.

** Anime fanfiction in the 90s. Crossover stories tended to introduce new fandoms to me - I came to HP fanfiction through Buffy.

** I started out with League of Legends, Frozen and Touhou fanfiction, both as reader and author. What got me into fanfiction in general was to fix couples I disliked, more of what I liked and, especially in regards to Frozen and TH, dark, mature and/or nasty stuff. Smut was very rarely optional. The same goes for Harry Potter fanfiction, sans the smut which is optional. I quite frankly dislike Ginny and Harry as a couple and I don't necessarily like Ron. I also love dark and/or evil Harry and I'm a sucker for 'for want of a nail' stories. And fanfiction provides me with all of this

** A friend of mine showed me a few fics for Blue Exorcist on FFN, I thought it was interesting and Iooked up HP. Few hours scrolling through and I've been reading ever since. Going on about 3 years now.

** In about 2005 this girl told me about this story linkffn(1318020) and I was sort of like "Yeah whatever, I'll check it out I just finished my last book anyway" She didn't give me any warnings about the slash or the violence and 12 year old me was not prepared for it, so I didn't read it out of embarrassment and put it out of my mind. Though after the last book was released I felt like I needed to find something to fill the void it left, and I tried reading other books that tried to follow in the footsteps of Harry Potter but I couldn't and then I remembered this story, it took me weeks to try and piece together what I remembered of the story I barely started reading when I finally came across it I read it non-stop and never looked back. I've never quite got over this story and even poorly written stories that are reminiscent of it I can't help but enjoy.

** I don't remember how I got into the HP fanfics, but I started when the Callica storyline went on Grey's Anatomy in 2008(?). Stumbled over a forum in my search for more about this pairing and found fanfics and it went on from there.
