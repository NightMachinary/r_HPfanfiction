  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3510863/Consume]]): Hermione goes back in time to assassinate Tom Riddle, and, for once, she doesn't get distracted by his good looks. Unfortunately, she doesn't stop there...

** Every time that happens the altered future diverges from this timeline and JKR never writes canon, so HPFF doesn't exist, so those stories don't exist.

*** Stop trying to be funny.

Obviously if Tom is killed as a child, Hitler would have won WW2 and we would all be living in a fascist state.

The story would be Akira styled like with Harry as the protagonist.

That's actually sounds neat! I might write it.

Oh and Grindelwald co rules with Hitler as the Magical "King"

  One last desperate gambit lands Harry in the past, to change the whole course of history - for the better. There's no turning back on the path Harry has taken, no second chances. Dark!Harry, vampire!Harry, time travel. 4th place in May DLP challenge.
