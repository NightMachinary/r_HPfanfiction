** In reality, it's actually Rave Against the Dark Arts. It's a huge underground party to celebrate the completion of their training. It's traditional not to tell the trainees until after they've arrived, battle ready and all. Of course, there is dueling but there's also music, lights shows, and dancing.

** For those unaware, that's the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, a performing arts school in London. (Probably, anyway - this is the internet, it could be fuckin' anything at the end of the day).
