I remain steadfast in my pursuit of script of quality that is beyond shadow of doubt worthy of honuors upon it bestowed for its greatness and awesomeness can not be denied. Indeed, I persist and give chase after those works I find myself capable of tracking down be it in the darkest day, spreading its gloom upon the world like a depression of Dementors moste foul with a rustle of the cloak as the condemned moan their despair forevermore! Let royal hue grace the page and with shade this most appreciable, let the Purple Prose commence!

Let the jokesters and fools, every kidder, quipper, punster be aware or be made to, that in endavour this most holy, effort must be great indeed, this collosal undertaking, the uneventful, uninspired, unmemorable and unnoteworthy shall be banished and discarded, in rejection, isolation, for though Dar'k'ness comes a calling, though majestic like the raven that upon'er brow hath nested, proves far too banal, used up, vapid - and shall swiftly be rejected.

//Discussion is dedicated to most perspicuous examples of purple prose in Harry Potter fanfiction and key words that make recognition of such even quicker. Also welcome are examples of impressively atrocious writing. My Immortal is all over the place and too well known to feature here - falls afoul of the 'bare minimum of effort' I'm afraid XD
