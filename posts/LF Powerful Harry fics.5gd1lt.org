i've read quite a lot of the category of harry being powerful/overpowered/bamf etc...with that said i'm looking for a super!harry fic that follow this criteria.

- a "Force to be reckon with" Harry; Where Harry is powerful or skilled enough to wipe the floor with regular enemies and even sub-bosses but is challenged when it comes to the bigger guns. I.e /Harry demolishes a group of death eaters but nearly died in his first encounter with Voldie/

- exciting or well done fight scenes

- Not a crossover

- does NOT feature an evil or psychotic/insane harry, a dark or morally ambiguous harry though, is more than welcomed.

- No cross-dimensional travelling that includes but not limited too; time-travelling, planetary travel, "redo" trope..

- If the fic features harry progressively becoming stronger, don't have it where it takes half the fic to do so to reach a certain point. the more concise the "training" or whatever method the author uses, the better.

- If the fic features romance of any sort, no slashes or gender-bends.

- decent or readable writing quality.

Fics that i've already read and more or less, fall under the above mentioned criteria.

linkffn(I still haven't found what I'm looking for) if the planet travel thing isn't a deal breaker.
