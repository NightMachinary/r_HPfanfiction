What nature out of the 5 basic nature transformations from naruto do you think harry is?

​

Personally I am leaning toward fire or lightning maybe.

​

I need this for a fanfiction that im writing.


** Fire. Almost everything about him reps/relates to fire and he even represents the element in GoF.

** Earth.

I have an elaborate head cannon based on daoist elements/body types and personality. Look at the Ame ninja who go through the ground, and Harry body types. Sasuke's cool exterior, Kakashi's attitude and type. Fire and lightning probably not for Harry.

Harry's skinny and flexible frame and personality make me think either water or earth. But with his personality... I think Earth is the better balance. It's a sort of... Opposite elements to body type, though sometimes supportive. The supportive or extreme types (like a giant sturdy guy with Earth, a Hagrid type) tend to be all in. And Harry doesn't meet those requirements for water. Hence earth.
