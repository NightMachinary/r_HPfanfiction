This is really just a rant/complaining and is probably an unpopular opinion but I read Green-Eyed Monster ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7221922/1/Green-Eyed-Monster]]) when it was first being published on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and fell in love with not only the author's style of writing but her dedication to creativity and ~realness~ so I have to say when I saw To Be a Slytherin ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin]]) having so many similarities (in terms of character and plotline) but more reviews/favorites and being published *four years* after GEM I was both annoyed and frustrated. I was reading some of the recent reviews on GEM and saw someone say it had too many similarities to TBS like it wasn't published first! I feel honestly insulted for the author. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery but their plotlines are way too similar for comfort.

** They are the same flavors of a similar idea. But accusing the authors of plagiarism is frankly insulting. Both of them copy tons of ideas from canon. There is a large amount of divergence in the DH plot. TBS is fundamentally more optimistic than GEM and has a better/longer epilouge-arc with better endings for everyone involved while GEM reads like a tragedy. Lorena and Audrey are very different characters and so is everyone in Slytherin. GEM diverges more from canon and has more original ideas while TBS has better pacing with symmetrical OC's who build on canon themes.

Lorena is closer to her brother and has a less tragic story arc than Audrey. TBS covers pre-hogwarts time and time spend at Dursleys in between school better than GEM which skips it too fast.

The biggest difference for me though is the extra muggle OC Amity Raincrow in TBS. Her characterization is done nicely with an original backstory and a side fic. The Snape arc in TBS is a lot better than the one in GEM because of her.

*** Never did I say in my post that there was plagiarism. You can go and check for yourself. I only ever said that the storyline and main character were too similar for my comfort. I was irritated that people were commenting that GEM was too like TBS when it was published first. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. I personally found the beginning of TBS too unrealistic to get through and the similarities of Lorena to Audrey a deterrent to me continuing to read it. Who know maybe one day I will decide to skip the first 20 chapters and find that I enjoy the story just as much as GEM. But for now I am definitely turned off. The least the author of TBS could do is say that they were inspired by GEM like many other authors of other fan fictions have done before (I am referencing the success of Dreaming of Sunshine, a Naruto SI fanfic that revitalized the genre and inspired a whole new era of SI fanfics for that fandom, most authors credited Dreaming of Sunshine as their inspiration). I also slightly doubt the author never read GEM as it was a leading Draco/OC fanfic on FF.net for ~3/4 years. But also maybe they didn't I really don't know.

**** I agree with most of it. It is entirely possible that the author of TBS did not know of GEM, both of them are similar enough to canon for this to be possible.TBS ended before GEM did while GEM started first which would indicate that they were written independently. Taking FFN reviews seriously is a wasteful job though.

** They are super similar stories. I really enjoy them both honestly and struggle finding other fanfics that grip me as much as these

*** Both of them copy heavily from canon. Plagiarism has a significantly different meaning in fanfiction.
