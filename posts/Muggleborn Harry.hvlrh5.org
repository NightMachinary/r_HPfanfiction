I remember the suggestion autocompleting for me awhile ago, but it only came up with either random OC stories or Hermione-centered stories. I get that Harry is essentially muggleborn growing up with the Dursley's for the intent of the audience learning as he does, but having him actually be muggleborn would be interesting. Either he is the Chosen One and no one really knows it's him because of the lack of focus on his family, or there is no prophesy to be fulfilled and he can be unburdened by the weight to be a child wholly interested in magic.

I guess some stories where he isn't actually the BWL/ Neville is the WBWL would probably capture a similar premise, but I was curious if there was actually a story out there.


** That could be really interesting. A Muggle James and Lily targeted by Death Eaters and Harry still ending up with the Dursleys (only for Muggle Law reasons rather than Magical Shielding reasons) could be really fun. I don't have any recs for you, apologies, but I'm definitely going to add this idea to my list to take a stab at writing when I get time. :)
