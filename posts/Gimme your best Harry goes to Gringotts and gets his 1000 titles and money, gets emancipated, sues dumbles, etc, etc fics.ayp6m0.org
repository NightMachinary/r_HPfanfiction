******* In Best Served Cold --- linkffn(12149140) --- Harry time travels back to the past; he briefly mentions how Neville was his supplier. There's a couple other mentions, and it becomes a slightly minor plot point, though it's not a huge point of the story. Saying more would give away the story.

It's abandoned, unfortunately, and takes a strange turn towards the end. But it has its moments.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!
