“There's a what?” Harry had long since stopped caring about how he looked that night, tears were freely flowing, the look on Sirius's face when he was launched through the Veil was stuck in his mind on replay.

“A prophecy, that is what Voldemort wanted to retrieve. Its about you and him.” Dumbledore spoke calmly.

The room started whirling with magic as Harry's temper started to take hold, it was a sight Dumbledore wasn't entirely unfamiliar with. Harry had a temper, he was a bit spiteful, close minded even, then again he was just a teenager, which on a certain level pleased Dumbledore a great deal. Tom Riddle had never been a teenager.

“Harry I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, I just didn't want you to lose whatever little childhood you had left.”

Harry scoffed before his anger took flight, “WHAT CHILDHOOD? I grew up in a broom closet you fucking old man. And its your fault, everything is your fault, if you had just told me what was down there, if you had just told me!” Harry didn't finish the sentence before he picked up the chair he was standing near and threw it into the wall.

Dumbledore had had enough, “Potter, you will sit down now and calm yourself, there are many expensive things in this room, important historical treasures and I will not have you destroy them with a childish tantrum.”

Harry's eyes widened at the Headmaster's manner of address, Harry had never been just Potter to him. He found the chair he hadn't thrown and sat down.

“I am aware that Professor Trelawney leaves something to be desired in her educational approach. She does not hold the position due to her qualifications as a teacher.”

Harry narrowed his eyes before they widened in understanding, “You're protecting her.”

Dumbledore nodded, “Just like I've been protecting you, your whole life. Prophecies are horrible things Harry, they take our free will and make a mockery of it, they twist good actions into bad and bad actions into good. Did you know that Tom Riddle once applied for the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts at this very school?”

Harry shook his head realizing Dumbledore was about to come straight with him.

“Yes, quite so he was a marvelously skilled student, and even better tutor. In fact part of his rise to power was just how many people owed him a passing grade. Some wonder how I could have missed the signs of a Dark Lord rising. And thus I can only say that the prophecy was already at work. Other than the incident with the chamber I never had any notion that he would turn out as he did. He was a good student, a friend to many, if a touch of a recluse. Not unheard of in Slytherin. I turned him down for that position in DADA. In retrospect I do not even know why, he was well qualified, had a sterling record, and while we know now that his special award was a sham, at the time I had no idea. I am not omniscient by any stretch of the imagination.”

“I know for a fact though, that Tom decided ultimately to become Voldemort as a response to my denial of his job. He told me, he said it was the straw that broke the camels back. I remember that duel like it was yesterday, that was during the time of the first war that I was still wondering why it had all turned out the way it did, before the prophecy came into my hands.”

Harry stirred again, “But why didn't you tell me?”

“Because you and Voldemort share a connection Harry. And I couldn't risk trusting you with information so vital and important. Even the hints you did receive caused fallout, Voldemort has been scavenging your mind for anything useful and you are completely defenseless against him. The only reason I am even having this conversation now, is that you hurt him greatly when you broke his attempt to possess you.”

Harry gasped, “Is that why Mr. Weasley was attacked?”

Dumbledore simply nodded in response.

“NO! This whole time? I've been like... like a double agent? NO!”

Dumbledore took the moment to walk around and do something Harry had never anticipated, and he was soon wrapped in a hug. He clung desperately to the headmaster as the frustration and rage crashed out of him in great weeping sobs.

“It is not your fault Harry, but even if I had told you, Voldemort would have used even that against us. He would have then begun to attack you directly, I couldn't bear the thought of causing your even more suffering than I already have.”

“Why did you leave me with them?” the words came out in retched desperation.

“Do you know how powerful those blood protections are Harry?”

Harry shook his head into the Headmaster robes.

“They are so powerful I could not even enter them. Did you ever wonder why we sent so many letters, driving your guardians to insanity? We did it so they would leave the house and we could retrieve you.”

Harry lurched back and blinked.

“No one who wished you harm could ever enter that house. And yes that precludes me as I know your destiny and that means I can never be free from asking you to harm yourself in its accomplishment. The protections denied me because of it. In fact that was the reason Hagrid was sent, he is a kind and caring soul, he was the only staff member who was pure enough to even hope to retrieve you.”

“The moment the charm was in place, you were safe. Incredibly, unbelievably safe, you've complained about your treatment there, but I know they never hit you on purpose, I know they never succeeded in any of their dreams of causing true and lasting harm. Even all of their neglect bounced off you in a thousand ways, and while I regret that you experienced it at all, there was nowhere else.”

“It was many years before the Death Eaters stopped actively attacking people after Voldemort was defeated, Alice and Frank Longbottom were not the only victims after the war's climax came to a close. There were many, even the year before you came to Hogwarts there was were still crimes being attributed to his forces.”

“They would have found you. You know that Frank and Alice were underneath a Fidelius as well?”

Harry gasped, that was definitely news.

“They were not the only ones betrayed, and the secret can be tortured out of even the most resilient of men. The charm has a brutal weakness, men. I never wished you to suffer Harry, never. I also know you never wanted your fame, I never wanted to give you special treatment, I knew some would be unavoidable, but I truly did my best to give you a real life, in whatever way I could muster.”

Harry leaned back, tears beginning to dry, “Thank you for explaining it. It hurts a little less now.”

Dumbledore stood up and moved back to his chair slowly.

“The prophecy Harry. The moment Voldemort began to act upon it, it was set into the fabric of fate. When I received the prophecy, I immediately hired Trelawney and attempted to hide the prophecy away, it was only later that I learned that Voldemort had had an eavesdropper. His actions set it in motion, once I knew that he knew, I acted to protect his targets as best as I could. I always knew you would be his first target, you were a half blood as he was, and he is exceedingly vain.”

Harry smirked a bit at that, moving to the edge of his seat in rapt attention. It was certainly better than thinking about Sirius.

“You see prophecies if they are ignored never come to be, or at least they are fulfilled in ways that do not bind people to fates against their will. I had attempted to stop it before it even started, but Voldemort could not stand even the idea he would ever be defeated and in his pride he locked himself into the very thing he hoped to avoid. I have every confidence in your ability to win Harry, if nothing else you are incredibly resourceful under pressure, and your natural charisma carries none of the dark notes of selfishness Tom had.”

Harry blushed a bit at the praise, “Thank you Headmaster.”

Albus took a moment to nod in acknowledgement. A soft glow emanated from a device on Dumbledore's desk. “Ah, our time grows short. I must ask you again to learn Occlumency Harry. I know you are not on good terms with Professor Snape. I know that he is not good for the school, I am not clueless, but he is as much here for his protection as anyone else. Will you please try again?”

Harry nodded, “Yes. If it means we can have a conversation like this again, I will do whatever it takes.”

Dumbledore smiled warmly, “See that you do, maybe take a moment to remind your Professor of a girl he was friends with in school and come prepared by doing your reading?”

Harry blanched in response and then hung his head in shame, “I did this, if I had just done as you asked Sirius would be okay.”

“Sirius was never going to be okay Harry. He spent twelve years in Azkaban, most men or women who come out of there are never more than a gibbering mess even after just a year. You should be proud he had any faculties at all, he was an incredibly strong willed man, and he loved you, but he was never going to be able to take care of you.”

“I guess somewhere in my head I knew that. I also know that Remus couldn't either, with his condition. Would you do it the same way again?”

Dumbledore frowned, “Unfortunately yes. Voldemort represents the end of us, I would give anything to stop him.”

Harry nodded before standing and straightening his clothes, “So would I. I tried to Crucio Bellatrix after she killed Sirius, I was not successful.”

Dumbledore's eyes widened before a truly brilliant smile took shape, “Righteous anger?”

Harry nodded looking away in shame.

“You know there is a spell just for such an occasion, try the third book on the left, on the second shelf, fourth bookshelf from the right.”

Harry spun and stared at Dumbledore in shock.

“I am the defeater of Grindelwald Harry. There were many wizards and witches between me and him before his ultimate defeat. I have forgotten more things than most wizards will ever learn. I choose to wage war as I do as an example, I am an old man, I can afford my peculiarities, but you must win. Take the book, READ it. Apologize to Professor Snape, so we can discuss this war and win it.”

Harry nodded slowly taking in everything he had learned, grabbing the book, he began the slow journey to the clinic, hoping his friends were okay.


** I'd like to point out that in canon, prophecies are explicitly not binding; they have about as much ability to force people to act as an ordinary weather forecast.

That said, this is really interesting! A Dumbledore who's aware of the binding effects of the prophecy and is trying to set up Harry to win with the limited freedom he has.

I wonder if it means that Voldemort is bound by the same prophecy and never had a hope of not being a dark lord in the first place?

** I like the idea, but your dialogue and general grammar is a little wooly. If you get a beta/proof-reader on board, this has the makings of a particularly great mentor-Dumbledore super-Harry fic...which happens to be one of my favourites. So if you have the ideas to flesh it out, I'd say go all for it!

My one caveat is that canon Dumbledore figured out Tom was dark and dangerous after the Chamber incident, unless you deliberately changed that.

I'm not sure why others are so confused. I clearly understood you were diverging from canon in this scene but a lot of other posters seem to think you were rewriting the scene but keeping the aftermath canon... idk.

Anyway, is this just a one-shot or do you actually plan to turn this into a longer story? I'd definitely follow it if you do. Great job!
