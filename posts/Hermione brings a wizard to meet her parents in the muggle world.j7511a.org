Or something the like. I just really want to read about Hermione bringing her boyfriend/girlfriend/a friend who has never really been in contact with anything muggle to meet her parents. I don't care if it's pre-final battle or post. I don't care who she brings or how many (I just don't want boyfriend!Ron). I just want someone who grew up in the wizarding world freaking out about beeping microwaves and being confused about television magic. I really hope someone knows some fic like that.


** Well, linkffn(Black Luminary) has a chapter where Harry (who was raised solely in the wizarding world in this au) visits Hermione and her parents after their first year.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
