I have seen these two charms used incorrectly in a number of fics and it makes me more angry than it probably should. I just want someone else's opinion to confirm if my tilting is justifiable or not.

From what I've come across the most common misuse of these words are authors using banishing when they really mean vanishing. Now I'm not entirely sure this is canon or not but to me, a Banishing charm is pretty much the opposite of the summoning charm, while a vanisher makes the target disappear. When I read some shit like "Snape banished the ruined potion with a cruel smirk!" I can't help but imagine the potion being flung all over the classroom resulting in a mass exodus to the infirmary.

The only time when I feel 'banished' could justifiably be used in the context of making something go away, is when we're talking about banishing ethereal beings like ghosts or a boggart.

Is my anger justifiable or am I just blowing hot air?


** I feel the exact same way about 'amused' vs 'bemused.' A lot of people think they mean the same thing, but 'bemused' is actually a synonym of 'confused.'

Kind of like fics in which the author writes 'I am deceived' when they mean to say 'I am disappointed', I know that lots of French people make that mistake, as it's 'je suis déçu' in French.

No... No, its not justified.

But I get that its a bit of a pet peeve. Not for me, as I just go with the flow of what the author /meant/, as long as its obvious from the context.

But I'm also the one who will degrade any fic to shit-tier in my mind at the simple glance of the words "magical core", so there you go.

***** Wow, that's... Dedication.

And honestly, a very fitting form of revenge you've chosen there.

Personally, I think if the concept isn't used just to show that, "Oh Harry has the biggest magical core since Merlin" or something, or isn't just brought up randomly and actually has some bearing on the story, it can be done right, though it never is. I might have read a couple fics I liked, but I can't remember any right now.

****** I think at this point I often can't completely separate the """""good""""", or at least not detrimental uses of magical cores, from the bad or catastrophic ones. Its because they tend to negate a core part of the HP magic system that I always loved.

The only limitations in HP are your own talent, will and knowledge. There is no mana-pool that limits you, no natural power level you're born with and no anime-esque magic power you can train up like a muscle by constant use. Its all mental, all in the mind (and the wrist...). The only exhaustion you can suffer is mental, the only pool you can run dry on is your knowledge.

It was inspiring as a teenager. As long as you wanted, you could be great. Effort, training and learning was key to becoming mighty.

Which is why I despise magical cores so much. They negate all of this. With them you're just born powerful or weak; you never get a say in it. It's cheap, it's stupid and I hate that its such a wide spread element in fanfiction.

******* There is no mana pool, but some wizards do have higher magical power than others. Dumbledore and Crouch at the very least refer to magical power coming in amounts, in greater or lesser amounts.

But still, that doesn't mean magic is a depletable quantity that the wizard uses up from a "core". I just treat it as something that limits the power, scale and preservation of the magic one casts. At the very least, this power increases as one reaches the age of maturity, as no 4th year (per Crouch) has strong enough magic to use the Killing Curse, but Crabbe could do so at 17.

******** Along with that, I've always thought that magic has a genetic component to it. It explains quite a bit, IMO:

Pure-blood supremacy started out of the genuine recognition that muggle born wizards tended not to be as strong.

Squibs are people with not enough magic genes active. They are aware of magic, but don't have enough of an affinity to wield most wands. (Though would a wand with high conductivity let a squib use magic?)

People like Dumbledore randomly have more magic genes active, making it more instinctual to actually cast magic, as opposed to those who have to learn it the hard(er) way.

I doubt it honestly. Nothing in the series suggests that and there's good evidence it's false. The two strongest wizards of the age are half-bloods. The ability to use magic at all is genetic, but nothing has been mentioned about the power of one's magic having to do with blood "purity".

#+end_quote

No. Squibs cannot use magic period because they didn't inherit the ability. Nothing about any wand can change that, JKR made this clear (although the series did as well) when she said that Filch could never have learned magic through the Kwickspell course.

#+end_quote

This is a misunderstanding. The series repeatedly shows that whatever differences in magic power there are, the true determination of Magical power tends to come down to intelligence and knowledge. Never once is it even hinted that some "randomly have more magic genes active", especially since the only genes for magic are those which determine if one can use it or not. Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindlewald, Hermione (arguably) are supposed to be powerful because of their wide ranging knowledge on magic.

#+end_quote

Well, you're completely right. Just for context, here are the differences mentioned in the books:

Banishing:

#+begin_quote
  They were supposed to be practising the opposite of the Summoning Charm today -- the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practise, the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room -- Professor Flitwick, for instance.
#+end_quote

Vanishing:

#+begin_quote
  So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.'
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked, again, ‘Where do vanished objects go?'

  ‘Into non-being, which is to say, everything,' replied Professor McGonagall.
#+end_quote

As for, is it justified - I think it is. I get annoyed when people get these things wrong as well. To get it right, all they need to do is look it up in the books, only takes a few seconds. It's just lazy writing.

And also just spelling mistakes. Like people not knowing the difference between 'definitely' and 'defiantly', or between 'breath' and 'breathe'.

Though it's a bit different, the thing that will immediately have me stop reading a fanfic is if the author calls Harry a brunette.

*** You've set me off now.

Writers who don't know the difference between 'reign' and 'rein'.

We should bring back the death penalty for 'should of', 'would of' and 'could of', using a method that ensures the perpetrator hurts the whole time they are dying.

Loose/lose could just be a typo, I suppose, but it doesn't make the clenching any less uncomfortable.

Writers who don't get that 'pique', 'peek' and 'peak' are three entirely different words and just use one in all three places or worse, use them at random. That last makes me want to nail their ears to a coffee table.

I could, and at scant provocation will, go on.

** I don't have a book in front of me to give support for this argument, just going from memory, so correct me if I'm wrong. And even if im right this will apply to maybe 5% of the cases youre talking about if that. Also, im more in the weeds here than I think JKR ever bothered with.

To my memory, Dumbledore and maybe others have sommoned things from thin air. Like, they knew where it was and almost apparated it to them. I remember he did this with alcohol sometimes. Now, he may have been conjuting it from memory, but i think he also claimed it was Madam Rosmerta's or something. So wouldn't it be unethical to conjure something that someone sells for profit? And wouldn't there be some kind of magical copyright thing? I think this is more likely a 2nd level of the summoning charm that only masters really perfect or something. He keeps his Mead in his office (or home if anti-apparition jinxes apply) until he needs it, summons it, drinks some, banishes it. If im right and thats a next level summoner, making something disappear from right in front of you to go where you intend it to be would be a next level banisher.

So THAT type of banisher could technically make things disappear, if it works like i think it does.

It's also possible that adding this power to even a few characters like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Flitwick, etc. Would be world-breaking.
