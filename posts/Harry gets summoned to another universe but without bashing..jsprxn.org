No Dark Harry. Jaded but hates Voldemort might be nice.


** ugh. the name escapes me and I can't get to ff.net on this computer, but he gets zapped to another universe (i /think/ its the one where resisting veritaserum breaks some great Laws of Magic or somesuch [dont worry, thats the only really "huh?" thing about this one]), changes his name to Chris Collins because his parents are alive and he has siblings. While he does know the odd Dark spell For Reasons, he can't really be considered dark (he's also quite snarky, which...actually, i think was a fad at the time).\\

  Harry Potter is thrown into an alternate universe due to archaic rules of magic. Hiding under the alias of Chris Collins, he tries to find a place among the suspicion of those he knew and some he never did, as Voldemort's power grows.

** I just shared this rec on another post, but it kinda fits here, too. This epic-length series might fit the bill?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/481666][Harry Potter and the Road Not Taken]] may be something like what you're looking for. I'd start with The Boy with Kaleidoscope Eyes, but the prequel, West of the Moon, East of the Sun, sets up some of the cross-dimensional stuff and could be read first, too.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
