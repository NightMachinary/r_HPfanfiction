Being tasked with the impossible - namely killing Dumbeldore, his father imprisoned and a dark Lord having invaded his home - Draco Malfoy is less than impressed with how his life is coming along. So when he ends up in the 70s by accident, Draco - like any respectable Slytherin - isn't above using this situation to his advantage. What better way to avoid the dark Lord, but by keeping his parents away from him in the first place?

Besides, if he can deal with sharing a home with the Dark Lord and aunt Bella's "training", he can deal with sleeping surrounded by a bunch of future Death Eaters.

And if embracing the political lessons his father had always wanted to ingrain in him manage to help him pull a few of those onto his side, it can only be positive.

But apart from his mother being only a year above him, there is still that rag-tag group led by an imposter-Potter, a pubescent future potions Master and a boy, of whom nobody thinks he might be a werewolf!

***** That one is my current WIP which basically sucks up all my time

linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

Don't know if you're interested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few cliché tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them.

  "A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life.

***** No I haven't posted anything yet, I'm still trying to at least figure out how it will end before I start posting but I'm so glad peeps find it interesting! It's been fun to write, esp as a Slytherin is going to be just so much more ruthless than our Gryffindor friends, and my Theo is the quiet but deadly kind of guy, so it's been really fun
