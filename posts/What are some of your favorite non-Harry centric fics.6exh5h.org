I don't know about the rest of you but as much as I love reading about Harry...he gets a bit old sometimes. I'm looking for fics that center on any other character except Harry.

I've read a ton (and I mean a ton) already, so any that aren't so popular would probably be better. I don't like Snape that much but besides that anything is game. (I also love Ginny to an unhealthy degree so....)

Some of the more popular fics I've read:

linkffn(The Changeling; One Hundred and Sixty Nine; Stars Fall by Lady Altair; Six Pomegranate Seeds; Exile by benny bear)

I recommend all of those by the way, they're pretty great. I'm sure there's lots of others that I can't think of right now but I'll appreciate anything you recommend.

Thanks!


** This one may be unique: A Severus Snape and Luna Lovegood-centric story

** linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity) Great next-gen fic (well, ALMOST next-gen; Teddy Lupin is the main character and the fic is about his first year at Hogwarts). Essentially, the Sorting Hat is sick of the four houses fighting and gives an ultimatum: Either you people learn to get along, or I stop this Sorting business for good. The Potters and Weasleys are important supporting characters, but pretty much every single surviving character from canon shows up for at least a cameo.

** That time travel one with an eventual Hermione/Bellatrix pairing... the concept sounds wack written out but it actually really convinced me, surprisingly well-written esp for a femslash pairing.

Unfortunately I can't remember what it's called but I'm sure now I've described it someone will jump in and help me out.

Northumbrian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] follows the life of an adult Ginny as a mother through the eyes of her muggle neighbor which is a really interesting concept. Northumbrian also writes some great Lavender Brown-centric stories, can't remember names right now or chronology but they're all on the author's profile.

I've also recently been /loving/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12159362/1/Lisa-Turpin-Goes-to-Hogwarts][Lisa Turpin Goes To Hogwarts]], which imagines Lisa (a first year Ravenclaw in Harry's year) to be a halfblood muggle Wiccan raised by a depressed muggle single mom who doesn't really understand that magic magic is real outside of the Wicca religion and practises. Hilarity ensues as the other students think she must be a very traditional pureblood. The author's doing a rewrite right now, but the original story is still up while that's in progress.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
