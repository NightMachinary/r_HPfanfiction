I would like to read some fic where Harry has a maternal figure in his life! (Preferably long fics, over 80k or 100k words.)

Example:

- Andromeda

- Molly

- Narcissa

Idk....

(Only wizards, no muggles or squibs.)


** I just had the thought of an idea where /every/ magical mother (creatures like dragons, kneazels maybe even owls possibly included) instinctively acts motherly towards Harry, this includes witches who are pregnant. And Harry discovers a Slytherin (Pansy, maybe) is pregnant because she goes from threatening/insulting him to insisting that he eats more or asking if he's getting enough sleep.

** There's an MLP crossover where he gets adopted by Princess Twilight Sparkle, and gets taught things like proper royal court etiquette and magic.

That's not the interesting part though. The /interesting/ part is when they go back to Harry's world and open diplomacy with the Muggle government first, because they don't even know there is a wizarding government yet. What does this lead to? Britain becoming a world superpower again and colonizing space.

In the latest chapter they acknowledged the Equestria Girls universe and discovered the Harry Potter books/movies. Existential crises ensue.

It's pretty good. Oddly enough, the bits relating to politics and diplomacy are usually more interesting than the Hogwarts stuff.

***** That one was super meh for me. The pace slowed to glacial about the time Harry went to Hogwarts, and the whole thing got into this loop of "omg Harry and his friends are so cool and can do amazeballs stuff because of his time in Equestria also the pones are so cuuuute!" It felt like it was just another OP!Harry fic but with MLP thrown in.

****** I absolutely agree with you. But as I said, I don't really read it so much for the main Harry plot as for the inter-dimensional immigration plot. It's both the best Equestria meets Earth fic and second best Wizard magic meets modern technology fic I've read. All the side plots such as the new Changeling hive, Starlight Glimmer working to incite a revolution against Purebloods, the rapid modernization of Equestria, the advances in space travel, the British government freaking out, the wizards being stubbornly ignorant, and others are all much more interesting than the weird polygamous harem Harry has going on.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.
