forgot to add

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] this one is an old one and is dark but not edgy more gritty

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729845/1/Adversity-Breeds-Excellence][Adversity Breeds Excellence]] this one harry/fluer/tonks but it is well written and even if the pairing isn't something you enjoy i would recommend it for the magic anyway

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When a Veela Cries]] this one i enjoyed but its need a beta because the writing feels choppy in places and it's not for everybody considering the amount of OC's and character death

due to the fact that the romance is actually progressing slowly rather than one meeting then no interaction for a few chapters then boom they are suddenly in love

Thank you! It's oddly hard to believe that people seem to be liking it as much as they are, and it's been super gratifying. I'm glad to hear it's one of your favorites!

**** Eh, I first came across that one, long ago, while sifting through unbelievable long list of OP AF Harry and/or Lord so and so Harry and/or time traveling Harry /Fleur fics and it stood out to me due to Fleur being OP for a change. And seeing it -after very long time- updated thought I suggest it. Anyways hope others wont disappoint.
