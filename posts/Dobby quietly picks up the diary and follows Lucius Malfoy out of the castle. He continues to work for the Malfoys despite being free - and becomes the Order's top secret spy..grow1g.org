Ultra dedicated Dobby wants to do everything for Harry who freed him, so he continues to warn him of every new nefarious plot.

Information such as that Sirius Black not actually a Death Eater according to Malfoy. Or the planned attack on the World Cup. He wouldn't be able to warn Harry about the Triwizard kidnapping as Malfoy wasn't involved there, but after that Voldemort uses the most luxurious place available to him as meeting room for his Death Eaters, and Dobby serves the drinks. The Order always knows exactly where the Death Eaters are going to attack next, and Voldemort can't figure out who the spy is.

*** Y'all. The prophecy could totally be about Dobby.

#+begin_quote
  /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.../

  /born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies.../
#+end_quote

Consider this: what if Trelawney didn't say "born?" What if she said "/borne/?"

Dobby came (or /was borne/) to Harry on his birthday, which is of course the end of July. By that point, Harry has defied Voldemort three times: once as a baby, once in the Forbidden Forest, and once with the philosopher's stone.

#+begin_quote
  /and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,/
#+end_quote

The sock -- a symbol of freedom, of humanity -- was delivered to him in what? That's right. Riddle's diary, which is basically the body of one of Voldemort's soul pieces. So, in a way, Dobby was given a /mark/ of being /equal/ by /the Dark Lord/.

#+begin_quote
  /but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.../
#+end_quote

Obviously, it's house elf magic. Or love, I guess, if you want to be sentimental. I'd say Harry's love totally qualifies.

#+begin_quote
  /and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.../
#+end_quote

In this premise, Dobby is stuck as the Malfoys' slave until Voldemort is defeated. He's the only one keeping Voldemort's attacks from succeeding. They're at a stalemate of misery until one of them goes.

#+begin_quote
  /the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be borne as the seventh month dies..../"
#+end_quote

I started this as a joke, but I'm convinced now. Dobby is the chosen one.

*** I'd think Dobby would consider the act of Voldemort's defeat to be Harry's, as the Chosen One ^{TM}.

It'd be great if dobby just sowed dissension in the ranks left, right, and center. Stealing this and blaming them, accidentally making sure everyone encounters their allergens, borrows biohazard from local hospitals and gets every death eater infected with a plethora of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Causes them to have violent outbursts in public, sets them up to lose money and business and everything they could contribute to the war. Borrowing pranks and such from the twins, Sirius, and Remus. Just silently and discretely making an absolute nuisance of himself and redirecting the blame everywhere like shit hitting a fan.

And in the end Harry strolls up ready for the fight of his life, but a majority of the Death Eaters give up and tell the courts everything, so long as they don't have to share a cell with Lucious cause he destroyed their family business, or Nott cause he killed their kneazel or Bellatrix because she always leaves her creepy magazines all over the common areas and everyone is sick of each other. And after all the chaos Dobby has sown, Voldemort really isn't able to give it his all and is defeated quickly.

One could interpret this as not a literal hand of the body but a figurative hand such as an agent.

If Dobby gives himself over to Harry and Harry's mission, and Harry becomes the handler for Dobby in the spy work, then Dobby could be seen as Harry's ‚Äúhand‚Äù which kills Voldemort.

****** Yes but Dobby as Harrys hand is right in the middle of Voldemorts territory. Bellatrix or Pettigrew probably would not be able to integrate themselves to the order. Ginny however, is already in the middle of the Order territory.

Maybe a small piece of Diary Horcrux is stuck on her and takes over her when she goes to sleep. Weasleys assume she has a sleepwalking disorder and do nothing about it while remnant of the diary horcrux gathers inside information about the order.

But unlike Malfoys, who loathe dobby and force him to be a servant, effectively making his spying carrier easier, Weasleys love their daughter and dont allow her into the order meetings because they fear she might die in the war. Thus power he knows not.

******* Ah, for story balance.

Hmm, I look at the other way. Voldemort basically controls all of Wizarding Britain. Harry and gang are the underdogs with an inside man.

So Voldemort has them surrounded and attacks from all sides. Harry etc can't really act openly and so are forced to act from a single point, which happens to be inside Voldemort's headquarters, and is ‚Äúthe most unlikely creature imaginable‚Äù, completely disregarded by pretty much everyone :)

I think what you suggested would be too powerful of an "all-knowing-spy", but perhaps if Dobby doesn't realise he's a free elf until later, but is too scared to act on it except until later in the fic when it really means something. He could come to harry with a lifesaving piece of information, or just plain old rescue harry with the classic "Dobby is a FREE elf!" and apparate away with Harry.
