Me and my friends where talking about this type of "what if" scenario and we just wanted to know if you had any good suggestions. Harry could be good or bad it doesn't matter.

  In June of 1980, Voldemort successfully took control of the Magical Ministry. For eleven years, Magical Britain was finally at peace, only a few rebels fighting against the New Ministry. Voldemort stepped out of the limelight after the end of the war, choosing instead to focus on something important: His sonInferius. A four year old Inferius who goes by the name 'Little One' and is completely adored by everyone who meets him. But Little One holds a lot of mysteries. Who is he? How did he die? But most pressing, what is his relationship to the Dark Lord? Everything is fine, of course, until the Order decide to take Little One away from a very protective and possessive Dark Lord. And somehow, that is the least of the Dark Lord's problems. Add one clingy, annoying Death and one all-seeing, secretive Fate and you might just have a story! Follow Voldemort as he struggles through protecting his child, fighting off a very persistent Death, running an entire country, and for Merlin's saKE CAN HE PLEASE BEAT FATE AT ONE BLOODY GAME OF CHESS?????   [Very OOC and not a Tomarry/Harrymort. Recently changed summary, same story!]

** I'm publishing one, it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30208026/chapters/74434125][ongoing]]: Voldemort takes Harry as a baby, instead of dying on Halloween 1981, and we're catching up with him years later.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, since in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; Dark, Light or no side at all.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
