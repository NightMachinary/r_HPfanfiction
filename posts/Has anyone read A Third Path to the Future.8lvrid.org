It's a massive HP/Marvel crossover. I got about 11 chapters in and I'm just bored and the romance is already feeling weird. Does it get better? But most importantly what happened with Hogwarts in the new world? Figuring that out is about the only reason I've lasted this long.


** It's been a while since I dropped off, but here goes.

The biggest problem I have with that fic is the pacing. It's tortuously slow. It has the same vibe as a kathryn518 fic such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]. Funnily enough, she's a beta for Vimesenthusiast. Huh. Anyways, it does get better in my opinion, but you'll need to push through the initial phases of the fic before it takes off. The romance always felt a bit off though - like Storm was just wayyy too cool about a multi relationship, among other oddities.

As for what happens at Hogwarts... [[/spoiler][If I remember correctly, it got taken over by a bunch of like... zombie spirits? Or something similar, could've been creatures too. There was a very long siege and everybody ended up dying. There's a very dramatic scene of Harry burying the bodies of children. For some reason the house elves survived. Harry proceeds to turn them and the castle into a factory of some sort to supply potions and other wizard items to the new world. Can't really remember more details sorry :L]]

** the author to that story focuses on very long chapters. It feels more like a chore to read them than to enjoy the story.. If you feel the same i can't recommend you keep reading story's from that author, I tried almost all of them but can't seem to read to the end chapters.

About what happens to hogwarts: [[/spoiler][The whole castle is full of dementors, Harry charges in to destroy them with patronus charged golems etc.. He finds a seal that holds alot of house elves in stasis and wakes them up. Also some angst where harry is mad at the adult wizards etc.]]

** 11 chapters is about 6 more than I made it. I had a glance ahead and didn't think it got better

** I'm current with the fic, and I have to say I really like it. But then again, I like long wordy stories so Vimesenthusiast and Kathrine518 work well for when I just want to get lost in a non - action packed fic. As for Hogwarts, he turns it into a Mutant and Mutant family rescue house. After dealing with the previously mentioned Dementors.
