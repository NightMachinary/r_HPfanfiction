Are there any fics out there where Hermione's parents are actually involved in her life and study magic as well? Like while she's away at Hogwarts they're busy reading up on Runes and Arithmancy and designing stuff for themselves, I remember it being stated that they were excited about magic so you would think they would try and study some of it.

It wouldn't even be expensive given that a single Galleon, exchanged for ¬£5, seems to have the buying power of ¬£100.

I just ask because I realised, not for the first time, that there is a growing distance between Hermione and her parents through out the series, that I find upsetting and can't help but feel is an underhanded ploy to try and keep the two societies separate at the muggleborns expense.

** It's not the main focus of the fic, but Hermione's parents are quite involved with Hermione, and Hermione finds a way for them to brew simple potions by using ruins.

** I am actually looking for a fic that fits your description and maybe someone knows about it? I read it some time ago. Harry went back in time and had a fake adult illusion to be able to move around in the world. At some point he owned a small island and the grangers were heavily involved in rune development. Eventually they had a van that was turned into a submarine as they wanted to keep the island hidden so couldn't aparate to it. Don't think the fic was complete when I read it and I have no clue what happened with it...

*** That sounds a lot like "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw". It updates like once a year, I've mixed feelings on it because it focuses on the children being hyper competent in a way which breaks my suspension of disbelief, basically being adults in children's bodies.

** So! I just finished reading a beautiful fic that fits what you're looking for: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] It's honestly professional quality level of writing and world building. All the new characters are so well rounded and developed it's bonkers. This fic is also the /only/ story where the parents react the way any normal muggle would react to finding our magic exists: weekly Diagon Alley trips regardless or not their child is with them or at Hogwarts. It's set in the 1930s and 40s and all the dialogue and narration is historically correct üòçüòç
