HP AU FIC

1.  Protagonist: Tom Riddle (not related to Voldemort). Half blood.

2.  Muggle father, witch mother (Marlene McKinnon). Mother killed by DE's shortly after giving birth, near the end of the war. Killed while out with (magical) parents. Pureblood bias protected Tom. Ministry unaware of birth and due to muggle father he was “lost in the masses.”

3.  The McKinnnons were traditionalists. Not bigoted per-se, but elder McKinnons frowned heavily on Marlene's husband and kept it secret from polite society.

4.  Protagonists Family: Single father -- Jonathan (John) Riddle. Inspector with the London Metropolitan Police Force. 34 years old. Loves his son dearly. Misses his wife even more so.

5.  Dumbledore introduces Tom to the magical world and sees this child as an opportunity to (at least in his mind) atone for his past mistakes with Voldemort. Perhaps he will have a closer relationship with the Riddle family than usual?

6.  No BWL/GWL -- Snape “kills” Voldemort.

7.  No Potters (never existed)

8.  No “Marauders”

9.  Sirius “Black” alive. Pureblood. Sorted into Gryffindor to his families eternal shame. Very loyal and something of a jester/rogue at school. Joined Order of the Phoenix in his seventh year at Hogwarts (1978). Killed Peter Pettigrew after discovering his treason in 1979. Well known figure responsible for the death/imprisonment of many DE's in the first war. Joined the Aurors from 1981 -- 1987 while working on his defence mastery. Current DADA Professor and Head of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts (1991). 32 Years old. Nominal head of the House of Black (he was disowned by Orion Black due to his stance and actions in the war, but was reinstated (on paper) after Orion and Walburga had second thoughts about Voldemort.

10. Peter Pettigrew dead. Pureblood. Sorted into Slytherin. Joined the Order of the Phoenix in his seventh year at Hogwarts (1978), but turned traitor in 1979, passing information to the DE's that lead to the death of many muggleborn families. Discovered as a traitor by Remus Lupin, who was lured to his death by Pettigrew. Sirius Black was tailing Lupin, suspecting him of treachery, and eventually slew Pettigrew after Lupin was killed in front of him.

11. Remus Lupin. Dead. Afflicted with Lycanthropy at a young age. Nevertheless, he attended Hogwarts and was sorted into Hufflepuff. Had few friends due to his condition, but still volunteered to spy on the DE's for the Order in 1979 as a werewolf. Was killed by Pettigrew after Lupin discovered he was a spy in 1979.

12. Lily Evans. Muggleborn. Sorted into Ravenclaw. Has semi-serious relationship with Sirius Black. Joined Order of the Phoenix in her seventh year to provide mostly material support in the form of potions/poisons. After the death of Voldemort in 1981, she pursued a potions mastery encouraged and made possible by the effort of Horace Slughorn. Current Potions Professor at Hogwarts (since 1985). She teaches all students up to their OWLs and then Slughorn (as the more senior brewer) takes NEWT students.

13. Severus Snape. Dead. Half-blood. Estranged friend of Lily Potter due to his fascination with the Dark Arts, he joined the DE's in his seventh year (1979) to gain access to forbidden knowledge. After an attack that he was a part of nearly kills Lily, he regrets his decision to join but realises that there is no way out. Was killed personally by Voldemort after fatally poisoning him with a unique poison of his own creation. Has a mixed following among the population, being a known DE who also “sacrificed” himself to kill Voldemort.

14. Rubeus Hagrid -- Was expelled in his fifth year for supposedly causing the death of “Moaning Myrtle” but was subsequently re-enrolled after no evidence was forthcoming. Dumbledore fought very hard for Hagrid to be exonerated and the ministry likely appeased him due to his magical power (which would be needed should Grindelwald turn his eye on the isles). Is the current Gamekeeper and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures.

15. Albus Dumbledore -- Extremely powerful and talented wizard. Half-blood. 110 years old. Formed the Order of the Phoenix in the Blood War and was very active in hunting down DE's and opposing Voldemort. Was the only one Voldemort feared, to the point where he would not meet Dumbledore in battle. Retired from high profile life shortly after the war, yet still maintains various relationships with key members of society, notably his Order members and Minerva McGonagall. An educator at heart, offers his services in introducing muggleborns to the wizarding world. Writes regularly for Transfiguration Today and Potions Quarterly (re. Alchemy). Is secretly working towards the cessation of Blood prejudice by using his influence to promote deserving muggleborns and half-bloods into positions they would not attain due to bigotry. Believes that Voldemort is not really dead, and is alert for rumours of his return.

16. Bellatrix et al. -- Captured at the scene of Voldemort's death along with the Lestranges and Crouch. Never tortured the Longbottoms. Frank and Alice are alive and well with Neville. Frank is an Auror and Alice is the Professor of Transfiguration at Hogwarts.

17. Lucius Malfoy -- Pleaded the Imperius Defence at the Ministry and avoided Azakaban as per canon. Has a seat on the Wizengamot and in 1987 was successfully appointed the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation following Barty Crouch Sr's /untimely/ passing.

*** POV split between Hogwarts/Wizarding World/Muggle World. Far less confrontational Voldemort (Muggleborns have much more representation than in canon due to Dumbledore's work). Pureblood supremacist faction is still active, both at Hogwarts and outside of it, but it is more evenly opposed. Voldemort will return, but will remain incognito to avoid a Dumbledore with a lot of free time. The war will eventually start up again, but it will take longer to get to "all out war." I want there to be some mystery involved with Tom taking centre stage and utilising help from his father to solve it.

** What's the focus of the story? The adults, or the kids? Both? Who're the POV characters? And, as was asked already: What's the plot?

*** I'm leaning towards both. Hogwarts will be a more stable environment with the staffing changes and the lack of a child of prophecy/target. There will be some intrigue though. Tom will be the primary POV. I'm thinking of following Dumbledore as he moves around trying to discover/combat Voldemort from behind the front lines. I'll definitely follow John as he tries to deal with Tom going off to Hogwarts, as well as doing his job with the revelations of magic. He'll likely come more into focus as we see the muggle side of DE atrocities.

POV characters (subject to change): Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, John Riddle, McGonagall (maybe), some minor characters (maybe).

** I'm pretty sure that the "caretaker" position exists so that Filch has a job. It's not too hard to imagine the Board of Governors or whoever going "Poor Squib, he'll never amount to anything real; let's make him a caretaker. That's a job he can actually do, and this way he can feel useful."

Interesting set-up... I'd probably check such a story out.

Couple of questions, though:

1: Why name the protagonist "Tom Riddle" if he's totally unrelated to THAT Tom Riddle? Wouldn't a different name be easier? If the idea is that Dumbledore wants to do right by a new boy in a similar situation as Tom Riddle... then couldn't the situation (half-blood with Muggle father, grew up not knowing anything) be enough?

2: Why do Lupin and Lily have different houses? I can see Pettigrew in Slytherin, if he didn't meet up with James and Sirius on the train he might not get the incentive to plead with the Hat for Gryffindor, but both Lupin and Lily seem to be pretty clear Gryffindors. Did something happen in their early childhoods or something?

*** Hmmm.....

1) I think that there is something to the idea that Voldemort despised his "muggle name" and did his best to rid himself of it, thinking that it made him weak, whereas Tom Riddle the child would embrace his muggle family (and name) and be great regardless. There's a split there that I think might be interesting to explore.

2) I put Lily in Ravenclaw because whenever she is mentioned there's great emphasis on her academic achievement. She was a very gifted brewer and and excelled at charms. Granted, she was also very brave, but I think in retrospect her magical proficiency made her more suited to Ravenclaw. Regarding Lupin, I imagine that as a young werewolf he would be extremely lonely. He probably only ever talked to his parents and shied away from other kids his age. I can believe that he asked the hat for Hufflepuff so that he could be in the "friendly" house (thinking he wouldn't have as much trouble there as the others).

3) I also didn't want the Marauders to happen or to have Lily/Sirius be overly familiar with each other during their school years. Weird, I know.

Thanks for the questions!

** The Butterfly Effect of removing the Potters is interesting, and I have to wonder what role Tom Riddle has in this world. Is he merely the viewpoint character to explore this world? Or will he play a role in defeating Voldemort permanently?

*** Both, certainly. Tom will provide a look into the AU from the Hogwarts/younger generations perspective, while Dumbledore will give us more of a "society in a period of change" view. Voldemort will definitely seek Tom out/seek information on him, seeing as they share the same name; though not necessarily to kill him outright.

*** While I've not thought about this, I suspect that either there are competing products to Sleekeazy that have the same or similar effects, or that it was simply invented by someone else instead of Fleamont Potter. Also the numbering looks fine on the actual post for me. In the source everything has 1's next to it, but I'm not proficient at using the syntax so as long as it worked in the actual post, I was happy.
