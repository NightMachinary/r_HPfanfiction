  The return of Prince of the Dark Kingdom...

  It's been a long hiatus, but I'm finally making my triumphant debut back into this world. I´m also excited to announce several upcoming projects for PotDK.

  I'm currently working on re-mastering the original fanfic and adapting the story into an original work. I´m also working on a PotDK Blog where I will post updates on the fanfic, the original adaptation, and exclusive sneak-peeks into a secret project I've been working on.

  Over the years, many of you reached out to me with great hopes for PotDK and now is the time to make your hopes a reality.

  The original story adaptation for this universe is going to be epic!

  I´ve got big plans for the PotDK universe...

  If you´re a writer, beta reader, artist, web designer, or have any other skills you'd like to contribute and are a fan of this series, there's loads of work to do.

  If you'd like to know more, or you want to submit an application to become a member of the creative team, send me a PM or email me at my Gmail account: POTDKproject.

  I look forward to hearing from you and reconnecting to new and old readers alike.

  Keep the Magic Coming!

--------------

I am cautiously optimistic. I'm always wary of "remaster/rewrite" attempts after a long hiatus, it never seems to go more than a few chapters before being abandoned again. Not to mention the author will be splitting their efforts between the remaster, an adaptation, and another project. All that being said: it's back baby. Holy crap.

** Is it actually? Sounds like he's editing the original story and also filing the serial numbers off. I could be wrong, but didn't see anything about actually continuing the fic.

** I miss the Kingdome. Besides bits of it falling and hurting people, great stadium.

*** I saw Steve Largent's last game there. And a few Mariners games when they were pretty bad. I liked it better than the Metrodome.
