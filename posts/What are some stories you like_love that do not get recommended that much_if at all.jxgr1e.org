Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated. If not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Ron abusing Hermione, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche. If there are any of those you recommend, please put a warning tag on it.

No raping of any characters please.

Can be from any Era.

Am fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.


** My own /s

In all seriousness, though:

#+begin_quote
  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

A couple years later, and the Dark Side has a new secret weapon: Hadrian "Harry" Riddle, heir to the Dark Lord. Part one of the Dark Prince Series. Years 1&2. COMPLETE. SEQUEL UP.

** I'm obsessed with a story called surrogate by 17734 on ao3. It's a Bellamort story that updates about every 2 months and it's one of the best things I've read in about 15 years of reading fan fiction. I know stories without Harry or the Golden Trio don't get as much attention, but this deserves all the accolades. It's dark and incredibly written and I can't commend it enough.

*** Thanks to your comment, I opened it, and boy, boy, boy!! There are not many great fics about Bella, but this one is a pure delight. The words, the actions, the character's depiction, the ambiance, everything, it feels like a work of art. Am now finding myself to want to send chocolates to the author, it is such a wonderful fic! Thank you very much for having recommended it :)

**** So happy to have introduced another fan to the story! I was floored when I first found it-- I usually find Voldemort paired with anyone to be unreadable but this author nailed it and I've re-read it about three times while waiting for new chapters!

Sirius gets a trial after four years and takes Harry in as his son. Has slow burn Hinny, politics (not Harry as an 11 year old on the wisengamot, it's all Sirius as Lord Black), a good plot and structure and good flow and 2.1 mill words. 9/10 IMO

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
