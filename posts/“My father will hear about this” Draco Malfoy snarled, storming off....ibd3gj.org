...to the Slytherin dorms, where he immediately penned a hasty letter to his father.

Lucius Malfoy had just sat down for breakfast when a tawny owl flew in through the open window, dropping a letter on his eggs. The tall, platinum blond- haired man sighed, before unrolling yet another letter from his son.

/“...Why does stupid scarhead always have to run his hand through his hair like that and bite his lip when I'm trying to +get his attention+ out him for the stupid bloodtraitor he is! And the way he dares to come down to the great hall with his dumb tie over his shoulder, and his disgusting uniform not buttoned properly?! Like he doesn't know all of the girls in the great hall are ogling him. +I want to be the only one who looks at him like that.+ You simply MUST understand the situation I'm in...”/

If Malfoy was a lesser man, he would've rolled his eyes. Instead, he simply stood up, cracking his knuckles, and wearily went to make sure there was freed up space in the owlery for the relentless onslaught of daily Hogwarts owls arriving at Malfoy Manor. Massaging his temple, he rued the day his son met Harry Potter in Madam Malkins and hoped the scion of House Malfoy™ got over his silly crush soon.

...so basically Drarry fluff

Edit: This is funny because I'm not actually the hugest Drarry shipper because I find it takes a lot of effort to make their romance real and not have them just ooc so I can't really find good Drarry fics but it's pretty unfair that Drarry immediately gets a bad rap and that's one of the reasons I decided to post this. (/please no downvote i'm just a weeb who likes to write/)

  "Harry!"

  Harry stopped and turned around, eyes narrowing in caution. Harry saw Draco Malfoy furiously running at him, pushing through the crowds in Diagon Alley, with his parents running to catch up.

  "I'm in heat and I need to impregnate you, you're my omega!"

  "I'm sorry, Malfoy, what?" Harry asked.

  "You're my omega, Harry! I figured it out when I was thinking about you last weekend!" Draco replied, smiling.

  Harry shuddered as the meaning struck him. "I'm sorry, are you trying to tell me you're attracted to me?"

  "It's more than that, obviously," Draco said before he launched into an explanation of Alphas, Betas, and Omegas.

  Harry's mouth widened and he began to look around for a way out. Trouble always did seem to find him. He saw Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy catch up with Draco. Harry grew even more confused when he saw them whisper at each other with panicked expressions.

  "Lucius, have you been forgetting the silencing charms when we roleplay?"

  "Maybe? Why didn't he tell us about it? Does he think we really mean what we act?"

  "I think it's worse that that, he's found our roleplaying diaries if his comments on other alphas are any indication."

  "Fuck," Lucius summarized succinctly.

  "Submit Potter!"
#+end_quote

Edit: I see there's a lot of confusion over this post. I'll edit again later with an explanation - a bit pressed for time right now.

Edit with the explanation: Here's the explanation: This was originally written (by me before I get banned for plagiarism) here - [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/drabbles-to-undermine-tropes.39354/]]. I recommend giving it a read, most of the drabbles there are way more funny than anything I could hope to write. My drabble was meant to undermine the trope of A/B/O where Draco suddenly having sex with Harry for "biological reasons" or even against Harry's will because "Alphas". In this instance, however, what I originally intended was for Draco to have thought A/B/O was a thing in real life. Why? It's Draco Malfoy. And because it was implied that Lucius and Narcissa roleplayed a lot of A/B/O and kept some kinky roleplay "diaries" that Draco got into. I posted it here because I thought it was similar to an obsessed attraction detailed by OP, even if my intent was not to portray Draco in a good light. Though, I suppose obsessions and daily letters don't paint someone in a good light either. Draco's attraction (with an intent to bang Harry because he thinks A/B/O) is not shared by Harry, or so was the intent. I was surprised by the amount of people that were confused but I suppose I see the opportunity for it. It was a pretty short piece.

**** Eh, I think for /obvious/ reasons, drarry is more prone to people writing the characters WILDLY different than the books. I'm not a fan of drarry, but the main reason I don't read it isn't because of pairing, it's because very few of them write Draco as something other than a Gary Stu who's basically the subject of a song by Simple Plan.

Stuff like this though is excellent. I'd love reading a story where it's kinda like this, but Draco doesn't even realize he's crushing, and it's mainly told from the perspective of Lucious being like 'wtf is my son writing to me about a guy every other day for?'

All that said, I never downvote just for pairing here, and I think that's pretty stupid regardless of the pairing.

***** Yeah, two things are problematic with Drarry most of the time. The story either starts like 5th or 6th year and the author just kind of ignores his very antagonistic history with Harry, or he's a Gary Stu (Draco in Leather Pants). Authors just often don't do the legwork needed to justify things and make the story good. There are gems here and there, but they're drowned out overall.

EDIT: Drarry is a go. Chances are fairly high that it'll be abandoned halfway through (surprisingly possible despite it being a one shot), but the beginning and basis of a plot are there. Will tag upon completion if it happens.
