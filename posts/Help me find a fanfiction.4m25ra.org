The story is Sirius/Harry slash and is set in the Marauders' time. Harry somehow traveled back in time and shares a dorm with the Marauders. From what I can remember the story if fairly well written (or it just looked like it before..) and it's not finished. Sirius likes Harry, but then he, with the rest of the Marauders, find that Harry is James' son. I think Lily knows too, but I'm not so sure. Anyways, I think Harry said that he can't be with Sirius and Sirius just makes a fuss after seeing Harry with some Slytherin dude who Harry was talking to to find some information(?). I don't remember much more, but I'd like to read it again. Help?

Also, it's not Time Turned Back by either TaraSoleil or SStarLuna..
