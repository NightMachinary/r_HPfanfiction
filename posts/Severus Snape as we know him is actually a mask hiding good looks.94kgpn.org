** Something like that happens in many Severus/Hermione fics (the... not that good ones), I don't have any specific in mind unfortunately but I absolutely remember a few where he has glamours and spells on to make his teeth crooked and his hair greasy and his nose bigger than in reality. But it's usually a very cheap way to make him instantly attractive to Hermione, I haven't seen it done well enough to be convincing.

**** I don't think I read this one, which isn't a bad thing haha. It's definitely really badly used most of the time. I read one where a few years after the wars he eventually cared enough to fix his teeth and went to live somewhere sunnier than Scotland so it improved his looks a bit (that was maybe 7-10 years after the war), so it was at least more interesting and believable. But most of the time... ugh.

******** I really liked PTL ! Haven't read it in a while but it touched a lot of interesting subjects from what I remembered. Since you seem to know your hgss, do you have anything new to recommend ? I usually just look at ao3 but haven't had much time recently, and most of what I found is pretty bad. Actually stumbled on some of the worst writing I've seen yet on ao3 recently, can't remember what but it was awful. Do you have anything interesting to recommend ?

  Who would Severus become without his burden of self-loathing? And how will that Severus react when Ron Weasley's widow comes seeking healing of her own? DH compliant, save for Snape's survival. SS/LP followed by SS/HG M for later chapters.

  Severus knew he was greasy and unattractive - but in his 20s, with no Dark Lord to please, a certain special someone gave him reason to overhaul his appearance. But did his new style impress a larger audience than he originally intended? Set in the 84/85 school year.

** I haven't seen anything that matches that specifically, but I write a little thing where he changes his looks slightly and uses charms to make people perceive him as more ugly, scary and greasy so that he has the freedom to move around in -er- other circles, while remaining mostly unnoticed and unrecognised. For example, someone might look at him and think, â€˜oooh a hot Professor Snape' but they wouldn't immediately think it's him. He also uses charms to alter his hair and eye colour to move in yet more circles. It's not a massive part of the story, but it's still there, so let me know if you wanna read and I'll link it.
