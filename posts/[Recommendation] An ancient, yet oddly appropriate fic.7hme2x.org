This hilarious one-shot was posted way back in 2001, so it's close to being old enough to vote.

Summary: 1981. Bill Weasley has dragged his father to Headingley to watch the baffling Muggle sport of Quikket. The odds on England beating Australia are 500-1 against. But Voldemort is at the height of his powers, and just as the England captain thinks his problems couldn't possibly get any worse the Dark Mark appears over the Kirkstall Lane End. 

Despite its vintage, it has aged remarkably well. It features Arthur, a 9 year old Bill, a hedonistic Sirius "Oh, /that/ party" Black, a delightfully stereotypical Margarat Thatcher (who thinks "that crucial thing" sounded promising to use on her Trade Union nemesis), and several cricketing greats, Botham, Boycott, Brearley, Gower, and even Lillee and Marsh get a mention (described a a muggle barbarian and disillusioned walrus, respectively).

It's appropriate because the Ashes are on again, in Australia this time, and England are once again facing imposing odds to win. I track this fic down to read every time the Ashes are played, and it remains one of my favourites.

*** There are a few references to cricket terms, but there is barely a sentence of cricket played before the death eaters show up. Absolutely no knowledge is required, though you may miss a couple of one-line quips.

Edit: the only thing that is good to know is that the game in question is an actual match, and is considered one of the finest examples of test match cricket in history. England overcome incredible odds, and one player in their team (who almost didnt play) almost singlehandedly wipes out the Australian team.
