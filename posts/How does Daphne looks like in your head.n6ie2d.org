** Honestly speaking, Daphne Greengrass does not have a fixed appearance in my head. Her body is as much as a blank slate as her personality.

She can have black or blond hair, pretty or just average, extremely pale or a slightly pink complexion, blue or green eyes . . . The only things that are constant in my image of her are that her hairs are straight, and that her height is in the average range for her age (though there was at least that one fic that made her extremely tall).

It's a bit sad, but I have a more definite image of several OC or quasi OC than I have of Daphne Greengrass (including her own sister).

** Brunette, pale skin, blue eyes, high cheek bones, tall. Very pretty. She tends to be quiet and a little sarcastic, but she's not an Ice Queen; she's introverted and at least calm seeming, but definitely not emotionless. Confident mostly, but can have bouts of shyness and awkwardness.

I kind of see her as having been a very shy kid who forced themselves not to be shy, but still not a delightful little social butterfly (said with love) like her little sister. In some of my fics, it's partly due to her growing up with a speech impediment that made her feel very self-conscious when speaking. She's most relaxed and talkative around friends, but get her on a subject she really cares about -like magical creatures say-and she can really come alive.

** Pale skin, short stature (no taller that 5' even post-puberty), and a lithe physique. Oval face, high cheekbones, and generally cute but not overly attractive in appearance. Black hair worn long down her back, often held in place by a ribbon tied at the base of her neck. Dark blue eyes occasionally framed by reading glasses. And finally she has a difficulty expressing her emotions, leaving people with a feeling that she's cold and distant towards anyone and everyone.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia][Nothing]]. Though if I were an author going to give her a description, I would take /inspiration/ from a different [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Blake][Daphne]].

***** I used to think it was a figure of speech when people told me about picturing something in their mind. I was floored when I realised that they could actually do it.

** Her look in my fic that I actually just started on today finally has her average height for 15 (that's the age I'm starting 4th years at on my fic). Here's my exact description in book:

"Daphne was of average height for a girl of 15 with long legs comparatively speaking on a petite frame (she has b cups for example, this is not included in the book text but I'm noting it here because I'm my head, I see her with b cups). She has a pretty face, but not model pretty, it would be more accurate to describe her as girl next door pretty, or in american phraseology, southern bell cute. She has ice gray-blue eyes with long , pale rose gold hair and a creamy skin complexion that very few girls can make look good"

There ya go, that's how she looks to me. Didn't really get into how she dresses here as its just where I introduce her looks as a character, and at that moment harry was just admiring her from afar.

Personality wise, I'm going for a tsundere personality (I guess in a way this somewhat matches the ice queen vibe that a lot of other writes do for her)

** Uhhh I think in the movie there was a brief shot of Daphne and she had white/blond hair in it (mind you, I searched her name on Google.)

** I wrote her as having blonde pin-straight hair, green eyes, and was pretty average in height (5'4-5'5). Healthy weight, not overweight since Pansy never called her fat, and not super thin since Pansy still thought she was prettier.

(They were cousins that grew up close in my AU's fic verse.)

** Honey blonde hair (basically, halfway between strawberry blonde and golden blonde), green eyes, pale skin, and slightly taller than average (around 5'7‚Äù at mature height). I also imagine her hair as having a loose curl it, unlike Ginny's hair (straight) or Hermione's (really curly/bushy).

** Very plain and less pretty than Pansy (who according to Harry looks like a pug) since the only reason Harry acknowledges her existence in canon is because she has the same last name initial as Hermione.
