So in my headcanon Andromeda was meant to be the one to marry Lucius but left him for Ted. I was wondering if there were any stories that dealt with that issue?

Can be a oneshot or a multi chapter. Would rather have the story be completed if it's a multi chapter, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** Not exactly what you are looking for but seeing that there are no other responses after 14 hours I'd throw in my own story "No longer alone". It has the premise that during an altered Sirius/Pettigrew confrontation the dementors showed up and Pettigrew was kissed, making it impossible for Sirius to clear his name. He asks Andromeda to take Harry in. While definitely Harry-centric there's a lot of backstory on Andromeda and Ted. The latest chapter is from Andromeda's PoV and focuses on her and Narcissa. No Andromeda/Lucius though.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.
