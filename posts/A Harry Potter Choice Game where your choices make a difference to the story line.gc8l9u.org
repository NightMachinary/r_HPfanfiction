Would they be any interest in a fic style story in which you make a choice at the end of a chapter for example, and then there are different chapters made for each choice? Kinda like a' Detroit: Become Human' mechanism, but instead of a game it's just a story with branch style pathways. Has anyone came across a Harry Potter fic like this, or would be interested in one if it was made? (I also hope that I've used the right flair for this)

** CYOA stories have a lovely history from the horror/thriller/mystery genres, and they have their own trope of every ending except the "right" one being a brutal death.

Sounds perfect for a Triwizard Tournament of olde, but it might be fab anywhere in the HP universe. I'll read it!

** That would be interesting. I remember reading some goosebumps books with that style way back when. I wonder if linking to the chapters would be difficult as the story starts to fan out.

*** Yeah, I think I've seen it done where you manually go to the chapter that corresponds with the choice you made, it does seem a bit confusing. But I was doing some looking around there and there seems to be some websites like chooseyourstory.com that does it better, it doesn't seem extremely popular though.
