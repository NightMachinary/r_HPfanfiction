** Going to direct you to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/][C'est La Vie]] - the writing is top quality, the characters are very well done, and the approach to Ancient Runes feels very fresh and cool without getting bogged down in overly specific detail. "Hadrian Evans" will probably feel like nails on a chalkboard the first ~15 times you read that name, but it's really not a big deal after a few chapters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville

Harry's first year is finished as is the second, though I believe that's all she's writing for the series. Her writing is top-notch and all the characters, even Slytherins, are well-done.

** In a few months I'll be releasing a first year Hufflepuff!Harry with a few original ideas. I'll put a link on here when it's more or less finished.

Aiming for around 100k words for first book.

Have the story planned up to book 5.

Oh.

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865/1/Remus-Lupin-PI][Remus Lupin, P.I.]] by Larry Huss, where I am pretty sure Harry ends up in Hufflepuff, and it's not primarily comedy.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** Reading this so far; really great. Probably the best Snape time travel I've read.
