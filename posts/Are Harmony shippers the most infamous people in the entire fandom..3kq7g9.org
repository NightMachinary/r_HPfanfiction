While I'm sure there are plenty of Harmony shippers who don't have a machete shoved through their brain, it's pretty apparent that these people haven't set up a very good reputation for themselves. For almost a decade in fact, evar since we started seeing forum posts about how awful Ginny is after the release of HBP and now, in a time where we have tons upon tons of fanfiction profiles dedicated to people desperately trying to justify their ship with every possible small line blown into supposed evidence.

Is there any other community in the HP fanbase that's so infamous?


** I think Harry/Hermione shippers can be a little bit more vehement than other ships, and more likely to try to evangelize. I think it's because they see themselves as competing with canon ships, whereas other non-canon ships like Harry/Draco see themselves as part of a fandom niche.

In my experience, Harry/Draco shippers are a bit more relaxed because most of them sort of realize that their ship didn't sail and was never going to sail. They're just shipping it because they enjoy it. Obviously you can go down the rabbit hole and convince yourself that Harry and Draco are meant to be, but at the end of the day I think most Harry/Draco shippers sort of stay in their lane.

There are plenty of Harmony shippers who were pretty much convinced that the entire book series was will they-won't they, or complain about the "sudden" Ron/Hermione in HBP.

I also think Harry/Draco shippers are a lot less likely to invoke bashing to get their OTP together, because they don't necessarily need to demonize Ginny. Ginny can be the nicest coolest person in the world, but as long as Harry's gay, she's not a threat to the OTP in any way.

If you ship Harry/Luna, maybe there's some Ginny bashing but Hermione/Ron can continue to exist in peace and Ginny can find some nice minor character. If you ship Hermione/Draco, maybe there's some Ron bashing but Ginny/Harry can exist in peace and Ron can find some nice minor character. With Harry/Hermione, both Ginny and Ron are still threats to Harry/Hermione.

And bashing them doesn't make Harmony shippers popular, because they're interfering with two of the biggest relationships in canon and warping Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Ginny as characters.

** Eh... I am not sure how much of the reputation is earned.

I think part of it is that other major non-canon 'ships (e.g., Hermione/(Draco, Snape, and/or another Slytherin in Leather Pants)) have their own subfandoms that don't really communicate with the rest of the fandom. This creates a selection bias of sorts: you don't get to see the inanity from Dramione and such because you don't stumble on their pages unless you are actively looking for them, and if you are, you are probably sympathetic to what they have to say. (This subreddit is probably one of the few places where subfandoms intersect and interact.)

The other part is that Harmony is viewed as something that /could've been/ and is therefore viewed by its proponents as something worth advocating. Proponents of the canon pairings have canon on their side, so they do not need to be as proactive, and Dramionists and recognize that their 'ship was never in the running int he first place, so you don't see as much advocacy there either. (Fun fact: an FF.net search for Draco/Hermione fics yields about twice as many as Harry/Hermione fics; the ratio holds whether or not the search is for general characters or for the more-recently implemented "pairings".)

Which leads me to my second point: this question presupposes that there is an "entire fandom" for which it is meaningful to speak of a group being "infamous". There isn't. What's infamous among the Harmonians is famous among the Dramionists and vice versa; and that's without getting into slash.

Insisting that it was the only possible outcome got a lot of people offside. Then the explosion in fury after HBP and the slut shaming of Ginny was insane.

I read Harry/Hermione. Enjoy it. But they're not canon. Were never going to be canon. It's the inability to accept that the pairing is AU that put a lot of people off.

He also hates Harry, curiously enough. He seems to have changed from a H/Hr extremist to a Granger-verse Nazi over time, which probably had something to do with his ban from Portkey:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a confused, uncurious, and emotionally crippled child with fast reflexes and a lot of luck. He thinks the world revolves around him. He has been carefully groomed by Dumbledore to believe that the rules don't apply to him. He shows few signs of Slytherin cunning or ambition. He is reckless and needs a lot more life lessons to realize the need for planning. He is held back by his friendship with MoRon. He is very much Dumbledore's man - in the sense of being an obedient and well moulded chess piece.

** In defense of a Harmony shipper, I have never said Ginny was awful. I just was disappointed at how little her character was fleshed out. She is non existent in books 1, 3, and 4 and is involved in 5 about as much as Luna (so again, not really enough development for me) then BAM 6 happened. It is just strange to go from her being such a minor character to suddenly Harry has a beast in his chest? Come on. I just never thought she was developed away from her fan girl phase. Rather than seeing her change, we are told that she changed. There are some truly fantastic Fanfics with Ginny in them but they take the time to flesh out Ginny much more than JKR ever did. It is due to this lack of character depth that made book 6 so jarring to me.

#+end_quote

And this is the typical anti-Ginny argument vocal non-canon shippers typically employ. If you had been unbiased when you read the books, you would have noticed that the 'fan-girl' phase had been actively downplayed since book 2. In book 4, there are infact two scenes involving Ginny where she isn't completely over her crush, but she does talk to Harry the way you expect a friend to. One was about naming Pigwidgeon right after Harry arrived at the Burrow and another was before the Yule Ball where she was comforting Ron over Fleur's rejection.

Also, there is a clear build-up to Harry/Ginny relationship from the start, and Ginny's character arc is based on it. It does not, in fact, come out of nowhere. Let's see:

Ginny starts off someone who is in awe of the Boy Who Lived, having heard stories about him right from birth. Her crush is shown to be shallow, and as such Harry could never like her. He is, infact, distinctly uncomfortable with the singing Valentine she sends him in her first year.

In GoF And OOTP (mostly the latter) she becomes Harry's friend. Now that she's dating other people and come out of her shell (there are a couple of scenes in GoF that show her getting over her crush, as outlined above), Harry finds her fun to be around. She is given a couple of important moments in the book -- one was breaking Harry out of his depression after he thought he was possessed, and the other was helping him talk to Sirius after he saw Snape's memory -- the scene in the library involving Chocolate. Later she fights in the DoM, proving to be a strong person in her own right. Meanwhile, Harry dates and breaks up with Cho, who is pretty, plays Quidditch and cries all the time, and that's all Harry knows about her.

In HBP, Harry spends a lot of time with her in the Burrow and comes to really like her. Unfortunately, she's unavailable at the moment. Stuff happens, Ginny wins at Quidditch and Harry gleefully breaks up her relationship with Dean with a little help from Felix felicis, and they get together in the end.

I fail to see how anyone can say there was /no/ buildup, because that statement is blatantly false. True, it was hardly at the centre of the story, but then romance was never the point of the Harry Potter series, and as such would always have been a side-story. Harry Potter was a trio-centric story right from the start, and Ginny had no place as a major character on their level, so she appears a lot less. And I will also point out that while the relationship had quite a bit of depth, the build-up to it in HBP was still the way a teenage romance should have been built up. Both Harry and Ginny act like teenagers, there are no sappy declarations of love, or status as soul-mates or whatever.

Ultimately, Harry/Ginny wasn't jarring to you because there was no build-up to it in canon. It was jarring to you because you /refused/ to see and chose to ignore any build-up to it. You were probably hoping for H/Hr and trying to scrawl though the books trying to find 'evidence' of it and ignoring any indications to the contrary.

I have said my piece. Agree or disagree as you wish, but do so logically.

But no, seriously, more screen-time (page-time?) would have been great for Ginny's character. It's not so much that she suddenly became a different person, it's that she grew up emotionally and mentally almost totally outside of our awareness, but not Harry's, then we're expected to step into his head and see what he sees when he looks at her, and it's a jarring step.

This involves quite a bit of pretty deep reading of just a few scraps of lines/paragraphs in a seven book series, and you're implying everyone should be able to see it. Maybe it's clear build up to a person who is really invested in the books and their interpretation of canon, but the build-up is sparse, at best, and Harry's attraction to Ginny does genuinely seem to crop up out of nowhere to most casual readers.

***** One, attraction does come out of nowhere. Especially in teenage years. I'm not sure there are many other ways it does, really. Even so, Harry's attraction to Ginny was mild at the beginning of HBP and was gradually brought up more till the kiss scene with Dean. A multi-book build up of it would also have been unfeasible given the timeline of the series.

Second, are you really saying that some of those moments, especially the St Mungo's possession scare and the one where Harry was utterly miserable because he had seen his father being a bully and Ginny helped him, /weren't/ important scenes? Really?

Also, if you didn't see it the first time, shouldn't you have gone back and checked before making the statement like "Harry's attraction to Ginny does really seem to crop up out of nowhere" and claiming that Ginny had no development as a character? Given that there aren't many Ginny scenes in the earlier books, it shouldn't have been hard at all to look it up, really. It is especially weird when so many people go over the books trying to find the minutest detail that seems to say that Hermione is attracted to Harry when there are so many interactions between them, yet ignore the very few Ginny scenes because it doesn't support their ship, despite it being relatively blatant in Ginny's case.

Also, I doubt many people here are casual readers. For my part, I'm very familiar with canon. May be I just expect everyone else to be as well when it isn't the case?

And to confirm this, people not seeing something because they don't want to see something is really a thing. It is the same reason why Dumbledore is perceived to be evil and why Ron is perceived to be a fair weather friend. People genuinely believe all that, some good writers in the past have believed that, pretty much the same way people believe that Ginny was a non-presence before HBP, which I consider absurd because Ginny was given at least two important moments in OoTP, and I maintain OoTP more important to Ginny's character development than HBP.

****** Hang on a minute, I didn't say the build up wasn't there /at all/. I said it was /sparse/. Which it is. Sure, the St. Mungo's scene was important, but it was just one, relatively small part of a large book in a larger series. JKR may be right about 'anvil-sized hints' when talking about Ron/Hermione; you'd have to be a moron to not see that coming, but Harry/Ginny is much more subtle, more like a mosquito's bite than a falling anvil.

Plus, it should be noted that I'm not arguing for H/Hr. I don't think Harry and Hermione would make a good couple based on canon. They could work when they're older and have changed priorities, but definitely not during their teenage years.

And then there are experiments that make sex cells from stem cells, and others that make stem cells from skin cells. All this combined with the experiments in organ growing from stem cells make it very likely to be possible in the near future. Whether it will be allowed by (often conservative) doctors anytime soon is a bigger question.

Karyotype matters very little for sex past the initial hormone surge based on it.

No they didn't. Because it won't. There's nowhere for the uterus to go. You can't just jam something like that in. Then there's no blood supply, but that's actually fairly easy to get around. You're fucked when it comes to the nervous system. The connections don't exist and we can't recreate them. Not to mention that no mental relay system exists and the uterus wouldn't be able to communicate with the rest of the body.

** I /am/ one, so who am I to talk, but I think the reason this is the case is that they're in closer contact with the rest of the fanbase than the other candidates for infamy. Like, if you're a canon-ships person it's not like you have to spend a lot of time tip-toeing around the Snarry people, etc.---they do a pretty good job of self-segregating, just because it's easy to tell that they're into something different. But H/Hr people are always lurking just off to the side, writing stuff that sounds like something you /might/ like, if they weren't staring daggers at Ginny. (/Outside/ the fandom I'd say they're [we're] well behind the slash, otherwise unusual [mpreg, harems, incest, etc], and even Slytherin/hero pairings in terms of infamy.)

There's no doubt that the H/Hr fandom produces some terrible stuff, of course---I've never successfully gotten through something by, say, chemprof or Bobmin, let alone robst, and I don't think I ever will. But there are fewer people writing H/Hr, so you have fewer options. (Most of the long fics I've really enjoyed from the pairing come from before HBP came out.)

***** I guess it's a matter of personal experience. But my point is that if you want to write a Harry/Hermione fic, you have to bash two main characters (Ginny and Ron) and warp the characterization of two other main characters (Hermione and Harry). Whereas pairing one of the "core four" with an outsider allows half of the core four to continue existing.

I'm not saying that Drarry fics don't bash characters other than Ginny (like Ron), but if they do, then it's something they've added to create drama rather than something that's essentially required because of the nature of the pairing. Drarry /can/ destroy the trio friendship dynamic, but it doesn't actually need to.

[Hermione] + [Harry] = [bashed Ginny] + [bashed Ron] + [OOC Hermione] + [OOC Harry]

but

[Harry] + [Draco] = [bashed Ginny] + [canon paired/IC Ron] + [canon paired/IC Hermione] + [OOC Harry]

[Hermione] + [Snape] = [bashed Ron] + [canon paired/IC Ginny] + [canon paired/IC Harry] + [OOC Hermione]

  For almost a decade in fact, evar since we started seeing forum posts about how awful Ginny is after the release of HBP and now, in a time where we have tons upon tons of fanfiction profiles dedicated to people desperately trying to justify their ship with every possible small line blown into supposed evidence.
#+end_quote

You forgot about how emotionally abusive Ron is. Reading Harmonian's opinions of him one would think that his only purpose in life was to make Hermione as miserable as possible. Of course, in the typical Harmony fanfic he becomes physically abusive in addition to emotionally abusive, and he suddenly becomes as intelligent as a brain dead chimpanzee.

The less said about Love Potions and how Molly Weasley tried to set up Harry's life right from the train platform the better.

Harmonians spend more time trying to discredit canon ships in their fics than trying to build up Harry and Hermione's relationship. I find it quite ironic that for a relationship that they claim should have been canon, they are constitutionally incapable of writing a story where the characterizations of the Weasley family are not butchered to some extent or the other.

I will also put in that only those who wanted H/Hr to be canon saw 'evidence' of it in the books. Any unbiased observer could have seen that the series was going to be R/Hr as early as book 4, and the whole Yule Ball chapter had those 'anvil-sized hints' that Harmonians in general are blind to.

Fact is, Robst and that Driftwood guy (the guy who wrote 'MAJOR Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore bashing', with soul bonds and the blatant author-insert Goddess of love to boot) are by far the most popular Harmony authors on fanfiction.net. That should tell you everything you need to know about the mindset of the Harmonian community at large.

You know what's funny? I've never read a fic where it's implied that Hermione is using love potions, or a fic where Hermione's criticized for giggling along with the other two. Can't imagine why.

** Infamous? H/Hr is rather a common pairing for the fandom. Some weird people have a hate campaign going, as if their lives depended on making sure that particular pairing is never written.

Pathetic, really. And ironic when they blame H/Hr shippers for the same fanatism they display in their hatred.

So, infamous? Only among a few vocal posters who seem to think they determine what can and should be written.

And of course, the hatred got really going after JKR mentioned that Harry and Hermione might have worked out better than Ron and Hermione. That little tidbit usually never gets mentioned, of course, when canon is brought up as an argument against the ship.

I am just rather sick of the immature hatred for stories that do not conform to some people's taste.

If they didn't bash on characters so much, and be so delusional as to thinking it should have happened (I bet there is a higher proportion of shippers thinking that then in other ships), and be so militant about it, then maybe the fandom would be more tolerant of H/Hr shipping.

Alas, Harmonians will never change, by the looks of it.

*** First of all, that's not what JKR said. She said that she could have written a story where Harry and Hermione made sense, but she chose not to. She could have written Hermione to be more in tune with Harry emotionally, she could have written Harry to be less annoyed by Hermione's nagging. But she chose not to do so. She chose to write the characters in a way that made Hermione and Harry a bad match.

If you build a green house, you can look at it and say "You know, I could have built a blue house." But that doesn't make the house blue.

And the harmony sentiment has been a thing in the fandom for a very long time.

The bottom line is that Hermione deserves better than Harry. Hermione deserves to be with someone who sees her tendency for nagging to be an expression of love rather than seeing it as annoyance. Hermione deserves someone who won't ignore or lie to her to avoid talking about his feelings. Hermione deserves someone who will argue back. Hermione deserves someone who will tell her when she's crossed a line instead of bottling it up and then exploding at her. Hermione deserves someone that's going to worry about her almost as much as she worries about them.

Hermione deserves someone that loves her /because/ she's an argumentative know-it-all who nags too much and wears her heart on her sleeve, not someone who loves her /in spite of/ those things.
