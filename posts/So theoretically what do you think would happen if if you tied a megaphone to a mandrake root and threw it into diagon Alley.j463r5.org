** Why a megaphone? Forget that.

HOWLER PAPER!

Use the howler to record the scream of a mandrake root. Use that spell that turns memos into airplanes that the Ministry uses.

Can't trace the owl, since there is no owl. The howler burns itself up. Unless they catch you sending it off (or check your wand), you're practically committing the perfect crime.

Edit: I'm probably on some government watchlist now...

** Not sure a megaphone would work very well, as they tend to reproduce sounds, not just amplify them. Technically it would be the same as hearing a recording of a mandrake, and I would expcect that to significantly reduce the effects of the magic.

Throw a sonorous charm on a mandrake, though, and you'd probably kill a shitload of people.

Canon confirms them to be effective weapons as they were utilized in the final battle.

** I don't think Magic (especially deadly Magic) and technology mix very well together. If anything, I would expect a similar to what happened to Colin's camera in PoS with the megaphone either weakening the scream (those who can only hear the boosted scream are only knocked out) or the scream destroying the megaphone.

In any case, a mature mandrake being able to scream in the middle of Diagon Alley (especially a full one) should do a fair bit of damages and way too many deaths.

*** The whole "technology doesn't work in magic rich areas" doesn't hold water in canon. Diagon Alley, St. Mungos, and the Ministry of Magic alone are in huge muggle-dense areas and would create electrical deadzones that would have squadrons of Linemen and engineers combing the area trying to find the reason the power don't work. Then, when they start coming back while not remembering things or acting funny? Yeah, the statute would end right there.

If anything, it was probably a lie perpetuated by Headmaster Dippet or the board of governors to stop the muggle filth from being in the castle or something.

There's no evidence tech doesn't work in those areas, We only know it doesn't work in Hogwarts.
