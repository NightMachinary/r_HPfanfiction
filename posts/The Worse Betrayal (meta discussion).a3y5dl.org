I just re-watched "Half Blood Prince" and was struck by how much worse Snape's seeming betrayal was to Harry than in the book version. In the book Dumbledore hits Harry with....I think a body bind? Harry is forced to observe everything that happens.

In the movie Harry is just hiding. As he prepares to intervene he sees that Snape has come up behind him. They face each other with their wands drawn.....then Snape puts a finger to his lips and urges Harry to keep quiet.

And he does.

In this moment, Harry trusts Snape, or at least Harry trusts Dumbledore's trust of Snape enough to remain hidden and silent while Snape approaches the Death Eaters. He saw it all unfold, was able to act and attempt to intervene, and did not because of this trust.

I very rarely will take a movie interpretation of a scene over the book version.....but damn is this so much worse for Harry's sense of guilt.


** Yes, very occasionally the films do something better than the bpoks, and thanks one of those rare cases. It at once shows how Harry has grown, but then immediately snatches that achievement away from Harry (and the readers) by making him feel that he was wrong.

*** I overall agree that I liked how this was done; however it creates a problem in that it makes Harry very passive in the moment. He just stands aside and watches it all happen (this is even before Snape and him cross paths). It felt quite out of character for Harry.

**** Fair point, it's definitely something that comes with how they shifted Harry's character.

** I do remember that later on in the book the body bind proved important because, once it broke, it was undeniable proof to Harry that Dumbledore died. Wouldn't have translated as well visually. I agree with you that it adds some grit and depth shown that way! Sorry I can't remember more context

** Conversely, Dumbledore doing the body-bind curse on Harry shows Dumbledore's manipulative nature a bit more effectively. It's one of only a few times before DH that you see Dumbledore doing something really unpleasant to someone /for the greater good/. Dumbledore could have let Harry leave - he would have found the others and the Death Eaters, and could have been a greater help down there. But he didn't. He made Harry watch Snape kill him. Why?

Because he needed Harry to know that Draco wasn't the killer that he thought he was. He needed Harry to know, when Snape finally was to tell Harry what he needed to do, that Snape was so completely Dumbledore's man that he was even prepared to see through his learned hatred of Dark acts, and do something that he believed might damage his soul. He needed Harry to see that Snape would keep his promises, whatever the cost.

While the film's way of doing it shows quite nicely how well Snape was playing his part, it hides Dumbledore's manipulativity - as does almost the entire series. In the films, Dumbledore is very much a kindly old man who is also a powerful wizard. In the books, he's an immensely powerful and influential person, whose kindness - while geniune - is often used to prove a point and make people comfortable; a conscious decision, because people at ease are far more likely to do what you want them to.

*** I always took Dumbledore putting the Body-Bind curse on him in a different way. It always seemed to /me/ that Dumbledore put the curse on Harry because he /knew/ Harry. He /knew/ Harry would try and interfere, and he /knew/ that would put Harry in danger. He puts the curse on Harry /before/ he even knew who was coming through the door. For all he knew, it was Order members, or other Death Eaters. He was trying to keep Harry hidden, IMO, to keep him out of danger. There's zero doubt that if a bunch of Death Eaters had burst through the door (as eventually happened) Harry would have done whatever he could to help Dumbledore, regardless of his own safety, and Dumbledore, knowing how important Harry is, wanted him to stay out of harm's way. That was always my take on it. It's always interesting to read others' interpretations!

**** I've thought of that too. Maybe it could be a bit of both? We know Dumbledore plays a deep game. I mean, his plan was followed to the letter - unknowingly on most parts - for a whole year after his death.

***** Could definitely be a bit of both. There's no doubt he's insanely brilliant and thinks about a hundred moves ahead, but there's also no doubt he's got a secretive and manipulative streak, so it wouldn't surprise me that it could be some of both.

**** I agree with this. While I like [[/u/7ootles]] 's theory because Manipulative!Dumbledore is how I lean typically, I don't think Dumbledore put a body-bind on Harry because of Malfoy or because of Snape. He just didn't want Harry to go charging in and get himself killed before he could fulfill his destiny.

Yeah, because after dozens of war crimes, we have to draw the line at murder. Just the Unforgivables would be enough to lock Malfoy away for life in a normal court (following the magical laws).

** I didn't like that scene in the film because I felt that it gave away the fact that Snape was on the good side. I mean if Snape was evil, would he just shush Harry like that and let him be? I don't know, I think that Rickman's facial expressions gave away the plot twist. How can you look at those facial expressions and believe that Snape really betrayed them? In the book , the "betrayal" was more believable, as Snape was described as having a "hateful expression".

** It also gives a glimpse of reality as Snape doesn't reveal Harry's presence when with the assistance of Bellatrix, Greyback and other D.E's, apprehending Harry would have been easy and end the war in one fell swoop.

The following scenes even further proved this point as Snape intervenes on Harry's behalf, saying he's Voldemort's to kill, glossing over the possibility of apprehending him.

I still remember reading that scene and thinking Snape was obviously a good guy because Dumbledore would never beg for his life. I thought Dumbledore's death was faked. My guess proved wrong but the satisfaction of guessing about Snape was great.

** i find the spoilers on this OP funny. Anyone reading HP fanfiction should really be familiar enough with canon to have at least read and watched HBP. If you are on this sub and do not know that Snape kills Dumbledore,

you need to get yourself immediately to the nearest source of Harry Potter and catch up. Seriously. You should not be resorting to emerald eyes and creature inheritances until you've run out of canon material at least three times. Or if all you have at your disposal is the cursed child.
