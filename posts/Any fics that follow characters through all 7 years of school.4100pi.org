Looking for any set of characters, could be marauders-era, next gen or even AU. I'm just hankering for anything that's relatively long (as close to complete as can be) that follows characters through their entire Hogwarts career. Preferably not romance-centric

** Very AU, but very good: "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived". Harworts is a School for superspies in a world without Magic, but with James Bond spies and weird science. Currently between 6th and 7th year.
