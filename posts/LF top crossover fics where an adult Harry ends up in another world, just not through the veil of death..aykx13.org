Or where he dies and Death sends him to another word because(insert generic reason here). I would prefer there to be romance but not to the point where it takes precedence over the plot. Can be femharry just please don't pair them with an out and out baddie. They can be flawed and have a sorry past but I wouldn't prefer to see him in a relationship with anyone comparable to LV and his Death Eaters. Also please no slash. Thanks.


** Linkffn(11160991)

A bit bashy, but it has literally the best portrayal of Divination in a HP fanfic I have ever seen. Sadly incomplete.

*** It ends on such a bad cliffhanger as well. It was my choice in the "add 100k words to one fanfic" ask a few months ago.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is arguably the best crossover in the HP fandom for me, and Steelbadger is still updating (albeit slowly). HP/LotR

Linkffn(On a Pale Horse) is total crack, but Death Harry gets summoned to another universe.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?
