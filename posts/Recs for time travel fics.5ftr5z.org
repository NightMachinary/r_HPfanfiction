  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die) is one of my favorite that I like to go back and read again. It has 50 year old alcoholics Ron and Harry divorced from their wives and bitter with the world being sent back to fourth year through means out of their hands. It's Canon all the way to the end of the books, including the epilogue. I like that while Ron and Harry are justifiably wary of people they know not to trust, and like to fuck with said people's heads for fun, it remains very down to earth as a whole. It has the wacky antics of let's do the time warp again but the plot remains grounded.

It's not a rehash in any way, doesn't go past 5th year and there aren't any string left hanging. The horcruxes play a part in the story but are dealt with without taking over the plot. It's not an overly long read imo, capping at 74k

Ships don't play a significant part of the story at all, the author focuses on Harry mostly, and his actions and responses to various situations. All potential ship are p much resolved by the end via heavy implications, but if they are not to your liking it very easy to just ignore them, it doesn't change the story at all.

Going by what you specified , I would definitely recommend this one.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** Whenever I see a time travel that tries to rehash/relive canon events, it's instant unfavor/unfollow. So, I've been looking out for time travel fics that either do things very efficiently or face some very different situations.

These two fics are pretty new and are still in progress:

/The Red Knight/, linkffn(12141684): Ron found himself reborn in a world, where some things were significantly different.

/Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw/, linkffn(11574569): A very entertaining and well written story despite having tons of tropes.

--------------

These are some of my favorite, completed ones:

/A Little Child Shall Lead Them/, linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories back to her two year old self. Hilarity ensued, but also heart-breaking moments.

/Delenda Est/, linkffn(5511855): Harry got thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. Most good guys got a lot better off as the result. The author made the pairing quite credible without overly whitewashing Bellatrix's character.

/Ginny Returns/, linkffn(4740107): Ginny fixed things up in a very efficient way, but ran into other troubles with her love life.

/Returning to the Start/, linkffn(10687059): Harry had little difficulties dealing with Voldemort and Death Eaters, but Hermione was not happy when she found out what Harry did. She spent several years coming to terms with it.

/Reunion/, linkffn(4655545): Dark Humor.

/We are the Golden Trio!/, linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day old Rose got thrown back to September 1991 by accident. They got down right to business and finished off Voldemort by Halloween. Fun story, but not so good writing quality.

** Sorry for throwing these at you without any details, but there's just so many of them.

linkffn(after the fall by mctazman; at the end of all things by snugglekitten69; three's the charm by misschsparkles; the life we all deserve by the determined witch; whiskey time travel by Private Jenkins; the second time around by zilchnil; )

I could keep going but I'm on mobile and it's a pain in the ass. There's so many flavors of time travel too! There's the soul-only type, old me/young me, groundhog day, dimension transfer, dimension hopper, the summoned, video game plot. That might be all of them actually. Regardless probably a solid half of my follows have some use of the above plots.
