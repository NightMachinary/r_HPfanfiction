Idea: Harry has in his close circle of friends a pure-blood from a semi-conservative household by wizarding standards and calls Voldemort a filthy half-blood in his face after they learn about his heritage in CoS.

Might be clich√©, but I never saw this done at all. Might be interesting to see. I feel like no one ever uses the bad guys' tactics against themselves. I would pay /good money/ to read Ron call Milicent Bulstrode or Tracey Davis a 'filthy half-blood' after they call Hermione a 'Mudblood'.


** I think in one of nonjon's fics, Harry in disguise went to (a reformed) Malfoy and yelled at him (for fun) about how "the light lord Potter would get rid of all the filthy purebloods" but it's been a long time so I'm not really sure.

** You know he'd get a huge earful from his mom and Harry too probably.. wouldn't be a good idea when one's best friend is a halfblood

** I've seen this a few times, can't recall where - nothing I've read recently.

I think there was one where there was a double reveal of parentage and Horcruxes, and the latter was even more horrifying to the purebloods than the first
