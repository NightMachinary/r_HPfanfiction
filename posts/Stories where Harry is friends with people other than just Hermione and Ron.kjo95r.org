Harry can still be friends with them (great if he's still friends with both of them), but I'd like extra friendships as well. Don't need to be best friends, but can be just acknowledging Neville, Dean and Seamus. Asking Lavender and Parvati for fashion help, getting involved with a love quarrel, bantering with the Quidditch team, etc. Test subject for Fred and George, just whatever random thing.

No Weasley Bashing! No Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, If Harry is friends with Draco and Not Ron, and the author has Ron act like canon Draco, that's not what I want, etc. If it says Weasley Bashing in the Summary, I don't want it.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Not looking for pairings, but if there is am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.


** Linkffn(A New Better alife by Ulltima101) it's my own story and I'm trying to do the last chapter but anxiety is killing me. Harry is friends with at least a few more people than cannon and this summer hes going to get a few more friends

  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione. Smartish!Harry, Grey!Harry, OP!Harry Good!Dumbledore, Mentor!Dumbeldore Rival!Draco

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) Ron is a bit of a jerk, but he grows out of it.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus; The Arithmancer) Both really good stories by White Squirrel

linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) Hermione-centered, nad she has... quite the group. Actually, kinda the same, Ron's a jerk, but he grows out of it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** In linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), Harry's best friends at school are Draco and Pansy, but she's on good terms with all the Weasleys, Neville, and various others. She and the Twins both cooperate and compete with some pretty epic pranks.

Only her cousin, though, knows all her secrets.

(Don't assume, though, that she has no challenges to face. Her life and her friends' lives are in danger every year.)

Just updated recently after a six-month gap, but the chapters are over 30k words each when they land, and the whole series is over 1.3 million words. According to the author's notes, fourth year has one chapter to go.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
