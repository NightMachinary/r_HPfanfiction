** So I currently have an iPhone but use my old android as my reader. The google text to speech on the android is noticeably better than iPhones. The voices' inflections while reading just come off as more authentic. Just a tip if you have the option of using an android.

**** Are you using the FF.net app to do text2speech on android? I use the eReader Prestige and it lets you pick from dozens of googles voices with accents, usually 3 in each gender in each accent. Though I normally just do the default female voice. But plenty to choose from to find your favorite.

*** My car has bluetooth connectivity so I open up fanfiction on my phone, start it reading out loud (there's a little headset icon at the top of the fanfiction app), sync it to my car speakers and away it goes.

** A good screed reader and the download to PDF option does the trick with Ao3 as well. It's been quite useful.

** I was using /Natural Reader/ for a long time. The BIG thing, especially for HP fanfics was that you can /customize/ the pronunciation. It would even output mp3 files that I could load on my phone (easy on android) and then I didn't have to worry about pronunciation.

I stopped when my work commute dropped to like 5 minutes, but now that it's back up I've been thinking about using it again.

Edit to say: the [[https://www.naturalreaders.com/index.html][personal version]] is free but you only have one voice.
