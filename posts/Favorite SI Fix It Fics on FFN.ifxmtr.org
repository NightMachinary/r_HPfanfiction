I like listening to fics on the FFN app, and I need something new. Whether the main character struggles or steamrolls the opposition, I like to see the good guys win.


** Have you tried linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay)? Most of the canon plotlines get shut down quickly and easily, leaving Harry free to focus on his schoolwork, his fantasy novels, and helping out the other unusually shaped students (a sphinx, a centaur, a pair of kitsune, a three-headed dog...)

*** That's a fun fic, but it is neither an SI nor a Fix-It.

**** You don't think it's a fix fic? Fair enough, it may not be an SI.

***** A Fix It fic, as I understand it, requires the MC to have foreknowledge of the plot, and thus they change events to Fix It.

****** Eh, I don't think protagonist foreknowledge is compulsory. Iiuc it's about the author fixing everything that went wrong in canon. Foreknowledge is one way to semi-justify that, but not the only way.

******* By that definition every fanfic is a Fix It.

******** Oh, not at all. I don't think anyone could reasonably claim that A Cadmean Victory is about fixing what went wrong in canon, nor is The Pureblood Pretense, and many stories don't take place within canon at all, whether they're post-Hogwarts like Grow Young With Me, or on another continent like Alexandra Quick, or even crossed over to another world like The Shadow of Angmar. And even when a story fixes /some/ things, it may not really be a fix-fic overall if it introduces new challenges to match. It's when such challenges do not appear that the label really fits. Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay gets away with it by focusing on school life and the antics of the various non-human but fully intelligent students, which makes for an interesting and engaging storyline even without the drama of fighting a dark lord.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
