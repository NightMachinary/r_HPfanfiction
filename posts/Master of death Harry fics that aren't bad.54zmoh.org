Basically I want a fic that touches the whole "Master Of Death" thing, but isn't completely and utterly stupid. No "I have all the power ever blah blah blah power level over 9000 blah blah blah".

Over 70k+ words.


** Yesterday we had thread that asked for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54ta6f/lf_harry_x_avengers/][MOD in Avengers cross overs]]. I don't think Harry is over powered in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]] linkffn(8148717) but maybe he is? I mean even a mildly competent wizard will pretty much own any muggle universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643484/1/All-Hallows-Eve-New-York][All Hallows Eve New York]] linkffn(8643484) is a fun little humor one shot with MOD Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] linkffn(8275548) is also the same (even if it is marked slash, it hasn't yet shown any) and is really excellent with how SHIELD would react to finding out about Harry. It is a WIP, and so how exactly Harry ended up in the Marvel universe is unknown (possibly via the Mirror of Erised). If you don't mind fem!Harry (and really, this fem!Harry still has a backbone, so it's not too bad), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] linkffn(10524028) is a nice little story, with a great relationship built between Harry and Tony. Harry is the MOD, but almost nothing is made of it. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/209843][MoD!Harry is Not Amused]] is a great little series of fun one shots in which Harry as Death is very much over the shit that goes on in the marvel universe, but he does have a lot of power, so it might not be what you want.

  There was no such thing as the Master of Death. By collecting the three Deathly Hallows, Horatia Potter became the Heiress of Death. It was only a matter of time before she became Death herself because Thanatos wanted to retire. Meanwhile, Hades had tired of his charade of marriage.

***** Because magicals, in general, know jack about muggles and hw they operate. The way that magicals lose to muggles would be due to one of two options. Option 1, someone defects from the wizard side and informs them about it. Option 2, evidence mounts that the wizards don't cohnteract, such as cctv footage.

While the story itself is a bit meh and I quickly stopped enjoying it, The Story of Starship Hedwig has an interesting take on how the muggles fight the Wizarding world if it had ever come to that.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!
#+end_quote

This is a HP/Sandman crossover, although you don't need to know about the Sandman graphic novel to enjoy it.

The writing is sort of clipped, but it works to give the fic an air of mystery - or at least it did for me. Harry is not like his canon self; he's thoughtful, subtle, sometimes cold, a bit ruthless.

I'm not going to say more so as not to spoil the plot. If you find yourself lost and prone to giving it up, try to persevere. The first quarter of the story is sort of intentionally vague. Once you start getting answers though, you'll be hooked.

**** It does take a while but the sandman stuff makes it pretty interesting, even though I knew nothing about it before

** I've got a few I can recommend but I think most of them are under your word limit - still really worth a read though!! This is also my first time trying to use the bot, so adding in manual links as well just in case :)

linkffn(10610076) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] - just under 50K words. MoD time travel fic where he comes back as a sibling to Sirius. I really enjoyed it.

linkao3(1134255) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] This one is 64K words and is HP x Sherlock (the BBC TV Show) crossover with a bit of HP/Mycroft slash if I recall. Don't let that scare you off, it's a really engaging read. Kind of alternate universe where Harry poses in the muggle world as a "Medium" to help solve crimes

linkffn(2857962) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] This is the only one that fits your word count requirement and I /might/ be misremembering that this is MoD (but I don't think so). It's an HP x Firefly crossover and it does help if you've watched Serenity but I think it would be an enjoyable read even if you've never seen any of firefly.
