Gotta say was a bit suprised with the lack if crossovers with the Fablehaven universe. I mean the premise seems rather exiting. Wizards learning that muggles effectively hid a large part of the magic world from them would surely cause some tension. You could set up Harry as a "child of two worlds" of sorts by using the typical trope of Harry accidently apparating in order to escape the Dursley's and ending up in Fablehaven or one of the other magical reserves. Later you could make him act as a mediator while two groups figure out what exactly to do with the whole "discovering a rivaling secret society" pickle. Voldie meanwhile would try to rally those who think wizards should simply obliviate the arrogant muggle upstarts and take over the reserves themselves.


** Isn't the weird fanfic where Harry gets a harem of literally a hundred girls a Fablehaven xover

*** Are you referring to Linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero)? It's not actually a Fablehaven crossover. The author just took a lot of inspiration from it.
