I recall reading a triology of stories, the titles I've now forgotten, where magic and government was structured entirely different, males being required to bond to female partners for some reason. And now I'm reading a story called Old Blood which has reorganized government and major institutes as far as it alludes. Are there any other fics which change the structure of Magic and/or the major institutions of power?
