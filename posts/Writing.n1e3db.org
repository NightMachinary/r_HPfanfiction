Hey! Im writing a fic about Draco that I would love to read myself, but I'm not sure if the storyline would be interesting to others. It's a pretty dark book (⚠️TW) it starts in 5th grade were Alice noire becomes extremely close with Draco, and things seem fine. After summer he starts ignoring her completely, and then the true order loose the war. The surviving girls are put on display for humiliation (as a sign of the dark lord winning) and given to most eligible death eaters, so and so. They are put on poison that keeps them weak and submissive.

Let me know if this is something you would read, because I'm not sure if I should continue the writing.
