i.e Post-war, not epilogue compliant, not too dreary or evil Harry, focus on rebuilding/rediscovering the wizarding world and/or on Harry deciding what to do now that he is 'free', avoids character bashing.

Anything come to mind?


** I really like "Novocaine", too.

"[[https://fanfiction.net/s/13498575/1/Potter-and-Prejudice][Potter and Prejudice]]" has some of what you're looking for. Plus Harry is trying to get Daphne to like him through his rebuilding efforts. linkffn(13498575)

**** I prefer minimal to no bashing, but for me the rebuilding efforts somewhat outweighed the bashing. Harry ends up creating quite a few organizations that improve the wizarding world and make it a less prejudiced place. Unfortunately, it doesn't start happening until the middle of the story, meaning that you have to get through the heavy bashing early on.

** Shit. Now I really wish I hadn't accidentally deleted all my bookmarks; about two come to mind for this at the moment. I, however, don't remember them very well.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9705578/chapters/21899159][Malfoy Flavor]] is one I think.\\
Honestly, can't remember what the other one was called. Very sorry, truly. But Malfoy Flavor is a good one.\\
Lord, I wish she'd change the fucking name.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12525734/1/][*/The Right of Conquest/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6714376/TC-Hand][/TC.Hand/]]

#+begin_quote
  A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about his accounts. It turns out that he just inherited a lot from Voldemort! Who knew that the Right of Conquest was still a thing? Now, Harry doesn't just have property and money but ownership of lives as well. Will they accept his offer of redemption? Will they ever heal from the horrors of war? HIATUS

** Does it need to be Harry-centric?

Dark Gods in the Blood by Hayseed is quite good: [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/darkgods.html]] (sorry, this version is weirdly formatted - was having trouble finding elsewhere). Features Hermione solving a mystery, a bit dark.
