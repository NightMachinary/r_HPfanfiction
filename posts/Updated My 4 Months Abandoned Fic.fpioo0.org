Hi,

I updated my fic that I abandoned for 4 months with a tiny chapter to get back into the swing of things. I also wanted to gauge reader interest, but no one on AO3 has commented on my fic. So I turn to you....

Would any of you be so kind as to leave me your feedback, criticisms, what you like/don't like, whether the story is even worth continuing? Thanks in advance <3

** Quidditch and Hufflepuff, well count me in. Please continue your story.

Little suggestion: can you make Hannah less Hermione like?

*** Thank you <3

​

Yes, I have been feeling like she's too Hermione-esque. I'll try to think something up to change that.

** Four months isn't anywhere near "abandoned" in the world of fanfic. One of the stories I'm following recently had updates after 9 years.
