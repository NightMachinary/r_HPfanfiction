** Seconded. From what I've read and heard, the author's going for an AU that isn't wildly AU, but a fresh-feeling homage to canon. It features a Harry who aspires to great things, but is going to have to 'put in work' (to quote a certain recording artist).

The mystery element is engaging, the description of magic shows a fine balance between academic and esoteric, and tbe dialogue is crisp. Couldn't recommend it enough.

** Wow, that's really good actually. I'm shocked I missed this one, definitely going into the bookmarks.

Edit: I thought I recongnized that profile! The author is actually on this sub, she posted her top 20 fics a couple months back.

*** I did indeed :) I'm trying to play it cool and not be all like "OMG let's talk about my fic!" so I only brought it up once (maybe two weeks ago, ish?), but I was thrilled to bits that someone thought highly enough of it to rec it in its own thread.

**** I read through the story, and was rather pleased by it. I'm looking forward to updates whenever you're able to provide them. Also, I like the top 20 list and accompanying reviews on your FF.net author page. I picked up another couple that I've bookmarked for reading.

** It was promising up to the latest chapter, where it became bloody obvious that this will become another super!Harry story, with a (what seems to be, because the author may change this) lame explanation as to what will make him so super. I'm sure that like all super!Harry stories that aren't incredibly flawed, plenty of people will gush about how awesome it is.

I like that different than most super!Harry stories it at least tries to give an explanation as to how Harry is trained rather than born exceptional (though there is a "Lily was a genius and at 30 would have been as powerful as Dumbledore" thing to give a bit of the old "born super" thing). I also like how the changes are subtle for the most part up to the first Voldemort war. The choice of Cho and Cedric as the other two to the trio is original. There are a lot of positives. I just don't like the fact that becoming Dumbledore/Voldemort level powerful has supposedly always been straightforward yet no one seems to think to educate towards that at all (except in Harry's case), nor does any adult try to achieve it even when they know what the "trick" is (Snape is a Slytherin - where is his ambition?!).

Super!Harry stories are something that I usually find incredibly lame. When the conflict is going to be solved by Harry being super, it takes away the whole "against overwhelming odds" element. There are exceptions, but they are so rare that this automatically makes me suspicious that things are so going to suck.

*** I'm aware of the issue. Bear in mind, when it comes to the whole Lily/Dumbledore thing, that we really only have Remus's word for it, that he's speculating, and that he's got a vested interest in turning Harry away from the "train at dueling at the expense of everything else" path.

He's not exactly /lying/, but he is being, shall we say, a bit /generous/ with his guess.

Becoming as powerful as Voldemort or Dumbledore is /not/ straightforward. It's an approach to magic that doesn't appeal to most wizards, who mostly from canon seem to be interested in action:effect type spells and not underlying theory. Plus, you need the instinct (base, primitive level understand of magic) and practice to back up your theory if you want to get anywhere.

I'm not sure what counts, exactly, as being a Super!Harry story. If it means any version of Harry who knows more magic than Harry does in canon or takes the study of magic more seriously, then yes, this will qualify. If it means a Harry who casually curbstomps all who oppose him, then that's /not/ what I'm doing. My version of Harry will have appropriate obstacles relative to his power level.

To quote Allie Brosh, "The thing about being an unstoppable force is that you can really only enjoy the experience of being one when you have something to bash yourself against."

**** super!Harry is one where Harry is in a different league than his peers. In canon he was far more talented and practiced in DADA than his peers (he could, in his fifth year, match up against run-of-the-mill Death Eaters), but when he came to "the big leagues", for instance against Snape - there's just no way he can beat someone that's talented and has twenty years of experience on him. Also, in different things, his peers outclassed him in turn (he was really only exceptional in DADA and flying).

Also, I gave a review as to how the specifics of the story work - there is no way that two people with equal talent at an equal task, where one is specialized in the task and the other is not, that the one not specialized will do better. But (counterintuitively) if someone specializes in a different task, and the other one at none at all, the one who specialized in a different task will likely do better (as the brain makes connections between advanced skills in one subject to general purpose thought).

And as to my point about Snape, in canon he /is/ the exception to the action:effect and heavily criticizes people for that (/cough/know-it-all/cough/). So the point still stands. Then again, Snape was never the type to advertise his skills... so perhaps there are twists and turns that I am not aware of. And as for most not being interested in it, I don't see that mattering to pureblood families when it comes to the education of their children (as homeschooling is an option for them according to DH).

I dated a psychologist (with a PhD in cognitive), so the whole "general purpose" thing just rubs me the wrong way because the brain simply doesn't work that way. I suppose this is just a nitpick that can be waved away with the word "magic", but what is fandom but endless nitpicking anyways? :P

***** Perhaps I'm being a bit loose with my terms - Dumbledore is a generalist, but that doesn't mean he's not as talented or more than, say, Snape, when it comes to the specific areas you can specialize in. I left a response to your review on FF.net, and I'll expand on a bit here:

You need to check three boxes to be as good as Dumbledore. Instinct (primitive shaping of magic before Hogwarts, base-level mental grasp of magic), knowledge (arithmancy, magical theory, wand lore, linguistic components), and intense, rote practice.

Check the last one only, and you're Arthur Weasley. Good, solid wizard, knows the basic spells really well. Check the 2nd one as well and you've got Shacklebolt or Sirius, or a good Auror: knows specialized spells in a wide variety really well and can use them to their maximum effectiveness. Check all three and you've got Dumbledore - that base-level grasp of magic lets him basically improvise. It's the difference between a concert-level piano player who's sight reading, and Keith Jarrett. Take away the sight-reader's sheet music (reliance on spells as written) and they literally can't play. Whereas Keith Jarrett has internalized all that musical theory to the point where it's basically instinct and he can create and improvise on the fly.

There are lots and lots of great musicians who can sight-read up to professional standards. But there are only a handful of Keith Jarretts out there. All the practice, all the theory, but also a fundamental, instinctual grasp of music that lets them create breathtaking, brilliant improvisations on the fly.

Remus is saying, to keep the musical analogy going, "you have the talent to be great; don't waste that by only focusing on one specific area of music. You'll be better in the long run if you take a wide sample at first."

And yes, there's an element of sheer talent here. Remus is postulating that Lily had it, and thus Harry does as well. (He's guessing, and trying to pump Harry up, but it's an educated guess). Lockhart could try this method, but he'd never get anywhere. It's an approach that you need a certain fundamental, intuitive grasp of magic to really make work. You need to hone that instinct, for sure - there are no free lunches - but as we've seen in canon with Riddle as a boy, some people are born with a knack for magic that's different, or deeper, than everyone else.

****** Fair enough. Even so, on a fundamental level I can't help but feel that in a fight between two people of similar talent, the one who specializes in fighting should always beat one who doesn't - Dave Grohl is an amazing talent on every instrument relevant to rock (in the original Foo Fighters album, he played all the instruments as well as the vocals), but he isn't as good on the guitar as (the less talented) Slash.

******* Yeah, this is where the analogy with music breaks down a little. Because it seems that with magic, the Dumbledore Package of talent, knowledge, and practice actually makes your battle skills not just different in quality, but different in kind.

I mean, look at how he casually dominated Bellatrix at the end of OotP - animated that golden statue, her spells bounced off it, and it pinned her down and took her completely out of the fight - and Dumbledore did that casually, as an aside, while he was focusing on Harry and Riddle.

The way I see it, there's no specific "target object becomes animated, controllable, and immune to magic" spell. It would have to be a mix of like 7 different Charms and/or Transfigurations, and Dumbledore - because of the way he understands magic on a base level (what I'm calling "generalization" but perhaps needs another name), he's able to just wave his wand and /make it happen/.

******** Dumbledore though was not only on the extreme end of the bell curve in talent and skill, but he also had the Elder Wand and over a century of collecting knowledge. His specialty was transfiguration, which is probably why he chose that. But according to canon, there /has/ to be a spell. Perhaps it is nonverbal (and you could even go so far as to say that there may not be words for it - like Voldemort's ability to fly), so in essence it is intent based (just like Snape's use of countercurses while applying wandless legilimency and talking vs. Harry in HBP), but still, if it is how to apply magic instinctually, specialization would improve your instincts in general more than generalization improving in specific ones (that's how the brain works).

But my analogy is a cowboy duel between someone who only practices quickdraw against a navy SEAL. The SEAL would lose despite being a better fighter in every single other category - specializing has to pay off, or else it is pointless and no one would want to do it ever.

edit: Also, Descartes may be a famous philosopher ("I think therefore I am"), but his most useful idea was in math (the Cartesian coordinate system). Similarly, Plato (philosophy/physics), Turing (cryptography/computer science/biology), and many others are examples of how specializing in one area (philosophy for the first two, cryptography for the third) makes them stronger in other subjects as well. The only popular example to the contrary is Leonardo Da Vinci, and here is a strong case that there just wasn't enough knowledge available for him to /need/ to specialize in order to innovate.
