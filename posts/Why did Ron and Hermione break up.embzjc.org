Lately, many people said that their problem with Dramione is Weasley - bashing.

So, what normal way made Ron and Hermione break up? (Ron didn't cheat, isn't violent, isn't abusive, and so on...)

Are they still friends? Can Ron accept a reformed Draco?


** As they got older they just realized that the spark wasn't there and they loved each other as friends but just didn't feel romantically inclined.

*** second. its a break up over mutual respect and acknowledgement that they don't have what the other person needs.

And I feel like Ron would only accept a reformed Draco (regardless if Hermione and/or Harry accept it), if Draco does something good that Ron never thought possible (eg: save a Muggle or take a bullet/curse for Hermione/Harry/someone in Ron's family). Remember how mad he was at Hermione when he thought Crookshanks killed Scabbers (and then Hermione got Harry's Firebolt taken away to be inspected) and how long that was drawn out for? Even Hagrid tried to weigh-in and speak on Hermione's behalf but that didn't do much. Ron is sensitive and takes things more personally than Hermione/Harry so all of Draco's misdeeds would be hard for him to forgive.

** The far more pertinent would be if Hermione could accept a reformed Draco, and the answer is ‚Äòprobably not.' But, like, Ron and Hermione breaking up over incompatibility isn't surprising.

** A very valid reason would be career, where Hermione is a workaholic and Ron doesn't like it

*** Flipping it would be intresting

Ron was Changed by the war and Spends all his time at work in the auror deparment tracking down surviving death eaters Hermione hopes that once they have been rounded up Ron will return back to the man she fell for but there is always another case for ron to get addicted too.

** I think what people mean by that is that most writers need to bash Ron and probably every other male in the UK before they can realistically pair Draco and Hermione.

But yea if you want them to break up without bashing they could just find out they're not actually compatible or they could be unable to bridge each other's expectations like Ron expecting Hermione to be a stay at home mom or Hermione expecting Ron to want to do something else than work at WWW.

*** You still run into the fact that people will still consider that bashing.

Some people unrealistically believe that anything that doesn't conform with canon equals bashing.

Bad Dumbledore? Bashing. Ron not with Hermione? Bashing. Harry not with Ginny? Bashing. Neville didn't pick up the pink cup in Divination? Bashing.

Okay, that last one was sarcasm.

**** Not really? Most instances I've seen where people call out bashing are pretty extreme (love potions, heavy abuse, forcing miscarriages, Harry focusing on destroying the Weasleys more than Voldemort) and OOC.

** I'm not a Dramione shipper, but in the stories I've read that involve a Ron/Hermione breakup usually comes in the form of Hermione having a ‚ÄúCome to Jesus‚Äù moment when she realizes her educational, professional, and life goals don't align with his. She is either career-oriented or wants to continue post-Hogwarts education and Ron wants a large Weasley family like his parents and wants to pursue Quidditch or the like. He rarely supports Hermione's next partner (in my ship), and grows bitter and jealous before finally moving on and resuming friendship in some cases.

** I've written/read 3 really great Hermione/Ron breakups. The first one was because Ron became friends with Seamus & people outside the trio. He realised that he loved Harry & Hermione but they were codependent and fed into each others insecurities. They all stay friends and Hermione asks Neville out.

The second one is something I read, not wrote. Hermione & Ron tried really hard, but she began micromanaging his life & Quidditch career (partly due to trauma) and Ron didn't want to date his mother. She ends up with a reformed Cormac, who called her out on her flaws.

Third is perhaps the easiest. Make Ron come out of the closet. I'm genuinely surprised more fics don't do this. One of my fics has Hermione divorce Ron shortly after Harry & Ginny get divorced because she loves him and doesn't want him to keep living a lie when Harry is finally available. Harry/Ron would be a great sidepairing to Hermione/Draco. Or Seamus/Ron get together after a series of hookups. Dean was dating the wrong Weasley the entire time etc. Ron grew up in a very "traditional" family with many children. I can see him having troubles with accepting himself.
