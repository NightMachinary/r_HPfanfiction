  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I remember reading one story where Harry got together with some muggle girl. Abigail something, maybe? It was 183k or so words long when I read it.

EDIT - It's Grow Young With Me. Guess it's not as popular as it was a few months ago?

I got downvoted when I originally posted this. I was in a shitty mood for unrelated reasons, so I assumed the attitude towards that story had changed.

****** This sub is (in general) fairly liberal with the downvote button. It's become an issue more so over the last few months.

It's frustrating, but meta can change. It's inevitable.
