Molly was able to kill Bellatrix in single combat. This speaks really highly of her abilities as Bellatrix was shown taking down Kingsley and Tonks with no effort in Battle of DOM. At Malfoy manor she took out the snatcher team in a well lit room with only stunners and they could not do anything about it.

Are there any fics where she is awesome like that? If not there definitely should be.

** The only one that comes to mind is a cooking competition one, that I can't seem to find. I liked it because Ron was like admiring of his mother's cooking ability.

But I agree that there should be more stories about how awesome she is...

Plenty of people like to bash her, unfortunately.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

*** But she could have been a hardcore dueling champion like Flitwick in her earlier years and just decided to stop after becoming a mom! :) That is always my headcanon anyways, and when the Battle of Hogwarts happened all of that stuff just came flooding back to her and so that's how she beat Bellatrix even if she was rusty. We do not know anything about Molly's life! :)

**** That would still mean she hasn't been a duelist for 25 years or whatever age Bill is. It makes little sense that Molly beat Bellatrix. If JKR had played Molly up as being badass with a wand and we just didn't get to see it that would be fine, but I think the only mention of Molly being particularly good at magic was that she was invited to the Slug Club. That might be fanon though I can't remember.

***** I mean, wasn't Bellatrix in Azkaban for a long time too? It could be plausible that she let her guard down when she saw it was just a stay-at-home-mom fighting her, and got overtaken by a surprising amount of skill.
