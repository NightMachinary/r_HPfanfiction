Interesting tidbits:

- Identical number of H/G and H/Hr shippers (119 vs 119)

- There is 1 Harry/Lily supporter

- Hermione and Harry are by far the most liked characters (105 vs 103)

- Voldemort is actually well liked (15 likes vs 4 hates)

- Ron is not liked (9 likes vs 19 hates)

- 9.3% believe purebloods are superior to muggleborns


** At least eight other people think that Ron is way cooler than Harry and Hermione.

Good enough for me.

The rest of you heathens? Y'all will see the light. Eventually. The Ron shalt Rule!

** I wasn't entirely sure how to interpret the question about the most hated character.

I hate them in the sense of 'they're a great villain', or hate as in 'I wish they weren't part of Harry Potter'? The former is definitely Umbridge, but the latter is definitely NOT Umbridge. :D

Someone needs to go back to Dark Lord school.

I think a fair number of answers were satirical in nature, along with some of the questions.

*** I just want to talk about the "Do you believe Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore about the return of You-Know-Who?" question, which was probably meant to be satirical in nature, but to which I answered "no" seriously:

From the perspective of most people, Dumbledore and Harry are asking the entire wizarding world to prepare for war on the word of one 14 year old boy and an old wizard who believes him. Dumbledore sounds senile and like he shouldn't be in positions of authority. Harry is claiming that someone who has been dead (and official word has always been dead, not gone) for 13 years is back alive; he sounds like an attention seeker, and not even a good one at that. His encounters with Voldemort his first two years were always very hush, hush, which doesn't help his case in the slightest, and as far as Fudge is concerned, he has a history of claiming dead men are coming back to life because he did the same thing with Wormtail the year before.

Fudge has a little bit more evidence (Snape's dark mark, Barty Crouch Jr) than the general population, but even still that's maybe enough to launch a quiet investigation, not proclaim war. Fudge is an IDIOT for not looking into it further, a little bit of research on Harry's resurrection story might turn up a real, powerful dark ritual that Harry had no way of knowing well enough to recount. But maybe he did launch an investigation, and couldn't find any evidence of that ritual (not out of the question). He's Kiss happy (again with the being an idiot, but not out of maliciousness) so Barty Crouch isn't available to question, nor would Sirius be able to submit to veritaserum to explain about Wormtail. Edit: And the thought that Crouch just went mad being under the imperius curse for over 10 years has merit.

I have no defense for Umbridge. Odious, sadistic, bigoted woman.

Harry spends most of book 5 complaining that only half the school believes him. His story is so fantastically unlikely I'm surprised there were that many. And this is why the fifth book is my absolute all time least favourite of the series, because Harry is so wrapped up in himself that he can't see that the rest of the world has a very very legitimate point of view. He spends the entire book complaining about people who are behaving quite rationally (apart from Umbridge). But he's so consumed with his own righteousness that he can't even look to see if there might be a real reason.

Harry's inability to see anything from anyone else's perspective is actually what I'd consider his most annoying character flaw the entire series. He gets a first impression of someone, and unless something truly monumental happens, that first impression is the way he sees them for the rest of the series. Snape and Sirius are the biggest offenders here. Edit2: This is actually Gryffindors' biggest character flaw in general

I really really want to read a fanfiction where everything that everyone else does is exactly the same, but Harry has the ability (or does not have the character flaw of not having the ability) to look at things from someone else's perspective. What would change if Harry went to Snape at the end of first year and said "thanks for saving my life during my first Quidditch match and refereeing the second one". What if he talked to Sirius at some point during the fifth and helped him find an outlet for his stir-crazy that didn't endanger himself and the entire Order. What if he looked at the half of the school that didn't believe him during the fifth book and could say "look, I can see where you're coming from, this story sounds absolutely insane, but if you think I'm lying and you're willing to accept this defense curriculum it's only going to hurt you, whether Voldemort's actually back or not". It probably wouldn't change much, but my goodness, Harry would be much less annoying.

Sorry for the wall of text/rant. Anyone got a fic like that?

**** I'm with you for the very most of your reasoning. But from my - probably quite fanatic - point of view there is one addition that you overlooked:

Harry not only persists in his first impression but is often motivated to make an unsophisticated 180Â° turn if he sees any reason for it:

- From loathing Sirius (for an at that time understandable reason), he goes right to loving him as his family. Without asking any questions.

- After being tormented for 6 years and seeing the continuous torment of his friends - mainly Hermione and Neville

- through Snape, he goes to naming his child after him.

- The defense of Quirrel is another but much weaker example.

The good counter-examples seem to be Hermione in first and Cedric in forth book. There he has good reasons for his opinions (negative and positive) and finds the - most likely right - valuation of them as friends after some time.

***** Yes, but each 180 degree turn is caused only by some monumental reveal, not any true introspection or thought. And even then, going from thinking someone is as bad as Voldemort to worshipping the ground the walk on (how he feels about Sirius after the truth is revealed) doesn't show any more maturity or capability for true thought than blindly following the first impression. His first impression's been proved wrong, so he makes another snap judgement in the other direction.

*** The ICW is useless, it's basically the League of Nations. Name one thing that sham of a governing body has done for Britain.

That time they sent troops to help hunt down a terrorist group after the former head of the ICW was assassinated.... oh wait.

That time the government began rounding up muggleborns and sending them to concentration camps? I'm sure they sent a harshly worded letter.

** Any way you could share some of the "other" responses? I'd be interested to read the responses for the favorite character/pairing questions, especially because one of the questions is pointless without it (favorite non-Harry pairing's options are "I only read Harry" and "other", so if you can't see the other you don't get an answer to the question really.)

*** For the favourite non-Harry pairing question, I've got the data and am doing stuff with it now.

First of all, I broke the data down by whether an intelligible preference was entered, or no preference was specified: [[http://i.imgur.com/sREeyrP.png]]

For eveyone who entered a pairing preference, the frequencies are here: [[http://pastebin.com/52MwGrBN]]

Now I need to find a chart program that supports that many segments without doing this: [[http://i.imgur.com/LhjivYd.png]]

I'm also going to look at doing some correlations between fields, any ideas would be appreciated!
