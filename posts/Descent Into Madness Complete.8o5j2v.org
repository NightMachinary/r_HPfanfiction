Just letting everyone know that my HP/Call of Cthulhu fanfiction, "Descent Into Madness," is complete! The epilogue was posted this morning on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. 18 chapters, including the prologue and epilogue, and clocking in at 120,000 words.

/Former Death Eaters are being found brutally murdered. A new friend leads to a quest with far-reaching ramifications for the magical world and beyond. A tale of intrigue, betrayal, and friendship set against the backdrop of the Triwizard Tournament. H/Hr, with a different take on Lunar Harmony. Rated M for language and graphic violence./

The story can be found here:

Hope to see you there!

** I forget, is Lunar Harmony just H/HR/LL, or was it where Luna is their friend or whatever?

Either way, I'll check it out~

*** Traditonal Lunar Harmony is H/Hr/LL. I didn't go quite that route in this story. Luna is closer to them than a friend or even a sister, but not quite a lover. Hope you enjoy!

**** Oh thank goodness. Nearly all multi pairings or harems are a mess in the relationship department. I can think of one story in all fandoms that managed it "believably", but even then it was kind of cheating by using that series's magic to lower the inhibitions of the members.

Anyway, I'll definitely check this out, H/Hr is my favorite pairing. :)
