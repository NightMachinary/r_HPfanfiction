So, I was just wondering when the last time you guys read an actual book. (Other than the HP books of course.) Other than my required readings, I've read about 4 in the last few months, which is low since before FF I used to read a book almost everyday.

Edit: So since you're all naming the books I guess I'll join in. From what I can remember about this year I reread ASOIAF and LOTR just after Christmas but it was more skimming so I don't really count those. I read A dirty job by Christophe Moore, a book called the Night Circus(really good), The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethus(Actually wasn't for school) another book called the Labyrinth and I read two non-fiction books on and off for a few months.

** Um, well, my fanfiction.net account is almost three years old, and I started reading fanfiction a few months before that. So... It's been about three years since I've read an actual book.

Help.

** I finished a book just a few days ago, actually! The Woman Who Went to Bed For a Year, by Sue Townsend (I'm on a Townsend binge atm). I thought it was important to step away from Harry Potter fanfiction. I was not expecting [[http://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/150397517981/trying-to-broaden-my-reading-horizons-and-move-on][Harry Potter fanfiction to be specifically mentioned in it]].

** I used to be the type of girl that finished two books a week at the minimum and then life happened. I read a ton of fanfiction now and make myself read actual books. I also challenged myself to keep a log of the books and fanfictions that I'm reading throughout 2016. I'd say I average around one real book a month so far and about five fanfictions.

** About two weeks ago, counting only physical books.

About a week ago, if you count eBook versions of books.

Two days ago if you count proofreading something I wrote as reading a book (page-count--wise it is a book, but I don't really count it because ... well, it would be weird if I were to count it).

** I'm currently trying to finish Worm. On the Scarab arc right now. But if by actual book, you mean something I could theoretically get from my local library's Overdrive, then I guess it would be Redshirts by John Scalzi, close to two weeks ago. Either that or Ted Chiang's Stories of Your Life and Others. Reading fanfic has slowed down my pace of reading published original fiction, but it hasn't actually stopped it.

I've read 52 books so far this year, but 35 of those are rereads, which are always quicker to get through. I read 109 last year, but I read hardly any FF last year.

** I recently read a novel by Steve berry. The Charlemagne pursuit. The thing is, I used to read a lot of novels. With fanfiction it's just free, easy, low quality entertainment. Easy because you are already somewhat aware of the world and characters but if you start a novel everything's new and you have no idea what you are getting into so that can be a little dull in the beginning but then again that depends on the novel and writer.

So I know where you're coming from, my list of books I want to read keeps pulling up.

** Apparently other than the Cursed Child, the last book I read was on July 1st. It was a YA sci fi called Mothership, about a bunch of pregnant teens on a space station. [[https://imgur.com/a/bPb5U][It was pretty hilarious]], to be fair.

I should really read more original fiction, but even if you borrow from the library and don't spend any money, the time risk/reward ratio is far better on fanfiction. I feel bad about quitting any book, but especially if I only read a few chapters (it might get better! I shouldn't judge it yet!), whereas with fanfiction, I can tell usually within a few paragraphs if it's a definite nope or at least a maybe.
