** I've never beta'd before, but I would be happy to look through the chapter. Does one just look for mistakes and perhaps issues with flow or wording?

** I have some professional editing experience, and can take a crack at it if you don't mind working with someone who hasn't read the rest of the story. Can you work with Microsoft Word's track change feature? (Current computer is too old to run Google Docs, so you'll need to send a Word file.) Feel free to send me a private message, and I'll give you my email.
