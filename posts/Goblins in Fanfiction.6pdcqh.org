In Harry Potter fanfics, goblins seem much more approachable and human than in canon. In canon, we don't know much about them but they are ruthless businessmen and warriors that have a disdain for wizards. In fanfiction, all Harry has to do is say hi, announce his rank (usually a variation of Lord Potter or Lord Black) and then say [insert good thing for the goblin and bad thing for their enemies] before they become best buddies and lead him to their leader which immediately likes Harry because of [insert trait here]. I would like a fanfic where Harry is disliked by goblins just like any other wizard (not because of the Gringotts break-in). In fanfiction Harry would be given the sword and the cup for free because he is obviously friends with the Goblin Nation.


** in the perfectly normal series gobiln make sure that when people are polite to them that they are treated extra friendly but have to pay much higher fees. for example hermione get the title goblin friend and a "special" fee for being so friendly towards goblin and of course she should tell nobody about it.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Their portrayal in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is quite different.

** I would like for some writer, whether Rowling or a fanfic writer, to not make the goblins one-dimensional. Species essentialism is my least favorite trope in sci-fi/fantasy

*** I would argue Rowling didn't make the goblins one dimensional. Of course, we only see it from Harry's perspective, which is limited, but I think it's there. In book seven, we get a glimpse into a complex world of goblins: their own history and customs with regard to ownership, but also their inner disagreements. Bill mentions that only a faction of goblins believe in ownership of items not passing down with inheritence. The goblins in the woods traveling with Dean and overheard by the group demonstrate different goblin perspectives on Voldemort, from being interested in what rights he could give them that other wizards haven't, to being sceptical of their role as a lesser race, to feeling that neither side respect goblins or their interests. The OP here describes goblins as being "ruthless businessmen and warriors "-- but neither of these are really supported in canon. Firstly: they own the bank, yes, but it's not clear that they are "ruthless." Hagrid warns Harry not to double cross them in book 1, which turns out to be good advice, but isn't that true of everyone? And much that we hear about goblins is from wizards, who are prejudice against them. Secondly, are they ruthless warriors? Hermione makes it clear that they are not more or less ruthless than wizards. I see Griphook as a complex character. He wants to believe Harry is capable of respecting a promise to a goblin, but when he is ultimately proved wrong, as he always suspected and feared that he would be, he has no problem returning the favor.

** My favourite portrayal of goblins is in linked(sympathetic properties) where they can be nice to humans who have earned their trust, but can also be vicious and are willing to go to war to protect their interests.
