He starts out thinking it's just time travel. But then, Harry‘s super confused when Dumbledore „asked him calmly“. Snape is less of a dick somehow and why does Hermione constantly say stuff, Ron said the first time around?

**** me too! As Radcliffe is a totally cool dude and seeing him in the HP world would be great. Harry as a Hollywood celebrity as opposed to Wizarding would be interesting too.
