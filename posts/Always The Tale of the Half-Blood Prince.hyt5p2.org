A few years ago, I got food poisoning and spent a weekend throwing up and laying on the couch watching one of those Harry Potter marathons on TV.

After that I kept having the same dream over and over again. What exactly did Snape say to the Dark Lord in the graveyard the night He came back?

From that burning desire to know what happened that night after Harry escaped through the port key, my fic was born.

Canon compliant, equals parts hopeful and violent, I hope some of you will take the time to read a few chapters and give me any constructive criticism you can.

Thanks fellow Potter heads!
