You would think that this was a cliche trope, but from what I've seen or rather not seen, not really. I read a couple years & years ago, but beyond that haven't found much that I haven't written myself.

​

My title is quite direct, really saying it all for once (I usually like Dramatic eye-catching titles). I'm looking for fics where Harry is owed a Life-debt by another character. The Method can differ, Saving a life, magical contract or accident, ritual etc... As a result they become enslaved to Harry & unable to disobey.

​

This is always a great tool in fic for teaching Harry that Wording matters & to mind what he says.

​

It doesn't have to be sexual, but it can be, & as always /I prefer Slash &/ The More Rare the pair the Better.

​

Thanks in advance


** There were two fics that immediately came to mind, but one 'ships with Hermione and the other is a harem. Do you want them?

*** As I said to Flashheart, Go ahead and leave them. If I don't like them I don't have to read them.

In truth I'm not a Hermione fan but I have read 1 or 2 that were a decent story despite the pair

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Five years of intense study and trying to survive has come to its inevitable conclusion and everything's gone to hell in a handcart. A smut fic that got a little too much plot for its own good. AU. - Discontinued -

** lol I was reading a fic not too long ago that mostly fits what you're talking about but there's no Slash in it and it's not really a debt from him saving someone like life debts usually are but more of him just taking control of his house(s). There's also quite a bit of underage. If you want me to link it anyways lemme know and I'll find it again.

I said I prefered Slash, not that it had to be, & I have no issue with underage fic. Besides, if you link it & I don't like it, nothin' sayin' I have to read it

***** Coming from someone who's been in one fandom or another for 20+ years, it's neither really weird nor rare. This sub seems to have an overwhelmingly negative response to homosexuality in general. Especially given the Potter Fandom as a whole is generally accepting of it and realizes it isn't even something that needs to be accepted, sexuality just is what it is.

****** I said as much in some fewer words then that. I've been in fanfic about as long as you (15-20+ years ☺) and in my experience people only ask if they wanna make an issue - some don't follow the golden rule of fanfic. But I was in the wrong here. I shouldn't have applied context to a comment where there was no context

***** Well, couple of points:

1)That's fair. I shouldn't have read context into a comment when it's not there. That's on me, but you might be shocked about how many people are dicks about it.

"We don't do Slash here" or "Thats insane, Harry would never..." or some variation of the like. They usually only ask when they wanna make an issue. The number of people that ignore the golden rule of fanfic is astounding. So... yeah apologies for assuming.

2) I did say I prefer Slash, yes, but not ONLY Slash. Any and all recs are welcome :)

** If you ask this over at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] you're likely to get more answers. I know over the years I've read quite a few of these in the H/D pairing, but also in other rare pairs. There are tons and tons of slave fix and forced bonding slave fics out there, but I can only vaguely remember the ones that involved a life debt.
