Ive always been a sucker for Harry/Fleur or Harry/Daphne stories, and have been curious about having the younger sisters involved as well. However all the ones I have come across seem to be just pure smut.

I had posted about this in another thread and a few folks either replied or PM'd asking me for recommendations, but I was looking for them myself.

Are there any well done ones anyone can recommend?

Obviously preferably with decent plot and it can be rated M or MA or Explicit, but I am not looking for pure smut. I am more interested in the story itself.


** We really need some kind of 'fics by pairing' list in the sidebar but I disgress. Try linkffn(The Greengrass Contract).

It's on the Wiki, but it should definitely be promoted a little more and expanded a bit.

** What the */fuck/* is it with Daphne Greengrass (and by extension Astoria)? Why are fic authors so massively obsessed with pairing who is essentially a non-character in canon up with Harry Potter? If you want an OC, actually have the guts to /create/ your own OC, instead of this lazy shit. It's grown to be such a big /thing/ - and I am sick and tired of people trying to create a perfect edgy fuckable Sue out of one-shot canon background characters.

And I could get into a whole other rant about how there are too many goddamn Harry/Multi fics and not enough Hermione/Multi or Ron/Multi or anyone-else/Multi fics, but I am not going to do that here.

  implied
#+end_quote

...exactly. We know /nothing/ for sure about her. We know her name and that's it.

#+begin_quote
  Her family is also implied as having significant connections between the two worlds and she is raised with vast knowledge of such things
#+end_quote

Again, do we actually /know/ this?

And yes, I know about the epilogue. I read the damn thing when it came out.

#+begin_quote
  enough of a backstory in reputed lore

  reputed lore
#+end_quote

This is just fanon. We don't know her character at all. We /really, really/ don't. You're deluding yourself.

#+begin_quote
  there are a lot more options for WHY a multi could happen in his case already laid out within canon.
#+end_quote

o_0

Where the fuck in canon does it imply this? I have literally never seen anything like that.

You've not given me any /factual/ reasons why Daphne Greengrass is such a fetishised character among so many authors. All you've given me is circular reasoning - what you've said about her is a /result/ of these fics, not the /cause/.
