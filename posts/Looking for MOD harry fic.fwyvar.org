Im having trouble finding a mod harry fic on ao3, he doesnt know hes master of death for a while but everytime harry dies hes reborn into the same life again to start again. In the fanfic he write in notebooks a lot and has a correspondence going with a sane Voldemort. (I think its tomarry/harrymort)


** This is Again and Again by Athy. Linkao3(439865)

I love this story so much. As soon as I read your description I knew exactly what it was.

I do so love this premise. There are a few I have read like it and I love all of them.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

** What rating? What length? When was it written? What language was is it written in? Is it complete, ongoing, or on hiatus? Any keywords you can remember? Any other characters that were in the fic? Is it a crossover or not? If it is, what fandom(s) is it being crossed with?
