Hybrid vigour is the result of new blood reversing the effects of inbreeding.

If an organism is not inbred, blood that is more distantly related won't magically improve the organism anymore than blood that is similarly related.

Mutts are healthier than purebreds because they are not inbred. Purebreds are only unhealthy because they are inbred, not because their blood comes from genetically similar stock.

If an organism is not inbred, genetic similarity is not detrimental to its health.

If an organism is not inbred, dissimilar genetic material is not beneficial to its health.

There is no scientific evidence that supports the existence of "hybrid vigour" as anything other than the reversal of the effects of sustained inbreeding.

Thanks.

EDIT: Never mind, I lied. Hybrid vigour does exist as a legitimate concept, however its benefits in humans are minute when compared to the detriments provided by severe inbreeding or the benefits provided by environmental factors.

I've once saw a weird thing written about Americans of Finnish descent here on reddit comparing their hair to that of the Targaryrens and mentioning inbreeding, even though that's just how Finns look and even though that idea is particularly insane since the Nordics has what is probably lowest historical rate of consanginuous marriages in the world. Lower even than continental Europe and Britain.

** In the Harry Potter books at least when it comes to magic this seems to be. The case with the main example being Voldemort and to a lesser extent Snape. Both Powerful wizards comeing from the Union of a pureblood and a muggle.

To me it's more like the vinegar and bicarb experiment with non-magic blood being the bicarb of soda and magical blood being the vinegar. The experiment works best when you have th right amout of each. In my mind it's the same with muggle and magic blood you want the best mix of the two to get a strong magic child with the canon example being dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Snape and Harry himself.(a counter argument for this would be seamus Finnagin who also had magical and muggle parent but doesn't seem particularly powerful like the other four examples I listed).

Hybrid vigor occurs in plants and Ligers. The plants get multiple traits boosted, since they're more resilient, and Ligers are massive, since the genes regulating growth are missing.

Genetics are complicated. Muggles don't weaken wizards (look at Voldemort), but we see the most accomplished wizards being half-bloods. The lack of inbreeding, coupled with good genetics could be an answer.

**** There have been no controlled studies of hybrid vigor in humans because of the obvious ethical problems. As with so much else, we extrapolate from studies of other species. Hybrid vigor is definitely a real phenomenon in many other species, so why wouldn't humans have it too?

You can't just throw around phrases like “the most intelligent people on earth.” There are many problems with that phrase. There's the problem of what intelligence even means: IQ score? That only measures one type of intelligence, the ability to sit still and take a written standardized test, alone. It doesn't measure other important forms of intelligence like the ability to think on one's feet or collaborate with others.

Then there's the problem that culture and environment have huge influences on people's behavior, including the traits that add up to intelligence. If one ethnic group really is more intelligent (by some measure) there's no reason to think this difference is due to genes rather than culture and environment.

Longevity is a trait that's easier to measure than intelligence, but again, we know that lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc) has a huge effect on lifespan, so you can't assume anything about the Japanese having genes for longevity..

In short, it's so difficult to study humans, scientists extrapolate from experiments on model organisms all the time. They can control both genes and environment relatively easily. These experiments show that hybrid vigor is real in many different species. Why wouldn't it be real in humans?

And sorry to disappoint you, but you won't find scientific studies of “mixed race people” because biologically speaking, races don't exist. Race is a social construct. The racial categories constructed by cultures don't correspond to discrete biological groups. If you were to travel north from sub-Saharan Africa, through North Africa, to the Mediterranean, through Europe, to Northern Europe, you'd notice that people tend to get paler, on average, as you go north, but if you tried to draw a line between “black” and “white” people, your placement of that line would be completely arbitrary. Different cultures draw that line in very different places.

That was exactly my point. The most intelligent and the longest lived peoples on Earth can thank their lifestyles for that fact, not their racial group.

Also, anyone who cares about traits like longevity, intelligence etc should focus on the environmental factors known to influence these traits, not waste time looking for genetic explanations of variability.

That doesn't mean that genes don't play a part, just that their role is impossible to figure out without doing experiments that are impossible for ethical and practical reasons. I'm going to assume that humans, like other species, have hybrid vigor for many traits, since there's no reason to assume that we're different from other species in this regard.

Yes there's an argument against miscegenation hiding here - not that it's wrong, but that it makes healthier human beings. It does not. It makes regular human beings with more genetically distant stock, which, when the individual is not inbred, does absolutely nothing whatsoever.
