** Only Fem!Harry story I can think of where she is a thief/pickpocket is Looking Beyond; however, it's more of an informed ability mentioned twice, used once out of 160 chapters for some mundane reason. Also, it hits all of the stations of canon, from what I remember.

Just in case you do want to read it: linkffn(9883718) I only really read it when I'm bored and don't want to dig up my books.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding only made sense that she would fall for a prankster, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. Somehow, she was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.(Greek Myths Abound)
