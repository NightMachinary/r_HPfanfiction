So I just recently finished fear 3 (yeah I know it's kinda old :D) and really liked Alma as a character after reading about her online. (there wasn't much of her in the third game). I was wondering if there are any fics that cast Harry as Alma, or something similar. The point is that Alma or femHarry should be the main protagonist.


** I've never played this series. Would you recommend it? (And how tolerable is the graphics and game mechanics?)

*** Well, I think the first game is pretty old now, don't know exactly. And as I mentioned before (or not) I never played the first two. As far as I know the first two is more a horror game with shooter elements while the third one was an okay shooter with some story. I can count on one hand how many times Alma appeared in the third game :/ Anyway, it's an enjoyable game, but wouldn't play it again.

** Well, if you cannot find one, turn it into a prompt an author could get interested in. Something like this:

'Voldemort is resurrected in May 1984. The Ministry falls in February 1985. In June of that year, Dumbledore enacts his final plan. One, he is sure, will see his next great adventure turn into a special Hell. On July 1st, 1989, Alma Potter is sealed away.'

'James and Harry die that night while Lily slips into a coma, dragging Voldemort's horcrux along for the ride. Thirteen years have passed. St Mungo's lies abandoned, sealed off from the outside world after all its occupants withered away and died in the winter of '82.The talk of Black magic being behind it was everywhere. Stories of curses, attacks and inferi stalking the halls in those last days. Of how Molly and Ginevra Weasley came in and were never seen again. Of how Alice and Frank Longbottom died screaming at the top of their lungs as medical staff were dragged into the walls by... things. Now Pettigrew, at the behest of the Dark Lord, has been tasked with infiltrating the building and looking for clues as to what happened there. Wormtail was not sure about this assignment, but it was either this or infiltrating Azkaban. And surely, this could not be as bad as Azkaban, right? Right?'

Of course, the easiest way to get what you want is to write it yourself, but that's a completely different kettle of fish.

*** I really like your teasers or whatever they are, especially the second one. Of course I could try to write it myself, but it's a completely different experience from reading a story. I'm not saying that it isn't enjoyable, but , at least I, have to consider all the story elements in advance. So it's more about describing the idea instead of experiencing it. I dont know if it is understandable what I wrote :D Anyway, I might try writing one if there really isn't a single one. The bad thing is, that as far as I know, FEAR-s fanfic base isn't that big. The last time I checked there were little over 200 fics in total, and most of them are below 10k :/

**** That's because nobody's actually made anything too interesting out of the setting really. It's basically 'psychic psycho tsundere and her offspring go crazy' with guns added. You want to attract people to the setting? You need atmosphere. You need to play with it yet keep it recognizable. You need to make it into something other than 'oh look, canon rehash with bits added to it. Yawn.'

That's hard. But, fear not! Because if you do it right, well, you will transcend the barriers of fandom and get people interested in the canon of the crossover you're crossing with. It's how I make some of my game/TV show choices nowadays-I read fanfiction crosses with them and stuff I like, then go after the settings behind the crosses that interest me. Yeah, it makes for odd outcomes (I just don't get MLP, for instance. I just don't), but I'm rarely disappointed and goddamnit I'm rambling.

***** Yeah, actually I found a few of my shows through crossovers too now that I think about it. Well, I might try my hand at it, even if only for a oneshot. The hard part is that as far as I'm concerned, FEAR is pretty reality oriented if you disregard that psycho aspect of it which is mostly just hallucinations anyway. And then there is the HPverse which is ,most of the time, really far removed from reality. It is hard to balance horror and magic, so it will be either your typical, "lets take this single character and drop it into the other universe" kind of story, or something totally unreadable :D Oh and I don't mind rambling, there isn't enough people around me who I can talk fanfics about with :)

****** So you disregard the prompts and make it an urban fantasy spinoff. One of the most underexplored aspects of HP fanon is the fact that there isn't just the magical world in it. England's there, in the background, generally not acknowledged at all. And mid-nineties urban England marks the tail-end of an era where designs such as brutalism dominated. HP takes place in that weird transitional period between where everything was either old or buried in concrete and the period where warm, welcoming and Jamie Oliver-type lifestyles rushed to fill the yawning chasm left by the eighties.

In other words, it's the perfect place to actually have a horror fic set around. The damp asphalt streets marred by potholes, the tenements where off-colour stains marking where violence and brutality took place amidst the crumbling dreams of the '70s working class, the almost casual way in which deprecation and soullesness seemed integrated into the design...

Play it off as straight horror 'oh-shit-it's-ALMA' for the unlucky muggle/squib babysitter for the plucky pureblood Auror and a gradually encroaching madness that tears at the soul of the young lad who was sent to investigate reported sightings of a witch engaged in muggle-baiting and ended up being stranded in a battle between muggle members of the police and what seems to be an incredibly powerful, not to mention quite insane, wraith without his wand.

Between the battles, the struggles and the need for secrecy, the sheer inhumanity and misery of the tenements, towers and other mass/social housing systems Alma uses as cover, the crime, the broken dreams and reality of muggle life in a bad situation even before the 'hauntings' happen (and the madness that follows-looting being the least of it), the Auror becomes convinced that it's all part of Alma's illusions.

Basically, even if the Auror survives, he or she will be quite unhinged, given that even Knockturn Alley has nothing on the sheer gravitas hundreds of people crammed together in a bad situation can impose upon sensitive souls. Couple that with the fear and panic of the unknown attacking them, and it becomes quite a spectacle.
