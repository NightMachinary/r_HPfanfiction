I saw Behind Blue Eyes recommended on a post requesting muggle/magical pairings and it was possibly the most excellent I've read. Now having finished it, I'm in one of those post-story depressions where you feel really empty because it's finished.

Does anyone know of stories similar to it? With similar themes and characters in situations like Kitty's perhaps?

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** While Grow Young With Me is an excellent story and I thank you for recommending it, it doesn't quite fit the bill; the only similarity between them seems to be that Abby and Kitty are both muggles.

#+end_quote

It's true there are plenty of differences but there are a few more similarities to consider: both muggle OFC are a 'down on their luck' sort with no supportive family, both have aspire to be artists (music for Abby, drawing for Kitty), Harry is "running away" in both stories (figuratively in GYWM, he is avoiding the pain of his past), Harry must weigh the consequences of revealing magic in both and lastly I imagine GYWM will end with the OFC finding success in her musical endeavors.

** It's a shame the sequel was removed. Although it was incomplete. Unless anyone knows if there is another copy laying around. Called 'Rootless Tree".

** I can't say having not read Blue Eyes (White Dragon), but there's like two I can think of with the whole muggle/magical pairing thing and one has been posted. This is the other one:

*** The muggle/magical pairing isn't the thing I'm looking for, thank you for the recommendation though.

I'm actually looking for fics with characters with similar situations to the one Kitty is in; whether they're magical or not is unimportant.

You should definitely read Behind Blue Eyes though, it's excellent.
