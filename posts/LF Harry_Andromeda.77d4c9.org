Any fics where Harry and Andromeda bond over caring for Teddy after the war?


** This is the fic I'm waiting for. I think it's probably one of the most plausible cross-generation ships.

Harry is going to take godfathering seriously since his was the only adult that really prioritized his well being. Andromeda will probably cling to Teddy as the last that's left of their family. They'll share caring for Teddy, disillusionment with the government/ war, a need to replace the family that they've lost to violence. It's on my list of fics that I want to write, but I'm currently a very slow writer.

** linkffn(3717364) is a non-romantic fic about the two warming up to each other. I liked it even though it was canon compliant. Both have a hard time getting used to each other, but they bond over Teddy and other things.

  Harry considers the future of the House of Potter. Andromeda considers the past of the House of Black. Teddy is where they collide. It isn't always pretty. Immediately after Deathly Hallows and continuing through that summer. Complete!
