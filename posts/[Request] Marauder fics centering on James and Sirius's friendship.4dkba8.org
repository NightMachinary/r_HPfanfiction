** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4972204/chapters/11419639][Loved In Spite Of Ourselves]] by LadyFaceElena is an absolutely amazing fic that follows the friendship of James and Sirius from their first year at hogwarts on up.

Summary: "It began with four boys, and one compartment." Spanning across time, through the first war, and into the second. The years were both kind and cruel for ones called Marauders, and for ones who came after. But they knew friendship, and sorrow, and love, and joy. And sometimes it was only things things which allowed them to survive--if that's all they could do. Survive.

There is slash in the story, but it is not between James and Sirius and the slash that is there is not graphic. The main focus is the friendship between James and Sirius. This was one of the best mauraders fics I've ever read before, you've got to give it a go!
