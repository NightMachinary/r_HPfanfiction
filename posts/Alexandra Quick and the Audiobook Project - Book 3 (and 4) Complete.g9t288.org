Hey guys, if you've seen any of these threads before, be assured that I save them for special occasions! My ongoing audiobook podcast for the excellent Alexandra Quick series of fanfictions by Inverarity has finished the release of the third book, Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment!

The podcast can be found with this RSS feed link:

or just by searching on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, or anywhere else for Alexandra Quick and the Audiobook Project.

The audiobook of the fourth book, Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above, is completely finished as well and will begin releasing this week! I have also begun re-recording the first book, Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle, to fix the dodgy narration style I had back then, and am overwriting those episodes in the podcast feed as I finish them. Five are done so far. It's thanks to feedback I've gotten here that I realized where I went wrong with the first book, so thanks a bunch for that and keep the comments coming!

Thanks everyone for listening!
