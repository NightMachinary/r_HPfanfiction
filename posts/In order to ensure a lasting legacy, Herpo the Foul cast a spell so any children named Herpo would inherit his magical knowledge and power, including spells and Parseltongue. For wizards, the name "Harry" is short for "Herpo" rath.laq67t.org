*** Perhaps the Herpo's Heir Phenomenon can only happen once a generation, or when the older Heir dies? The affected child will obviously keep what they inherited a secret, too.

Perhaps "Harry" is only close enough because noone actually names their child "Herpo" because of the stigma (the same way noone names their child "Emeric" or "Voldemort" or "Gellert"), so the magic jumped to the closest linguistic cousin and started afflicting that. Harry could conceivably be short for Herpo, which was enough for the spell to take effect.

** /"The first mentions of the "Curse of Legacy" as it was later named, go as far back as the Battle of Actium, though there are unconfirmed rumours of it's effects starting with its creators demise. At the time, most have dismissed children going mad as the will of gods (more on the Council of Mount Olympus on page 10345) or exposure to cursed artifacts or even improperly stored potions ingredients./

/Herpesus Agrippa, the lesser known nephew of the muggle historical figure and a bearer of the curse, described it's effects as an insidious whisper, trying to seep into his mind and soul like poison, foreign concepts and eldritch knowledge promising untold power, while steadily eroding at his sense of self. To this day it remains a mystery if such was the prpose of the curse, or if it is merely a remnant of the vile one and the river of memories that smothered his youthful flames. No more of Herpesus' accounts survived, which might be connected to the fact that he'd taken his own life at age 12, overcome by madness and pain, covered in dark flame and bleeding from all orfices./

/Other accounts from that time state that the curse started affecting the boy the moment he was capable of recognizing his name and giving a coherent response, and grew in potency as the mental development of its host progressed./

/A curious bit of trivia is that there was another boy named Herpo at the time, a son of stable hand half a year older than the Agrippa, but slow as a result of a head injury while young. No other boys of that generation were affected, but the very next one the brightest of the blessed of Hecate was also cursed by the black flames of Herpo the Foul's legacy..."/

Unfortunately, holding your first meeting with your followers in a windswept graveyard has some negative consequences, and what they heard was "Voldemort."

Tom shrugged and moved on with his life. It took several years before he figured out the anagram thing. He crapped his pants in surprise, and made sure to update his diary Horcrux's memories to make it seem like it was intentional. Everything was going good until he heard a prophecy that might lead to his downfall involving one of two children. One of them was named Neville, and Tom crapped his pants again when he saw the other one's name.

** Interesting idea. Counter-proposition?\\
Fearing the use of binding magical contracts against him, a dark wizard known as Archibald the Fiend cast a terrible curse, such that anyone whom tried to sign his name without his permission would be drained of their magical might and turned into a squib.\\
This curse is so terrible, even writing down fragments of his name, like Ar*** Fi*** will drain a witch or wizard's power over time.\\

Arabella Figg and Argus Filch didn't know this, of course, nor did their parents. It was only in their teens, a short way into Hogwarts, where the two always signed their homework, that they found their magical powers weakening and dwindling away to nothing...

*** Why not both? I like the aesthetic this sort of thing adds to the setting. Just explain it by saying that any piece of magic designed to activate when certain conditions are met is recharged by taking some magical energy as payment whenever a magical person activates it, and so doesn't wear down over time.

This would also explain why all the incantations for spells sound like something a human might pick for the effects they have. All the spells people learn to cast at Hogwarts are the same kind of thing as the structure that empowers Herpo's heirs and squib-ifies people who try to sign for Archibald. The reason the summoning spell works is that someone put a variant of the Taboo Curse on the word "accio" that summons things instead of telling Voldemort where you are.

That might also be an explanation for where blood purism came from.

- Originally, there was a real hazard that muggleborn people would trip over some ancient cursed word or phrase or action and hurt someone, whereas magical parents taught their children what to avoid saying and doing
- So people were understandably cautious of having muggleborn people around
- But when you give some people an excuse to be bigots, they latch on with great enthusiasm and never let go
- And so even though most of the really bad curses on words and actions have been deactivated using modern cursebreaking techniques, the bigots still hate muggleborns.

Also, maybe magical society likes its traditions so much not because tradition is cool, but because they're not sure what some ancient dark wizard cursed, so it's better to keep doing what's been tested and found to be safe.

**** Huh, cool idea. So 'real' magic would be complex and difficult to perform, but the spells taught at Hogwarts with the wand-waving and magic words actually work to access different spell engines created a long while ago?\\
The specific construction of wands was added to most spell engines a while back to prevent accidents with uncontacted muggleborns, but there are still a few older engines and devices in different countries which can let people cast without a wand?\\
 \\
That has adventure potential; to try and cripple Voldemort's forces, Harry, Ron and Hermione, perhaps assisted by Bill Weasley, set out to try and track down and destroy the source of power for the Imperius, and other dark curses.
