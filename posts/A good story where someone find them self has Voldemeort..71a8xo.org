A story where a character find themselves in Tom Riddle body, whatever is before or after he becomes Voldemeort. Would prefer if the said character is good natured and actually tries to help people while having to deal with Riddle 'fame'.


** linkffn(becoming by sensibly tainted) is a Harry wakes up in voldemort's body fic after the possession the DoM attack. Harry is light and good in this fic and attempts to do the right thing, while attempting to maintain the guise of voldemort while voldemort had free reign of Harry's body.

linkffn(eternal return by silver pard) is Harry is reincarnated as Tom Riddle after he is killed in the forbidden forest.

  How much of what you are depends on your environment? If everything changed, who would you become? Harry Potter is about to find out. If it would save everything he loved, could he become a Dark Lord?

** I'm trying to conceive of a reason for a good guy to be a mass murdering psycopath and I think I've got it.

Your job is to kill everyone. To this end we guarantee a good afterlife for anyone you kill or your minions kill on your behalf. Forgiveness and rehabilitation for people who would have gone to hell, straight to heaven for everyone else. Anyone you don't kill is likely to be worse off for it. You have to keep this a secret or you lose the power.
