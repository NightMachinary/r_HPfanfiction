Right, so I'm making a fanfiction where after Harry gets hit by Voldemort's killing curse, he goes back to the beginning when he gets the letter, only he hit his head and forgot everything. Then he starts to remember around the time of his first potions class, and he only remembers all of it after his fourth year, because I can't change too much, you know?

So right now I'm at the scene with the Mirror of Erised. He already had that closure scene with his parents and the resurrection stone. Although he can't remember it, he can feel it deep inside of him. I'm wondering now, what would be his newest 'Greatest Desire'. I mean, I could just put everyone he met in the future and older characters in the mirror and call it a day, but I wanted other people's opinions before I actually decide on it.


** In general, I think Harry's greatest desire is always family. But if he'd gone back in time, it would probably be to save the people who died along the way - Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, Fred, Lupin, Tonks. I could see him imaging himself grown up and married to Ginny with all those people still alive.

*** Yeah, I think he really thought of all them as family, so the same desire, but different representation. I'd also like to think he learned his lesson with the mirror the first time...

***** But he wouldn't exactly know who they were, would he? Because he's in his first year and hasn't exactly met them, but he gets the feeling he does know them.

******** you could also have harry unknowingly being drawn to his friends

so he meets ron and instantly feels deeply connected with him or he meets hermione, considers her annoying but for some reason he feels that same connection he felt with ron

Harry could also unknowningly be helping his friend with the issues they have.

** Family. A loving family of his own. Maybe in this case the mirror shows him with a wife and kids in a living room with a picture of his parents on the wall but the wife's face is obscured by shadow. Depending on your pairing possibly showing just her hair color or something. Ie if ginny he can still tell his wife has red hair or something like that.

** a family and connection.

something i wondered is if that great ambition that was sensed in him was to rise up and have a family that loved him despite all obstacles.

Dumbledore always called love Harry's greatest power which sounds like nonsense until you realize the dangers harry continually fought in order to save people. to ensure his friends and one day family were safe.

the ruthless ambition that would see him torturing bellatrix and alecto for vengeance. the near inexhaustible well of determination. he would have done well in slytherin, simply his end goal would not have been so trite as many of his classmates.

** I think that after everything his greatest desire is to be 'Just Harry', without his fame or enemies putting his loved ones in danger. Kind of a 180 from book one where Harry was excited to be different from the Dursley's and wanted to join the magical world, after book seven I think he'd want the opposite because he'd hate all the attention and the consequences that came with it.

*** I think that would be a good idea, too. I might somehow include that, no idea how, though.

** I woould imagine Harry's greatest desire would be to stand at the start of Diagon Alley and see the wonder of the kids first coming to the magical world, the happiness and excitement of everyone as the look at the latest magical bits and bobs. Of course there would be all his friends and family that he lost in the war buzzing around with everybody else. Most importantly nobody would be looking at him, he would be just another person in the crowd.

This scene I picture as Harry's greatest desire because A) it was his first experience in the magical world and away from the Dursley's. B) it shows everybody he wanted to survive, alive and well. C) it lacks the fear that he hated seeing during the war and shows happiness and a sense of innocence. D) he is a normal person like he always wanted

** Why does he have to find the Mirror? I mean, just a rewrite of the original timeline is pretty boring to read. Maybe you could try and to it a bit differently

*** The Mirror is a useful device, just like the Sorting Hat and boggarts. It gives you an easy insight into the character

*** I've already kind of set it up where he encountered it, but it's a bit different on how he finds it though, not to mention a little bit later, too.

** I think he can finally see the mirror for the trick it plays on you and find it as a regular mirror. You can pick something from your theme too. It would be great for character development.

Btw looking forward to the fic.
