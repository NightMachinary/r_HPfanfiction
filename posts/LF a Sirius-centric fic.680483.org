I of course can't remember the title or author. Or site.

But, Sirius makes a vow to do his best for the Black family that is so serious and comprehensive, that Kreature totally starts supporting him and tells him he's reached a new level of Head of the Family, not seen in centuries. And he can now command family members - to the point where he compels them all to come for a family meeting, and Bella beats her own brains out on her cell wall attempting to comply.

And there are dark family objects like a chair of thorns that compels truth-telling - which he uses to prove his innocence and dedication to the family. Oh, and a diary they somehow make a brain-dead Bella write in to use in court? Because only the truth can be written in it?

I'm... 95% sure these scenes are all from the same fic.


** I think I found it. linkffn(7185731)

I skimmed it to make sure it had Kreacher and the thing of thorns you mentioned and found this.

/His bulbous eyes shining as bright as stars, Kreacher fell to his knees before the wizard, bowing his head as the little house elf held up his hands, palms flattened, as the Black family servitor cried out in ecstasy, "Master!"/

lol.

  The concept of the 'do-over' is used in, at the very least, hundreds of Harry Potter stories. Here's my own take, using a HP character that actually has a good reason for getting another chance to make things better.
