Basically after Grindelwald Germany is a bit of a pariah and after Voldemort so is Britain


** I always imagined Grindelwald to be from the Austro-Hungarian Empire especially because his first name sounds Hungarian and his fortress is in Austria.

No, this name is German, and DEFINITELY NOT Hungarian.

****** I mean if he was from the Austro-Hungarian Empire (which still existed at the time of his birth), it wouldn't be such an outlandish thought. Although I think that JK just came up with a name that sounded central European and didn't really think much of his origins at first.

******* That's the likeliest case - since she put the school with the German name, with slavic students from the Balkans, in Scandinavia - not exactly the most consistent approach origin wise :P

** British muggleborns taking the piss out of the german expats they meet by sticking a finger under their nose and sternly stating "Dont mention ze war" as their counterparts come up with increasingly elaborate pseudonyms for Voldemort, making jokes on "You-Know-Who" with longer and longer titles until the joke is only recognisable if you've lived in an obscure bavarian village your entire life

** I've always considered the Grindelwald war to be different from the World War.

In my headcanon, I consider Grindelwald as Hungarian rather than German. I honestly don't see him working with Hitler or muggles in general. But yeah, this is my head canon.

Doesn't fit with what I consider his motivations and objectives are.

** I always imagined him being either from South Germany or from Switzerland. About the countries being pariah for a while after their defeat, I agree with you.
