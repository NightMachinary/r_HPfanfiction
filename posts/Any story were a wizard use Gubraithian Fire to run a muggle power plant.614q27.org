** You could just enchant the turbine to spin without the extra steps.

But probably yes.

*** Yeah, all that heat's a fairly big inconvenience. If you could just make a frictionless turbine spin forever you'd call it a day.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
