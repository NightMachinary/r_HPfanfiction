Hi, all! Just lookin' to see if anyone has any new fics they'd like to promote/recommend. Specifically, I'm looking for anything new that you consider high quality from the past few months or so, with at least three chapters. Like the title says, I'm looking for specifically Harry-centric fics with no slash. Point of departure, AUs, or time-travel/dimension travel fics are my preference, but really I'm open to anything you think is good. Thank you in advance!

*** Just read the summary and the second sentence ("Harry never forgets that in which has passed and strange occurrences have begun to emerge deviating from the norm.") confuses me. What is that supposed to mean?

***** "Harry never forgets /that in which has passed/" The part I put in italics is grammatically wrong I think. Do you want to say "Harry never forgets what has passed/happened" or something else?

I also think the second part needs work. I get what you mean, but it's kind of unnecessarily complicated at the moment. (e.g. *strange* already means /unusual, unexpected/, so *deviating from the norm* doesn't really tell us anything new in this sentence, but makes it confusing and sounds stilted.

  The night sky twinkled, Hagrid was never sent to fetch Harry which resulted in him being alone for his birthday. Harry never forgets that in which has passed and strange occurrences have begun to emerge deviating from the norm. A different path has opened and with it might come something that could shake the world. A Song of Basilisk Venom and Phoenix Tears. Slytherin Harry A/U

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]]. Recently finished what's written. Very enjoyable and fairly unique fic. Towards the end of what's written it becomes a lot less Harry-centric and the POV jumps around a fair bit but it remains captivating. Only problem is it's a slow updater, but the chapters are huge. EDIT: OP!Harry, but I think it's dealt with quite well.

It was published in December 2014, so not sure if it is what you're looking for, but maybe you'll like it.
