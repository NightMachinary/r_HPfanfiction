Just started working on a new post war haphne fic, and need an editor. I've only ever written regular fiction before, and am a self published author. Need some help with ideas and the like as well.


** Not a writer, but I'd be happy to help

*** Daphne was kidnapped and tortured following the final battle, following some strange circumstances Harry finds her, helps nurse her back to health and find the death eater who had her captive. May continue after that but I'm not entirely sure.
