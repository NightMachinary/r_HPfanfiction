I've read several fics where the Diary Horcrux comes to life and proceeds to compete with Voldemort. But after reading [[https://fanfiction.net/s/12930702/1/The-Seven-Voldemorts][The Seven Voldemorts]] I've wondered what it would be like if the rest of them gained bodies too.

I'm also okay with the cliche trope where someone else gets summoned from another universe, but instead of the Order of the Phoenix summoning another Harry, it's the Death Eaters summoning a handful of Voldemorts. Or a bunch of dimension-traveling Voldemorts accidentally converging on a single universe. Really, as long as there are at least three Voldemorts existing at once, I'll be happy to read it.

Edit: For the purposes of “three or more Voldemorts existing at once,” I'm not counting Harry's Horcrux (or any Horcrux, for that matter) as a Voldemort unless it gains control over a body. Voldemort's spirit doesn't count unless it's possessing someone or he's undergone a ritual to have a working body, like in canon.

IIRC there are 3 Voldemorts, at least, in this fic. One is the Minister, one is Defence teacher and the original is still out there, and they are competing with each other.

** This isn't quite the same route, but in this trilogy, by the last book harry is dimension-traveling, and has to juggle fighting the influence of his horcrux, while helping the realities he's travelled to with their Voldemorts -- big butterfly effects happening, so he feels obligated to help, but he still mainly in his original reality because it's his home and he has obligations. Through the three books he also has to end up fighting a few versions of voldemort (including fighting the influence of the horcrux in his head a couple times)

I really recommend giving it a chance, it starts in his 6th year but the main focus on the series is after graduation and auror training. Features unique powers, believable growth, and great character development. It takes a few chapters to get in the swing of things and hit its stride. Just give it a shot!

This has an emergency protocol in the horcruxes. When the Diary is destroyed, the others send out a signal to attract people to wear them for possession. Things don't go the way they expect. Humor Crack. It's a nice fic to read where Harry is a side character. Hell, Trelawney is more of a MC than Harry in this fic.

*** I feel conflicted about this fic because while it's got exactly what I want (all the horcruxes activating at once and finding unconventional subjects to possess), the other half of the story is totally cliched Dumbledore/Snape/Molly Weasley-bashing that adds absolutely nothing to the story... It's such a pity, the Sybill Trelawny/Frank Bryce pairing is very well done and I have a soft spot for different Voldemorts immediately trying to kill each other, but the Harry-centric section of the story is like a tumor. I wish I could just cut it out.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane.
