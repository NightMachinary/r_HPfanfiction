Not for another pairing, but because Krum is over 18 (he might be a 7th year, but his age corresponds to a college freshman) and Hermione is 15 (her age corresponds to a high school freshman).

Criticism on both sides is valid and encouraged (considering Hermione pursued a brief physical relationship with him).

Bonus: Krum wanting to hit on Ginny in book 7, a girl just shy of 16 at the age of 21.
