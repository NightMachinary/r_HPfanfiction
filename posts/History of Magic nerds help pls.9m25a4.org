Can anyone point me to some sound theories that formulate the origins of magic? When did humans gain the capability, why was it restricted to some of them etc?


** It doesn't exist. On Pottermore, JKR says that no one knows where magic comes from originally. We know it goes back at least to ancient Egypt though. Well, to be technical we know old Egyptian tombs were cursed according to Ron and it's part of the common experience in Curse Breaking. Could have been added later, but Ron says it was the ancient Egyptian wizards who cursed the tombs I believe.

As for why it's restricted, well, genes or something. I personally hate that, so I ignore it in my story. Otherwise we get the stupid crap lots of crossovers do where the antagonists get Harry's blood and clone him to get a wizard for themselves (ignoring the obvious issue of that Harry having no way to learn to control his magic...). I relegate it to the soul, which does have canon support. Riddle that came out of the diary could use magic, and he didn't have any biological material from his original self.

**** We sort of know that's true. Harry wasn't born a Parselmouth but he still received the ability through Voldemorts Horcrux, and we later learn he permanently imbibed the ability even though the soul piece was removed. In my own story, I basically say there's a magical equivalent of DNA that explains these extra abilities (Parseltongue, Metamorphmagi, Seer, etc.). I call them "Extras" because I'm not very clever. :)

****** I treat the soul as carrying on its own equivalent of DNA. To me, it explains everything in canon. From Diary Riddle being able to use magic and Parseltongue to Harry gaining Parseltongue from the soul piece (and retaining it). So it's just two kinds, for me.

******** The books don't specify, but Cursed Child does establish that he kept the ability without the Horcrux (though his children don't seem to have received it).
