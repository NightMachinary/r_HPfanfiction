Are they Muggleborns who decide not to go to Hogwarts? And if they reject going what happens to them? Does the Ministry put them under surveillance?

After Hogwarts, are they any Muggleborns who decide to return to the Muggle world? Perhaps they prefer the Muggle world better?

What's stopping a Muggleborn from going to the police , MI5 or any organization and revealing that they are a Wizard?


** I feel all of your questions can be answered referring to the Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. So if there is a reliable way that will stop a Muggleborn from producing random bursts of magic even without Hogwarts education, it's fine*(*)*

If they return to the Muggle world and don't use magic around Muggles, it's fine.

And if they break the Statute, they are going on trial, and ultimately can end up in Azkaban (see [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/carlotta-pinkstone/][Carlotta Pinkstone]]). "What's stopping" them is what's stopping anyone: it's against the law, and there are consequences for breaking it.

*(*)*: It's just for Muggleborns, there probably isn't. At which point you have two possible avenues: A), either they don't take no for answer, see Harry, for whom Dumbledore sends a thug to beat the Dursleys into submission, if you want to look at it uncharitably; or B), they do, and say on your head be it. Meaning as soon as they break a law, even if they don't know about it, see the last paragraph above. Ignorance and inability to control yourself won't be considered valid excuses.

DH seems to imply Hogwarts effectively was compulsory for Muggleborns. I'm assuming Muggle parents wouldn't have access to the resources for home education in magic and, in most cases, couldn't afford to send their children aboard.

  ‘Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,' he replied. ‘That was announced yesterday. It's a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but *their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred*.

It must actually be quite scary to be the parents of a Muggleborn: your child is suddenly and forcibly inducted into a secret world, made subject to new laws over which you have no influence and kept at a secret location for ten months of the year.

*** True, however that was only made a rule when Voldermort was in control of the ministry, I'm pretty sure it would've been changed after his fall. In COS Justin Finch Fletchley says his name was down for Eton but he decided on Hogwarts instead implying he had a choice.

  ‘My name was down for Eton, you know, I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family ...'

I think you could interpret that passage either way.

**** Sorry, I should have been more clear.

DH seems to imply Hogwarts effectively *[was]* compulsory for Muggleborns.

Lupin describes the policy before Voldemort's coup; as well as the current situation.

** According to what was formerly-called Pottermore:

"There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, all of which are registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry (in which case, I cannot vouch for the standard of education they might offer)...the wizarding populations of most countries choose the option of home schooling. Occasionally, too, the magical community in a given country is tiny or far-flung and correspondence courses have been found a more cost-effective means of educating the young."

So theoretically they could be homeschooled (Lupin's father wanted to homeschool Lupin before Dumbledore intervened), do correspondance courses (which might be wizards and witches coming in to teach a subject or two/mark exams, or owl-correspondence for theory-based classes) or go to a backwater school. Of course, the (Muggle) parents would have to ask about these options, so if they don't (or even if they do) their child would probably go off to Hogwarts.
