Yes, I have been drinking, thank you very much. What does that have to do with anything?

​

Edit: Wow! This really blew up! I didn't even remember posting this until just now, and there's so many awesome one-shots in here.


** Thanks to the ever-unhelpful Peeves and the Weasley Twins leaving a 2nd floor corridor covered in frogspawn, Harry Potter had to deviate from his usual route to check on the third floor corridor. It was already a struggle getting out after curfew and he was in a rush, so the only thing that kept him from being discovered by Professor Dumbledore was the Invisibility Cloak and the man who had Dumbledore's attention.

The Professor's eyes, normally twinkling with his smile, were looking decidedly bugged out at the moment. "I beg your pardon? You said your name was..."

"Yeah yeah, Hades, Pluto, God of the Underworld, Father of the Eternal Night, all that jazz. Look man, you gotta do me a solid here. My wife kicked me out of the house, said I'd better find somewhere else to sleep until I fix this. I can't sleep in Tartarus man, those tormented souls /never/ shut up."

Harry did a double take - surely this man, slouching inside a heavy black cloak and wearing... muggle sunglasses?... couldn't be the god of the Underworld?

But Professor Dumbledore seemed to be taking him at his word. "And you say that the Cerberus our Groundskeeper got from you is yours?"

"She loves that dog man. Hell, I love it too, I was just having a rough day and he'd just torn apart another person all over our new carpet, he /knows/ he's only supposed to do that outside, so I was a little ticked off."

"Ah, well, while I can certainly sympathize with your predicament, I'm afraid we really do need your dog. He's guarding something very valuable from a very dangerous wizard."

"Look man, you want guards, I'll set the Erineyes up on a rotating schedule, I just gotta get that dog back." The Prince of Darkness was starting to look panicked, gesticulating wildly.

"I think we'd best avoid any whip-wielding, dominating women - we're not trying to provide /that/ type of education to our students. Still, I'm sure we can work something out, would you care to join me in my office to hammer out the details?"

Mind running a mile a minute, Harry threw caution to the wind and threw off the Cloak as he approached the pair. "Professor, wait!"

"Harry! Out for a late night stroll are you?" There were the twinkling eyes Harry expected.

Hades didn't look surprised by a child suddenly becoming visible - granted, he also looked like Aunt Marge in the morning and she never seemed to be interested in anything after a night of heavy drinking. "Hey, that's Than's cloak, right? You must be one of Ignotus' kids then! Man, we *still* tell that story at dinner, it really gets his goat every time we bring it up."

"Professor, I overheard your conversation and was thinking: maybe Mister Hades could help us with the reason the stone has to be guarded?"

"A capital idea Harry! I think you're right, this situation is right up his alley."

Hades turned his gaze on Harry, revealing flames flickering behind the sunglasses. "Look, my hard nos are anything involving platinum, releasing souls, or deals with Poisedon - I still owe him from our last bet and I've managed to avoid him for the last 200 years. As long as it's not one of those three, I'm sure we can work something out. But I really need to knock this out soon, the Kingdom of the Dead doesn't rule itself, so can we get this show on the road?"

"Certainly, certainly" said Professor Dumbledore, twinkling once again full-force. "I think, Harry, that you can forgoe your evening checks for the immediate future in light of recent events? Perhaps you should make your way back to Gryffindor Tower before Mr. Filch finishes disposing of that Frogspawn."

"Of course Professor, thank you!"

As Harry turned to leave, Hades interjected once more. "Hey kid, c'mere a sec."

Reluctantly, Harry stepped within arm's reach of the Greek god. Hades swiped his hand across Harry's forehead in a quick motion, before wringing it out as if to clean it. "There we go, you had a bit of Soul on you, just got it off. Now then, your office Professor?"

Harry didn't quite understand what just happened, but from Professor Dumbledore's stunned expression, it was important.

"Oh, I think we will have /plenty/ to talk about, my Lord. Follow me please!"

Pretty much all the Greek myth stuff was cribbed from Hades the game.

I know that Dumbledore didn't really suspect Horcruxes or that Harry was one until later in the story, but I just couldn't resist.

** "Awww fuck," he groaned, blinking against the oppressively bright candle light burning right beside his face.

"Hey fellow, you finally awake?" A woman shouted straight into his brain before poking him with a broomstick.

"Hmmwhat." He flapped an arm against the offending broom, only to overbalance and fall from a wooden table and face-first into the ground. Bits and pieces from the night before started fitting together in his mind as he used the tavern table he'd been previously sleeping on to drag himself into a less pitiable position.

"Last call was hours ago," said the lady who'd poked him, a bartender. "I tried to wake you in every possible way, but you were sleeping like the dead."

He would have rolled his eyes at the pun, but she probably didn't even know. He looked around the place with the feeling he was forgetting something. Something important, something... big.

"Did I come here with my dog?" He had left the underworld that morning with the intention of taking Cerberus for a quick walk, and now he couldn't remember when or why that had derailed into a night of drinking like he hadn't had in many centuries. The last time he drank this much, he ended up giving his favorite invisibility cloak away to a human and never found it again, now he hoped the same wouldn't happen to his dog.

"A dog?" The bartender asked perplexed. So maybe he had done the responsible thing and left Cerberus back home before heading here, after all.

"You know, 8 feet tall, three heads, loves music."

"You mean that beast you were selling last night?"

"...I was doing /what/ now."

"You brought that monster of yours here, already drunk, insisting that the owner let it in even though it couldn't fit through the door. Then this bearded fellow, taller than your dog, said you weren't taking care of it properly, that he could take it off your hands and give it a better home."

He took her shoulders and shook her frantically. "/Who??/ Who did I sell my dog to???"

"I didn't see his face, but he was quite tall, maybe even a half-giant."

"Shit, fuck," he swore under his breath. "Persephone is going to kill me. There's only five days left of spring, Persephone is going to see how I'm a terrible and irresponsible husband and spend the rest of her days figuring out a way to /actually kill me/, damn it."

...

(aah, I was gonna write more, with Hades accidentally retrieving his Deathly Hallows and accidentally being hired as DADA teacher and accidentally doing a lot of things until Persephone has to go retrieve her husband and dog herself, but it's 3am right now so I'm not gonna finish this, sorry) (if anyone wanna take it from here, feel free)

He has plenty of authority on his own, but Hades has the power to put his foot down if the situation is serious enough. Certainly, losing control of three ridiculously powerful artifacts counts as serious, especially considering Hades oft repeated sentiment that he deals with too many dead people already (that's why he actually didn't want the war between Zeus and Poseidon; he didn't want to deal with the paperwork, so to speak).

If anything, the gods are more like a mafia family - lots of internal strife, bets, bad blood, revenge, etc. Hades would definitely not fuck with items belonging to the guy that makes people die.

** [Disclaimer: This is my first time doing a one-shot type of thing, as well as my first time sharing my writing for anyone online to see. Secondly, I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes---I was fighting off sleep writing this---and I'm sorry if Hagrid seems OOC (speaking of, I didn't write out his accent because I just wasn't comfortable or confident in doing so in a well-written way). Finally, this was done for fun! So don't take it seriously please :)]

Hades isn't having the best day. Well, the best week if he's being honest. Actually---let's just say Hades is at his worst both when A) Persephone returns to her mother for the required time of year and B) when Persephone is cross with him. Having autumn begin just a week ago, he should be recovering from his bout of spring-time depression, but at its peak a few months ago, he made a mistake.

Now, Hades wants to preface with the fact that along with being the one that keeps his poor moods at bay, Persephone is also the one who stops him from making stupid decisions---and with her back, the Lord of the Underworld now understands that selling their pet monster named Cerberus while drunk falls under that category.

So, Persephone, Goddess of Spring, Queen of the Underworld, and the only one who can truly punish Hades, has been decidedly cross since she returned home from her mother's a week ago.

Now, Hades has to track down the half-giant he sold Cerberus to, request for the beast back---or, steal him should the request be denied---and bringing him back home to his doting mistress.

The first step was surprisingly easy; as it turns out, there aren't many animal-loving, half-giant/half-wizards out there that have a habit of spilling their secrets. Actually speaking to the man, however, results in stupefaction on either side.

“A guard dog?” Hades repeats, knowing he hears correctly but not quite believing it. “In a school full of children?”

He knows Cerberus fills the same role for the entrance to the Underworld, but that is a stark difference to a place where mortal children reside. /Persephone would have my head if she knew./ He imagines her expression and shivers. /Better resolve it before she can catch wind, then./

“Yeah, so you see why I can just be giving him back.”

“What on Earth is important enough to have a cerberus guarding it?” Hades makes sure not to mention that said cerberus is actually The Cerberus. It'd be hard to explain that without also revealing who exactly he was---it's not just anyone that can accidentally sell the Underworld's guard dog, after all.

“Well I can't just be blabbing my mouth about the stone---“ The half-giant called Hagrid freezes mid-sentence. With a groan he tugs in his beard. “Not again,” He mutters forlornly.

“Listen,” Hades says impatiently. “My wife is quite cross with me at the moment. She is rather fond of Ce---“ He clears his throat. “Spot,” He recovers smoothly. “And she won't forgive me until I retrieve him. So, if you will just allow me to do so, I will not only leave without any... commotion,” He lets his tone imply what exactly a ‘commotion' would entail. “I will also provide you with another cerberus in his place.”

“A-Another cerberus?” Hagrid perks up at the mention. “But I've grown fond of, Fluffy...” He trails off. “Spot, I suppose he's called.” Hagrid's tone is dejected, his hunched form positively pitiful.

Hades sighs. “I don't think my wife would be too opposed to allowing you to... babysit every now and then.”

The large man's eyes widen to a preposterous size. “You really think so?”

“I will see what I can do.”

“Well then, if you can make sure there's another cerberus to protect the-the thing that needs protecting---“

“Of course,” Hades interrupts, eager to get his dog and go home to his soon-to-be happy wife.

Hagrid nods, and it's settled.

A few hours later, one happy goddess pets one of three oversized heads resting on the floor in front of her, snuggled into the side of her husband who, fulfilling the last part of his atonement, is dutifully stroking his harp for the napping cerberus.

He wouldn't have it any other way.

** Fun fact: The name Cerberus is theorized to originate from the Proto-Indo-European *k̑érberos, which means "spotted".

That would mean Hades named his huge, three-headed guard dog the equivalent of Spot. I think he might have /been/ the Greek version of Hagrid.

Also of note, Hagrid didn't /win/ Fluffy, he /bought/ Fluffy - though he did meet the "Greek chappie" he bought Fluffy from in the pub, the year before.\\
The dragon-egg he "won" off of Quirrell, who probably threw that game on purpose to incentivize Hagrid into talking.

That said, I could still see Hades drunkenly agreeing to loan out Cerberus to do what he does best and go guard a hallway for a year, without card games or other bets coming into the equation.
