In this instance, I'm referring to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics][genetic chimeras]], where one person is comprised of two (or more) distinct genotypes.


** I was really hoping this was going to come with a story featuring the mythical sort of chimeras learning to do magic because being a ridiculously powerful beast wasn't enough.

To answer your question, though. Short of autoimmune response and major physical changes (heterochromia, intersex, etc.), chimerism doesn't really do much in terms of noticable differences, so probably not. Maybe they'd have an unusual wand?

*** It may have implications for polyjuice and/or spells that rely on biology and/or identity (perhaps polyjuice makes the drinker look like someone different because the chimera's hair and bones are of siblings). Also, if they're basically just their own conjoined twin, does that mean that they have two souls?

**** Unless you think someone with, say, a heart transplant, has an extra soul, probably no on that last one.

Would a pair of conjoined twins who share some of their brain matter/nerve tissue have two souls?

** Magic seems to function regardless of genetic makeup - you don't automatically gain magical proficiency or wand mastery just from Polyjuicing as someone, for example - so I doubt it would be relevant. Your magic would simply incorporate the new genetic information into its idea of who 'you' are.

Maybe that ability gets a little out of control sometimes, and you wind up able to manipulate your own phenotype... but then you'd be some kind of metamorphing magus, which is totally weird and not supported by canon at all.

** Women are already chimeras, so to speak, due to X-inactivation. It presumably has an effect on their ability to do stuff, by making some unusual traits be watered down (mostly likely) by more common ones. A genetic chimera would be a bit different, because they aren't so finely mixed. Maybe one arm would be good for transfiguration, the other good for charms...

And tracking spells don't work for some of them.

And of course if it affects the brain, then there are two minds souls-bonded in the same body, and that means they're immune to AK's, if the plot requires it.
