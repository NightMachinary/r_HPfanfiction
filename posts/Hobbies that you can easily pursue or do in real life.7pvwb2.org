I'm pretty sure we've all read this type of fanfic at one point in our fanfiction browsing lives: Harry (and his gang) decide that they want to do something else along with their current Hogwarts curriculum, so they head to the library or hire some tutors to help him and they slowly master or learn this skill over time. I'm also pretty sure that I'm not the only one who gets inspired by these fanfics. So, what're some hobbies or skills that you can easily pick up with minimal cost or startup fees?

*** Paint, brushes and canvases are pretty expensive. Even though you can compromise at the begining it will soon become pretty costly:(

**** You don't have to by expensive paints, brushes, or canvases at all. I've been an art student for six years now and I've been drawing for a lot longer and I still don't spend a lot of money for materials. It's not always worth it. A good artist knows how to make do with the stuff they already have. I've used nail polish as paint before, the bar isn't high when it comes to my materials

***** Maybe prices differ in our countries. I tend to prefer oil paint or acrilic and even the cheapest brands are somewhat expensive. Some brushes die pretty quickly so eventually I end up buying new ones.

And nail polish is just as expensive as oils and not as effective. But I see what you mean by using what you have, always try to do it myself:)

****** Well what country do you come from that has such high prices for paint? Also, I do own very cheap paints where a bottle is about 50Â¢ each. I've had my paintbrushes for years now, and they're still pretty good. I just get the ones that come in packs with many brushes inside. It's either that or I paint with my fingers. I'm not above doing that

******* I am from Russia. The cheapest oils that I could find is about 2.5$ for 40ml tube.

I envy your for your still intact brushes. Acrilic washes off fine from mine, but oil usually is very difficult to wash out. It has an especially bad effect on smaller brushes.

** I have recently been into bookbinding. You can make sketchbooks, notebooks and even plain books. There are lots of ways to make bookcovers. They can be from simple paper or even leather. I recommend you check out SeaLemon on YouTube if you are interested. She even has a Tom riddle diary tutorial:)

** Knitting and crocheting both have pretty minimal starting costs. When you first start learning you really only need craft store yarn and one size hook/needles. It gets more expensive for the better yarn/tools; but what hobby doesn't?

** Beading. Sure, it does have a start-up cost, even non-trivial at that if you want to get into it seriously, but for people who have access to transfiguration it's basically a matter of getting some samples of the more unusual stuff they'll want and getting some info about what beads and other stuff used for beading is made of and how so for them it would easily close on a twenty-pounder.

** Bird watching. If you want to get fancy you can get a decent set of binoculars but really the Mark I eyeball is pretty decent.

** Maybe not easy, but worthwhile is to start learning a language. For example, there are all sorts of great free online classes for learning German through DW.com (I really like Nico's Weg), and I assume the same is true for other popular languages. There are also websites where you can trade helping someone learning English in exchange for help with their native language.
