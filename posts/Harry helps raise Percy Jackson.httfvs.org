Wizards/Witches are Legacies of Hecate, it's where the blood supremacy stemmed from. Over the years however, it just became bigotry. Muggleborns are Hecate's newly blessed, and wix like Dumbledore and Harry (people who are important to fate) become her champions.

The gods are aware of the wizarding world, as they are aware of the existence of gods.

Hecate was torn. She could feel something was coming, something big, something that had everything to do with the great prophesy. While she resented the Olympians and their arrogance, she wanted to have her own piece on the chest board. One with experience, one who was reliable to live and become a wild card in the plans of Zeus. However, what she herself would do was undecided. She would see how this played out, yes, but it was time to bring her knight out of retirement.

Harry Potter was not done yet.

A year was enough of a vacation, right?

After the defeat of Voldemort, Harry thought his life would slow down. Maybe after he'd become an auror, he could settle down with a nice girl, have kids, and live the life he'd always dreamed of.

Nope. That all changed when he came home to find that what looked like /hell hounds/ had invaded his home, and decided to attack him. Having never seen such creatures, he came out of the scuffle with a slashed up jawline, a gold dusted apartment, and a whole lot of questions.

Hecate visited Harry in his dreams that night, told him to go America, New York, and search for Chiron. With all the pieces in place, she stepped back and waited.

Sure enough, the ICW had requested for Harry (the new Dumbledore) to leave Britain and pursue leads as to where the odd stream of monster's were coming from. It was an odd case, long term and obviously manipulated by the goddess. Harry didn't question it though, he had a job to do.

But one cannot expect Harry to resist meddling, especially when it was with fate. Harry knew Hecate was manipulating him, but as she was a goddess he was a mortal wizard. While she could only listen, he would get involved, but for now he settled. Things hadn't even begun, and he wanted to relax for a bit. It wasn't everyday he got a break from the annoying fame.

19 year old Harry meets 6 year old Percy in New York, after noticing a cyclops had its eye on him. He followed the boy and his mother around for awhile, noticing disguised monsters were drawn to him. What was odd though was that they took one sniff of him and left, this kid was obviously a demigod like Hecate had told him about, so he must have hid his scent. He was also the key to finding Chiron, if he was persistent enough.

The pair were obviously on their way home from school, if the backpack was any indication. Harry trailed them for a bit, feeling a bit creepy, but those monsters were getting too numerous for comfort. He noticed the the mother looking around aswell, anxiety on her pretty face. She was in her early thirties, with blue eyes and sandy brown hair. The boy had darker brown hair, tanned skin, and sea green eyes. He obviously looked like the father, but had his mothers nice disposition.

Harry sees them cut into an alley, and almost leaves them alone till he notices a trench coated man that was too tall follow them in. Harry cursed, picking up pace and weaving in between passersby. Once he was in the ally he tugged a thin bronze chain from his neck, and it straightened till a jagged two pronged spear was in its place. It was a gift from Hecate, being able to channel less intricate spell work with the core of a thunderbird feather.

He dashed through till he came upon the revealed cyclops that was about to end the two's lives, with nary a thought Harry cast a spell.

"/Baubillius!/"

The stream of white lightning struck the beast, turning its attention towards the young man that had a pointy staff barreling towards it. It roared in pain, and had no time to retaliate before the spear clipped its head off and reduced it to dust.

With a reaction that spoke of having done this many times before, Harry tapped the spear against his neck and it wrapped around him, becoming a chain once again.

He turned to the mother and son,

"Are you alright?" The mother appeared to be in shock, but the young demigod looked up to Harry in amazement.

"That. Was awesome."

After that, the newly named Sally Jackson was more than happy to have someone else look out for her son. Percy and sometimes Ms Jackson became a regular thing at Harry's apartment, as Sally would much prefer her son with Harry then her current husband; who sadly was important monster repellent. It took many words of reason to stop Harry from going over to their residence and having a 'talk' with the waste of space called a human being.

Percy, the demigod, was pretty cool. He was a good kid, if not a bit oblivious and or hyperactive. Harry learned that Percy struggled a bit in school, getting into trouble that wasn't his fault and not quite getting the material. This hit home with Harry because HE was like that when he was young, being punished for something he had no control over. Harry helped him as best as he could with homework, as Sally had to work a lot and didn't have the time.

He could see fairly quickly that Percy had dyslexia, and when things got frustrating for him Harry helped take his mind off it. Usually by engaging in a battle of wits, making each other laugh by just talking.

(Sort of) Unknowingly, Harry had trained Percy's sass into something fierce. Harry was a master at making powerful people want to rip out their hair, and Percy had become his apprentice. In Olympus, Zeus had a strange sense of foreboding every time he wondered of his brother's spawn; ignorant of the stress that was to come.

As the years passed and Percy grew older, Harry noticed how unhappy he seemed. He couldn't seem to stay in a school for more than a year, and everytime he was expelled Harry saw how sad Percy looked as he trudged through his door after the day.

Percy had come to see Harry as an older brother, and cared a lot about what he thought. So when at 11 years old he had to explain how he accidentally shot at his school bus with a Revolution era /canon/, he was a bit surprised that Harry laughed.

"-A CANON! Hahahaha- and I thought /I/ was bad-!"

Harry had stopped laughing when he saw how upset Percy was, immediately feeling like an ass.

It was then that Harry gave Percy some advice that stuck with him through every hardship.

"People are gonna try and put you down no matter what you do, simply because you are Percy Jackson. Don't listen to them, if you didn't mean to, it's not important. As long as you do what you think is right, I'll be proud of you, so will your mum, and everyone else that matters. Chin up, you'll go far."

Harry had clapped him on his shoulder, and gave him a grin.

"Now, let's start today's training."

Zeus and Chiron shuddered again.

Camp Half-Blood wouldn't know what hit it.

I'm done for now, feel free to add or write a fic if you want! (Also sorry if it sucks, I wrote this quick so it might not make much sense.)


** This was really fun! I don't usually go for crossovers, but I've always thought Harry and Percy had quite a lot in common. With all the trouble Percy goes through, I feel like having someone like Harry with him would help a great deal! And as for Harry-no doubt Sally (and Paul!)would practically adopt him as her own and give him a family away from all the fame and attention in the Wizarding World.

If you or anyone else continues writing something like this, I'd like to read it! I only wish I had the ability to write it myself, but I'd probably failðŸ˜‚
