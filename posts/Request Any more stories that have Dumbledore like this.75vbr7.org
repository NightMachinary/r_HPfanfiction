So I'm currently reading Eldritch and I'm really enjoying the story, I'm not that far into it mind you but I do like where it seems to be going. Although unfortunately it is incomplete, rather sad about that.

I was wondering if there were any other Dumbledore characterizations like that?

Without spoiling too much for those who want to read he was sent in the past and is having difficulty in trusting Tom Riddle Jr.

I really like the conflict, we normally have a Albus Dumbledore who believes in second chances and the like and while he does believe it he's having difficulty following his own advice on giving people second chances.

My version of Dumbledore is that he makes mistakes, he feels bad for said mistakes but that does not make him a monster. Making mistakes means you're human, he's human and is filled with guilt over the mistakes that he has made.

And that seems to be represented in the story that I'm currently reading. Which I like that. Either writers go full out and hate on Dumbledore for his mistakes or make him a saint. He isn't a monster or saint, just merely human. And it's shown well here.

Basically a Dumbledore that has flaws and tries his best but isn't always right or justified is what I'm looking for. And if people in the story actually call him out on the more sketchy stuff he does that's a plus too, because Abeforth reprimands Albus in the story when he does something wrong, which I like.

So yeah, anything like that sort of characterization for Albus would be amazing.

  Albus is thrown back to 1934, where he meets the troubled orphan, Tom Riddle. Albus discovers that this parenting business isn't half as easy as he thought it might be, especially when the child involved is Tom.
