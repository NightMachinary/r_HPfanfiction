** If there are so many tags that it would take at least five minutes to read them.

Also, tags which say something like 'I'm not saying what the pairings will be, it's a surprise!'. There are a lot of pairings that I won't read, so hiding the type of story it's going to be on purpose and not saying what the relationships will be always means that I never try it out.

Specifically soulmate au tags were you have no other choice but to be with your designated partner. Also A/B/O again on an existential level never actually having a choice because you are a second class citizen by default and you are bound by the laws of your biology.

** - Bashing fics. If you really don't like a character, you don't need to write a whole fanfic just to bash them. You can just hate them privately. If you're serious about writing an actually decent story, then don't bash them from the word go. Focus on why you don't like the character, examine that in the story, and then use that to find a way to give them their comeuppance in a realistic way.

- Mpreg, A/B/O, and gay slashfics. I don't need to explain why this needs to stop.

- Powerful! fics. Unless you're writing a commentary on or parody of this type of fic, you are writing a very bad anime and too lazy to come up with your own story.

- Intelligent! fics. Unless you're the guy that wrote HP and the Methods of Rationality, you're writing a very bad anime and too lazy to come up with your own story.

- Grey! fics. Unless you can properly outline what Light, Dark and Grey mean, explain what the consequences of committing to each are, reason through why Grey is truly the best option, and show how the character actually becomes Grey, you're writing a very bad YA story and too lazy to come up with your own.

*** Why would gay slashfics need to stop? I can understand reasons for not liking the kinks/fetishes involved in ABO and MPreg, but slash pairings shouldn't be in the same category.

It's okay to not want to read gay pairings, I don't read femslash, but I don't think people shouldn't write them.

**** I included femslash under the umbrella of gay in this instance. The reason I say those three kinds need to stop is that they almost invariably exist for the sole purpose of writing smut. Given that, it would be better if they were published on a site specifically for smutfics like hpfanficarchive. However, as the sheer volume of these smut writers on ff.net make it seem extremely unlikely they will move to such a platform, it would be far easier to simply wish they would stop.

I would argue that all fanfiction sites are made specifically for smutty fanfiction since they are made for all fanfiction.

***** It's true that for some slash pairings the fanfiction about them are mainly smut but I've found some pairings where there are a lot of lovely romance stories without any smut at all (or smut being a very small part of it)

However I agree with you on the fact that they should relocate their fic elsewhere when it's PWP stories.
