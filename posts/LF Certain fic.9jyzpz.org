Harry took up the mantle of Lord Slytherin, but used aging potions and (I think) a mask whenever he had to appear in public as said Lord, because he doesn't want people to know his true identity.

I remember 1 or 2 specific scenes. Harry kisses Daphne, who is (I think) betrothed formally to Lord Slytherin. Their group then had someone polyjuice into Harry's form, and the real Harry, as Lord Slytherin, tore a new one into the fake Harry for kissing his betrothed.

Please help, I really loved this story, and I want to re read it, as I'm kind of obsessed with Harry/Daphne right now. (Also if you have any other good fics with that pairing to recommend then I'm all for them.) Thanks!

*** Thank you so much. It turns out that that was one if the first results when I searched up the fic, but I overlooked it because I confused it with something else ü§£üòÇüòÅ
