I need some snily [Snape/Lily] in my life. Sad thing is that a huge fucking chunk of it is angst on angst on angst on angst and that just isn't on. So throw some happy/cracky Snily my way. Doesn't matter if they are platonic or otherwise. Ideally, I want something like [[http://lascaux.deviantart.com/art/Snily-Comic-Arson-1-260423857][this]] in fict form [read the rest of the comic. It's hilarious].

For those without suggestions, if say James Potter was out of the picture, who would you pair Lily up with and why?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11211969/1/Tempus-Vita][Tempus Vita]] is pretty good. It's not really funny or cracky, but it has practically no angst from what I can see (that, or my definition of angst is way different than yours). I'm pretty sure it's gearing up for a Snape/Lily romance. It's not complete yet, but (afaik) it hasn't been abandoned.

*** Not super emo angsty but not as lighthearted or cracky as I wished. Oh well, looks like a good fict regardless so thanks. :)

** That comic is hilarious. I'm a huge fan of Snape/Lily and I've read a ton of fanfics with that pairing but I haven't come across anything crack-like or angst-free like you're describing. :-/

*** I was afraid of that. I am writing my own sorta snily fict and even with all these lighthearted ideas in mind, it's like I keep getting pulled into this vortex of angst. :(

**** I think that's at least partially because Snape is an angsty individual.

***** He is but I think he would do really well in the deadpan snarker or exasperated everydude in this situation. Like every time Lily goes all Gryffindor he's like 'LILY NO' and she's like 'LILY HELL YES' lol.

And the fict I mentioned is a part of a series [it's mostly drabbles so you can skim through it] called [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/122235][Kingdom]].

***** Dark Comedy is best comedy as long as it isn't just stupid edginess. I like morbid jokes not 'this isn't your cup of liquefied baby huehuehue'
