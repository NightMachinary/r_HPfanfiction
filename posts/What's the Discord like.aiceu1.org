I don't use Discord, but I'm thinking of starting so I can join the HPFanfiction server. Before I do, I was wondering if anyone could give me a rundown of what it's like, and whether it is limited to voice only or if you can type messages as well.

I've finally gotten over myself where my writing is concerned and started posting on FF again for the first time in over a year. I thought if it's basically a group of writers/readers encouraging each other and discussing ideas, that I might find it helpful for pushing on with my fic.

** I've only used the voice channel once, when drunk. I think I sang Adele. It's best for everyone I don't do that again.

The discord community is lovely and I have a nice time there.

** So, from a long-ish user (over 2 years now), the Discord and IRC are still linked. If you type a message in IRC, Discord users will see it, and vice versa. However, basically all members are using Discord now.

We have around 10 text channels, and around 98% of the actual chatting goes on there. In the voice channels, nobody is online for most of the day. We have an extremely active #general channel that has people on basically 24/7, we have nice #actualreading and #actualwriting channels - those are for discussing reading or writing fanfic.

I'd estimate there are around 50 regularly active people, with a core of around 20 users who are online almost daily. Generally, I'd like to think that we are a welcoming bunch, and it doesn't hurt to just join for a bit. I personally have met with one of the chatters (one of the mods) from there in real life twice, and he's been quite enjoyable to hang out with every time.

A bonus is that community pillars like [[/u/Taure]] do hang around from time to time.

Oh, and we have our own version of the fanfiction bot to recommend fics.

** I never use voice chat so don't worry you can use text/message just fine, it's basically just a chat room, plenty of people there discussing things related to HPFF :)

I'm still relatively new to it but I've found a few other channels for the ships I like and whatnot, took me a week or so to figure it out but it's pretty straightforward

** Discord supports voice channels and text channels. It's pretty popular for voice communication for online gaming. Most of the discord servers I'm on are specifically for gaming.

** I'm not sure if more than a few people use the voice channels. Most use text. There's channels for all kinds of things (general, reading, writing, gaming, politics, memes, etc.), so you can find discussion for practically anything, including your own work.

** I was new to Discord as well when I joined this one, but everyone has been amazing and super supportive. There's always someone willing to discuss everything from random shit to grammar and story related stuff. Can definitely recommend
