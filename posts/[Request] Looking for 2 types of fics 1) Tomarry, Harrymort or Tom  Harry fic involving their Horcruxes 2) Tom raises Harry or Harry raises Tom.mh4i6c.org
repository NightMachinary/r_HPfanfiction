For the first kind, anything involving their magical connection.

In other words, no time travel fics.

Second one is pretty self-explanatory.


** Also for type 1 a solid harry/fem!voldemort is linkffn(departure from the diary by tendraelumbra)

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** There was some story that iirc was pretty good- it was a while ago but iirc aberforth is an unspeakable and sends harry back to kill baby Tom but something goes wrong and harry arrives later, when Tom's already a kid and their first interaction is harry saving him from being bullied and then can't bring himself to kill him so he raises him instead. In the end he and the woman he ends up getting together with do a good enough job raising him that he ends up being minister of magic when harry gets back to the future

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** If you don't mind self-recs, I'm currently writing a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30208026/chapters/74434125][story]] where Voldemort absconds with Harry when he goes to kill him in 1981, and seven years later, one of his old Death Eaters catches up with him. It's got a Tom thatâ€˜s living a very low-key and Mugglish life, essentially retired from being Voldemort, though he won't be able to get away with that as easily as he hopes.

** linkao3(5924098) Time-Travel fic. Slash. Rewritten by goodmorninglove falls into the second category, Harry is the Master of Death and after most of his friends die of old age he decides to go back in time to find an anchor to preserve his sanity, and ends up adopting little Tom Riddle. It's a wip though and it hasn't been updated in a long time.
