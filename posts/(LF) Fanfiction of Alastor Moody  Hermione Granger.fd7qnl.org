*********** the person i replied to originally said moody was seventy years old. i said "voldemort is older" trying to imply if hermione x voldemort exists, hermione x moody can too. then you said voldemort's body is four years old and i said having a relationship with a four year old is wrong. is everything clear now?

****** The chronological age of the body is irrelevant. Bodies are just meat. It's the age of the mind that drives it that makes romance creepy.

******** I disagree. The vast majority of the cells in your body are younger than that. If we're going by physical age of the body, that makes everyone a pedo.

********** Sex organ cells only live for a few months tops. But that's just me being facetious

In a world where the mind is irrevocably bound to a single body, physical age always equals mental age.

Not so when a mind can inhabit multiple bodies across its lifespan. I'm sure you'd agree that a hundred year old mind piloting a twenty year old body is not twenty years old.

*********** Are you ok? Nobody mentioned cells. Legally atleast physical age = birth to death

Which means rebirth = birth but again >>> voldemorts new body is like 4

************ Only because no courtroom has ever had to deal with a case like this. If they were, and may indeed be in the future, I cannot imagine they would claim the physical age of the body is more important than that of the mind.

The comparison to cells is relevant because your body is nothing but a collection of them. The age of those individual cells has no impact on your legal age. Ergo replacing them entirely (i.e. body hopping) should not have any impact either.
