** While this is happening in the Dramione fandom specifically, any instance of plagiarism by an author of her following is a massive deal. This situation reminds me of Cassandra Clare's back when she wrote HP fanfiction (ironically, she was one of the authors who were plagiarized).

If you notice that something in a fic you are reading is stolen, please speak up and help hold the "author" accountable <3
