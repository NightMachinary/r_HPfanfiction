I remember reading a story where being "dark" was not about being evil, but instead about belief and practice of a pagan religion. I would like to find more stories that are along these lines. However, they are hard to find.


** It's probably not quite what you're after, but in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza's]] Denarian series, Harry plays host of a fallen angel Meciel, who is bound to one of the 30 pieces of silver that Judas received. The series, much like the /Dresden Files/ series by Jim Butcher (with which it is a crossover) leans heavily on religion, devils, angels, etc.

** I remember a fair bit of paganism and rituals in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1015585/Chris-Widger][Chris Widger's]] Grey Queen series. It was one of the earliest "Harry sorted into Slytherin" stories and I'd warn that it's heavier on the angst than I normally follow.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]] has paganism as a main theme, and [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=1324][Lightning Wave's]] Saving Connor series also uses pagan ideas on both the dark and light sides of magic.

**** Nah, apart from very background Remus/Sirius thing. But the relationship between Harry and Voldemort and is the main focus of the fic, and that's not a sexual one.
