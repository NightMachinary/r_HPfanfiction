Harry Potter knows he can't change the past...at least not the main events. That doesn't mean he can't go back and screw with everyone.

First year: During the sorting feast as the first years stand awaiting their sorting Harry hexes Quirrel so he can't move. All the professors yell in outrage. Harry shouts "hold on I got this". He runs over to Quirrel, spins him around and yanks off the turban shouting "TADA!!!" Voldemort flees.

Second year: During the sorting feast just as Dumbledore is about to introduce professor Lockhart, Harry magically (figure it out) add veritaserum to Lockheart's juice. As Lockhart stands up Harry shouts out "hey Professor Lockhart how did you do all those things in your books". After Lockheart tells all Harry stands up and shouts " TADA!!!" The diary and all that can still happen.

Third year: During the sorting feast Harry walks up to Professor McGonagall and say "look Professor I found a rat and check out this cool new spell I learned". Harry then casts the animagous revealing spell and Peter Pettigrew is revealed. Harry shouts "TADA!!!". Serious is freed and Pettigrew later escapes so book four can happen.

Fourth year: During the sorting feast as Mad-Eye is walking between tables Harry hexes him so he can't move. The staff just shake their heads. Harry turns to them and says "You're gonna need to give me about 45-50 minutes on this one. 45 minutes later Mad-Eye reverts to Crouch Jr. Harry shouts out "TADA!!!". Pettigrew still gets Harry's name in the goblet and completes the ritual.

Fifth year: During the sorting feast Harry decides to go with the tried and true method of veritaserum. When Umbridge gets up to introduce herself Harry shouts "Hey professor who sent dementors after me this summer?". After she spills all Harry shouts "TADA!!!". The ministry battle still happens and Sirius still dies.

Sixth year: During the sorting feast Harry walks over to the Slytherin table quickly hexes Malfoy. Harry shouts "TADA!!!" as he pulls back Malfoy's sleve showing the dark mark for all to see. Malfoy flees from Hogwarts and some other Slytherin finishes his task.

This is obviously a crack fic idea. I can just imagine the professors going from worried in second and third year to just resigned by fifth and sixth.
