His Magic does things that it isn't supposed to, because Harry believes it can. "You can't apparate in Hogwarts?" Just did. Ideally make him as ridiculous and over the top as actual Orkz are, if possible. Bonus points if Voldemort loses to Harry's WAAAAAAAAAAAGH

**** I drafted a crossover, where Harry would be turned by Mannfred von Carstein (because everyone loves Mannfred) and then I realised that Warhammer magic/creatures are grossly overpowered compared to basic Harry Potter magic.

I do realise that 40k and fantasy are different, but you know.

***** I am fairly certain your average Bright Wizard would ROFLstomp the entire HP universe. Let's not even get into the shenanigans a named character could get into. Harry being a Weird Boy would utterly break the HP universe at a level so fundemental that it would likely drive everyone mad.

So basically the story is going to be pretty short but Harry is definitely building his own broom (one that belches noxious fumes and has a very loud engine) and paints it red.
