** When I saw the title, I thought it would be linkao3(If Them's the Rules) where he works in a dressmaker's shop. Doesn't look like it fits your request otherwise, but this is a great story anyway so I figured I might as well link it. Best of luck on your search!

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

*** Honestly I'm not a fan of the story, Harry just seems so I guess weak would be the word. I understand that he can't be OP or anything but it felt that he was just lacklustre. Not to mention that he didn't study up on the timeline he was going to. I don't know, it just put me off.

**** I feel like he was pretty similar to canon, so his shortcomings weren't especially jarring. More frustrating, but that is something I thought reading the original series, too. I understand where you're coming from.
