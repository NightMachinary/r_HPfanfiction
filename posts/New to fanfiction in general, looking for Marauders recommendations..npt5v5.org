Title basically, but my preference would probably be Lily/James stories, although everything in that era I'm interested.

I'm asking because from my little research there seems to be a lot of fics on this topic, some even in the millions of words, so any advice would be appreciated.


** My absolute current favorite L/J story is Come Together: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22187539]]) It's the slowburn to end all slowburns but it's incredible and the characterizations are top notch. My best friend loves this fic and she hasn't even read the original series haha. Sixth/seventh year jily.

I also love The Last Enemy series by chdarling on ao3, she's just started posting the second book, but the first one is complete: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707]]) Each book is a year, the first one starts in fifth year.

And then there's TLAT, which is the classic jily fic: linkffn(5200789) It's incomplete, but there's somebody on AO3 writing a final three chapters for it and they're doing an incredible job - it fits in with the rest of the story: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28519491/]])

The Mapmakers is also incredible and is almost finished: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/]]) It has both Jily and Wolfstar, and does a great job of focusing equally on everyone. Also features probably my favorite interpretation of Dorcas Meadowes.

I have loads more jily/marauders recs, but most of them have been mentioned on this sub a lot if you do a search!

  It's difficult to say when James and Lily took the first steps to love. Perhaps they had always been walking this road, unaware of the person they were walking towards until the mist cleared. They would fall in love eventually --- but we would be remiss in ignoring the hiccups along the way.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and it's about time they shared a kiss already.This is my attempt at TLAT Chapter 37. It's Jules's world, we're all just living in it.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
