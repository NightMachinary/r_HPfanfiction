Usually the time travel fics revolve around Harry and Marauders but is there any where Harry is more close with Lily? It doesn't necessarily have to be friends, I read one with female Harry being time travel reincarnated as Lily's adopted sister after Harry's parents (Lily's aunt and uncle) die so something with those vibes?


** I think in linkffn(timely errors) Lily and Harry are sort of friends. It's not a fix-it.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

** "Lily and Harry are sort of friends" - I think the request is a bit more than sort of kinda friends at the last moment after they spend 95% of the book hating each other.

Harry / Lily is sadly one of the hardest things to find that shouldn't be. Most of the stories that have both Harry & Lily fall into one of these categories.

1. WBWL - Lily gets memory charmed or talked into giving up her son harry to the dursleys or another orphanage so she can focus all her time on his younger brother who needs all of her attention and love now.
2. Marauder Time Travel to 1991 - We are going to die soon so no reason to get involved in his life. We shouldn't change anything or try to show our son any kind of love he missed out on.
3. BWL Suprise! - Harry is not really a potter because his real parents were murdered by the potters or sirius so they could save their real son James Jr. from the horrible fate of voldermort and only come back to the real world once harry dies or is crippled from fighting in the war. Also the new James Jr Potter steals all his friends.
4. Harmony time travel to 1975 - Harry goes back in time with Hermione to see if they can prevent the total destruction of the wizarding world. Harry carries a ring in his pocket so he can propose to hermione but his parents get in a fright in whatever year they go back to and Harry finds out James asks hermione to hogsmede and he finds out by walking into them snogging with each other in the common room. Harry throws the ring in the fireplace and jumps off the astronomy tower later that night.
5. Mental Time Travel - Harry wakes up as a 5 year old again but in godrics hollow. His parents are not only alive but he also had 3 sisters. The body he jumped into happened because death owned him a favor and the harry potter kid killed himself so he allowed the soul jump in. Instead of making new friends he is constantly yelled at and hated because his other self was a dick and his father throws him out of the family taking away heir ship while his mother cries but allows it all to happen for the greater good.
