There are actually two fics with this premise - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/945805][here's the other one]]. I hadn't read it before I started writing mine.

Anyway, the above scene doesn't really happen in the fic, but a cho/dudley story where it does is the criminally underrated [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25821994][magic, but the muggle kind]]

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

***** There's about a billion background characters like that. HP is kinda covered in characters without much actual character when it comes to the the actual school kids.

From Harry's year or the one immediately above or below, there's maybe.. Three Ravenclaws that are noteworthy. And I'm defining noteworthy as having a few lines or more than like three character traits known. So- Luna, Cho, and Padma.

I can think of literally zero Hufflepuffs. Wait, Cedric. One. We have one.

For Slytherins I got three. Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy. I'm kinda ehh on that last one.

There's a shit load of Gryffindors. Guess that makes sense because the POV character is there lol.

But then you gotta keep in mind that we have really basic information about /dozens/ more. HP is so fantastically designed for fanfiction it almost feels intentional sometimes. There's so many characters that are functionally blank slates it's absurd.
