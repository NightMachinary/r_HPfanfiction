After Sirius death and Dumbledore's visit to take him to Slughorn, Harry is fed up with the Dursleys and decides to spend the rest of the holidays in Grimmauld place. There he goes through the stuff he has inherited. He finds books and heirlooms and roams the streets of London in his free time. Harry also finds Sirius' vinyls from the 70's and his old clothes, leather jackets and band shirts and stuff.

With people pressuring him to return to the Dursleys at every occasional visit, a dark Lord planning to kill him and Fudge trying to pull him on his side after calling him a liar for a whole year, Harry decides that the Establishment can go fuck itself and he emerges from Grimmauld place as a full fleged punk to face his 6th year in school.


** So not to take anything away from this but you have two different years happening at the same time in this prompt. Slughirn happens in year 6 and the ministry calls harry a liar in year 5. That being said though this is an amazing prompt and if I wasnt in the middle of a project I would totally try my hand at this

*** Ah damn you are right. I'll edit it. Thank you. Though I wouldn't be mad if someone wrote the whole thing with Sirius still alive and introducing Harry to Punk

** The scene at the beginning of the Half blood prince where Harry is not wearing his school uniform just became 200% funnier. Imagine Snape when Harry shows up as punk.

*** Snape: "Why are you not wearing your Uniform Potter? 5 points from Gryffindor"

Harry - even wilder hair - Potter: "I will no longer conform to your stupid social constraints"

/flips Snape the bird/

Though for real I didn't even think of it before but you mentioned it.The thought is hilarious.

**** Well, he's certainly not James anymore. No, he became something far more terrifying. He became Sirius. Have fun, Snape. Or rather, good luck.

** Maybe have a few scenes of Harry listening to the old Vinyls with Sirius during his time at Grimmold Place. Something they do together to bond , so Harry finds Solace in the music after Sirius dies, as a means to still feel connected to his godfather. I can kid of picture Harry, grieving, angry,and Frustrated going in Sirius' old room and slamming the door getting Tonks to magically lock it for him. And just sitting for hour listening to the Ramones and The Clash , Trying to process his grief.

*** Yeah, though imagine Harry already turns Punk during his 5th year when Sirius is still alive. Snape would be soo done while Sirius would cheer him on

** I have a really weird feeling like I read some punk!Harry at some point in life. Maybe I imagined it? Harry in leather jacket makes so much sense somehow. And listening to music, maybe he had a walkman in one fanfiction? Idk.

*** Check out the A Very Slytherin Harry series on ao3, specifically Pyrite.

Snape is the ex-punk, he lets Harry listen to his music and gives Harry a walkman for Christmas. Harry even steals Snape's old bandshirts and jacket later.
