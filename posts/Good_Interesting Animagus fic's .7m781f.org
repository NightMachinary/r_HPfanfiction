I'd like some that revolve/focus around the Animagus form and maybe incoorporate it into the relationship(ok i think i need to clarify,- not strictly in a sexual way.... like both are animagi... ;p) too. those that i have digested thus far that focus on those points, atleast methinks? are:

- Vox Corporis
- The Accidental Animagus

im looking for similar fics!

bonus points are

- long
- romance
- does not shy away from lime/smut (if it doesnt focus too much on it, its just a natural part of relationships)
- good writing style


** No romance or smut, but focuses heavily on the animagus forms.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11171435/1/The-Secret-Life-of-a-Black-Dog][THIS]] is mine so I'm not objective enough to know if it's good, but the animagus aspect is pretty important. It's a Sirius/OC romance and not particularly long, but it is complete.

** I don't read a lot of long fics where an animagus form is integral to the story. linkffn(4942221), linkffn(2869358), linkfnn(4447256), linkffn(9406877) are four that immediately came to mind, but please keep in mind the year they were written. lol I can't guarantee how well written they are, but at the time (come on, 6 years ago...), I liked them enough to add them so... (sorry if Harry/Draco isn't your cup of tea.)

linkffn(12618429), linkffn(10884162), and linkffn(11585513) are a bit more recent. linkao3(3177607) isn't really animagus... per se.... it's very interesting, though. Unfortunately incomplete.

Hopefully that gives you some options. Sorry if not. I'll be the first to admit I have low standards since I've read so many (at this point all i want is new stories to read lmao).

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

** Twice in a row, linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) is a good answer.

Sirius escapes from Azkaban early and takes Harry in. Eventually (and keep in mind that this is a long, long fic, with multiple sequels, and is still a WIP) Harry becomes an animagus under Sirius' tutelage.

Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the lady thief by starfox5) is a good one where Hermione becomes an animagus.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
