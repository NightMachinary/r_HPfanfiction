Does anyone read any fics with OCs that are one of the MCs or the only MC? I was thinking I might start reading some but wondered how people generally felt about them. Thanks!


** I love a well written OC.

Thing is I love seeing the Harry Potter world itself, not just the characters from the books. I love stories that delve into the world's past and future, explore different cultures, and so on. And, a lot of the time that only makes sense with OCs being at least heavily involved.

I also just prefer OCs over supposedly canon characters that, to me, feel like OCs.

** I prefer OCs that are excellent secondary characters who assist the main characters BUT don't become main characters that overshadow the main canon ones. I don't mind a super-Auror that trains Harry and the others - but not if he/she is the one that leads the missions against the Death Eaters or fights Voldemort until he runs away scared. There's an excellent lawyer OC in several HP fics - Mercy Fuller, I think - and I like her because she illustrates different sides of the canon characters without drowning them out.

There's enough room for OCs, yes - just remember the reason we're reading fanfic and know that HPs the reason we're here. Of course, this means that there are several excellent exceptions that prove the rule, and we should tell everyone when we find those exceptions. 🙂

** Highly, highly recommend many of these even if they don't reach the same popularity as Harry-centric stuff.

Alexandra Quick is my favorite fic and probably has some of the best writing and most imaginative worldbuilding expansion of any fanfic out there.

Slide's two series both have fantastic characters and writing, and are amazingly well-constructed. They're both complete.

Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake is a hidden gem among hidden gems. It deserves a thousand times the views it has.

** My gut instinct was to say I dislike them, but I realised that plenty of fics that I have liked have featured OC's as a main character, such as Theia Higgle in The Aurors linkffn (11815544).

What I think it is is that I associate the term OC with the badly written example, the self inserts and Mary Sue's, but if the character is well written and their place in the story makes sense, I dont really think of them as OC despite being exactly what they are.

** Are we referring to real original characters or pseudo-original characters? (By this I refer to the non-mentioned original 40, underdeveloped names within the HP universe, etc.)

Certainly, fanon has allowed for the development of specific 'personalities' and 'traits' to become associated with individuals, however, not all of them receive development to actually turn them into a character.

My personal opinion is that if an original character is well constructed, realistic, etc. then such fanfics will tend to return more favorable results.

** Depends on the fic. Generally, an OC is good if there's a reason to have them and they don't overshadow everything else by virtue of their very existence. There are a few really, really good OC fics where the character has a purpose to exist and that purpose plays a genuine part in the story.

In all the stories below, the OC is a distinct character with a distinct role in the story. Deuteragonist roles too, so they're actually important to the story. They affect and effect things, but they don't control them. I'd say Behind Blue Eyes (warning for utter bleakness of plot and narrative) and Grow Young With Me are probably the two best examples of how to do an OC right.
