So I am interested in reading a story with saner, but not good Voldemort. Like usually he is portrayed having followers, because they are all psychos who are happy to kill and torture or at least are somewhat ok with that. I want to read about Voldemort, who is brilliant evil mastermind who is even loved among his followers, who is smarter than simply killing and torturing muggleborns or his followers for that matter, and genuinely believes he is improving magical society. So that even a lot of normal people are deceived and some support him as a strong leader or something like that. Kind of like magical Putin :)

It's interesting to see how Harry or Dumbledore can counter him, when it's not that obvious to people that he is an evil guy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Voldemort has maneuvered himself into a strategically very advantageous position, and it's Harry who now has the reputation close to a dark lord.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12769659/1/Nymphadora-Tonks-The-Last-Auror][Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror]], linkffn(12212363;12769659): I would say Voldemort is quite sane in this series and has successfully brought most of Magical Britain under his banner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de Sangre]], linkffn(11752324): Female Voldemort has basically brought Harry to her side. Although the story ends on a cliff hanger, a sequel is in sight.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Voldemort almost won despite a very competent Dumbledore and fairly reasonable Ministry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853): Voldemort won, killed half of the good guys and corrupted the other half.

**** My take on "Emperor":

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.
- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- This Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. He was quite bloodthirsty and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications a few times.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2024.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military environments. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of new circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Ellie, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  The Statue of Secrecy has fallen. Voldemort has returned, and with the backing of the Ministry of Magic has declared war on the Muggle world. Dumbledore has been defeated and is retreating into hiding. Out of the entire Auror Corps, one woman is making a stand.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight), features a much saner, very different Voldemort. The story focuses on politics and worldbuilding, and has multiple points of view. Voldemort isn't a highly featured character yet, but he will be in volumes three and four.
