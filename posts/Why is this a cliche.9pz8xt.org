I've read many fics over the years, and in most Harry is described as short, but he's not. Sure, he's shorter than Ron but Ron himself is described as fairly tall. I'm deathly hallows I'm pretty sure Harry was the same height as James, so if anything he's taller than he should be(at 17).


** Authors sometimes depict Harry as short when they want to show that the Dursleys' abuse had noticeable long term effects.

*** He is notably shorter in the first few books, PS is quite explicit in that regard (and that it is in fact the Dursley abuse).

And there is little reason for Harry to grow out of it. He is not getting any medication or supplements, his meals are not consistent (summers at Privet Drive, the hunt) and Hogwarts does not have a balanced diet (eg salad or fruits aren't mentioned). Yes, people can grow out of their childhood malnutrition, but probably not with what Harry got. Hogwarts certainly lessened the effects, but it should not be enough to completely counteract a decad of malnutrition with daily rations as low as 500 kcal (as seen in CoS).

**** Isn't he supposed to be described as "as tall as Ron" later in the books by Molly?

Edit: Book 6. Molly says he's grown "just like Ron." Granted, my books are on Spanish, so it may be different in English.

Edit 2: And I think Hermione says he's grown a foot compared to last year.

***** I think what she meant was he has grown as much as Ron has, not to the same height as Ron.

** Because Daniel Radcliffe [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9j2wmu/harry_with_his_girls/?st=JNI4RK0G&sh=9a700684][is short]]

*** Admittedly it doesn't help that both Bonnie and Emma are wearing high heels, thereby making him look even shorter.

** Pretty much what the posters above said.

I'd add that it /isn't/ a cliche until Harry reaches about 16 or so. I believe that he was regularly described as 'scrawny' and 'short' in the early books. I recall that Hermione comments on him becoming "more fanciable" or the like in HBP, though I can't recall if he's hit his growth spurt yet at that point.

*** The line is “And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either” (HBP Chapter 11). Harry is also described as being the same height as James in Snape's worst memory, and James was described as tall in the Mirror of Erised. However, Harry is only described as short only once, in POA, and that may have just been to distinguish him from adult Sirius ("[Harry] had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man," Chapter 17), and never as scrawny.

**** Thanks for that! Thinking back, I think I must have been remembering a line from movie 7 (doesn't one of the twins call him a scrawy, specky git?) In either case, that's just the movies. I must have made up my own head canon about it.

***** No, that's a line from the books and I had totally forgotten about it! Fred said “Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever,” during DH (Chapter 4), so I have to amend my previous statement to Harry being described as scrawny once, my bad. But I don't think "scrawny" really says anything about Harry's height, just that he's skinny.

** It's because the general consensus in fanon in that harry was abused horribly in his formative years, so his bones are under developed. Ie. He's short.

** There was a thread on the main HP sub on this topic which pretty well estimated Harry's actual Hight.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/452di8/how_tall_are_harry_and_the_other_characters/]]

TLDR In the Half-Blood Prince Harry is about 5"9, Hermione is about 5"6, and Ron is about 6"2. Hermione told Harry that he grew about a foot in the summer between fifth and sixth year (she was probably exaggerating) which means that Harry was fairly short for most of the series, and average hight by the time he is 16/17 year old.
