[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10814626/1/A-Fresh-Bouquet][A Fresh Bouquet]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2221413/Tsume-Yuki][Tsume Yuki]] My favourite SI/OC (self insert original character) fic for Harry Potter that I've read that this point in time. The main character is Lily Evans sister, and a Hufflepuff. WIP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer][Trimphant, the Dreamer]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1313690/Shadowblayze][Shadowblayze]] Not my favourite, but a very popular SI/OC fic. The main character is Harry Potter's twin sister, Heather Potter. The fic spends a serious amount of time at the Dursleys, which put me off a bit. WIP

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/NonchalantxFish/pseuds/NonchalantxFish/works][NonchalantxFish]] I found the main character way over powered but it was still quite entertaining. Main character is Ginny Weasley's twin sister. WIP (updates weekly)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/922715/Slayer-Anderson][Slayer Anderson]] A fun to read, but rather Mary Sue-ish main character. (That can also be attributed to the SI part though.) Main character is Draco Malfoy's younger sister. Abandoned

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3909547/Publicola][Publicola]] I don't think I've read this work. The main character is Gilderoy Lockhart. Tentatively Abandoned (Last Updated 2015)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807][Faith and the Devil]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Tozette/works][Lapsed Pacifist/Tozette]] I love this author, so I'm really not a reliable judge here. Main character is Draco Malfoy's older sister. WIP? (Last updated early 2017)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2748992][No Gryffindor]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Nia_River/pseuds/Nia_River/works][Nia_River]] My favourite SI Harry Potter one shot. Main character is Lavender Brown. Complete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9143581][Hold Me Tight and Don't Let Go]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thefirecrest/pseuds/thefirecrest/works][thefirecrest]] I know I've read this... I think I liked it? Main character is Dudley Dursley. WIP? (Last updated early 2017)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5143445][Stars in Silence]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Nariel/pseuds/Nariel/works][Nariel]] I haven't read this one. Main character is Sirius Black's twin sister. WIP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4024547/butalearner][butalearner]] It gets a lot better than the first chapter suggests. Main character is an American muggle who (literally) stumbled into Platform 9 and 3/4 and is suddenly a wizard... named Bud A. Lerner. Complete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15070124][Accio Butterflies]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tearlessNevermore/pseuds/tearlessNevermore][tearlessNevermore]] Self insert OC as an orphan several years older than Harry who knows canon and wants to take the most direct route to fix it. Spans from the OC (a non-binary character named Poe) starting at Hogwarts until the death of Voldemort, in non-chronological order. Complete

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12136589/1/fish-hooks-in-the-corners-of-their-mouths][fish hooks in the corners of their mouths]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4668065/deletrear][deletrear]] Self insert OC as Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa's sister. Abandoned, but over 100k

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks.

*** Originally it meant what it said on the tin: yourself, inserted into the story of choice. Over time it's developed to be short hand meaning someone from this world, put into a fictional world of your choice.

SI/OC means that 'your' character is in a new person, while you can also have a 'Canon SI' where 'your' character goes into the body of a pre-existing character, such as Hermione.

** Tozette has also written [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][a Lockhart SI oneshot]]; the main character wakes up in Gilderoy Lockhart's (beautiful, beautiful) body and promptly decides to do the reasonable thing and fake their own death. Complete, obviously, given that it's a oneshot and all.\\
Also, it's not quite a self-insert, given that the main character is not the author's avatar but rather a character from a different series, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]] fits the template of 'Character from another world wakes up in canon character's body' if you're only concerned with general premise. WIP but it's 221k so that won't be bothering you for a long while.

  This is the story of a person who died. It's OK though, he got better. Through some kind of cosmic coincidence he wakes up in the body of an 11 year old Severus Snape. What would someone in his position, with knowledge of the future and what can be accomplished with magic do? Liberally abuse it and live like a king of course! Snape!Harem SI-OC as Snape NO SLASH.
