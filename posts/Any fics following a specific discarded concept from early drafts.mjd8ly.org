So, yesterday on the Harry Potter Wiki, I made quite a shocking discovery. Some of you perhaps are already familiar with it, however I was not.

Evidently, in the earliest draft of Philosopher's Stone, the Potters lived on an island, and the Grangers lived on the shore nearby. When Voldemort kills James and Lily, Hermione's father notices an explosion. So he gets in his boat, rows out to the island to see what happened, and finds baby Harry.

A personal thought of mine feels that he would instead own a small motorboat since the Grangers are supposed to be well off... I think.

Just imagine how different the whole franchise could've been on this alone if Rowling stuck with it. I'm intrigued.

Does anyone know if any fics exist that follow this premise? Because I sure as hell would like to see them. Hermione and Harry growing up together in every sense of the word feels so... adorable.


** Yeah there's some interesting stuff on the cutting room floor, like Vernon being a Member of Parliament. You can kinda still see the traces of that idea - the paranoia about how his family is perceived by the public, the fact that he attended a public school and is sending Dudley to the same school. But it's then been mixed with a more "working class" aspect, living on an estate, reading the Daily Mail, etc. So you're left with a kind of hybrid caricature of the worst, most stereotypical aspects of both the upper and working class.

*** They don't live on an estate

In any case, the Dursleys that appeared in the books are neither upper nor lower class. They're clearly designed as middle class social climbers. I think you'll find that all their behaviour fits that stereotype

**** I remember reading some interviews (I think? Can anyone corroborate this?) that she was meant to be incredibly ambitious and ruthlessly clever. Even better than Hermione in some cases and this was meant to be a character development for Hermione to realise that she can't always be the best + give Slytherin some spotlight.

***** Interesting. I see her as having a chip on her shoulder the size of the rock of Gibraltar, and a burning desire to prove that she's just as deserving of being there, if not more so than those with an unbroken wizarding lineage. Likely something she developed after a year or two at Hogwarts, having to listen to the taunts from people like Malfoy (possibly even him specifically if/when he learns of her rather direct relation to the Weasleys) given the fact of her father being a Squib, and the doubts that she's even a quote-unquote "real" witch because of it.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
