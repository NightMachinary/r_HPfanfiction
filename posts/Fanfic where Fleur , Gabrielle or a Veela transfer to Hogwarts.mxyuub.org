I'm really interested in Veela's going to Hogwarts How would they be received? What will their difficulties be?

NO VEELA DRACO OR HERMIONE OR HARRY


** I have a part Veela girl and my oc is part Veela from a line of famous French Veela in my series and it covers a bit more with the Beauxbatons girls during the the gof year. But it's a bit of a read to get there and it's not the main point of the fic. But I put in the story that there is makeup and lotions and perfumes that help to muffle the Veela allure, especially when pregnant, I have a head cannon that they tend to glimmer a bit while pregnant

(It has Hermione in it but she isn't veela. I hope that's what you meant by the restriction)

  Fleur didn't even need more than two months in that damn castle to realize that she didn't like in Hogwarts. She quickly learned that the British were not tolerant of diversity. The people here were stiff and judgmental and prejudiced. What did she expect though? This was a school that intentionally dichotomized the school population and perpetuated stereotypes and intransigence under the illusion of the so-called “house pride”.  or“It seems that I am the official welcoming committee” the brunette joked glancing at the duo on the other side of the room that seemed to live in a separate dimension.Fleur glanced at them and her lips tugged.The brunette, encouraged by the other girl's reaction introduced herself enthusiastically.“Hermione Granger. Pleased to meet you.”Fleur grasped the offered hand and replied.“Likewise. Fleur Delacour.”
