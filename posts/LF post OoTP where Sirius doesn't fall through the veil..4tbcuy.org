Wanting lots of politics, trials clearing his name, etc. Also would like I include a love interest for Sirius. Remus and him rekindling their friendship and Remus and Tonks getting together.

Preferably novel length and rated M cause I like my smut. Ta!


** I just finished a great one but its pre/during GoF where Sirius takes up the Lord Black, raises Harry, and otherwise causes all kinds of bad ass things. Besides it not being post OotP its what you're asking for, except no love interest for Sirius or smut. It is an excellent read though. Lots of awesome political shenanigans.

*** I am so happy I only found it towards the tail end of the writing process. That way I only had to wait like a month for it to finish. A good fic that works a lot with family magicks and lots of oaths.

** Linkffn(impose by marauderlover7) is actually pre PS/SS--sirius breaks out of Azkaban early. Other than that i think it ticks the other boxes. It's SUPER long - one book for the pre-hogwarts stuff, and another for each of Harry's year after, with an equal focus to Sirius and harry, and more focus on a bunch of other characters. The author is now on GoF, updates often and the complete fic is close to a million word mark.

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

**** Yeah, that one's the longest because it covers three or four years. This is definitely one of those fics where I wish I could convince the author to kill their darlings and focus on one specific character so 1 million words got us a little farther in terms of development. I like the sirius and harry bits, but the character I really love is gryffindor!draco.

** What if he falls through the veil but yet ends up alive somehow due to what the veil actually does?

I dont know of a story that exactly fits your criteria like that, but it was just an interesting thought as i read your request. Perhaps others may know though.
