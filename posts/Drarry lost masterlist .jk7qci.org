:FlairText: Where's That Fic?
:END:
I realize getting drarry fic recs is really easy, but I am looking for a very specific masterlist that I just cannot find. It is my favorite. SO I don't know the name but it used to have a pastel pink background and then it was light grey and it has a cute drarry icon thats "chibi" style. It has an entire breakdown of fic rec lists including this like "rentboy!draco" but also one thats like "drarry+ginny and the wealseys" .... if anyone knows what I'm talking about please tag it !


** [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] is more hospitable to these requests
