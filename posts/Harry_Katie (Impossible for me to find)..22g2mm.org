** There's some very brief H/K in the Psychic Serpent trilogy, but that one goes H/G eventually. The H/K was really good while it lasted though.

** If you can locate a copy of VINCET (and sequel) by nos tres reges, this is probably the best story I know of that pairing. (The trio of authors recently took down all their stories, but you might find it archived somewhere.)

I don't particularly care for the author (who has written a million words rehashing the same basic plot over and over), but MK-ONE's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10015981/1/West-of-Here][West of Here]] also claims to be HP/KB.

**** I agree; a sad day for the fandom.

I've communicated with the author who took down the stories. While there's a bit more to it than this (and I'm not sure he'd wish for me to share details in a public forum anyway), the crux of it is that he was ready to move on.

*** That's really unfortunate about the authors taking down their stuff. Sometimes the quality stuff disappears and it's rather disappointing. But, on the contrary, I absolutely love West of Here and can't wait till the next update!

Ugh, MK-ONE's work actually hurts my soul. Not only is his writing mediocre at best, but you're definitely right about his rehash of the same idea over and over again. In terms of fanfiction, he's definitely in the top 10%, but that really isn't saying much.

Honestly, once you've read one of his fics, you might as well just forget the rest of his stuff.

One could make the same argument with regards to most of HP fanfiction. :-)

I've not read all of MK-ONE's stories (I tend to avoid HP/GW). I recently reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7560048/1/From-the-Shadows][From the shadows]], and I think it decently written. Just keep in mind it is Super!Harry. A few days ago, I tried reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7927023/1/Half-Alive-Half-Dead][Half Alive Half Dead]] and it has its moments but isn't well written, and stopped after a few chapters. Next I tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][Vengeance from the grave]], and it is so poorly written I was contemplating asking him if it he allowed someone else use his account to post the story. Wanting to try a HP/KB, I decided to give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10015981/1/West-of-Here][West of Here]] a try. It is another Super!Harry, but (I think) it is well written, and I've followed it.

**** Yeah I have to agree with you, it's hard liking a less popular pairing when fics that have it are either one shots, abandoned, too short, or a combination of all three, but I'll be damned if I don't find my self looking for new ones

** Have you tried searching [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=1&c2=848][FF.net]]? There are a few listed there. Not sure how good any of them are. I know how frustrating it is to want to be able to read fics of a pairing with a small fan base. Good luck!

**** [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Here's]] a better way to search FF.net. My advice when looking for distinct pairings is just search the characters (not using using the romance tag, as many authors who write those kind of romances have them as subplots, and will use different tags). Start with stories with 100k+ words, and slowly work your way down the word count as you look for fics that fit your standards.
