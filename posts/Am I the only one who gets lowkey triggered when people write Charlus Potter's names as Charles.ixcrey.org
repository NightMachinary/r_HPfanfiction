Because, like, whenever I come across someone using the wrong name for any character, not just Charlus, it triggers me a little and makes me swear at the author a little in my head. I've literally read a fic where they kept saying that Angelina's name as Angeline and the subtle difference was really annoying me.

***** How so? Going by cannon only the extreme pureblood families do this. According to pottermore the potters are mainly descended from potters and peverells married into the family. And harry is basically the middle English form of Henry anyways, so there is no point in making it a short form of anything. And going by Hp fandom wiki, Harry is named after his great grand father, Henry potter irrc. And the potters were never a noble or titled family.

Besides in these Harry comes across as a bit of snob. Tbh my head cannon is that Harry grew in such away that he did not want to act in any way like dursleys, hence why he is so uncomfortable talking about any thing that goes down except for his friends, not taking the trauma associated with it. So I think in the whole inheritance trope he would feel really uncomfortable and not really tell anyone nevertheless changing his name to something like Harry James Potter-Black-Peverell-Griffindor.

And even that's unrealistic, as going by the rites of succession as Iolanthe Peverell married into the potter family so she had no right to gain any inheritance from her family except for her dowry (this was in like 1200 ad or something) including the name. Peverell family had no male heirs from Ignotius Peverell's line and Cadmus Peverell's line ended with the gaunt family which I assume was married into as well as they would have kept the Peverell name given how big bunch of bigot and snobs they were. It just turns me away from the fic if they do this sort of thing. Seems like a cheat code to get resources and a cheap way to start bashing characters.

TL;DR : Harry is already a pure blood name and the whole multiple inheritance thing is unrealistic.

******* Harrison isn't really very popular in England as a first name...nowhere near the popularity it has in America. “Harry” in England pretty much tends to be short for Henry (most common), Harold (less common), or just a name in and of itself that's not short for anything.

*** Such as Harrison or Hadrian? I don't mind in certain instances. Like, if you're going full pureblood politics in which you announce Name, Heir to House Surname, then I don't mind all too much. Because "Harrison, Heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter" sounds a little better than "Harry, Heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter." Just not Hadrian for Harry, though. I'll only accept that if it's Hadrian Peverell for a time travel/cross dimension fic. Harrison I don't mind all too much since Harry is a shortening of it and you could spin it so no one actually knew Harry's first name was actually Harrison. I read a fic where it did that and Harry's name was actually Harrison James Evans-Potter and Dumbledore only heard them refer to him as Harry James and he needed to put his name down. The fic was linkao3(Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet) if you wanted to check it out. I might be wrong on the name aspect but I think I got it correct.

  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life.

*** I personally don't mind Charlus as Harry's grandfather even though it's not canonically correct. It just helps if you're doing a fic where Harry is the heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black and he needs a legitimate claim via blood relation. It's also because I find the names "Euphemia" and "Fleamont" stupid.

** I recently had a similar problem with a character's nickname. It was a Slytherin! Harry fanfic where, during the first night, Blaise and Draco were talking to a "Teddy". I was really confused at first and thought of a OC until the character introduced himself as "Teddy Nott".

Also, while it's still a bit annoying, I am a lot less triggered by people who just forgot to translate a name from their mother's tongue compared to people who just write a name wrong (like in French, Draco is Drago, Blaise is Blaize and Kreacher is Kreature . . .).

**** Without being a matter of preference,I'm not even sure you can actually do that. I know that English has some stranges rules when it comes to shortening names (William turns into Bill, Edward into Ted or Teddy . . .), but these rules exist and I never heard of Theodore being turned into anything else than Theo.

So, I may be wrong, but I think you can't shorten a Theodore into Teddy the same way you can't shorten Ronald into Bob.
