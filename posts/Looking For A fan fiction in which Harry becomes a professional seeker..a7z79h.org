One of my favorite stories and imo the direct antithesis to Hope by jeconais. So reading one right after the other is an interesting experience.

Edit: Seems like bot is slow so I'll link it here [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus]]

**** Agreed, but I will say that my re-reads of Hope have left a bad taste in my mouth. Gabrielle becomes too much like a sex doll in that one for my taste. I understand that is the whole plot, as in she doesn't have control over her feelings, but I just feel weird reading it.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]] starts with Harry as a professional Quiditch player. It's not focused on quiditch, but there's a fair amount of quiditch content (albeit most not professional). Harry/Gabrielle

#+begin_quote
  A new Dark Lord, cunning and patient, begins to move. A family of heroes, loving, crying, living and dying, goes about their lives. Revenge by those thought wronged is sought. Danger seems everywhere. Amidst it all a plot conceived more than five millennial prior unfolds. A plan so insidious the Gods themselves seek to influence the outcome.
