Having recently rewatched /Fantastic Beasts/ i was struck by the undetectable extension charm in the suitcase. I've read plenty of fics where that charm was abused out the wazoo, and a few others where it was more limited, but was curious what you think. Is the charm overpowered and is it overused in fanfics, underutilized, or appropriately used?


** Way overutilized. It felt like it was in every fic written between 2003 and 2011. The super!trunk is one of the worst cliches in the entire fandom.

** I always used to read fics where Harry owned a library that was inside his trunk that he bought at a bargain. I always went "Ridiculous"

But for some reason, I was perfectly fine with Fantastic Beasts. So, I don't know why but I am okay with it.

**** But then the problem aren't the trunks.

+The problem is Vegeta+

The problem is that the Trunks are usually asociated with power wank fics. The trunks by themselves are fine.

*** I think it's to serve a purpose to the plot that isn't just, "look at my new shiny toy! Aren't I cool?" Newt has that case for a specific purpose and it is used so that it's present, but not overwhelmingly so. A solid balance.

*** I feel this way too. I was perfectly fine with something like a single big space, but the idea of having whole flipping apartments inside a trunk felt strange. But gigantic landscapes for beautiful animals? Absolutely. Belief suspended.

**** How is an apartment harder to suspend disbelief for than a single large space? Take your single large space and put up some studwork-and-plasterboard partitions, magical plumbing where necessary, add furniture and voila! Apartment in your trunk.

Or have a big landscape like Mr. Scamander's, and build a house on it. Once you're creating space with an arbitrarily-portable portal object, you're limited by the skill of the enchanter you hire to build it and your budget as to what you put inside.

In the original seven books, internal spaces seemed to be limited to tents, bags of holding and that one trunk of Moody's; I just sort of assumed that there were other uses of the technique happening all over the place off-stage, because it's so /enormously/ useful. One assumes it's limited by the working hours of wizards skilled enough to make such things, but other than that it'd be like the wizarding world's version of microchips, they'd use it in /everything/.

***** Apparently the Ministry has to approve such things (as with Apparition) because of how obviously easy it would be to abuse it.

****** All clown cars have Undetectable Expansion Charms, isn't it obvious?

Also, the Phone Booth Challenge is a joke to wizards.
