Someone did the same in the Naruto Fanfiction sub, so I thought I'd try it here. I'll try to write something for all the prompts you might post.


** Harry bashing fic. Just have Albus rant at Harry in the same self-righteous way that Harry often rants at Albus in fanfic.

Also, has this been done before?

** I got another one; subvert the usual trope of snakes hurrying to do a Parselmouth's bidding.

Instead of being awed at a Speaker's talent, they're infuriated and seek to destroy any human who profanes their sacred tongue.

Conjured snakes are bound to the will of their summoner and have no free will of their own, while the Basilisk is magically bound to obey descendants of Slytherin (grudgingly), but the rest, whew...start with the snake in the zoo (in Philosopher's Stone) having a practical seizure and trying to smash the glass when Harry talks to him, then go from there.

I mean, Xeno doesn't seem like the type, and I think before her mothers death she would have been too young. And yes, Hogwarts has flying lessons, but there's flying for transport and flying for fun.

** Leon the Professional crossover. Harry replaces Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and is taken in and then trained by Leon to be an assassin. At the end of what would have been the movie Harry goes through the wall at 9 3/4 holding the plant on his way to Hogwarts with new skills and a new outlook.\\

Or the movie stays the same but at the end Mathilda receives a letter and goes through the wall at 9 3/4 holding her plant and meets up with Harry on the train and later teaches him what Leon taught her. This version making it possible to have Harry and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) snogging.
