The fanfiction I am looking for features a reborn Harry Potter. He is born to a mixed-race couple (black father, white mother) and they are quite afraid of his magic. He is a Slytherin, graduates Hogwarts around the time Tom Riddle is 4-5 years old and then adopts the little Tom. HP starts working in a bookstore in Hogsmeade.

Dumbledore starts visiting the shop every now and then.

Thats all I remember of the content.

I tried finding it through google, but ... well. I had no success.

Hope one of you can help me find it.
