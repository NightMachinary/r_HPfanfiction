Hello everyone!! So I read All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 on AO3 a few months ago and it has completely taken over my life (it was my first ever marauders fic I've read, even the first fic I read!). I've been branching out and I read a few other fics (but they all were inspired by ATYD lol). I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a girls POV of ATYD or something similar? Im looking for a fic that goes through the 1-7 Hogwarts years, it can go past it too, but following the girls from the marauders era. Any suggestions?

(preferably w jily, wolfstar, dorlene)


** In the Language of Flowers by dwellingondreams is a wonderful take on the Marauders' Era. It is an AU story that follows Petunia Evans (she is the witch, Lily is the muggle, and it is brilliant) through her school years and beyond. There is no wolfstar, but there is some well done jily. I loved the way Lily was portrayed in this story, along with the rest of the ladies from that time period - Mary and Marlene feature heavily. It's a great sister story, too. It is complete, and, while much shorter than ATYD, I can't recommend it enough.
