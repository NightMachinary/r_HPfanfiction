I prefer OC stories I'll admit. My favorite are honestly the ones that give any of the main characters (tho especially Harry) a sibling, throw a bunch of rivalry in there, and see what happens. Usually they end up being loving regardless, not the best to get along with, but they love each other. That's great! However, I'm really craving some angst, some big fat family angst and drama. The sister doesn't have to be a full DE, she could just end up choosing Vold's side for a bit (either because she spiralled or got involved with the wrong crowd or just hates Harry that much at one point), but fighting against her brother and the good guys is the goal. Ideally, she'd realize she made the wrong choice (like Regulus) and go back over to them and make efforts to atone for her actions is what I'm looking for. I really want to see characters confronted with that big bad family drama and reckoning with their past actions.


** Doesn't have to be super long, though I generally don't like one-shots as much as fuller stories, any help is appreciated! Even if it's just twins with a real bad relationship and lots of resentment.

** Would you be interested in one about James Potter and his Slytherin Death Eater sister? She is close with Regulus and has the same kind of arc he does, regarding loyalty or lack thereof to Voldemort. Plus, she is the Slytherin version of Sirius, going to the "wrong" house and suffering her famiy's wrath.\\

  James and Emma Potter are twins - inseparable. They have their Hogwarts years planned out from the start, including the House: "Gryffindor, where the brave dwell at heart!" But what happens when the impossible comes true? Standing on opposite sides of the war, the twins realise that not everything is as black and white as it seems as the battlelines seem to blur...

*** think i replied to the bot there, but yes! that sounds exactly like what I'm looking for! Anything that showcases the pressure slytherin kids can be under while also having a real rocky relationship between siblings. Those are the OC family fics I love the most.
