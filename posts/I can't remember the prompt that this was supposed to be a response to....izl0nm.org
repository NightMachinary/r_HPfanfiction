"Welcome back Mr. Potter. Cocked it up again I see."

Harry stared at the figure seated across from him. Or rather the outline of a figure, hidden in shadows. Only a pair of immaculately manicured hands were clearly visible, steepled atop the round table separating him from the shadowy figure.

"Pardon?" Harry asked, "I don't understand."

"Of course not," the figure replied lightly. He thought it's voice sounded feminine, "So let's get straight to the point. You're dead."

"Dead!?" he shouted, "I think I'd remember dying! The last thing I remember is catching the snitch and winning the Quidditch Cup!"

"Catching the snitch mid-freefall, I believe," the figure replied, clearly amused. "One of your less auspicious endings, I must say. Don't they teach the featherlight charm at Hogwarts?"

"What's that supposed to mean!? What about my friends!? What about Voldemort!?" Harry cried out. This had to be a joke. One of the twins was having him on, that had to be it.

The two pranksters had joked for ages that his...tactics as Seeker would get him killed eventually. Now they were trying to prove the point.

Yes, that had to be what was going on.

"That's not what's going on, I'm afraid."

Harry slumped forward in his chair, burying his face in his hands. Of course he was really dead. His life could never be simple. Now he'd left his friends, left the entire world, to Voldemort's non-existent mercy.

“But fret not,” she continued, a smile evident in her voice, even as her face remained cloaked in shadow, “I've been authorized to make you an offer. You can go back.”

Harry's head snapped up.

“Go back?”

“Go back. And you'll even be granted a boon. Something to help you complete your task.” The figure leaned forward, whispering, “We've been concerned about your Dark Lord for a long time. His...experiments saw to that.”

“So you'll let me go back and give me the power to stop him? Power--”\\
“The Dark Lord Knows Not. Precisely.” The figure leaned back, and pulled a small object from the folds of her shadowy robes.\\
“You don't just get whatever power you want, of course. You have to make a choice.” Harry jumped as a deck of cards slapped onto the table in front of him.

“And you won't know what the power is either, not until it manifests,” With an elegant wave of her hand the cards began to divide themselves into two piles, one significantly larger than the other.

“As you can see, you've taken advantage of this offer a few times before...” she tapped the larger pile with her long, pale index finger, “You're King of Hearts attempt was quite something. All those broken hearts...”

She picked up the smaller pile, riffling the cards with ease, then spreading them out in an arc in front of her, face down.

“You've had thirty-three tries,” she said, gesturing to the cards, “so you have twenty to pick from.”

“Twenty?” Harry asked, reaching for a card. He hadn't played cards much, but something about that math didn't seem quite right.

“That's what I said, isn't it,” the figure, the dealer replied, clearly enjoying herself, “Now lets see it.” She gestured to the card.

Harry flipped over his card, revealing a grinning clown surrounded by a heart, stave, club, and diamond.

With a jolt Harry's chair disappeared out from under him. But instead of hitting the floor he seemed to fall for ages before finally landing on his back.

His head was still spinning when he heard a shout from above him, “Keep that racket down boy, or it'll be no food for a month!”


** Okay, there's DEFINITELY a fix that has Harry trying to fix things like 12 different times before death or whoever gets frustrated and lets him keep his memories but I have no idea what it's called.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
