As the flair says, I'm here to promote myself. Here is the synopsis to the first book in the Lucy Hazelton series.

"Contrary to popular belief, Crabbe and Goyle weren't Draco Malfoy's best friends. That was Lucy's job.

Lucy Hazelton, daughter of Reuel and Doris Hazelton, has grown up believing that muggleborns are inferior to purebloods. Thus, it was only natural that she befriended one of the most prejudiced purebloods at Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy.

When the Triwizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts, presenting the school with a new perspective on education, Lucy finds herself caught between her house and her heart as she begins paying special attention to her sworn enemy, Harry Potter.

As her feeling for Cedric Diggory begin to wax and wane, Lucy finds that someone is attempting to penetrate her mind with visions from the future.

Can Lucy figure out her tricky situation in time for the inevitable events of the third task, or will she let the third task define her situation?"
