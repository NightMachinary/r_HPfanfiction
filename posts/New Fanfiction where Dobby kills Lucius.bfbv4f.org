Hello all, i recently saw a prompt on this thread posted by [[https://www.reddit.com/user/LittenInAScarf][u/LittenInAScarf]] about what would happen if Dobby had (unwillingly) killed Lucius when he shouted "you will not harm Harry Potter". I thought this was an interesting idea and wanted to work on this as it hasn't been made a thing. The first chapter is posted and i will attach a link to it. Its under the name Ock8.
