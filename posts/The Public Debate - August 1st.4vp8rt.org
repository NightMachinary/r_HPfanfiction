** Against:

Based from the Slytherin Welcome Message from Pottermore, I'm pretty certain that's not the case. Also 'always'? really? Come on now. In terms of chance and probability, that's barely probable at all.

(Also, it is also rather difficult as to how one would consider a wizard to be Dark or Light simply through the spells they use, which in my opinion makes this entire argument moot but as we assume a Dark wizard would be a villain of sorts as portrayed in the story, then no. Slytherin House will indeed not always be full of dark wizards and I'll continue explaining below.)

Here's parts of the welcome message I find relevant and proving how Slythering House isn't always full of dark wizards:

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin Welcome Message By J.K. Rowling

  Now, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin -- and a few you should forget. Firstly, let's dispel a few myths. *You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house -- that we're all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you don't want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. I'm not denying that we've produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses -- they just don't like admitting it.* And yes, we have *traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays you'll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent.*
#+end_quote

Dispelled by Rowling's own words.

Also, it seems that the term Dark wizards is in reference to those who joined Grindelwald's or Voldermort's reasoning of Pure bloods being superior to muggles and using the Dark arts and ancient houses as supporting reasons to their cause. Grindelwald isn't even from Hogwarts, thus isn't from Slytherin but most likely influenced many of Slytherin students due to their aligning ideologies of superiority over non-magical humans. Voldermort, or Tom Riddle, as a student who lived through Grindelwald's time wasn't a Dark Wizard simply because he was a part of Slytherin. He wasn't even raised by wizards or witches, no, he is instead a half-blood raised by muggles in the muggleworld and was shaped by their prejudices against magical beings such as himself because his powers were unexplainable to them and thus shaped, already by blood relation (Salazar Slytherin line) more likely to practice dark arts, even further into being a Dark wizard by taking inspiration of Grindelwald's strategy and using similar ideologies once again to bring himself into power. It is through being influenced of his discovery of being related to the very founder of the house he was in, did he take inspiration to literally follow the misplaced in time ideologies Salazar had spoken of due to his negative experiences with muggles and had generally sought this sort of status more than the other students who had less inclinations than him to prove themselves as plenty of them were already from a long line of wizards and witches and were not raised by Muggles. It just so happens to be that this person exhibit the characteristics of Slytherin very well for a not so very noble reason and coerced their fellow housemates to become Dark wizards through spouting out ideologies that was in alignment of many of the house's students' beliefs and sets of principles and persuaded them to treat his own ambition as theirs as well. Which most likely strengthened the notion of Slytherins being full of Dark Wizards.

"Traditionally taken purebloods" - this is most likely due to the historic portion of the time which the founders lived in where humans burned witches and wizards due to their fear of the unknown and also one of the major reasons why the house itself is known for their Dark reputation because many of their students come from lineages of wizards and witches and have to keep the pride of their family house as either family members or even heirs, hence their Slytherin traits of: Cunning, Ambition, Resourcefulness, Determination, Shrewdness. It's simply by relation to coming from a long line of wizards and witches (particularly of the older and nobler houses) do the students tend to already know Dark magic because of its knowledgeable asset.

#+begin_quote
  Here's a little-known fact that the other three houses don't bring up much: *Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house!*
#+end_quote

and considering how people keep on using Merlin's name as an expression of "an oath used to express irritation, dismay, or surprise." similar to the phrase Jesus Christ in our world. We can more or less presume that Merlin is equivalent to the wizarding world's own central figure of their culture and considered as a "good" person. Or at least, their accomplished ambitions and goals were viewed that way by the majority of the wizarding world for his god-like reputation and he isn't hailed as a Dark wizard either, now is he?

#+begin_quote
  But that's enough about what we're not. Let's talk about what we are, which is the coolest and edgiest house in this school. *We play to win*, because we care about the *honour and traditions of Slytherin.*
#+end_quote

Which may at times, include using Dark magic. (But there's also an unclear boundary of what spells are considered dark and light. Think about Avadra Kedavra. It is the swiftest, cleanest, painless death one could experience in comparison to many other spells that could have been used but yet it is considered Dark simply because one has to /mean it/ for it to work. But this argument isn't really about that. Just thought I'd mention it.) Knowing what Dark magic is, will simply give you an upper-hand in general in most cases should your adversary know it too or not, it'll remain as an advantage regardless if you decide to use it or not, knowledge is still power and a resourceful tool to be used.

The Honour and traditions of Slytherin would be their cunning, ambition, and resourcefulness. Hence the whole knowing dark magic would be rather useful and sometimes for the "greater good", one must use what must be used for the betterment of the majority. One of life's biggest moral dilemma.

#+begin_quote
  We also get respect from our fellow students. *Yes, some of that respect might be tinged with fear, because of our Dark reputation, but you know what? It can be fun, having a reputation for walking on the wild side. Chuck out a few hints that you've got access to a whole library of curses, and see whether anyone feels like nicking your pencil case.*
#+end_quote

Again. Advantage.

#+begin_quote
  But *we're not bad people.* We're like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and *frequently misunderstood.*
#+end_quote

Mainly due to the portrayal of plenty villains in the story coming from the Slytherin house and plenty of heroes being portrayed from other houses instead.

In conclusion, Slytherin House will not always be full of dark wizards, there will simply be more of an inclination towards it simply because the majority of people from other houses view it through stereotyped lenses and view it as an abomination than simply a tool to be used and advantage themselves by at least knowing it. Since in duels, I believe, one's morals does not matter as much as staying alive would and there are most likely plenty of instances in which Dark magic is much more convenient than Light magic, as previously mentioned Avadra Kedavra is a prime example of that. But that itself would depend on the person's set of principles and beliefs, and in Slytherin, they value cunning, ambition, and resourcefulness and makes certain in accomplishing their ambitions through taking advantage of all there is that they can get to survive and work towards their life ambitions. It is also to be important to keep in mind that what started the stereotype was simply through other people persuading those of the Slytherin house with similar ideologies to become Dark wizards because it was /the best way to achieve their goals/.

(I'd appreciate getting advice on how to argue better as for the majority of my life, I tend to not argue at all even when not possible by keeping my own mouth shut to keep the peace which I have to say has been detrimental to me in general).

*** It's a very well thought out argument, and the execution isn't half bad either. (That's my way of complimenting you.) The entire argument or essay just needs to be polished. There are three things you may want to keep in mind.

The first thing I noticed is while your argument is in a essay format, three arguments with evidence followed by a conclusion, you do not have a proper introduction. A good/bad introduction can make or break an argument, it is essentially, your thesis. If you don't have a strong thesis, your entire argument ends up breaking apart. This is a casual argument so there doesn't need to be any clear cut thesis/intro, however, to avoid elaborating on why Slytherins are not all dark you remark "more on that below." Instead you should have, in my opinion, mentioned the three arguments you are going to spend a lengthy time explaining.

Secondly, and this one is the most important in this scenario, length is not everything. Reading this argument I could not help but notice how much shorter it should be. In every paragraph you continue to add context and explanation that, in most cases, has already been established previously. Or you simply end up repeating a point more than once. The biggest offender, however, is simply how long a sentence/explanation is, and while it may feel like you are adding to the validity of the argument, the reader would disagree. To help show you what I mean, here is an example:

"He wasn't even raised by wizards or witches, no, he is instead a half-blood raised by muggles in the muggleworld and was shaped by their prejudices against magical beings such as himself because his powers were unexplainable to them and thus shaped, already by blood relation (Salazar Slytherin line) more likely to practice dark arts, even further into being a Dark wizard by taking inspiration of Grindelwald's strategy and using similar ideologies once again to bring himself into power."

This is a very long sentence, that simply has too much in it, if you trim all the extra content and stick to the facts it would end up being better. Here is how I would write it:

"Tom Riddle was a half-blood raised in the muggle world and was thus exposed to the prejudices against those of magical origin. With Tom already more inclined towards Grindelwald's and Slytherins ideologies, he took inspiration and rose to power with similar intent."

My third and final point of advice, which goes hand in hand with the second, is to stick to your argument. While you don't digress, you do repeat yourself. This adds to the overall bloat of the entire argument.

Those are the only three things I can think of at the moment. I really do think this is a good argument/essay you just need to polish it up and I believe that taking the above three points into account might help. I sincerely hope I haven't offended you or anyone else, this is entirely me trying to do as you ask and help.

**** Haha, thanks! I kind of would have thought my argument wasn't that good but apparently it's not that bad, yay haha. If you were to rate it out of 10, how much would you have scored it? Just curious is all.

Ah, I didn't really have much of an essay format in plan, it just sort of happened? (the word phrase choice of in conclusion is what I usually use when summarising about the things I said to other people in general hahah also like I said the whole Slytherin is always filled with Dark Wizards is pretty well, wrong in general. Poor word choice perhaps or did they mean it literally indeed? ) Hence the no introduction thing. I'll keep that in mind for future well, arguments haha thanks!

Yeah you're probably right, I just sort of ramble a lot in general, simple and clear writing is something I definitely need more practice at.

Thanks! I appreciate the advice you gave, and to be honest, I kind of sometimes repeat things like I would to a person I talk to in case they forgot or I forgot if I mentioned it or not; I probably should preen my written work more indeed. Hence the horrible run off sentences, I literally don't punctuate when I talk hahah I should probably fix that.

Aww, hey thanks! I'm grateful that you think it so! :) and lol there's no way you can offend anyone by offering them the criticism and advice they asked for! Especially when the criticism given is quite constructive hahah :) thanks again!

** Against. I'd even argue Slytherin was never "full" of dark wizards in the first place. In the end, Hogwarts is a school for children and Slytherin is a house of kids... and not your fanon pureblood machiavellian prodigies either. Tom Riddle was an exception. He corrupted his classmates/dorm mates closest to him (fellow Slytherins) and in turn, they influenced the ideologies of their own children. I fully believe if there was a budding Dark Wizard in say... Hufflepuff, who was a wizard extremist, the same thing could happen. Realistically, most Slytherins turn out to be functioning members of society.

** Well, I just typed up a large argument that I accidentally deleted so here goes again... I'll be devil's advocate and make an argument against.

The House of Slytherin is known for two primary traits: cunning and ambition. Both traits don't necessarily mean that you have to be evil, just like being smart and clever (Ravenclaw traits) doesn't mean that you have to be studious or a nerd. One might even argue that ambition is necessary to get anywhere in life, such as getting a job promotion, or achieving higher grades in school. While cunning means "having or showing skill in achieving one's ends by deceit or evasion", that doesn't automatically make you a Dark Wizard or evil. If that were so, most politicians, including Fudge, Scrimgeour, and Dumbledore would be labelled as Dark Wizards.

While there /are/ more Dark Wizards in Slytherin than other houses, there are also Dark Wizards in the other three houses. While we only have the example of Peter Pettigrew being in Gryffindor, there were presumably Dark Wizards in houses other than Slytherin over the 900+ years of Hogwarts history.

Finally, there are many examples of members of Slytherin who were not Dark Wizards. Merlin, Slughorn, Andromeda Tonks, Umbridge (evil but not Dark), and Rita Skeeter were not Dark Wizards and yet they were members of Slytherin. Even Dorea Potter, a relative of Harry, was in Slytherin, and she married into the Potters, a family who was against Dark Wizards.

In conclusion, being in Slytherin does not automatically mean that you are a Dark Wizard, meaning that, Slytherin is not and will not always be "full of Dark Wizards".

** In favour.

Eliezer Yudkowsky in HPMOR makes a good point when he says that Salazar's ideology, while not evil in and of itself, attracts dark wizards.

Eventually, Slytherin house was labelled as the "Evil" house and attracted dark wizards while good wizards stayed away (the sorting hat takes your preference into account. The bias will keep Slytherin full of dark wizards.

I feel like it was more about Voldemort taking advantage of Lily and Jame's Generation than anything else. Slytherin was always a house for the cunning and ambitious so it only made sense for them to follow someone like Voldemort who was promising power. Many great wizards came from Slytherin for example Merlin(Distinctly Light Sided Wizard, Against Dark Magic, Greatest enemy was Morgan Le Fey(Dark Witch, Created the order of Merlin), Albus Severus(Showed many Gryffindor qualities despite being Slytherin) and Snape(despite being rude to Harry for most of his time at Hogwarts he still died for the greater good).

** In Favour.

Canonically (The seven books), every named character from Slytherin was a horrible person with the sole exception of Horace Slughorn. In the books no Slytherin performs a single altruistic act.

Horace himself isn't exactly a good person either. For all his surface geniality he still knew what a Horcrux was, which is rare and dark information to have, and was willing to share that knowledge with a young member of his house, one who had already acquired a dark and mysterious reputation.

Draco is ideologically identical to everything we know of Salazar, showing that the house hasn't evolved over the millennia much, if at all. We also see the Slytherin's do nothing but help the Death Eaters the battle of Hogwarts, implying that there is no real division in the house.

Finally we have both Hagrid and Ron both claim that only dark wizards come from/go to the House of Slytherin. Indeed we are given further proof that most people consider Slytherin's dark by Sirius Black's treatment. No one suspected that a 'true' Gryffindor like Peter would could ever be a traitor, but Black comes from a Slytherin aligned house and is thus suspect.

No one ever corrects this, even if we the readers understand that both Ron and Hagrid are unreliable narrators in this instance.

We are given no evidence to the contrary and it appears that Slytherin have always been this way. We can infer that Slytherin has produced more than it's share of Dark Wizards and will continue to do so into the future.

** This is a little harder to state a preference for as one first has to define what makes a dark wizard. But assuming we go by the standard ethos as it's applied in canon, then yes Slytherin will always end up being filled with dark wizards, comparatively. Not to say every Slytherin will be evil but the propensity for evil is higher there than in arguably any house save Hufflepuff(Who as we all know have to be sociopaths masquerading as kind and hard working people.)

The defining traits of a Slytherin are cunning and ambition. Not necessarily evil traits. But ones with a higher risk of abuse towards evil than the others. Ambition often blinds us to the morality of our actions, and cunning by its very nature tends towards duplicitousness. And though the canon morality itself seems okay with some lying and rule breaking “for the greater good” (couldnt resist, didnt try) the majority of the characters who behave consistently in that fashion are never really considered good.

But I'm equivocating. The main point of this argument is will Slytherin truly end up with mostly “dark” or evil wizards, (or witches!). Yes. Because the successful villains are inevitably ambitious, cunning and clever. Which means they'll get sorted to Slytherin, with lesser odds on Ravenclaw. Gryffindors can go bad. But it's more of a spree killer bad I always assumed. And as established Hufflepuffs are all secretly sociopaths.

An argument could be made regarding the dark wizards in canon and their respective houses, but that argument doesn't hold weight in my less than humble opinion. A more valid point would be due to their ambition more Slytherins will turn dark if a dark wizard is already in play.

In summation By the defining nature of the traits prized by each house, dark wizards are predisposed to Slytherin so will gravitate there, thus making sure it will always be full of dark wizards.
