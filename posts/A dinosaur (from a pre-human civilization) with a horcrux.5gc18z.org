As you probably know, in HP canon, Herpo the Foul was the first human wizard to create a horcrux.

But, what if there were a magical civilization that came before humans? A dinosaur civilization, in fact? And, that dinosaur civilization had a left over dark wizard who independently developed his/her own horcrux/es?

Perhaps after a certain meteor impact decimated dinosaur civilization, or even before that (there were multiple mass extinction events, after all), this wizard-lizard ended up as a disembodied spirit for millions of years.

If it didn't go completely insane, it might have possessed a few thousand different hosts over the years, trying to find magical sources that could achieve its resurrection.

Given that flesh, blood and bone is out of the question (with no surviving relatives or enemies), it might take until the present day (with the whole Voldemort thing) for this dinosaur to develop a means of resurrecting itself. And then...who knows?

*** Sooner or later I should post a request for subversions of the "Yer a wizard, Harry" line.

Like, "Yer a lizard, Harry" (as you just mentioned), or "You're a wizard, Hagrid" (I've seen that in a short story where Hagrid is removed from his Care of Magical Creatures job to finish his Hogwarts Schooling), or "Yer a muggle, Harry" (idea I had before involving muggles going to the wizards dimension and overwriting the local laws of physics with their technology), or "It's yer blizzard, Harry" (Hagrid breaks the news that Harry is a mutant with power over storms)...

**** "Harry...I'm sorry to bring this up," Remus said, "but there's something you should know about your family. Your mother, well, she grew up in Sheffield, and after she married, she spent a month or so with your grandparents. And, well, she met a university student there."

A bolus of dread was making its home in Harry's stomach. "Are -- are you trying to tell me --"

Remus nodded. "I'm sorry, Harry. James loved you, never doubt that. And despite Lily's...misstep...she and your father loved each other very much."

Harry cleared his throat and said, with effort, "Who is my real father, then?"

"A, well, a comedian," Remus explained. "You might know him -- he was in that production of /The Cryptogram/ --"

Hagrid's patience chose that moment to shatter, and he burst out, "Yer an Izzard, Harry!"

** I can actually see this being a really good villain for an OP!Harry fic where he easily deals with Voldemort. A primordial immortal dinosaur wizard who wants to kill everything/conquer/whatever could make for a really cool and interesting villain. Creepy, but also really interesting. And I like the whole magic is older than you think theme that it would have going.

Once upon a time there was a very wicked dinosaur. It was a very long time ago, so nobody now knows his name. Or even that he existed.

This evil dinosaur was very adept in the ways of magic (magic existed before humans, you know), and used his mystical powers to conquer an empire for himself, taking everyone whom submitted to him as slaves and all who opposed him as food.

To assure his eternal reign, he discovered a way to split his corrupt soul; taking bloody trophies from conquered heroes, the wicked wizard lizard placed parts of his soul inside each skull, thus ensuring he could never truly die.

And so, immune to death of any kind, the (lol) tyrant lizard expanded his empire, slowly but surely conquering the globe and ruling it for thousands of years.

Why isn't he around today? Well, you see, on one of his expeditions to conquer a rebellious province, the tyrant decided he wanted to show off, by calling a great asteroid to /squash/ the city ruled by the rebels in a single blow.

Unfortunately, as you might have guessed, he selected too big of an asteroid...and despite being very well versed in magic of the darkest kind, he wasn't so adept at physics, and didn't understand the importance of velocity, just mass.

Though utterly disintegrated by the force of the blast, the tyrant wizard lizard did not die. Why would he, his what-we-now-call-Horcruxes were back in his capital city on the other side of the globe.

His spirit remained on earth, though with his body utterly destroyed and his empire destroyed by the aftermath of the asteroid impact (along with everything else!), he could do nothing but wait for millions of years, waiting for intelligent life to return to earth, waiting for someone or something he could use to restore his true form.

The dinosaur watched as humans descended from the trees and taught themselves to use fire.

He watched as the Ancient Egyptians learned the principles of magic and used them to guard their homes and tombs.

He watched as Herpo the Foul followed in his footsteps, creating a horcrux of his own, though the human dark wizard barely lasted a century.

He watched as humans exchanged their togas and loincloths for shirts and breeches.

He watched as magical beings of all shapes and kinds came together to hide from non-magical humans.

He watched as Lord Voldemort was blasted from his body, becoming an incorporeal spirit like himself.

He noted with interest the events at Hogwarts.

He watched Voldemort come back to corporeal life using the flesh, blood and bone of his father, servant and foe.

And, the millions-of-years-old dinosaur wizard planned.

--------------

Okay, you come up with the next bit. What's this tyrant lizard's name and what method does he use to gain a new body?

** SharpFastTalons lurked in the underbrush, watching his prey as it drank from the river. He sneaked closer, silent despite his foot long toe-claws cutting into ground beneath him. The fat FoodLizard twitched, it's super-vision and danger-smelling powers working at their peak. SharpFastTalons froze, just too far away for a leaping killing chompslash to the neck of the fat FoodLizard.

SharpFastTalons flexed his legs, and his head, and his teeth and claws. He could picture it, the perfect arc that would sever the FoodLizard's leg strength with both of his feet, and land with his mouth right there on the back of it's neck. He coiled his tail, and his legs, and with a roar so powerful it gave him just enough thrust, SharpFastTalons launched himself into the air towards dinner. The FoodLizard saw it coming from the reflection in the water, but it was not enough time to do more than gain knowledge of its imminent death.

"Baaaaaaiiiiieeeeeee-" The FoodLizard cried out, cut short by SharpFastTalons snapping it's neck with one fierce chomp. SharpFastTalons drooled with happiness, and dragged its dinner away from the shore and into the underbrush to eat. He relaxed his legs and claws, but maintained his focus on flexing his head and teeth. He needed sharp teeth to eat better, and he needed his head to think better. He could already tell that his thinking helped, he had a big dinner right in front of him just waiting to be eaten!

SharpFastTalons tore into his dinner with reckless precision, flaying the FoodLizard with quick strokes of his claws and gobbling down the flesh and organs with quick bites. He continued to think, now that he could, and flexing his thinker back on itself even harder didn't seem to have much of an effect, in comparison to the first time. Which he hadn't relaxed at all, unlike his legs and claws, though his thinker didn't seem to be getting tired. His legs could only run him half a day, much less if he ran extra fast, but his thinker seemed to keep thinking on just fine with no wear. "Excellent," SharpFastTalons thought to himself. "I will be able to catch and eat anything! And nothing will be able to eat me, not even GiantScary or the SuperExtraDeath!"

... i was gonna keep going, with how the magic velociraptor taught itself how to magic, and somehow made a horcrux, and tried to take over the dinosaur world, and then killed everything on accident, including himself. so he just hung out, mostly dead for an long ass while, and i dunno what happened when he met HP or LV or whatever, but I think it was gonna turn into a horror story where it came back and then just ate everyone, one by one. i dunno. im not gonna keep going.

It could easily be resurrected in the present. Bone of the father might be available, depending on how fossilization affects the ritual, and the servant and enemy could be from the present day.
