Now she, and her coven of fellow "squibs" practice their witchcraft in secret, awaiting a child of fate and sacrifice to bring about their reign. When Albus Dumbledore -oblivious as to her true nature- asks her to watch over Harry Potter, she believes she has found the child of prophecy, a baby spared the touch of death by a blood sacrifice. Thus she brings her coven to Privet Drive and they raise Harry as a blood mage.

​

Basically, the crazy old cat lady of Privet Drive is actually a powerful blood mage, using hag magic and sacrifice to fuel her powers. Bonus points if she convinces Squib!Petunia to join the coven and learn blood magic. Please note that I'm not looking for that oh so lovely "dark is not evil, it's all about intent!!!1!" trope. If not crack, then the Privet Drive Coven should be absolutely vile and depraved, though Harry himself doesn't have to be. The idea is heavily inspired by folklore of medieval witches and their dark rituals and powers. My headcanon is that those muggle stories are based on hags.

Thanks.


** Dude! I had an idea super close to this too! In mine her and other ‘druids' were sacrificing magical kids to bring back the old gods, which they do on the night Voldemort goes after the Potters.

Barrier begins to break down that night and Morgana low key posses Figg from time to time as she identifies Harry as her champion against god of destruction and chaos. Sacrifice plays a big role moving forward too

****** This is what I wrote as an intro...

The wet squelch of mud-laboured footsteps echoed across the moor as twilight faded. A creeping mist descended, blanketing the landscape and dulling the rising moon's watery light.

In a small valley, a man bent with age trudged on, clutching a bundle tightly to his chest. His rattled and wheezing breath echoed eerily through the hills.

“One more,” He croaked, glancing back over his shoulder to his daughter.

“That's right, just one more,” she reassured him with a sad smile as a hacking wet cough wracked his body. It was an old routine for them and gave comfort to them both.

His knees quaking with effort, he resumed his slow trudge through the muck with her following closely behind.

She couldn't help but admire the way the dappled light accentuated the blue woad tattoos that wound their way across his leathery skin in mysterious patterns. A reminder of time gone by, of their ancestors, and the old ways. They were the last of their kind.

---- Miles away, a cold wind whipped through the pines and the rain lashed the window of an old lonesome cottage on the edge of the moors. Inside, a dog whined quietly by the fireplace.

"Don't worry pup, we're safe in here,” laughed an old man jokingly, scratching behind her ears. The dog eyed him sceptically before nestling back down, assured by her owners gentle touch.

"Hope the sheep are alright though," he grumbled as an afterthought. The dogs responding huff seemingly echoed his owners thoughts.

The fire continued to crackle and pop, the only other sound besides the howling of the wind that steadily grew in volume. Windows began to rattle, faintly at first and then with more violence.

"It'll be fine," the man said with more confidence then he now felt as he reached down again to pet his faithful friend as much for his own reassurance as hers. "It'll all blow over soon," he whispered as a chill began to settle over the room.

----

A circle of stones appeared before them like jutting jagged teeth from the land. The mist wound its way around them curiously but remained unable enter the circle. She could feel a prickle on the back her neck now as if she was being watched. And perhaps she was.

A piercing wail from the bundle in her father's arms cut through the silence.

“Hush now babe, it'll all be over soon,” he crooned, as they stepped into the circle. The babe quieted almost at once perhaps too sensing the presence around them. Above them, the sky cleared to reveal a full shining moon above.

Before them in the center lay an obsidian slab of granite that seemed to soak up the light around it. Moving closer, she could make out the familiar crudely cut jagged lines of its shape. It's oily glossed surface glimmered menacingly in light, hungry and waiting.

She hoped this one would be the last. There had been so many. Hundreds. Thousands even. For generations, their people had sacrificed until they'd had no more to give, and they'd had to start finding others. This would be the last though, of that she was certain because after her father passed, she doubted she'd have the stomach for what was necessary.

She halted her advance, feeling a faint pressure against her while her father began a slow and measured chant as he approached the altar. A chant used by his father and his father before him. Twisted, bitter words of loss, hatred, sacrifice, and blood. Words that spoke of dark nights, great depths, of ripping reality, and reshaping worlds.

From his waist he drew a knife, his chant increasing in speed. The blade was as black as the altar and worn smooth with use, but the runes upon it started to glow silver in the moonlight, absorbing the light and darkening the very stars above them. The altar responded in turn, small etched runic symbols beginning to shine an electric blue, throbbing with power as the darkness spread throughout the clearing.

The chant continued to build at a frenzied pace now. Spittle flying from his lips, he placed the babe firmly onto the altar and unwrapped it from its swaddling. It watched on helplessly, wide and curious eyes tracking the now glowing blade that rose slowly above it.

The steadily building chant finally reached its crescendo and with no warning came to a sudden and abrupt halt. A pregnant pause where time itself froze as the world waited with baited breath for the release the power that had been summoned. He hesitated just a moment, savouring the power he held.

One more, and the old gods would live. It would all be worth it. It had to be.

The blade descended and she could not look away.

----

A sudden flash of lightning and boom of thunder shook the house causing the man to duck subconsciously and the dog to whimper loudly as it began to cower behind its owners legs. A smell of ozone suffused the air heavily.

"Bleeding hell, what do you reckon that hit?" The man muttered to the dog as he shuffled out of his chair towards the window.

Squinting up against the window and using his hand to shield against the glare from the fire he tried to peer out into the night. Straining his eyes , he could just make out a fire in the standing circle of stones that he used as a sheep pen before his warm breath fogged up the freezing glass.

"Ah Christ," he swore as he swung round and began to get dressed in his warmest clothes. "Fucking sheep better not be dead," he mumbled angrily as fumbled with his boots. A bark from the dog startled him as he at last pulled on the stubborn wellie.

"What is it, girl?" He asked curiously as the dog continued to bark ferociously at the door while backing towards the corner.

"Hush now," he berated, pulling up the hood of his jacket and jerking open the door only to stop dead in his tracks.

A woman stood there. A beautiful woman with dark hair, striking ice blue eyes, and the most red lips that he'd ever seen. Behind him the dog had ceased its barking and begun to whine piteously.

"Excuse me, sir," she said softly with a small embarrassed smile. "I was caught out in the storm when I saw the light from your window. I don't suppose I could come in and warm my hands by your fire?" She gestured hopefully to the hearth behind him.

"I... uh... sure." Mumbled the man, a bit taken aback by the stranger's sudden appearance and her striking appearance.

"I'm sorry what was that?" Asked the woman, a slow smirk now making its way to her quirked lips as she tilted her head in apparent confusion. "I couldn't quite hear you over the wind."

The dog had almost ceased its whining and was now shaking in the corner as temperature began to plummet. The fire too, had begun to flicker and die.

Fighting a shiver the man cleared his throat before shouting loudly over the rain, "I said that you can come in!”

"Thank you," said the woman, a twisted smile full of white sharpened teeth making its way onto her face as she moved forward with far more speed than should have been humanely possible.

Screams echoed their way across the moors and the wind continued to howl.

***** I was puzzling over the same question, honestly. I can see someone saying "I only write scifi" or limiting themselves to high fantasy instead of urban fantasy, or only writing romance novels set in the '20s, and so on, because those require specific skill sets and settings that demand certain areas of expertise to pull off. But even then a mature writer will venture beyond their comfort zone to develop their skill, just to exercise so to speak. Maybe writing poetry when they typically don't, or writing in 1st Person instead of 3rd Limited. Etcetera.

But saying you only write about one very specific pairing between two very specific characters doesn't make sense to me. Why would you constrain yourself like that? I get that you might like that pairing, sure, but that's still a very very narrow box to jam all your writing skill and potential into.

And to clarify, I know restrictions boost creativity. That's why we have such strong rules about how a sonnet works, or haiku, limerick, iambic pentameter, and so on. Forcing oneself to write a short story which uses zero adverbs, or without the letter E, can be a writing exercise to improve your skills and develop creative thinking. But you don't say "as an author, I never use adverbs" or "I only write haiku." That's not inspiring creativity by adding constraints to a particular project, that's curtailing and even crippling your entire writing career.

(As an aside, not bashing you or Tomarry even. I've just seen this particular self-restriction echoed by several people, and it's always concerned me.)

******* That sounds like a writing rut, to me. Kind of like writer's block, just instead of being unable to write anything, you're only able to write one thing. I'd recommend challenging yourself to outline and craft a story in which it's impossible for it to be Tomarry (perhaps imagine a HP universe in which Voldemort doesn't exist, or just write a story outside the HP fandom). That way you can broaden the scope of possibilities for your writing. I'd wager it would improve the quality of your Tomarry fics.

Just some writing advice. 🙂

Another note: this kind of problem tends to be more common with a "pantser" style of writing rather than a "planner" style. It can feel more natural, but it provides less control over the writing process. Which ultimately means running into more problems than just writing ruts and blocks.

***** I mean, it's limiting for the obvious reason. "Tomarry" is a really niche story element in an already niche-of-a-niche world (HP fanfic is a niche of fanfic which is a niche of fiction with is only one type of writing).

It sounded odd because to me, "Tomarry" isn't a type of writer. It's not even a type of story - it's a story element. The phrase "I am a Tomarry writer" struck me like someone saying "I am an oregano chef." Like, oregano is just an element in dishes, it's not the whole dish and it's not a type of chef.

I don't mean to shit on your choice to write particular kinds of stories that repeat certain story elements. If you only like writing stories in which Riddle and Potter have super-hot gay sex, then by all means, you do you. The glory of fanfic is reveling in that kind of super-niche stuff. I would just think it would get boring after awhile and you'd wanna write different stuff and that a self-imposed label of "Tomarry writer" would feel limiting.

Anyway, I definitely look forward to whatever you write in the whole "Figg is secretly a blood witch" thing, because the OP's premise sounds /fucking awesome/.
