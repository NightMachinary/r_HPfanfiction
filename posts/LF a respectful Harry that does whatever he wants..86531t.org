LF a Harry that gets tired of everyone leaving him in the dark and at the Dursley's. So he just jumps on the knight bus and goes to Diagon Alley. Dumbledore finds out and tells Harry he isn't allow to do that. Harry respectfully says ok and then goes off and does whatever he wants to next. Each time he's confronted he's respectful but then goes and does whatever he wants. Not looking for Shouting crazy I'm Lord Potter-Griffindor-Slytherin I can do whatever I want and no one can stop me Harry.


** I'm imagining this:

Albus Dumbledore looked gravely over his half-moon spectacles at the contrary teen in front of him. Said teen was happily munching on a chocolate frog and attempting to get Fawkes to enter a staring contest, with very little success. "Harry, I am quite disappointed in you. You know how important it is to remain with your Aunt, for your own protection. You even agreed with me that it was the best course of action, and consented to remain under her roof for the summer." He leaned forward, placed his elbows on the table, and did his best /intimidating you for your own good/ look. "Why then, did you rent the apartment above Borgin and Burke's for the summer and inform everyone who asked that you were the illegitimate child of Narcissa Malfoy and Severus Snape?"

Harry chewed thoughtfully, having given up on Fawkes as a bad job. He swallowed, shrugged and said "Well, I thought it'd be funny."

I laughed so hard. I'd love to read a fic where Harry does this.

***** Oh god, not this story again. I really dislike this story. It's the worst example of a time travel story.

[[/spoiler][A time travel story that manages to introduce a lot of changes while still bending over backwards to stick to the canon stations. Characters become a mouthpiece for the authors opinions as well as their attempts to hand wave the many plot holes.\\
None of the characters are likeable except Lockhart who is genuinely entertaining]]

** linkffn(11685814) He acts this way to an extent towards Dumbledore in this one. They have a few chats and Harry immediately turns around and does things anyway. There's more to it than that, but it has some of the premise you want regardless.
