For most people The Fallout is THE Dramione fanfiction but I don't see why. I can't finish the story, I fail to see why it is so loved and why it is considered the best. What am I missing? Where does it start to get interesting ? What is even it about?


** Not every story is going to click with every reader. If it's not doing it for you, don't worry about it. (It's a â€˜war changes people/ Draco defects to the order/lots of sex/Ron isn't who you think but a guy in disguise/they rescue the real Ron/more sex/Draco is pretty mature (far more so than Hermione)/sex/ potential for HEA)

** Different strokes. I'm personally in the same boat - the version of Draco in particular just isn't one I'm interested in - but the story obviously works for a lot of people. Depending on what turned you off, it may improve as you dig into it or it may never click.

It's a (possibly) unpopular opinion, but I find other works by the author such as Sugar Water and When the Bell Tolls to be more compelling and a better reflection of the writer at their best.
