** It's canon, but it's not book canon, and a lot of people only allow book canon. Fantastic Beasts is certainly considered more often to be canon than Cursed Child, but it still has problems here and there that can cause people to reject it. A lot of the stuff people keep from it is probably their own head canon already too.

**** That's true, but as Taure mentions in his comment, it's taking something that's likely rare and making it commonplace, when in reality rarely any story should feature Harry having an apartment sized expanded trunk. If you reject the canonicity of FB, you could also argue that apartment sized trunks are a bit too far. There certainly seems to be a limit to what you can do with magic; certainly we don't see items getting expanded millions of times their size, or a single Aguamenti unleashing Noah's Flood. Headcanon, if rejecting FB could just simply lump the apartment sized trunk in with impossible magics, though certainly FB weakens this position quite a bit.

  *SCENE 41. EXT. PLACE CACHÉE, CIRCUS ARCANUS---NIGHT*

  TINA walks past the street performers working in the open, scrutinising them. A *HALF-TROLL* performs feats of strength. A few misshapen and particularly downtrodden humanoids -- UNDERBEINGS without powers but of magical ancestry -- shuffle around, taking money from the crowd. Horns hidden beneath hats, unusual eyes beneath hoods; HALF-ELVES and HALF-GOBLINS juggle and tumble.

JKR went full urban fantasy with the setting. Half-elf, half-goblin... weird, but okay.

*** It's not for people to decide what's canon. The very definition of word canon, in this context, is whatever the original author of work consider part of their world. It's canon because JK Rowling thinks it is. People being stubborn about not accepting it /their/ canon is their right, but it will remain /the canon/ as long as JKR thinks it is.

The debate over canonicity, imho, is between people who take JKR's writing as canon (7 books, supplementary materials like Beedle the bard and published essays), and those who take everything JKR releases or was involved with that has anything to do with HP as canon, which is an increasingly varied range of sources from Twitter, behind-the-scenes commentary in DVD extras, interviews, and collaborative projects like the Fantastic Beasts movie series and Cursed Child where other producers were heavily involved with the writing and creation.

The real issue arises when something JKR posts contradicts other things she has posted or written before, like the [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/596635888446218240?lang=en]["All racists are Slytherins" post.]]

But it's not. It shits on the original characters we loved from canon. Hermione is dumbed down, Ron is dumbed down even further, and Harry telling Albus the "wish you weren't my son" line just doesn't compute with the canon Harry who values family as his heart's desire. When he looked in the Mirror of Erised in book 1, he saw his family, not just James and Lily, but his entire extended family with messy hair and knobbly knees.

***** Moral alignment does not. Role in the story does. An antagonist who all the characters you're supposed to sympathise with dislike, and who is ultimately defeated, is never going to be a Mary Sue. Once Delphini is revealed, she is not treated as wonderful or delightful. The protagonists don't go out of their way to see her as only misunderstood, nor do they compromise all their own values to accommodate her. She's an antagonist and is treated as one.

The appropriate trope for her is the one where a female villain initially appears as charming and attractive, as if she were the love interest, only to betray the heroes later on. Which is a pretty common trope, but definitely not for a Mary Sue.

You'll also notice that the only characters who are ever in awe of her are two inexperienced teenage boys. Not Harry, nor Hermione, Draco or Ron. A real Mary Sue would be attracting praise from all the important and accomplished characters that everyone knows and loves and respects.

And villainous or not, Harry is awed by her abilities, even though he's a pro Auror with 20 years of experience. It's not that Delphi's abilities are unexplained that makes her a bad character, it's the fact that the narrative has had to devalue other characters' competence to allow the Sue, in this case, a Villain Sue, to succeed. Not only does Delphi have the power to defeat Harry, who is trained in catching dark wizards, in a duel, but even though she's eventually defeated, the story shows that she outsmarts the whole cast, who have been dumbed down to OOC levels for her to succeed. It's not just Al and Scorpius who are tricked, but Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and Draco too.

That's not awe, that's an offhand compliment. Nor is it awe to simply acknowledge the abilities of an antagonist. If we're going by your standards here, half of all characters ever are Mary Sues.

As for beating Harry in a duel, so what? Sure, he's an Auror, but we regularly see or hear of experienced Aurors losing to Death Eaters. Delphini was trained by one of the Lestranges. Molly Weasley, an untrained housewife, beats Bellatrix, an exceptionally dangerous duellist, but no one seems to complain about that or call her a Mary Sue. The same applies really to the whole of the DA.

If your problem is the simplistic way it's written - "they fight, she's stronger" - then it's the genre. I've always said that the biggest problem with Cursed Child is not the writing (though that comes second), it's the simple fact that it's a play script and not a novel. They're not going to write blow-by-blow descriptions of duels and how one character uses an array of clever and subtle magic to out-manoeuvre and overwhelm the other. First because you don't do that in scripts, you leave it up to the director or fight choreographer or whoever, and second because they're not going to be able to display any complicated magic in a live stage show anyway. Even the movies, with the world's best CGI available to them, turned most duels into contests of aggressive wand thrusting. You can't apply the same standards to a play as you do to a regular fic. The practical limitations are completely different.

  “You...you've been living in a trunk?” she said faintly.

  “It seemed like a sound investment, since property values keep rising.”

  “How do you eat?”

  “Dobby.”

  The house elf appeared, only to pop away again at my dismissive gesture.

  “So you're stealing, then,” she said flatly.

  “Dobby is stealing. I am accepting gifts,” I said.

  Hermione shook her head and then peered into the compartment. “I just assumed you'd be staying with Ron. If you'd told me that you really didn't have any place to go, you could have stayed here.”

  I chuckled. “That's what I've been doing.”

  “In the guest room, Harry!” Her hair fluffed up like a cat's coat.

  I frowned, glancing out of her bedroom door. “I don't know if I would like that. Your guest room's pretty small.”

  She raised an eyebrow. “You've been living in a trunk.”

  “Which is still bigger than your guest room.”

  Hermione began to pace, footfalls heavy on the hardwood floor. My trunk shuddered with every step, and my bookcase rattled within. Suddenly, the girl exclaimed, “Is it smoking?”

  “Well, I have to air the potions fumes sometime, or they start to build up.”

  I've tried to remedy the situation through spells, but that tends to set off some of the more delicate brewing. I still hadn't fixed the hole in the floor from my last attempt at Felix Felicis.

  “There is absolutely no way this is safe,” Hermione muttered.

  “You're thinking like a Muggle, Hermione,” I said as I descended once again into my new home.

  “I am not!” she said. “Also, there's nothing wrong with that!”

  “Sure there isn't, Hermione” -- I chuckled, waving my hand as the roof latched behind me -- “Sure there isn't.”

In any case writer would love to paint their vision on paper, write the world they envisioned in story, in ways they want to see it written. Either it's because they enjoy such thing, or because they want to see if they can world build in ways they can envision it.

It's all about what a writer wants or what a writer can. In all of those cases writer made no attempt, apart from creating their beloved baby and publishing it, to get the your or anyone else to log in, open a link, and continue reading. It's free work, and reader loose nothing if they close the tab and move on. Kindly show compassion to people who take time out of their day to write stuff they want to write, because at the end of the day the basic motivation for a writer is to write the world they want to write, reader getting the chance to read and enjoy it is just an added bonus. If you don't like it? Move on

** It gets flak not because it's counter to canon but because it is most commonly used as a device in an overwrought Diagon Alley scene in which the author shows us just how much much more foresight his (and it's almost always a "he") Smart!Independent!Gray!Harry has compared to his canon counterpart---and is then never seen again.

Of course, if /is/ seen again, it is usually not much better, since the live-in trunk mainly serves to isolate said Smart!Independent!Gray!Harry from other characters and therefore from meaningful character interactions so that he could */¡TRAIN!/* without interference from the Manipulative Old Coot etc..

** As some people said before, the main problem with the "Apartment-sized Trunk" is not the fact that is exists, but what most people do with it.

Scamander's trunk is the place where he places every magical creature he collects (or rescue I guess?), so they can live in better condition than let's say, a cage. This Trunk can also be used as a kind of plot device : Scamander is in a situation where his wand is not enough? Don't worry he has the perfect magical creature for that in his trunk.

For Indi Harry Trunk, we have a way too long scene where he buys an appartment sizer trunk with a musculation room, a library and 3 rooms (when the trunk is not Manor sized with 10 rooms and a Quidditich pitch), and then . . . nothing. The trunk goes to the same place that the Acromantula's silk robes, the gold cauldron's and the Phoenix's quills. It was used one time to "show" how much better Indi Harry is cause he can dress himself as a pimp, and is completely forgotten.

​

Some fic, like Seventh Horcruxe (because this fic will never be mentionned enough) use "The Appartment sized Trunk" trope for a reason in the story, and I don't think anybody ever complained about it.
