What if his lemon drops were a tyoe of drug and he constantly got caught doing thinks like:

Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts

Minerva McGonagall stepped out of the fire in the headmaster's office to a strange sight. Professor Dumbledore was attempting to feed his pet Phoenix a lemon drop. The Phoenix seemed to be chirping in annoyance while the headmaster persisted that he try it.

"Albus surely you can see that Fawkes has no desire for your candy." McGonagall said.

Fawkes thrilled in agreement. Dumbledore sighed and put the box of candies back on his desk.

"I never understood why no one appreciates a good lemon drop, Minerva." Dumbledore said with a smile.

** I've seen fanfics where they were laced with calming draught, which is why he presses them on people the moment they come to his office. A kind of â€˜calm your tits' roofie to make everyone settle down and be able to discuss things rationally. I can't remember which fanfics had this particular tidbit in them - it was a throwaway, background thing. I now have it firmly as head canon because I think it's hilarious.
