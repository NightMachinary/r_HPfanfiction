Has anyone else written a fic and then questioned if it should go online (fanfiction or AO3 or something) as it is, or if they should retool it as their original IP? What did you decide? What swayed your choice?

A friend asked me what I thought Bellatrix Lestrange was like in Hogwarts. What resulted was an epistolary /The Diary of Bellatrix Black/ set in her fifth year (1967-1968), where I had her introduction to Voldemort. She's an unreliable narrator, but still reveals what circumstances made her vulnerable to pureblood radicalization.

I originally had every intention of just cleaning up my draft and putting it on fanfiction, but now my husband is encouraging me to explore ways I could tell the story without the context of Rowling's Wizarding World. I could make my own fantasy world, or my own take on “magic is real in this world,” or delve deeper into the psychological manipulation and leave out magic altogether.

Some relevant questions I'm asking myself include: Is magic necessary to this story? If I tell it without magic, is it less interesting? If I need magic to tell it, is it still worth the effort of retooling? Would more people want to read it as the Diary of Bellatrix Black, or as the journey of an original character?

(Just to be clear, the story does /not/ show Bellatrix, Voldemort, or anyone supporting Voldemort in a positive light. I was partially inspired by /Dangerous Liaisons/, where wealthy, beautiful, charismatic people reveal themselves to be abusive monsters.)


** you could always do both. there are quite a few popular authors who originally posted something as fanfiction but then rewrote it as a novel. publishing can be very difficult, so fanfiction could allow you to have your work out there and getting reviews and critiques, and then if you ever get your more personalized version publish you can always delete the fanfic if you need to.

*** Thank you. I hadn't considered that---but maybe I could post the fanfic and let its online life influence how I develop the story as an original IP. This is some great food for thought

** One is Amazon's ‘Kindle Worlds'. This service allows fan fiction to be professionally published so long as it is from one of the ‘worlds' which has volunteered to be part of the service. At the moment, this is a very limited pool, found here in its entirety, but does include popular properties such as G.I. Joe, Veronica Mars, The Vampire Diaries, and more. Many creators see fan fiction as an advert for the original work, so this very new service is likely to grow in future.

*** Oooh thank you! I wasn't aware of Kindle Worlds. I'm going to check it out as a user even if I don't try to publish that way ^{.^}

** It worked for 50 Shades of Grey, so give it a shot I guess. But seriously:

Honestly if I were you and you really want to try your hand at making it an original IP, I'd write out the base of the fanfic as you would want it, then make some rough drafts of the different versions you'd make as your own IP. Change up the characters and settings, try magic/non-magic versions, etc. until you figure out what sticks and works best for you, and what version you find most interesting to explore. Once you've figured out where you want the story to go and what version you've made that you want to work on, start making redrafts and build on the story from there.

You don't have to fully flesh out the entire version of each story you're considering, you can start with a rough outline and add in more details to each until you figure out the one you want to focus on. Writing a book can take years and several redrafts depending on the author, especially if you care about how well-crafted your story is. So if it's too much work and you don't want to put in that much effort then honestly just write the fanfic and don't bother with the original story.

*** Thank you! I find outlines invaluable when I'm writing, so your suggestion to try multiple takes and adding more details here and there sounds like an excellent tool.

** Imho, if the point is not magic, and if its plot is not propelled by magic and its presence, then I would cut it entirely. Reconsider the circumstances that would result in the same personality.

If magic is the heart of it all, keep it, but change the way it is utilized and what it would mean for the broader world.

Try to avoid the trap of the 'style' of fanfiction. I would cut out fanfic for a good minute to think about what your style is about if it isn't well explored, and read some books similar to what you're going for tonally. As much as fanfic can pose interesting questions, it usually has problems (as a whole) with structure, plot holes, and detracting side stories or details that muck up the understanding of the world at large.

*** Style is a weird sticking point so far. I wrote my draft with an attempt to blend into canon. So, the letters and articles Bellatrix tapes into her diary sound like they're from the Wizarding World (plus one muggle article), and all the diary entries are Bellatrix's voice/her perception of that world. All the “depth and color” moments blend into real history or Wizarding World canon. In an original IP, the depth and color could just be replaced with building “my” world; and the protagonist's perception would have pretty much the same filter of her own experiences.

The point isn't magic. I think the book would stand on its own feet without legilimency, which is really just used as a tool for emotional/psychological manipulation. People IRL pull enough of that s---t without magic, anyway. I like the idea of making the story fantastical /somehow/ how; tapping into a recognizable Good-vs-Evil dynamic.

...Now that I'm thinking about it, my preference may be driven mostly by my own comfort. My protagonist is SO different from the kind of person I want to be, that putting a wand in her hand and sending her to Hogwarts gave me a sense of distance. Sooooo yeah that's some food for thought too.

Thanks for weighing in!

** A bit late to the party, but this is a really interesting question. First off, the premise for this story is incredibly interesting.

Personally, like someone else said already, I don't think you need to limit yourself to either/or. You can post it as a fanfic, see what you get out of doing that - it could be a great way to work out plot holes, inconsistencies and other kinks with the story that you might have missed.

To me, it sounds like the core of your story goes far beyond Harry Potter. The challenges of youth, the pull of family and tradition, the lures of extremist ideology and so on are topics that can be applied to a multitude of settings.

I recently read a story with similar elements set in a near future dystopian America. I've also encountered concepts like this when reading historical fiction. They're big themes.

So for the sake of sharing this work you've created and getting some feedback, you can post the fanfic. Then if you want, putting it in a different place (your IP version) can be a further exercise in developing and exploring the story, concepts and character.

I do understand just wanting to go ahead and post it after all this work you've done. I also fully understand the desire to have it published as your own story and I don't think you should sell yourself short on that. It'll be hard work, but there's no reason you can't. You can literally have it both ways.

Best of luck with this! And if you do decide to post it as a fanfic (and as an original story for that matter), I'd love to read it.

*** Thank you! I've been toying around with different settings. I think it could work as an original YA novel.
