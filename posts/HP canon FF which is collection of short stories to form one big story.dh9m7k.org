:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a Post-Hogwarts canon fan fiction on AOOO which was basically a collection of 70-80 short stories which cumulative formed a bigger story.

If anyone can remember the name of the fan fiction and share a link to the same, I will be grateful.


** Sounds like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian.]]

*** Even though this sounds interesting, this isn't it. This one focuses on other characters, the one I remember reading focussed on Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione along with other characters quite a bit.

** Can you be more specific? There are quite a bit of series with that description.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][Slice of Life One-Shots]] from FloreatCastellum is one, although the one on her tumblr is more complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075][mischiefmanaged!verse]] from irnan.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/441613][Fresh Pickled Toad]] from gryffindormischief. This is the one that has 80+ stories, so maybe you're looking for this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] also had a series like this, but it's on FFn.

and of course the one by Northumbrian
