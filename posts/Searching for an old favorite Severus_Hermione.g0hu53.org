** Doesn't ring a bell, but I sort of wanna read it!

Here's some love for the inevitable “Snamione hate” cuz I ship them too!

*** Ship hating makes me so sad! I support any ship that people are into, then get hated on for liking pairings of Hermione and Severus or Draco. To each their own with love and support!

Got any favorites to recommend? For Severus/Hermione my favorite is probably The Last Spy and for Draco/Hermione I'd say The Right Thing to Do, which is the first of three.
