I know a lot of books switch perspectives, but all of the ones that come to mind do it while maintaining a third person perspective. It's such a disappointment to me when perfectly serviceable first person writing switches narrators--I've always been of the mind you're supposed to pick one and stick to it.

I'm not saying it absolutely cannot be done well, just that I haven't seen it done well myself, and I read a lot, fiction and fanfiction. Personally, I'd rather be immersed in one voice and mind; that's what I come to first person fiction for.

Any idea why authors do this? Do you like it? Why or why not?


** Breaking Dawn does. Not that you'd notice since the sixteen year old Native American boy and the eighteen year old apparent bookworm girl sound almost exactly the same.

Don't judge me. I didn't listen to it willingly.

** Rick Riordan is the absolute king of switching first person perspective, it's like the entire shtick of the Kane Chronicles series and he later implements it into most of his later titles. The kane chronicles are amazing btw if you haven't read them(would highly recommend, like them more than the hp books honestly)

** Jodi Picoult tends to switch between first person perspectives by chapter. She's certainly made a successful career of it.

This example will show my age, but back in the 80s-90s there was a popular children's book series called The Baby-Sitters Club. Most books in the series were first person limited to one of the girls in the club, but there were periodic “super specials” where the first person narrator would switch by chapter within the book.

It's not my favorite style to read, fanfic or otherwise, but I do believe it can be done effectively (The Broken Earth Trilogy already mentioned is a great example.) And it does seem to show up more in fic than elsewhere.

** The only time I've ever really liked this as a concept is the songs Helpless and Satisfied from Hamilton.

I didn't even like it when I tried to do it in Princess.

** N.K. Jemsin won three best novel Hugo's for her Broken Earth trilogy, which uses this technique. Ok, technically one of them is second person, which is even less common/odder. And I think Children of Blood and Bone switches first person narrows. Which is to say, yes, switching perspectives is a not uncommon writing technique, even when all those perspectives are not 3rd person.

** Iron Druid series does. not in the first book or two but it gets to being from three different perspectives. Thankfully the author splits perspective changes by chapter.

** I can only think of /The Wandering Inn/ and other modern "post-fanfiction" works, offhand. (EDIT: For other examples, see [[/u/Colubrina]] above.)

("Post-fanfiction" is incidentally a term I just made up, but it may well become accepted twenty years from now. It's very likely that in hindsight there'll be an apparent divide between Pre- and Post-fanfiction writings, what with a substantial proportion of future writers now getting their start in fanfiction.)

That being said, say, criss-crossing "diary entires" in the first-person perspectives of two lovers in a romance doesn't sound like such a far-fetched idea. It's very possible that some book or other did it long ago.

** Im not a fan of this. I always stick to one objective third-person narrator, only sprinkle in first-person thoughts of characters every once in a while.

** Shit writing, and I don't care which professional authors do it. Just because it happens in published works doesn't mean it's good.

*** I wouldnt write it off so easily dude. First person is the most natural experience for readers and authors alike, case in point both you and I wrote out points in first person. Having multiple narrators first person POVs allows for a similar moment in time to completely switch how they feel, from the valiant struggle of trying to keep upright as the narrator fights to uphold thier beliefs, to a horrid beatdown as a narrator watches their freind get beaten to a pulp. Tldr; switching first person POVs allows for sudden shifts in tone to feel natural and can keep a story interesting as it allows for first person narrators to have their thoughts be obscured at points in time.
