** This might not be quite what you're looking for, since in this fic Petunia develops magic later in her life, but it does have Petunia as a witch raising Harry

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

**** The only real problem I have with that fic is it kind of just starts to drone? Like, it continually stretches the universe more and more (which is generally fine) but when I stopped reading (sometime around chapter 110) it felt like it was barely the same universe anymore, and Harry/Dudley were unrecognizable?

** Well.... This was surprisingly easy to find. I might even have enough time to finish my assignment. I don't quite know if it is exactly what you are looking for but it does contain a witch!petunia.

Edit: It is exactly what you desired, the AN point's toward that deviant art image. I hope I helped

And, uh, the fic's link was on the second page of the comments for that picture. So... look a little harder next time >.>

  Petunia loves her little sister Lily more than anything in the world. She would do anything for her. She would watch out for Lily at Hogwarts, protect her during war, and even raise her son. An AU oneshot about the unbreakable bond between sisters, featuring witch!Petunia.

*** I think you'll be retreading a well-trodden path. Unless it's along the lines of a Russian folk tale, like Vasilisa and Baba Yaga--but there's a reason Harry was never considered for Ravenclaw.

**** Baba Yaga will be a character. I can confirm. But I was thinking about changing Harry's response to being mistreated. We have almost exclusively seen him rebellious, heroic, or in the excruciating Severitus stories, Harry as an emotional ball of tears crying crying into people's shoulders. I was going to go along the lines of more brainwashed type of Harry, where he is loyal to Petunia and submissive, even though she is nasty to him. I am not a child psychologist, but it is hard to imagine that it is impossible for a Stockholm Syndrome type of scenario happening where Harry defers to Petunia with many aspects of his life. It is still in the works and easily changed, but this is the direction I imagine going.

******** I want to keep her in Britain. Baba Yaga is not the only hag, merely the most recognizable. I have a list of 10 Hags easily recognizable from stories or folklore, and of the 10, 7 of them are willing to kill children, maybe 4 of those 10 are willing to kill their own children, and maybe 4 of the 10 are willing to kill and eat children.
