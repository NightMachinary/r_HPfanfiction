*** I mean I like starfox5's super Hermione better than most fic writers and the movies... but only in small doses. The marriage law revolution had an interesting Hermione, who wasn't stealing the spotlight. Patron had great world building. His Ron is also done really well done most of the time.

I'm a bit of a hypocrite, since super Harry (think teen version of Dumbledore, Voldemort, or Grindelwald in terms of talent) is a favorite of mine.

But back to the topic on hand, Hermione in his stories tends to be a bit too perfect. I want to see struggle. I want to see people called out on their bad decisions. I want to see a hard-earned victory, not a deux ex machina.

**** My characters struggle - but more against competent enemies than their own stupidity. They're not perfect, but they're not some min-maxed collection of flaws and edges that stumble through a conflict, alternating between utterly stupid decisions and brilliant stunts. That goes for everyone of my characters. I don't have Harry walk into obvious traps either, or have Voldemort go with plans a six-year-old would reject as stupid, or have Dumbledore watch as someone targets his students. If my characters have the time to plan, they'll generally plan competently. In Divided and Entwined, the body count rocked up whenever people had to improvise or lacked enough information for a good plan - on all sides.

And I'm really not fond of characters who wouldn't be able to function in society, much less in war, because they don't have a handle on their issues. If someone will accept every challenge, no matter the situation, they aren't an interesting "flawed character" - they're a stupid, shitty cliche.

***** That last bit was just a general thing, not really aimed at you. The Patron ending with the ritual left a bad taste in my mouth, but it was well-written.

It's mostly the level of competence that bothers me. You have to understand I've read most of your novel length fics. Your younger Hermione reads a lot like your older ones to me.

I feel she flowed too naturally into the role of a leader in the fics in Divided and Entwined. Adult Hermione like in the Marriage Law Revolution, I can see in a leadership position. She lived through a war already. Hermione in Divided and Entwined, not for a little while, not at her maturity. I always felt you wrote adults a lot better.

The whole love triangle thing felt a little bit forced. Just my opinion though.

The strategy was on point. Your OCs add a lot to the plot, and I'm actually astounded by the number of characters you manage to solidly develop.

Your take on Amelia Bones was great. I can't tell you the number of fics I've seen ruined because Amelia Bones is apparently a badass who can stop Fudge and Dumbledore. She wasn't a stalwart supporter of Harry's. The best that can be said is that she was impartial.

Overall, I liked the fic, but it wasn't my favorite of your fics.

It's still better than the Half Blood Prince and cursed child though.

****** Hermione's leading other teenagers in Divided and Entwined, and by the time young adults join the group, she's been established as a leader for quite a while (and a legal adult in Wizarding Britain to boot). Not to mention that, in canon, of the trio, she's the one who becomes Minister for Magic - so, unless she suddenly changes at 20 or so, she has leadership potential in spades.

******* I'm not saying she doesn't have leadership potential. Heck your stories write that better than canon. I'm saying it is better written, in my singular opinion, in one story than another. Her assuming leadership would have happened eventually, but a few more chapters in would have been more palatable to me. No matter how many connections, I feel her age would have to be surmounted. It's a moot point later in the story.

On a side note, your Aberforth is always great to read. People forget he fought his brother and Grindelwald in a three way duel in canon.
