It just occurred to me that Hermione and Ron are made prefects, but we never really learn too much about what that means for them. In particular, I'm surprised I haven't seen any smut of them together in the prefects bathroom (which is apparently gender neutral??!).

I'm interested in such smut, but also interested in little slice of life stories where one of them alone just enjoys the prefects bathroom as a bathroom/pool. Maybe their shock on seeing it for the first time, and how awesome it is. Maybe one of them says, "how come you never told us after using it last year?" to Harry.

I'd also be interested in non-sexual slice of life stories where one of them runs into other prefects in the pool and they just kick it, talking about the dramas of being a perfect - maybe they talk smack about the Head Boy or Girl being too uptight, or the challenges of being responsible as a perfect while also studying for OWLs. Maybe there's disagreements between those who take their duties more or less seriously. Basically shop talk.

And I guess this doesn't have to be in the bathroom, either. I'm interested in prefects meetings, seeing more of how they get assigned their hall monitoring shifts, for example. And not in a dramatic, extra-plot kinda way - just slice of life stuff that happens in the background of canon.

Thanks in advance for any leads!
