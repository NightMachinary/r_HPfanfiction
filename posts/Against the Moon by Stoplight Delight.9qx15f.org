Is it fully abandoned now? Or has the author said anything regarding updates. I just really love the work so far and don't want to see it go.


** Nope, not abandoned. From what I understand, StoplightDelight has a chronic illness and can only update when she feels well. She's also a “chase the muse” kind of writer, so she's currently posting a Star Trek fanfic. This has been since the summer, and she's already on chapter 50-something because she writes crazy fast. No idea how she does it.

She's been working on AtM for an extremely long time, so you just got to sit back and wait. She goes through spurts where she'll write like 50 chapters at a time (e.g. last summer).

*** Thank the lord. Any word on when she's planning on updating or going back to it?

**** Hmm, no idea. It's kind of one of those long-haul fandoms. I've been following the story since 2014. In that time, she's only had one period of frenzied updates (last summer). It was originally posted in 2011. She's in a Star Trek phase, but she still says that she will update AtM when the urge hits her. I don't really care for Star Trek, but I think her story is pretty popular there as well.

** This question has been bothering me as well. But I was afraid to even ask. But we are in the third year now, I bet I'll still be reading that fic when I'm in my 30s. It's that prequel I've been waiting for, JK can decide never to write a word about those four and I won't be very sorry. But it does bother me a bit that Remus and Sirius have such a close relationship in that fic, I just can't bring myself to believe this. But I should stop, because I'm rambling. Anyway, thanks for posting this question here :).
