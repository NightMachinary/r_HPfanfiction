Besides finding an amazing story that you realize hasn't been updated in like three years, I don't think there's anything as demoralizing to me in HP Fanfiction as a story starting in first year.

I can't even count the number of times I've read a summary and/or pairing that has gotten me so excited and intrigued, only to realize that the story begins with yet another first train ride, another crack at the author trying to write as an 11 year old, another troll incident, and so on, and so on.

But that's not even the worst part: the worst part is knowing that there's less than a 10% chance that the entire story will ever be written. HP Fanfiction is littered with story-corpses of fics starting in first year, going through like 200K words and three years of Hogwarts, and then just petering out.

Even with the stories that start in first year and have had a consistent update record so far, such as ‘Prince of Slytherin' and ‘Ashes of Chaos', you're basically hoping that the writer keeps up with this pace for the next few YEARS in order to finish (no knock on either story - I am wildly impressed with both authors commitment so far. I just pray it continues)

That's why I found the recent story ‘A Flower for the Soul' so refreshing. It's really a fourth year story, but the author chose to show Harry's life and schooling up to that point by only devoting one chapter to each year. It's enough to give us the background without bogging down the entire experience.

Am I the only one feeling this way? I'm curious to see other's feelings on the matter


** I find that the drawback on younger year fics is that people forget how children act, and make them overly smart or overly nice (or overly political in terms of the pureblood lord/lady trope). I was considered precocious as an eleven year old and I can assure you I was still dumb as a brick, impulsive, and easily frightened in life threatening situations in account of never having been in one. Sure, kids can be crafty and quick witted and succeed at a plot but there is an upper limit to how efficient and adult you can make a child character before it becomes unbelievable and embarrassing. I've read hundreds of brilliant fics but also many bad ones, so reading something that starts in first year is a gamble.

*** The other thing too is having the kids study and work on classes like 90 hours a week. One of the bigger complaints I read about Ron in fanfiction is how lazy he is - he's an 11 year old! Most kids don't want to spend literally every minute doing work!

**** As far as I'm concerned, Ron and Harry are the norm (for teenagers) when it comes to work ethic, and Hermione is the weird one. This is why I'm always amazed when people say he is "lazy" or "weighting Harry down", I can never know if these people can't remember their school years, or if I just went to an extremely shitty school.

***** But on the flip side Harry is not a normal kid. Ron is a normal kid and his work ethic reflects that, but Harry is more or less told he is, at some point, going to have to fight Voldemort to the death, and does fuck all towards preparing himself for it.

****** I can get behind stories that have Harry working extremely hard - he has a built in reason, e.g. uberpowerful immortal wizard who wants to kill him. Ron though is supposed to represent a normal wizard kid, and I find it hard to believe that the average kid spends literally every moment on school work.

****** The problem is that Voldemort is an extremely talented wizard, who always worked hard and have a 50 years headstart. I doubt any amount of training could have closed that gap, and I don't think Harry ever had any chance to win against Voldemort /in a/ /straight fight./

Harry's victories against Voldemort were never due to superior magical power or dueling skills. He won because of "love" (oldest and strongest spell bla bla bla). It's a bit cliche, but I still think this a bit more believable than "/Harry worked very hard for 6 years and became the strongest wizard on Earth/".\\
I don't think Harry ever stood a chance even if he had spent all of his time training. Even worse, I'm afraid that such a Harry would have been unable to develop some qualities such as "love" or "compasion", or to connect to his peers, which would have made him unable to use the "canon method" to win against Voldemort.

So yeah, even if I'll admit that Harry could have been a bit more proactive when it comes to learning defense (he could have seen the patterns after 4 or 5 years), I don't really see the point of him being trained as a weapon. At least in a canon setting, I have nothing against this in an AU where he may have a chance because reasons.

******* There are myriad problems with canon, but I think one fix is to have Harry be doing a little extra DADA each year than anyone else. Maybe he can read a combat spells book in one scene or he and Ron can practice with a dummy in the courtyard. Then when it gets to fifth year it can make a little more sense why he teaches them.

*** I think it's a bit more than that - people have a story that they want to tell that requires older characters but are too tethered to the canon situation that it ends up muddled/wrong in the way you describe.

Like you say, there's a limit to how smart one can make children - to use a different author/work, roughly Ender's Game/Shadow level is when it's already starting to get out there.

The solution, though, is pretty simple - just starting later (if the start of Hogwarts isn't a major point), aging up Hogwarts, or both.

** I don't mind fics starting in first year, /if/ they do something sufficiently different to the storyline of canon that it makes sense to do.

A lot of the problem is actually that people just take the canon storyline verbatim, just putting the same thing in different words over and over again. If there's a change, it's usually from something that snowballs as the years go on - and in first year, that snowball isn't even really rolling yet.

** Sounds like your real problem is canon rehashes, moreso than first year fics. If it's just another alley-train-troll-mirror fic, that's what your post seems to say you dislike. That I definitely agree with.

I personally have really enjoyed some first year fics - particularly time-travel repeats or those 'slightly different personality ones' (there's a couple that I'm forgetting the names of that start with Harry getting really into books and then big divergences happen when he visits Gringotts) - and like you said with 'A Flower for the Soul', all-the-years fics can be done well. I won't deny it's a strong predictor of story-death, but the idea of a first year/all-the-years fic isn't bad in and of itself. Like most times, it's not the idea, it's the execution. Some people do them well, other people need to do more work.

But yeah, I'm more of an "I want interesting stories!" person than an "I want more canon!" person, so generally the non-rehashes do appeal to me more.

*** I think your assessment is somewhat accurate in that I don't care for canon rehashes. But I can honestly say that even with the unique stories that do drive my interest I still have that vague disappointment reading them because I know that there's a slim chance they'll be finished. Even if the first year is excellent by itself, I still don't get the full enjoyment because I know the overall story most likely won't be done.

**** Fair. It's quite fascinating how that idea of being reticent to start a fic that might not be finished stretches throughout the fandom, actually. It's sort of the opposite of the sunk-cost fallacy, being unwilling to buy into something on the possibility it won't pay off. Like a 'sunk-cost hesitation'. :D

** Eh, I don't mind first year fics, though I generally wait until a series is up to the third of fourth year before I start reading it. The ones that look interesting I mark for later and then check back on them when I'm looking for something new to read.

I'm writing a year 1-7 (plus one year post Hogwarts) series and it's a lot of work. I'm about a third of the way through book 4, and I've calculated at my writing speed it will take another two and a half years to finish the series. That's definitely a long time to focus on one project. However, I'm really enjoying it.

What I don't enjoy is blatant rehashes of canon. Like, make something different. If I wanted to reread the actual Harry Potter series, I would. If there aren't some interesting changes by the end of the first year I generally stop reading.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** I completely agree. I'm so tired of starting a fic that has a cool premise only to find it starts right from the first ride to Hogwarts and we have to go through first year again. And then we have to go through every single day chapter by chapter.

I currently feel like this about the Arithmancer. I'm very interested in the idea of using Arithmancy in spellcrafting but it's going so slowly. I know I can't skip because I'll likely miss crucial information but the first 13 chapters are the first two months of first year which is just Hermione mapping Hogwarts, going to class, and writing to her parents. I just wish I could speed it up and get to when they're older and the events get more interesting.

But I understand that authors want to build up the story from the beginning because it's probably important for the characters story.

** I can think of some really good 1st year and on fic's, but most of them are beginning again, time travel fic's too.

I see your point, a lot of the really bad ones are poorly done 1st year's, but there are some good or interesting ones out there; you've just probably already read them.

I read all kinds of fanfiction atleast twice, there are too few great stories out there to read only them.

EDIT: Looking through my ffn community of all time favorites (Those Less Forgotten), I have 9 total non-crossover non-SI/OC, non-time-travel fic's (or series') which start 1st year, all of which are atleast mildly AU; not that you'd necessarily like the same stuff I do, but that's like Ten Years of reading fanfiction, so 9 total isn't all that great.

/Firebird's Son/, /The Arithmancer/, /893/, /Harry Crow/, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, /Core Threads/, /Seventh Horcrux/, /Gabriel/, and /Harry Potter and the Manifesting Magic/.

And, heck, /Core Threads/ and /Gabriel/ aren't even complete, but they do stop at well enough a place.
