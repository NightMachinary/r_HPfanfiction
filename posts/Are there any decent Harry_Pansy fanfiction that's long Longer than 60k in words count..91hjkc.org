I wish to read where Harry explores more of his choices in Slytherin than just generic Harry/Ginny (Which is canon) Harry/Hermione (Which is common) Harry/Daphne (Which is more prevalent to say the least). While there's some Harry/Pansy fanfics exist they are either set in Harry becoming Slytherin which is very uncharacteristic of him or some form of betrayal fanfic which I just don't get at all when Hp series also promotes friendship as much as every other thing.

I just wish to find a decent fanfic where Harry stay in character doesn't change his house loyalty and still be friend with Pansy. I know there will be friction between golden trio if it were to happen in reality specifically with Ron but I like to think their bond (Harry and Ron) stronger than the choice on would make along the way. If it's anything it would make it more interesting as long as the friendship don't fall apart.

I have read a great fanfic where Ron and Pansy were contractually bound to marriage and they survived each other and saved their marriage. The author took a really interesting and realistic angle where everyone who reads it will it including me. Even though it had Harry/Daphne pairing (Which I dislike since I've seen so many of them) but can't help but shade tears of how it went specifically Ron and Pansy parts even though I don't particularly care for them or didn't before that.

I don't know much you link the story but let's give it a try so everyone (who read this post) can at least have a chance to look it up.

** White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais is around 200k words, and a personal favorite of mine for a Harry/Slytherin pairing. You can find it at jeconais.fanficauthors.com

*** Umm.. I am not a slash or harem sort of person and I would like to think Harry is not into it if we go by JKR version.
