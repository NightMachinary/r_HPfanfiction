** Man, has no one here ever heard of the concept of swords being used to throw blades of force/magic?

I don't want to insult anyone, but have some imagination!

Here are some examples of op sword powerups:

-You block with the sword and a magic shield springs up from it

-When you slash with it, you can choose to release build-up magic in an instant, creating a crescent moon of pure magic/elemental power/fabric-of-reality tearing force. You can slash and literally cut down a whole forest.

-Pointing the sword upwards releases a huge burst of magic that synergizes with your phoenix's song to make your troop's morale soar (while also boosting everyone's power a little bit).

-Stabbing the sword into the earth will effect a huge circle of land. The ground will become elementally deformed or a huge shield will spring up from that circle or a bunch of meteors will drop in the area or all three and more will happen all at once.

-Simply pulling out the sword from it's scabbard will don you with an infinitely light, yet infinitely tough and infinitely shock-absorbent armor that also looks cool.

** Basilisk venom is already considered the deadliest poison in existence in-canon. You can't get much more lethal than "fatal within seconds with a single cut, and destroys the best-protected magical artifacts".

Plus, you know, wands let you blow up 12 people with, at most, 2 words - so there's not much point to a sword for a Wizard.

There's a few fics that boil down to "Harry gets a super-sword that's better than the Sword of Gryffindor in every way for no adequately explained reason" but none of them are actually /good/ and he almost never ends up using it for anything.

***** Depends on how exhausting you consider magic to be, and how the sword works. If constantly casting high powered spells can exhaust someone, then having a sword with said magic imbued within it can be a great backup. For Fiendfyre, since it's difficult to control then having a sword enchanted with it will allow you to use it without having to keep control over it. Granted, in canon you can use normal fire against Inferi, but maybe you have a group of people with you and you're worried about collateral damage if you just start up an inferno. So you can use smaller fire spells, or the sword, which can again depend on how exhausting using powerful magic is.

As for the Killing Curse, this is a bit more interesting, I think. Since Basilisk venom seems to need to be injected into the body (via fangs), then it'd make sense for the sword to need to cut into the skin to get the venom into the body. But, since the Killing Curse only needs to touch someone/thing to kill them, then perhaps the sword would only need to touch a person to kill them, rather than cutting them. In this case, I think something like a Goblin-forged spoon would be more useful. It's smaller, would leave no wounds (while a sword or dagger could leave a cut even if you're being careful), there's no flash of green light, and it's far easier to touch someone with a spoon without anyone noticing compared to a sword or dagger. So it'd actually make a great, stealthy assassination weapon, so long as no one sees you or investigates the spoon too closely.

As for the sword, if we're sticking with that, well I think if someone can't cast the Killing Curse, but uses the sword to block the curse from hitting them, then the sword would be imbued and wielded by someone who can't cast the Killing Curse themselves. Even if they could cast other spells that could kill, not much is as efficient as the KC. I imagine even something like a dragon could be killed by the curse, even if other spells bounce off, so just tapping them with the sword should be able to kill it.

In short, how useful it would be depends greatly on the rules you set up as well as the situations you put your characters in. I actually think this makes the whole thing better, as it grants access to abilities and solutions to problems the main cast might not normally have (kind of like what JKR did with the sword in the actual series), without making it an overpowered battle weapon that can just kill everyone, whereas something like a gun that's enchanted to shoot out the Killing Curse would actually be completely overpowered.

****** Voldemort looked at the Death Eaters fallen before him. Slowly, almost carefully he tasted magic in the air, an ability he gained after his latest ritual, and noticed the slight tang of Death, metal and...soup?

The Death aftertaste was easily explainable, after all, he was intimate with it from his teenage years.

The Metal thought, he only tasted it the previous war, when goblins managed to fight back a squad of Death eaters. The magic lingering in the wounds that were caused by various enchanted swords and axes stang of it.

But...the last one. The...soup. It truly scared him.

He was reminded of his fights with Dumbledore, where magic swirled, changed and moulded to their casters wishes. And although they both were accomplished wizards, they only managed to change their magic to elements, and, although he never would admit it, only Dumbledore managed to give his magic the taste of Animals, his choice of transfiguration.

But this... This was something never seen. To change a sacred thing such as magic, a force that differentiated Him from those filthy muggles, into such a...mundane thing as...soup. Truly frightening.

Only wizards who surpass Dumbledore and Himself could change it so thoroughly.

And that means only one thing.

A new player has entered a game.

And Lord Voldemort shall no longer consider that bearded fool his greatest rival. No. Only a wizard who has such control and authority over magic is worthy of being His opponent.

******* Sure, it doesn't seem like it in canon (it's not explicitly mentioned but any tiredness could be excused by the fight itself, or if we're talking about dementors it could be from their draining effects rather than exhaustion from the Patronus). However, plenty of people use it in their fics, whether it be from some "magical core" or simply that it can tire you out if you aren't used to the power of the spells you're using. Which is a good balancing factor. If magic takes no effort to cast other than knowledge and concentration then it's easy for your characters to become overpowered and have no negative effects from it. Whereas having magic be like a muscle that requires training and practice to not get tired while casting more powerful spells, it provides character training and growth that relies on more than just learning, they have to actually work towards becoming more powerful.

Like, imagine someone teaches you how to bench press. You learn the proper technique and body positioning, and after a bit of work you have it down. You're not suddenly an Olympic-level weightlifter. You have to start small and work your way up to it. Whereas if magic only takes knowledge and a bit of practice to actually learn a spell, you now have an unlimited supply of bombs to throw at your opponent, only limited by how fast you can wave your wand.

Others use it as stress relief, as entertainment, for personal wish fulfillment, as escapism, or as a coping method. I don't mean to sound harsh, but you're demanding that other people invest their time and effort into creating free stuff up to your standard of quality. They don't owe you anything. Maybe you got instant noodles when you were expecting a grilled steak but at the end of the day, free food is free food.

edit: Also when I said "anything goes" I meant it creatively. If someone's writing horror, I don't expect the same sense of whimsy as shown in canon. Crossovers especially are a fascinating place to see the intersection of genre clashing together and making something new. People make alternate universes all the time. The rules change. The world is a sandbox. Sometimes that means it becomes a more gimmicky power level focused fic. As an example, I think harem fics are generally sexist and demeaning, with incredibly one-dimensional characters and repetitive plotlines, but that just means I ignore them instead of trying to control what people write, read, and want.

The Killing Curse will murder at "I can see you, therefore I can kill you" range. Fiendfyre will cover a room the size of the Great Hall.

The sword has a range of barely over arm's length and only destroys things one, maybe two at a time. You have basically nothing to gain from using a sword infused with either if you're willing and able to cast the spells in the first place.

Although, we don't know the limits as to what will actually be absorbed by it. Basilisk venom, Fiendfyre, and the Killing Curse are all powerful enough to destroy Horcruxes (I believe the KC is able to but not sure if that's actually confirmed), and the sword can absorb Basilisk venom, then something equally destructive should also be able to be absorbed.

** As noted by many others, the main problem is that the SoG is a melee weapon in a setting where the ranged options are just too good.

Possibilities to fix this:

1. Introduce some mechanic that makes melee better (for example, at range, magical combat becomes a contest of who chooses the best shield combination that blocks the enemy spells for the least effort, with the loser being the one who fails to block something deadly, or runs out of energy first. At close range, the opponent's shields interact with each other and short out, so Harry, lacking regular magical combat experience, just aims to get in close and cut through everything.)
2. Borrow from Dune, there are shields that have an obvious tell that do a MAD if hit by offensive spells, most wizards don't use them because they can't while holding them, either, but Harry can use them plus the SoG to great effect.
3. Some form of metal armour that grounds out most or all spells at the cost of limiting casting ability
4. Harry is a Squib, or has some other disability that greatly limits his ability to at least /cast/ magic (leaving open passive magics or things like rituals and runes).
5. Harry has a magic-immune Animagus form that also cannot cast, but can wield a sword.
6. Harry can extend the cutting range of the sword, and that extension carries all the properties of the SoG, either by some inherent ability of or addition to the SoG (like he can extend or retract the blade), or some inherent ability that lets him cut things he can't actually reach (if you've read Worm, Jack Slash's power).

** Just let him cast through it. Or store magic in it. Or deflect curses with it (unless it already can?)

It's so much cooler than a small pointy stick. Might as well soup it up.

*** Nah, pointy sticks are tight. Make the sword swirl around Harry in deadly circles and then fly through enemies like a flying sawblade! BZZZZZZZD! "Eat death you stupid.. ermm.... death eaters... or something! Damnit! I need to work on my catchphrases more."

** I havent read something exactly like this but i did read a fic where harry uses the sword in Stages of Hope. Tho not very similar.

There's some tho where he's the heir of gryffindor thus leading him to use the sword.
