Once upon a time when we were all waiting anxiously for OoTP to come out, twiddling our thumbs since Jo was taking forever, I found a fanfic that I devoured. It was hundreds of pages long and I adored it. I believe, if memory serves me right, it was better than OoTP when it was finally released.

Anyway, this fic is easily over 10 years old.

When I was about 9, I got a new computer and lost the fanfic / it was taken down and I could never find it again (because, hell, when I was 9 I didn't realize that "fanfiction" was a genre.. sort of).

I'm reaching out to you lot to see if you guys have any freaking idea what said fanfic may be. I have *zero* recollection of the content, I just remember that it was amazing and I enjoyed it more than OoTP.

Also, I'm like 99% sure it was between GoF and OoTP that it came out.... but I could be wrong! I was a kid so memory is fuzzy >.> I don't remember if the author tried to claim it was OoTP or the official 5th book, but I just know it obviously was fan-written and at the time, awesome haha. Any suggestions / leads would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)


** If you really can't find it /anywhere,/ then perhaps it was one of Master Eldryn's. He did basically rage-quit the internet ten years ago, and his immensely popular stories, somehow, went with him.

** Is there /nothing/ you can remember about the fic? Pairing? Tiny plot detail? Whose POV it was written from? Perhaps whether it was just 5th year or if it continued to cover 6th and 7th year?

I want to help but it's very hard to find a fic when you've got nothing to go on but "it was amazing!" There were a hell of a lot of fic written in the three years between GoF and OoTP, even (possibly especially) novel-length 5th year fics.

*** Honestly, no idea. I don't remember anything other than that my 9 year old self loved it. This is over ten years ago for me, literally half my life, so I have no recollection sadly.

What the other poster said would make sense though, because I had the link bookmarked and it and everything else just... disappeared one day. Sorry!

** Search for zizenya's fic. I've forgotten the name but I'm 90% sure it's what you're talking about.

*** The Zsenya fic you might be thinking of is called After The End. It is without a doubt my all time favorite Harry Potter fan fic. I was absolutely floored as I was reading it by the insights that the authors showed into the characters, even though they only had the first four books to go on.

It was written after Goblet of Fire, and it covers years 5-7 through flashbacks, the end of the Wizarding War, and the aftermath. It's mostly focused on life after the war for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, and Remus. It's a wonderful fic. Really insightful into all of the characters. Definitely more character-driven than anything else, but in a really good way.

I loved Ginny in this fic. I felt like she got a chance to shine more than ever before. She's such a great character, but her potential gets overshadowed by the others in cannon, I feel.

Ron is wonderful too. All of them, really.

Anyhow, I'm not sure if it's a fic that you would have loved at 9 years old, but I'm betting it's a fic you'll enjoy now :)

So, if you want to read it, it's After the End by Arabella and Zsenya at [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619]]

Good luck! Hope this helps!
