Seriously need a slightly angsty fic where Hermione and Draco get together but Ron and Harry are really mad at her for doing so. I can just imagine this in my head so I would love to read it! I can't find anywhere where Hermione and Draco get together with big consequences for the trio (and I'm surprised- I think it would happen if it was cannon!) If anyone knows a fic like this please let me know!!


** When I saw your request is thought, sure two sec, just gonna find the right bookmark folder. And looking though them all I realize I've never read anything like your request. Even though it should be quite common.

*** That's what I thought! I've been looking everywhere for a fic like that because I would love to read an interpretation of dramionie which, to me, is more realistic. I doubt Ron and Harry would've been happy if Hermionie ended up with Draco!

** Perhaps I am being excessively flippant, but you are certainly not the first person to imagine that, and such fics are numerous. I am not much of a Dramionist myself, so I can't point to any good examples, but just searching for the pairing on FF.net, perhaps with the other characters mentioned in the description, should get you fics to read.
