:END:
Preferably something like you belong to me (i belong to you) By Child_OTKW were Harry is actually pissed off about Tom killing his parents and is in equal footing with him. It makes me angry that people always write Harry as a weaker character in comparison to Tom because he doesn't know as much theoretical knowledge but people forget that what he lacks in theory he more than makes up for it in sheer willpower and precision over the spells he does know. I'm not asking for a Gary Stu but I do want a Harry with a backbone who doesn't take shit from any of Tom's cronies. Canon Harry always had a strong willpower with strong principles and I just want to see that more with Harry/Tom Harry&Tom time travel stories were he doesn't get constantly manipulated by a teenage twerp who's not even yet a dark lord. Anyways I would appreciate if anybody had some good recommendations preferably ones that aren't abandoned.


** Wind Shear linkffn(12511998)

20ish Harry gets sent back to the beginning of the first war. He proceeds to utterly wreck Tom's shit.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Whiskey Time Travel linkffn(11233445)

It's currently being rewritten (I've linked the new version), but I've always liked it because it has time travel Harry, but Harry as a battle hardened adult. He gets time traveled back to the early days of the 1st Wiz. War.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know. Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. He has the entire school wrapped around his finger.Only Harry has no plans to save him. In fact, he's going to kill him.

  Getting lost in old memories is a dangerous thing for anyone, but in Harry's case the whole situation is slightly more literal than usual, and - as it always tends to be - much, much worse.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
