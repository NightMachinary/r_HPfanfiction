#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

**** Most fics that have Harry as independent have him becoming an animagus. I think only a small minority of those actually have him living at Potter Manor, so most of the fics I know only fit the animagus criteria. Perhaps try linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) or linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) (though I don't remember if he became an animagus in the last one).

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
