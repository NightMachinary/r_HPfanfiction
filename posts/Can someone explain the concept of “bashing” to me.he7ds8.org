I've been reading fanfic for quite some years now, and have always noticed that the HP fandom seems to have quite a few fics with “bashing” of certain characters. (Dumbledore and the Weasleys seem to be common victims.) I understand the concept, but I don't understand why. Do people look for these fics on purpose? Why make a protagonist character purposefully unlikeable? What is the appeal?

Thanks!


** My theory about why many authors (and readers) are attracted to ‘bashing' fics is that it starts as a cathartic exercise, usually about a character that is held up as a person to be admired in canon but the reader/viewer notices some really negative or toxic parts of their personality and so wants to shine a light on it. I'm imaging a lot of this is driven by frustration and disappointment when things aren't addressed in canon, and that tone is noticeable in a bashing fic.

The first time I got into reading bashing fics was in the Torchwood fandom, it was Gwen bashing. I was resentful because I felt that the show-runner wanted to force viewers to hold Gwen up as the morally upstanding one, meanwhile I felt that was hypocritical & that all these other fascinating characters were left with wasted potential while the show kept the main focus on Gwen. Reading bashing fics was a guilty pleasure but it made me feel better cause I knew other people agreed and I ended up less annoyed with the canon character afterwards.

**** Yeah good point, now that I think about it this also kind of covers why there is generally more slash fic in fandoms (I think someone was asking why that was a few days ago?).

The popular pairings for any non-canon relationships don't pop up out of nowhere, readers and viewers get a sense of connection and chemistry between the characters. And again are disappointed and frustrated when that's not explored in canon. Its especially annoying when you know there are all these narrow minded social and political reasons for same sex couples to be denied representation in fiction & popular media. (Yeah its getting better, but there's still a ways to go on that front).

I wonder if bashing fics end up so negative because it's mostly driven by negative emotions, whereas relationship fix-its also have an upbeat, hopeful kind of tone going on.

** There are 2 common definitions to bashing:

- Assassinate any and all characterization of a character in favour of making them a caricature of evil. They may, strictly speaking, not actually be any worse than in canon morally, but their only purpose in a fic is to exist as a mindless foil.

- Portraying a character as behaving in a way worse than would be plausible assuming the fic is canon compilant up until whatever divergence point the fic chose. As in, a character might turn out worse than canon but "naturally" from character development, but this wouldn't count as bashing. But a character who is just randomly a worse person than in canon out of nowhere would be bashing. This is the definition I personally use with bashing.

For the latter definition, "bashing" becomes more of a dynamic scale. For example, portraying Bellatrix as a Death Eater wouldn't count as bashing since, well, she is one, but portraying Ron as one in the canon continuity would count as bashing. But a Ron the Death Eater that, for whatever reason, grew up with the Malfoys wouldn't be Ron bashing since he would have grown up with very different values from canon.

The latter is the far better way of doing it, but IMO both definitions are fic flaws. If you want to portray a person as a villain who wouldn't plausibly be one (Ron, for example), I'd much rather you explain /how/ and /why/ he got to that point with character development, because in canon they would simply not be like that.

In my experience, the most common reason for bashing is to make a non-canon ship work. For example, Harmony tends to bash Ron. The other common reason is that some tropes seem to attract bashing of certain people by their sheer presence. For example, Indy!Harry very commonly features Dumbledore-bashing and usually Weasley-bashing, and WBWL usually bashes both Dumbledore and James (and rarely Lily), and an assortment of other Order-members, mostly at random (but usually including the Weasleys).

*** I wouldn't think of a Death Eater Ron as bashing just like that. For example, if he received the diary in place of Ginny and got his moral corrupted, making him join Voldemort after the fourth year, that wouldn't be bashing to me. If he decided to join them just "because why not" *that* would be bashing.

One of the consistencies I perceive in bashing is that the character concerned is always stupid and unable to question themselves. Since it's the author's catharsis/guilty pleasure, this character cannot grow out of it until and if the author has decided they had enough fun.

There's also the case of minor bashing, where the character is bashed at the beginning of the story to get rid of a flaw or force him to change his point of view (ex: a story where Harry bash Draco to demonstrate the absurdity of the pureblood ideology, leading him to a redemption arc)

**** That's what I mean though. "Behaving in a way worse than would be plausible /assuming the fic is canon compilant up until whatever divergence point the fic chose/". If a Ron becomes a Death Eater after character development turning him that way, that wouldn't be bashing. But if Ron, just out of nowhere decides "yep, those Death Eaters look like a good idea to be part of", then it'd be bashing.

** I think that one of the great strengths of Rowling's writing is her complex, ambiguous characters. Almost all of them are a mix of good and bad traits.

I think a lot of readers hate that about her writing. They want all characters the be either perfect heroes they can root for, or villains they can hate, so they sort her complicated characters into these two narrow boxes, filing off any traits that don't fit neatly into the “hero” or “villain” box. They feel that this simplification improves the story.

A few readers have commented on my stories to this effect: “Aargh, I can't tell if this character is a good guy or a bad guy! This is so frustrating! Make up your mind!” I'm like, “This story isn't for you. Go read something else.”

*** Every single character subjected to bashing I saw had a depth of a puddle. The fact that good characters have flaws makes them human.

I feel like authors genuinely hate some of canon characters. That results in those characters in their stories being robbed of all the good features.

** Most HP characters(and just characters in fiction in general) have some very unpleasant facets to their personalities that don't get focused on enough for readers to be clearly told, 'hey, that's wrong'.

Dumbledore: Manipulative, Dishonest, Controlling, Foolish, Hypocritical, etc...

Molly: Xenophobic, Slut-Shamer, Controlling, Rude, etc...

Ron: Backstabber, Disloyal(at certain crucial parts), Jealous, Rude, etc...

Hermione: Controlling, Obnoxious, Rude, etc...

Sirius: Dishonest, Hypocritical, Prejudiced, Immature, Rude, etc...

All of these traits coming out in unpleasant abundance in GOOD Characters are very annoying and don't really get addressed much. All of them have said and done some very not-so-good things and instead of being properly addressed, it's all kind of pushed under the rug and Harry(and by extension we the audience) are expected to just accept that it won't be addressed and that magically, the wronged people got over it/should get over it immediately despite the severity of being wronged.

A lot of times it's cathartic to see Good Characters held accountable for their flaws. Sometimes this is literally just holding them accountable(which many will claim is 'bashing' and 'unfair to do') and others it's just taking their most negative flaws and worsening them by 1000%(which is actual bashing depending on the context of the story).

Bashing can be very fun to read if you need a certain kind of story. Sometimes it can feel like it doesn't fit in the story's narrative though, even with characters who do a lot of bash-worthy things. Most of the time Dumbledore Bashing is my go-to but I don't want to read that all the time. Some fics don't even do it very well and just annoy me. And I don't like it coming out of nowhere and not being tagged. I read bashing fics for the 'Good Character' who is made morally bad in the fic, to get their comeuppance in a well-deserved manner, and for usually no other reason.

Also, I think a lot of us may have experience with someone who acts like the character in question does(in canon or the fic in particular) and seeing them get what they deserve is nice since irl, such people most likely WON'T be held accountable for their actions. It almost feels like you're the one getting justice in a sense.

** Bashing is a way to put a fictional person down. They are not the protagonist at all. They are there to make a character, usually the viewpoint character, look good in comparison. They typically lose in every situation to the protagonist. Idk why people want to read someone constantly getting their way rather than fighting for every victory. It would make them sweeter, I think.

I want to see a fic where the viewpoint character is a kid and all the adults get /bashed/. The reality is that the child isn't winning, the adults are backing out of the situation that involves an annoying kid that just /has/ to have the last word. The child grows up and matures near the end and people talk about how they wanted to punch them in the face when they were younger because they were so bad and disrespectful.

They are glad that the main character has learned some respect and are now mature enough to hold a conversation with.

** If you're actively seeking it it can depend on the fandom. Sometimes it's a need to aggressively defend a character by making other characters unforgivably awful. That usually happens when there is a large schism in canon. Sometimes it's that there are two BIG FAVES and it's a mine is better than yours thing. They feel the other characters did their fave a dirty. Sometimes they just don't want that character to like the bashed character and have them reject them. Sometimes it's fandom politics. The HP fandom is weird to me because the bashing seems to come with a certain type of fic rather than the reasons I'm familiar with.

** It's an hater thing. It's not about the character to be unlikable, it's about the character to be utterly hated and blamed from other characters because the author hates him/her. It isn't an exemple of good writing. It's anti Mary Sue, opposite intention, same effect.
