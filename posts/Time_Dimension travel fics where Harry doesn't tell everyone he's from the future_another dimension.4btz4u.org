I'm looking for time travel fics where Harry doesn't tell everyone he's from the future. Maybe he's summoned, and no one knows his backstory, or he's thrown into the past, and no one finds out.

But I want good time/dimension travel stories where Harry tries his hardest to keep his past life hidden, with minimal brooding about how he can't tell anyone.

One of my absolute /favorites/ is linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe). It feels so much more /true/ to Harry's character, in my opinion, that he stays silent about his past.

(I posted something similar [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lnjz6/lf_good_timedimension_traveling_fics_where_harry/][a few months ago]], but I've finished reading most of those)

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

**** It's not a great literary work, but it's thoroughly readable, which much fanfiction isn't. It's certainly sometimes saccharine but that's not all bad, and it's well tempered with emotional and ethical complexity and some darkness.
