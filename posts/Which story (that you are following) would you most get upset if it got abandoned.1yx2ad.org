For me it would be Harry Crow.

** The author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Future Past]] said it was next on his to-do list last September (Last Updated October 2012). Excitement got the best of me and I re-read it. I would be very annoyed if it never did update again.

** I follow the author on Tumblr, so I know it hasn't been abandoned, but the several months in between each chapter of *The Life and Times* will kill me one of these days. This is, hands down, the best canon fanfiction I have ever read. If they ever made a TV show about the Marauders, it would follow this story. It's long enough to be several books already (the total word count surpasses "War and Peace" for example), but she's probably got another fifteen chapters left to go. It physically hurts. The last time she updated was back in August.

I mean, I know you can't say too much without spoilers, but the description you've posted, while well written and interesting, makes me think the whole 600,000+ words are "and here's the story of how James and Lily fell in love".... and while romance and sap are all well and delicious... I don't like it to be the one and only focus of a story. And, so, there are 600,000 words! There must be plot beyond that. :)

**** Definitely. I wouldn't say that romance is the main focus of the story, although the idea of "love" and what it means crops up in a lot of the story lines. The story follows several characters (over 10), with Lily and James being the main focus of the story. Other notable characters are of course the Marauders (Sirius, Remus, and Peter), and Lily's friends as well (Mary, Marlene, and Donna). Snape plays a HUGE role, and we get to see a bunch of the early Death Eaters in addition to him.

The story opens at the beginning of their sixth year, so we start out seeing the classic "they hated each other" dynamic between James and Lily (who, by the way, are the most well defined characters I've ever seen in a fanfiction - no Mary Sue or Gary Stu). Over the plot we see events such as the rise of Voldemort, the moment when Sirius tries to kill Snape with werewolf Remus, Snape's final turn against Lily, an amazing protest in the Ministry of Magic (sorry if that's spoiler-y, but that's my favorite chapter), Head Boy and Head Girl, and an exceptionally dark event that literally makes you cry (seriously, I sobbed over a fanfiction).

Jules is a very good writer, but the story kind of reads like the narration in a TV show (think How I Met Your Mother, Pushing Daisies, Arrested Development, etc - "but more on that later" and an annoying chapter where we see the events of one day from several different perspectives). There's also a lot of slutty characters who like to sleep around, and James and Lily each have romantic interests while they deny their interests in each other (we'll call them "obstacles"). I can see why some people wouldn't like it, but it is definitely my favorite fanfiction. If you want a romance story with more than just the stereotypical fall-in-love plot (spoilers: they are still not "together" by chapter 36), then I would suggest this in a heartbeat. Jules focuses a lot on the war and how that affects people. I mean, the vibe I get from the story is not only do you want James and Lily to get together, but you also want them to tear apart all their enemies with a vengeance. There's a part in the most recent chapter where they pretty much promise each other that they will fight Voldemort together.

Have you ever heard the phrase, "Don't Chase the Quaffle If You See the Snitch"? It comes from TLAT. Tumblr is pretty fond of that phrase, and I want to put it on a t-shirt.

*** Having JUST finished harry crow... It wasn't terrible. I've read a lot worse. The biggest problem I had with it wasn't that harry was a perfect little warrior.. it was that harry and hermoine both were angels. And repeatedly reminded everyone about it. "Oh harry, I love you, and you make my stomach feel funny but we are much too young to take out relationship further."

It.. how to say.. It was written by a dad. That's what it felt like for me. They know how it feels to look at their kids, and the memories of what it was like to be 13 and hormonal are far enough away that they don't want to remember them in context with these kids.

My other big issue is that you could have cut the length by half easily. There was SO. Much. "and then they did this and that and the other thing and then they did this and this and by the way they're excersizing all the time, and then they did this plot relevant thing before working out more and christmas happened and they kicked some ass on school stuff and then they did this and that then THIS plot relevant thing happened and it was pretty exciting and here was some fall out for that but now they're going for their morning run again and eating breakfast and....

and yeah. But then at other points, they skipped over things so quickly. "and school ends, then the next chapter, summer ball is starting after several weeks of vacation. It's.. better that we don't have to sit through weeks of "and then they went tot he beach" and such, but it's jarring to barely mention it's passing after there was literally a chapter or two put in to figuring out who would be going, where and when.

Also kinda annoyed they skipped over some relevant plot items. big party that we've been talking about for chapters as being a big deal? happened between chapters? Wedding between two major characters? mentioned, not seen on screen. And yet we see that they're going jogging again.

All that said, there were some pretty cool parts. I liked how the stuff with the chamber of secrets plays out. I like some of the stances Harry takes. I like some of the details. But at the same point in time, the author is setting up a perfect little playground for his pieces to play in. The pieces he doesn't like (snape, dumbledor, umbridge, lockheart, slughorn, etc) are quickly removed or depowered, and those he does like are buffed (sirius, Fudge, Bones all come to mind)

all together, this story would have been way better, if it was about half as long. if nothing else so there would be far less to try and eat through.

I was reading mostly because I liked fragments of world building, and was interested in the story, but it was SO LONG.

sorry, had that on my chest to get off :)

**** I hate any story that showers Harry (or whatever character they happen to be writing about, but really it's always Harry) with superpowers, unusual abilities, knowledge, wealth, etc. for no real reason other than fulfilling a silly power fantasy. There's no real conflict, just a series of events that always work out in Harry's favor.

I guess immature power fantasies appeal to an awful lot of people given how popular fics like Harry Crow are, but I don't get it.

I don't mind long stories or even powerful Harry stories, I like Sacrifices, but it needs actual conflict and character development.

***** I dislike them as well. But I could KINDA get around it in Harry Crow because parts of it were a reasonable chain of events: He's taken in by Gringotts, raised a goblin. They help to ensure his bank accounts are treated correctly, and that he is well trained. That's... reasonable, and a lot of the plot revolves around the fact that he's a goblin.

That said, he seems to waltz through wizard society fantastically, he is a fantastic fighter, and he's redonkulously rich. like, Oh my god, how rich. Like, oh, you bought fancy clothing for half the school. Again. wat. That could have been scaled back. a lot. The multiple summer vacations around the world were silly wishfulfillment.

I much prefer stories where there is conflict and difficulty. Like, I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills]] right now, and it's pretty awesome. It feels, so far, like it could have been a harry potter book in the series itself. and that's pretty cool. The author has evoked a whole lot of emotion in simple scenes like an older brother being brotherly of his siblings. I found myself crying at scenes that weren't even that SAD. And it had the kids being.. kids too. Goofing off and laughing. And that appeals to me WAY more then Harry Potter and the string of petty challenges. (I don't know how it ends, but it is complete... but, you might like it as well)

Can I get a link to Sacrifices? I LOVE long stories :) (i'd google, but there are probably a thousand stories with that name)

...and dare I ask about "in this world and the next"? I don't want to give more of my time to reading his crap when I know it's terrible. I looked at the description. .. is it the classic "and I dislike the weasleys, so I'm going to paint them as terrible villains and try to make you hate 'em too?" I suspect it goes deeper then that :C

I had to stop reading In This World and the Next after like 3-4 chapters. It's just psychotic. Ron rapes Hermione, Harry kills Ron because of it, Harry and Hermione get sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, the Dementor explodes after Kissing them and they get sent back in time. Harry and Hermione (along with Hermione's parents who are told about the time travel) start plotting against the Weasleys even though they haven't even done anything wrong yet in this new timeline, like seriously discussing murdering Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince Of The Dark Kingdom]]

This fic has many problems. The writing ranges from decent to brilliant for one. There are horrible tense changes in the middle of chapters that are really jarring. The first 100 or so chapters suffer from pretty terrible spelling and grammar.

That said, the world building and characters are just /too fucking good/ for me to give up. I read the fic over a period of 3 days, and now I want it finished so bad. It's just so original, with all the characters being OOC, and yet they all fit perfectly. The action is good, the story spectacular, and the /world building/ is just so damn perfect.

*** Prince of the dark kingdom.. unnnf.. I fucking love that story.

I don't notice the tense changes myself (but when I write, I have SO much trouble staying in the right tense), but some of the spelling errors make me twitch a little... .... that said. IT IS SO GOOD. I LOVE how it goes. I love how the world is built.

This was the story that made me go "holy shit, Harry potter Fanfic is awesome." I think I was on tvtrope's "for want of a nail" fic rec page and Prince of the Dark Kingdom was right on top. I love the world building. I love the characters. I love how all the characters feel REAL and feel like themselves, even if they're totally different. (like Ron! he's different, yet I can see Ron in him perfectly.)

This was the story that made me fall in love with [[/s%20Snape%20becoming%20a%20father%20figure/mentor%20to%20Harry...%20as%20well%20as%20Voldemort%20becoming%20Harry's%20mentor...%20%20and%20their%20soul%20bond.%20%20and%20..%20%20unnnf!][Spoilers!]] ...

I wish there were more stories, too, that dealt with a WELL WRITTEN Voldemort. There are COUNTLESS stories where Voldie is basically some frothing raving psycho with no ability to think ahead, use foresight, or plan past "First I will capture Harry Potter, and then I will kill Harry Potter.. mwahahahaa" ... the stories where he is, actually, a very clever man who is actually a threat to the wizarding world, and not just an explosion waiting to go off. (and yeah, I totally get that some authors do the things where Voldie split his soul so much that he's lost himself, but SO much of the time that feels more like an excuse for not being able to write clever plots. (I can't write clever plots, so, not being critical there..)

also I love the [[/s%20Pagan][spoiler]] magic!... it's rare you see authors really go digging down into the whats and whys and have anything out there other then Windgardium leviosahs. (Oh man, and don't get me started on stories where everyone basically refers to the killing curse as "AK" .. as in "He AK'ed him"... fucking hate that.) ... the author has put so much thought into the world they made.

**** Warning: Spoilers ahead, I don't know how to tag them like Colby, and to be honest I'm a bit too lazy to bother. Don't read ahead if you haven't read PoTK.

You pretty much described everything I love about PoTDK. The thing that /really/ cinched it for me as the best HP fanfiction I've ever read, was definitely the world, and in particular the werewolf camps. The way the author turned them into a refuge for Harry (no seriously, spoilers right after this shit), and then tore away that refuge by killing everyone in the Goddess Moon colony. I actually cried a bit during it, I'm not going to lie. Any /fanfiction/ that can get me to cry is amazing.

Beyond that, the intricacy of the characters is amazing, starting with Voldemort and going straight down. There is not a /single/ character in PoTDK that isn't a full, round character (besides /maybe/ Pettigrew, but he's hardly in it at all). Characters that are introduced off handedly in the first couple chapters come 140 chapters later to be major game changers in a way you'd never expect. It's really amazing the detail the author put into this fanfiction.

I don't think it's an exaggeration at all to say that if Mizuni-Sama fixed up his/her writing style (or at least, rewrote the first 135-ish chapters to the quality found in the last 10), and changed the name of his characters and magic school, PoTDK could be its own novel. I finished the fic in 3 days, reading it at work, taking care of my 10 month old, and trying to function on no sleep. I then immediately reopened it to my favorite chapters, and reread them. It's so fucking amazing.

If you're looking for another "Voldemort won" fic that has decent characters and world building, I'm currently reading [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501][The Train To Nowhere]], which is pretty good. To be honest, it really doesn't hold a candle to PoTDK, but it's still good. It's slash, but I'm 11 chapters in, and it hasn't been prominent yet. I've yet to find any fic that has as good world building as PoTDK unfortunately, but I'd really love to encounter some.

***** Oh gosh the WEREWOLVES. I loved the werewolves SO MUCH. What they did with them, it was so REAL. I could SEE THAT really happening... ANd I loved how harry slowly got pressed into politics and he's on his way to becoming.. well.. prince. LOVE that.

and how they made the Goddess Colony into a refuge then ripped it away? horribly beautiful. I think I cried a little too, honestly. though I more remember every.. heart stopping moment of Harry and Voldemort interacting. That.. fantastic banter, the sharp edges, and the warmth. I LOVE how Voldemort will come tearing in after harry to save him. I think one of my favorite scenes with them was when Voldemort explains to harry that they are MORE then family.

As for characters that are not wellrounded.. pettigrew does come to mind. I remember not enjoying "tom" as much.. but thats' because he's single mindedly obsessed I supose. Creeper. XD

I've read through POTDK twice so far. I'm getting ready for a third run through sometime soon.

I wish Mizuni-sama had a webpage, or .. something where there was fan art, and.. .. more. I just want more that I can wallow in.

it's so nice to have another fan to gibber at, though. I've tried SO. Hard. to pass the fanfic on to my other friends but "i'ts too long" or "I didn't like it" and it makes me wanna cry :C

I"ll load Train to Nowhere up on my Kindle now~ :D

Let's see.. waht can I offer in return....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favorite]] by the Fictionist - It is ... it's an interesting story. It's not a "voldemort wins" story, but.. hm... So something weird happens, and Harry ends up traveling back in time and spending about a year in 1940-whatever going to school with Tom Riddle. And they end up being pretty good friends. Then Harry ends up back in his own time. Tom, and several of his friends, travel FORWARD in time to Harry's present and land on top of him in the Great Hall. And that's where the story begins.

It is... a really intense story. It's not slash, but it's about a really close friendship. It's not always a good friendship, but it's an intense one. The biggest problems with it are that the author spends a lot of time on dialog and character interaction--which really is glorious, honestly, but sometimes I missed bits of the plot between the lines because I tend to read when I'm sleepy. It's quite long (315K words) and an enjoyable read. If you like that sort of thing. Tom and Harry are very detailed characters, there is a lot of witty banter, and the characters are genuinely intelligent. And Tom, like Voldemort in POTDK, does not hide the fact that he is Not a Nice Person, and definitely doesn't pretend to be anything but the genius psychopath that he is. That said, the story is complete, and there's a prequel being written. And the author has several other stories focused on Tom and Harry in different configurations if you end up liking it. That ALSO said, this wasn't a masterpiece in world building. Good details, well thought out story with good give and take between characters, but it is a lot more focused on the CHARACTERS rather then the world.

Hm. Thinking about it, I do lack stories where the world building is so prominent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/562135/GreenGecko][GreenGecko]] has written a series... Resonance, Revolution and Resolution that was rather awesome. still in progress. It covers.. about 4 years I think, and details, I THINK a fair bit about day to day wizarding life and magic. It's a snape!father figure story and starts out really rough (It is 1,713,000 ish words long. And was started in 2004, so some roughness is allowed, I think) ... it is a fantastic story if you, like me, tend to read to the end of an adventure, and go "but what happens NEXT?" as the story (mild spoilers) deals with defeating Voldemort. And then.. life continues. And there are new conflicts that arise. And the really cool thing is that there are plot seeds planted in the FIRST CHAPTER that start coming up all throughout the rest of the series and we honestly having even figured out the "big mystery" of why yet, or how. And in the latter half of the series, they've got a lot more polish to their story writing. I think I would include it on my "top three list of best HP fanfic EVER." On that list also is POTDK. The other..

The [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] stories, by [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=781][aspeninthesunlight]].. it's three stories. A Year Like None Other, a Summer Like None Other, and A Family Like None Other... about 1,388,000 words in total. Yes, I do like long fic. :) It has had a brand new chapter posted recently too! It is... a story covering a year or two. It's ANOTHER snape!father figure story. It's about people learning to trust each other, and a family learning how to be a family. I can't remember a lot of the details right now, but it's a fantastic story. It, as many stories do, starts off somewhat rough and polishes nicely over time.

I could read those three over and over again. I rarely reread stories <3 I"m thinking about it right now, though, pretty hard. :D Oh, neither of those are slash. :)

okay I"ve rambled far long enough now... ^{^{;}}

It's a SB/RL slash and it may be the best SB/RL I've ever read to be honest. It starts a little before their first year and it's currently on their sixth or seventh year I think. The author is still updating but only about one or two chapters a year or so. Coincidentally, he is the same author of the other story I don't want to be abandoned.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4238196/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marauders-of-the-Mind][Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind]]*

It's actually a sort of sequel to the one listed above, as events that happened during that story are mentioned in here so it makes a great companion fiction. Basically the souls of Lily, James, Remus, and Sirius all went into Harry when he used the resurrection stone and he is trying to find a way to restore their bodies with the whole master of death thing. It sounds cliche but it's a great story and I would hate if either of these were abandoned.

Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.

'Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? '

Kind of a bland description I know, but it's a really great story. It's a crossover with Marvel though that's only recently come into play. It's almost over 300k word count, and the author updates every other week or so. He writes in arcs though and he won't start posting any chapters in a new arc until he finishes writing it, so he's likely to not update for a month or two since he just finished the third arc. It's only been a few days but it's already killing me
