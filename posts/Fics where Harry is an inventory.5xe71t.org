I've always been interested in how thins in the magical world are created.

Over 100k+ words, no romance.

EDIT: Inventor, not inventory ;-;


** Inventor*, not inventory. The latter doesn't make sense.

Most are rune-enchanting nonsense (no, I'm not getting into that argument). But here are two off the top of my head: linkffn(Bungle In the Jungle) and linkffn(RuneMaster by Tigerman)

It's also a large part of one of my favorite two fics: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone).

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race.
