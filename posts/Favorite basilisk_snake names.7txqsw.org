I've been trying to remember the names of some snakes and basilisks from fics I've read. I like fics where Harry (or other parselmouths) have a snakey friend, but some of the names are dumb.

** Shoshana.

It means "Rose" in Hebrew, and roses are elegant, and snakes [can be] are elegant, and it's a very hissable name.

** JÃ¶rmungandr is one I may use in darkness ascendant for a very, very tiny snake. I'm debating three names for a runespoor that will also be in da.

**** Jormungandr is the world snake. He circles midgard(earth), clutching its tail. When it releases it, ragnarok begins. The tiny, Tiny one will be a ring that harry can spy with based on sning from piers anthony's incarnations series.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.
