** It could us some actual explanations. What are the three brothers, stories, stars, whatever, and how do they actually connect to Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore? You're trying so hard to be mysterious that all you've done is be confusing.

  What do you think of this complicated theory?

It leaves me confused. Your post did prompt me to check the meaning of Remus. [[http://129.74.15.137/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=remus&ending=][I checked with University of Notre Dame]] and Remus technically means /oar/, which does have connections to rowing.

 

Give [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lr7e1/internallyconsistent_reason_for_why_hp_characters/][this recent thread]] a read, it on the "overly appropriate" names of HP.

** Is this inspired by that scene in Black Dynamite? Or are you really high?
