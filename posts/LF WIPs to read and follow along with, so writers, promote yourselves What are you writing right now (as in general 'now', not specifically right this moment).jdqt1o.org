So, I'm looking for some WIPs (I like the serialisation feel of following along with updates) and, wondering what our writery types are up to right now, was hoping for some people to post exactly that. So, tell us what you're writing or what you're working on, and feel free to chat about the ideas and inspirations or interesting side-details behind the works too (if you want, no pressure - I'm just curious and like the poke behind the magician's curtain).

Also, please provide a link, if the thing you're working on is uploaded. :)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

Linkffn( A New Better Life by Ulltima101)

It follows a Harry who has a real drive for learning and protecting his friends. Dumbledore is a bit mentorish, Draco is going to be a rival eventually. Im coming up on the end of first year where I plan to end the first story and start its sequel at the end of that summer.

I'm currently on a biweekly rotating schedule. 1 week I write for this Harry Potter story, the other week I write for my My hero academia story. I randomly update my Naruto story.

The main events of books will still happen but details will be drastically different as the previous little stuff starts to build up

Also thank you for reading. I really want to thank everyone who reads my stories even if they dont review, but it always sounds so Insincere when you put it at the top of chapters.

********* It has corrected. The 'chapter 2:' bit has gone.

Details do make a story, I totally agree. I think it's finding the balance between the amount of details you have and the amount of words you use to describe each detail. Like, if you use a thousand words to describe one detail, that's probably too much, but a thousand words to describe five-hundred details would probably be too little.

No worries at all. I've been there. "Omigod, people read my nonsense!!! Maybe it isn't nonsense after all, I'm so glad and I can probably keep doing this!" Heh. Better to be grateful, even insincerely sounding gratitude, than not grateful at all, in my book. :)

*** That is an interesting premise. Oddly appropriate for the coming of age type themes of Harry Potter too, come to think of it. The Teenage Years are basically just a decade of "Who the heck am I? Maybe I could be that with them?", after all. Plus, a more seductive and cunning Tom Riddle is definitely more interesting than the aimless lunatic Rowling came up with.

The not speaking thing is an interesting touch, too. I haven't seen many fics try to work with a speechless angle like that. Does that feature strongly in your plot, or is it more a supportive element for other things?

  When Lukas Black was seven, or maybe eight, he opened his eyes to a back alley and found he couldn't remember anything beside his own name. Not even how to speak. Stranger yet is the boy with a lightning scar calling for him while chasing Lukas down a street.Jack used to be a Malfoy, but now he's a fugitive with a skull and a serpent branded across his arm. The discovery of his old friend's son on the streets gives him the purpose he needs to pull himself off rock bottom. It's just a shame that the Dark Lord and his lieutenant don't have the good grace to stay dead.With fractured memories and a hunger for power sleeping beneath his skin, Lukas steps into the wizarding world with his teeth bared. Strange dreams haunt his night and a boy called Tom who lives in Ravenclaw's diadem calls him by another's name, and Lukas has to uncover the secret behind these hidden memories before they drive him insane.Tom is a blessing, a sanctuary against the nightmare that claws out Lukas's mind, but the further he falls into Tom's gravity, the more Lukas questions what's really going on behind Tom's acid-brown eyes....Does Tom want Lukas to lose his mind?

** Last update to Victoria Potter was in August. That was the climax of Year 2. The next chapter is the final chapter of Year 2, wrapping things up. However, before writing that I have been planning Year 3 in detail which has been taking more time than anticipated - I had a general direction for Year 3 in mind from the start, but the specifics were not planned until now. Lots of spreadsheets involved.

Probably another couple of weeks before the Year 3 plan is finalised, at which point I can get back to putting words on a page.

One big change for Year 3 is that I am trying to have it so that I have shorter, more frequent chapters. This should help me maintain writing momentum, I think, rather than taking 2 months to write mega 14k word chapters.

** I'm writing a Percy Weasley centric story. It doesnt have any bashing in it but I'm trying to be realistic to how the rest of yeh Weasleys would react. It's an AU, set in the summer before HBP. So all the events that happened in the 4th/5th happened except no one but those that went with Harry to the department of mysteries saw Voldemort; so the rest of the wizarding world and Fudge never saw him. Anyhow, enough of me rambling. Here's the link:

*** I've gotta say, your first chapter has grabbed me. Little tell-ey in places (he felt this, he felt that), but the look into Percy's head is fun and interesting and I'll definitely be adding it to the list. It'll be interesting to see what you do with the No-Voldemort-Reveal idea later on. :)

Thanks for the self-rec! :)

** I'm currently working on an OOTP era AU crackfic set during a pandemic. It's slash, but all the action happens off screen. It's currently ongoing and I'm going to try and continue it until either the pandemic ends or it meets or bests OOTP in page count, whichever comes first and/or feels right. As of today it has 45 chapters.

Well, I read so you've decided to be evil by Evadne, but it hasn't been updated since 2007, so i decided to write my own version. Basically, a fanfic of a fanfic, but i probably will not publish so I won't be accused of plagirsm.

And fair enough. If you actually state that you're inspired by Evadne's work, you probably won't get too many accusations though.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

  Petunia's love for astrology rubbed off on her nephew. So when Harry Potter met Sybill Trelawney, a real-life seer who could tell the future, it was only natural that he'd be drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Follow the coming of age journey of a young boy, a child of Prophecy, as he divines the secrets of fortune, friendship, fame, and just might find love along the way.

Seven years later, he's near graduation with only a few Acceptable OWL scores, a string of broken hearts, and enough notches on his bedpost to bring down a redwood tree.

*** Sounds like your first fic (A Simple Act) is a bit of a 'poke at the fridge horror of canon' type fic, from the description, anyway. I take it the story focuses more on the dark and gritty than the magical and wonderful? Interesting first chapter though. I don't think I've seen another fic where /that/ happened.

Divination Rom-Com is another one of those phrases I never thought I'd hear and am not thoroughly surprised I never have. Goes right alongside 'Secret Boss Kneazle' for that. What kind of Luna do you write for that fic?

Mildly amused by 'Lonely Lothario' as it sounds like a phrase cheesily written in Middle-Aged American Woman Erotica, but the story itself sounds interesting. We definitely need more 'meddling in Harry's life that is actually for his own good' type fics.
