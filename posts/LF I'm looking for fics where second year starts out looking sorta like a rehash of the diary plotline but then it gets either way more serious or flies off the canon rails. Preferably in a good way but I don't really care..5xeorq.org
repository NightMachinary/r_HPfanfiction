#+TITLE: LF I'm looking for fics where second year starts out looking sorta like a rehash of the diary plotline but then it gets either way more serious or flies off the canon rails. Preferably in a good way but I don't really care.

Examples:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game][Harry Potter and the Game]]

  - /really/ liked the explanation of why nobody knew what the creature was and why nobody died in this one. Also loved the Lockhart bits and the chapters from Diary's perspective.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]]

  - Loved what they did with Lockhart and the firewall stuff. Made things interesting.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal with a Devil]]

  - Really liked how attacks got spiced up and that twist near the end was great.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a Baby?]]

  - Dumbledore doesn't care. At all.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

  - A little weird but pretty fun. I don't remember it much though. Waiting until I completely forget everything about the fic before I do a reread.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778267/1/Beyond-the-Pale][Beyond the Pale]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12014738/1/Tom-Riddle-and-the-Fate-Worse-Than-Death][Tom Riddle and the Fate Worse than Death]]

  - A humorous take of Tom's talks with Ginny.

- That fic that's entirely Ginny talking to the diary.

  - I think it was called "The very Something diaries" Not my favorite but it was nice to see things from a different perspective.

- Pureblood Pretense second year

  - I'm not the biggest fan of the ideas behind that version. It and the stuff first year seemed kinda horrifyingly shortsighted given Riddle's apparent political acumen and I never really bought into the reasons that the author gave. (if I'm remembering it right)

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

**** Woah! That sounds like a great plot device! The old spunk could be from the time he an McGonagall did it but it's not spunk because they were doing it in animagus form (Dumbledore turns into a horse) with some coprophilia. See Dumbledore's been into that stuff since Grimdelwald shat all over his life and he killed his sister for making fun of it. Anyway back to what I was saying the shit would be a plot device since Hermione's mother's are dentists and they obviously have experience in that sort of thing (the dealing with shit and horses part at least. They're british so someone with horse teeth instead of human isn't entirely unexpected) so Hermione's probably into that stuff htoo. Now I know that it's only third year so they aren't the most sexually active but I really think that you should give it some thought I mean with the time turner Hermione's probably living like a week for every day, right? That makes her legal about 3/4 of the way through the year and then it's only sorta illegal for her to do it with Harry since he's probably using his pokemon (Celebi and Dialga of course) to make himself legal so he can get in on some action with a harem of 8th years who are all female and veela and into stuff (yeah that's not canon but shut up! They're all at least 18 and they want Harry!) so then there's a LickitungTangrowth couple that wanders in on Harry, Hermione, Supergirl, Sakura, Power Girl and Konan (they're transfer students) and it starts going at it because that's what pokemon do (I read real manga, not that kiddie bullshit Nintendo pumps out. I know the truth!). Anyway so they finish up and they're all covered it Pokemon stuff yeah I know, you're in bonor city already, right? But back to the story (there is one and believe me it's gonna be /so/ good.) See when the transfer students arrived Dumbledore tried to memoimperiormentia charm them in his effort to get his dusty old dick up again so he could keep contributing to his cum collecting underwear that he really doesn't want to give up on since he'd cum on it everyday until he hit 70 and really, giving up on something like that would be criminal. That all means they need to work against the incompetent sex obsessed Headmaster oh god I just remebered what that picture of the underwear looked like I need togo barf one sec okay back now like I was saying Dumbledore is incompetant at everything because Harry is competant. It's like Victor from worm except instead of gaining the skills Harry multiplies them and comes up with ways to use them to get laid (he's legal now so HA!) and destructify Voldemort with the true power of love (it's explosions).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
