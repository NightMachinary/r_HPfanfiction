** Linkffn(Stages of Hope)

Luna is one of the main characters, though not the main character.

*** This has one of my favorite Lunas. Her storytelling of how they are and came to be is fantastical, and embodies that Luna lives in a metaphor, not entirely in the real world like the rest of us.

**** Have you got any fics to recommend?

Harry/Luna is the pairing that makes the most sense to me and is my favourite also. So if you got what I need, hook a brother up.

I can only think of cracky fics with luna in at the moment such as

linkffn(2390865)

or fics in which it's all a mask.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.

** I've always been a fan of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby.]] It's a little hard to explain what it's about without it seeming weird.

**** Just a word of warning if you try to read: if you can't read through a scene where religious influences cause the victim to apologise to someone who hurt them, no matter what the intentions of the one who hurt them were, then spare yourself the effort because you'll just throw it down in rage and/or annoyance.

If you can read that, though, then I can only say “have fun”.

  Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

  #+begin_example
      The title of this fic comes from the song lyrics of Fly Me Away by Goldfrapp\. Specifically the lyric, "The crazy little things that you do are magical\." Something that I think perfectly suits Luna\. The band itself has a very ethereal and mysterious quality that reminds me of Luna\.
