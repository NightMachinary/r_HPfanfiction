The Students get pushed too far, and either lock up, or wipe out everyone with a Dark Mark, and either kill, or find someone capable of using Imperio on the Carrows (and Snape, for cover) to keep sending the "All Clear" message, so Voldemort never knows that the School has been taken back, because he has no reason to suspect.


** Why on Snape for cover?

To the knowledge of the students he totally is one of them and if they overpower them he would be the first to go under. Would you belief it if the one responsible for the suffering tries to tell you, nono that guy ask me to kill him and told nobody about it...?

*** Carrows would go first. If no Death Eaters were around, Snape would likely reveal himself to save his own life.

**** Yes Carrows and Snape.

Yes Snape would maybe try to reveal himself and who would believe him in such a high stress situation? Would you give a terrorist that allowed people to be tortured to prove his innocence? Would you give him maybe even the chance to pull a fast one on you?

Maybe, big maybe, Slughorn. But would he really stick out his head for Snape? McGonagall? Why should she? She saw him murder Dumbledore and why exactly should Dumbledore trust the ex-death eater more than her, who was always on the right side and his right hand in everything? The students? Don't make me laugh...

Maybe he wouldn't be killed, because you need him for example polyjuice to trick Voldemort. Maybe he could use that time to convince people, but it would be really hard and they would suspect him of lying at every turn.

***** You can tell when someone's fighting the Imperius, as proven with Harry. Tell Snape "If you're really on our side, don't fight this, and answer truthfully" Imperio him, and then make him answer truthfully. As for that, You'd need Snape to keep Voldemort from coming with his army and killing you all.

Imperio is the answer really, I assume McGonagall and Flitwick are both capable of casting it, even if the student saren't (Harry could, so i assume Ginny and/or Neville could) You can tell if someone's resisting Imperio or completely under.

****** Can you? You see them struggle because they don't want to follow an order...

How to you know they are not just pretending and McGonagall and Flitwick know that he can use Occlumenty...

**** Yeah. Snape is a little too self-serving for my taste. I'd rather they tie him up, get some veritisum(?), and interrogate him. Not sure if it's fanon, but could Occulmancy curb the truth potions effects.

Thanks,\\

***** Veritaserum, and it CAN be resisted in canon, it's supposedly (according to the source materials) like a Magical version of a Polygraph, I guess if it was absolute, then all the Death Eaters would have been in Azkaban

****** It could be resisted but I doubt every deatheater is a master of the mind arts and/or a potion master, I would rather believe in the fanon theory of being protected due to pureblood advantages
