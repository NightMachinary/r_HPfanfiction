Are there any?

Edit: been asked to be more specific. Well, I'm just looking for some new stories because I've read all of those posted on ffn. Everything except harems is fine, although I prefer the relationship-focused ones if possible. Thanks in advance


** Are you searching for a specific Harry/Gabrielle story? If so, you're going to need to be /way/ more specific.

If this is a request for recommendations of Harry/Gabrielle stories, you'll probably also need to be more specific and change your tag.

** An Old and New World - Lens of Sanity

â€‹

It was pulled off FFN a while ago so there is a chance it is new to you. There is a french translation by another author on FFN otherwise there should be an archive copy posted somewhere. (I feel kinda iffy posting a direct link to something an author decided to pull)
