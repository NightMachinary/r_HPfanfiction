"Welcome, dear children, to your first day on the journey to greatness. Your first day...\\
As Slytherins.\\
I know that some of you dreaded finding yourselves here - I can hear a sniffle or two, it's alright.\\
Doubtlessly you've heard all manner of stories - that we are "evil" wizards... that we served L... "Tom Riddle"... in his ruinous attempt at revolution. That we EAT!... children...\\
Whether these things are true or not... is something each of you should put much thought into during your time at Hogwarts.\\
But truly - if every wizard destined for Slytherin was wicked, or was to be the next Dark Lord... surely, what would drive them to suffer such a house? The moment the Sorting Hat placed you here, why, a team of wizards would scoop you up, and simply drown you in the Black Lake, wouldn't they?\\
And some would think them right to do it.\\
However - here you are. A newly minted member of one of the oldest, grandest, most respected Wizarding houses in all the world. Because, like many things... the truth... is often far more complex than it may at first appear.\\
Here at Slytherin, a blind lust for power has no place. Leave that to Ravenclaw.\\
Nor are we so foolish to believe, as they do in Gryffindor, that magic is some tameable beast, which bends and twists itself to serve some end arbitrarily defined by it's wielder.\\
And we certainly take little interest in... whatever Hufflepuff believes to-day.\\
No. Here at Slytherin, we respect magic for what it is: a powerful, wild force, greater than we can imagine, with an inscrutible morality that we dare not, in our hubris, believe aligns itself to match our own.\\
We believe that Magic is a thing to be served, and sacrificed for, if we hope to be worthy to hold some reflection of it within ourselves.\\
That, if anything, is the secret of Slytherin's greatness - we alone ask so little of magic, while doing our best to ascertain its will in the Wizarding World.\\
Our task is to be, each of us, the finest possible instruments of its expression. And as those instruments, know that to look down upon us, is to look down on magic itself.\\
The one insult that no true Slytherin can bear.\\
Many of you clearly still fear the shadow of the wizard called Voldemort upon this place.\\
And I tell you, it is true. He is here.\\
But only every bit as much as the groundskeeper, and the architects, and those who have magicked the mildew from the fixtures in the water closet. Because like all of them, his goal... his place... was to serve. To serve magic, and, in his "misguided" way, to serve us.\\
No matter what you may have heard of his methods, his weaknesses, his failures... he sought to serve. And in the weakness of his heart, his character - he failed. Perhaps one among you will be clever... or skilled... or gifted enough to serve properly... and gain, as Magic's own chosen favourite, every reward you could possibly imagine.

But for now, think not of such things. For we have arrived at your rooms. And look! We've conjured a special cart of sweets, just for you, children of Slytherin. Yes, don't rush, there's plenty for everyone - on one condition.\\
These sweets are not to be shared with those from the other houses. They are enchanted to know who consumes them. Should one touch the lips of a non-Slytherin, all will disappear. And then you'll have nothing setting yourselves apart from the others, will you?\\
So let's just keep this... our little secret...\\
Shall we?"

** /Slytherin orientation/ (synonyms: /ophidiosexuality/)

1. Sexual attraction to spoiled, whiny, bigoted blond brats who pretend to be some sort of aristocracy, but wouldn't know dignity if it punched them in the nose.

2. Sexual attraction to sallow, greasy-haired misanthropes with anger management issues, who can't let go of a decade-old dead crush and take their frustrations out on children they teach.

3. Sexual attraction to thoroughly politically neutral yet well-connected, politically savvy from a very young age, magically advanced, and usually blond Ice Queens, who were created mainly so that the cunning!independent!extra-badass!protagonist could have a 'ship worthy of his amazing specialness.

See also: Drarry; Dramione; Greengrass, Daphne; Snarry; Snamione.

**** I don't see how you got that from my post. Each of the three definitions of "Slytherin orientation" represents a 'ship for the protagonist with this sexual orientation (usually Harry or Hermione). So, HP+1 = Drarry, HP+2 = Snarry, HP+3 = HP/DG, HG+1 = Dramione, and HG+2 = Snamione.
