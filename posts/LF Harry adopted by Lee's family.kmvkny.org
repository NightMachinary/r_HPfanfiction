:END:
I vaguely recall a fanfic where Harry ends up adopted by Lee's family pre-Hogwarts. I don't remember anything else about it. I am hoping that this scenario is at least unique enough that even though I can't say anything else about it, someone out there would know about it and could tell me it's name. (I feel like there were some cute brotherly scenes that I would love to read again)

(I think the Jordan's didn't like Dumbledore and that Harry occasionally had bad flashback to his time with the Dursleys...if that helps at all, assuming its at all correct)
