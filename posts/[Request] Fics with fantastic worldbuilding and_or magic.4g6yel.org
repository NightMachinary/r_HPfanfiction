I'm a sucker for fantastic worldbuilding or interesting magic/traditions, etc. For examples- the whole Sacrifices Arc/Saving Connor has /amazing/ world building when it comes to traditions, the "pureblood dance" etc. Even the much-reviled HPMOR has some interesting magic going on with the Most Ancient and Noble houses.

So what fics have something interesting going on? Even if you don't dig it?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

This oft-recommended fic has a near canon rehash happening in the background while we see the world through the eyes of young wizard of Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald's caliber. It explores canon compliant magic in an new environment of Durmstrang complete with great OCs.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I've never read it, and I probably never will, but you might enjoy linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

Personally, I think the pranking that goes on in linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is really impressive and interesting, and only gets better as the Marauders enter their upper years.

**** Just caught up (or, more likely, finished. I'm guessing this is abandoned, unfortunately). In short: -Introduces a bunch of new magical concepts, most of which related to dueling, but also a decent amount of artificing as part of the war effort (Canon compliant up until GoF, then slight divergences before the start of the story). -Also has an incredible take on the underlying theory of magic that is strongly influenced by Eastern philosophy (I think. That's the impression I got). -Battle scenes are much better than canon and involve not only more magic, but more strategy. -Also establishes history going farther back than Canon, as it's linked to the current characters.

Overall, definitely worth reading. Just don't be angry when you get to the end and realize it's unfinished, like I did :P

** Greengecko's R series had some interesting magic going on, on a bigger scale and on a 'past Hogwarts' scale once you get to that point. Third story didn't get finished, but it was near completion (it felt like). linkffn(Resonance by greengecko)

linkffn(Roundabout destiny by maryroyale) had some interesting magic use and pureblood culture sprinkled throughout.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
