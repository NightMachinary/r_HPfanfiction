hey does anyone have any good fanfiction with the 'Voldemort wins the first war' au? I can't seem to find a lot of those which is kind of disappointing since the topic can be approached in many ways and is interesting to read, and even when i do Lily and James still seem to be dead...

i prefer completed fanfics and i don't mind slash.


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom is the best example of this. It is 1m+ words and is thought to be abandoned but what is there is nothing short of a masterpiece.

There is another abandoned fic called "Champion" where Voldemort won where Harry Evans, a halfblood, is entered into the Goblet. This draws Voldemort's ire, as he cannot just have Harry killed as it would cause an international scandal. It was deleted and I can't find my copy but what was there was very well done.

*** I read â€˜Champion' once and I'm pretty sure it's been taken down since then.

** linkffn(The Only Way to Wake Up by Amphryxia)

I'm writing an AU about this. It started out as a simple smut fic where Hermione was Pansy's maid, but I liked the setting and expanded on both the girl's relationship with each other and the plot. It's at the point where they're both working in different ways to destabilize Voldemort's regime.

(Skip the first three chapters or so if you're not interested in basic smut between two characters. The relationship deepens past that, and the plot comes in a bit later.)

** I've written an AU where Lucius Malfoy fakes Voldemort's survival after Halloween 1981 and wins the war in the Dark Lord's name: "The Dark Lord Never Died"
