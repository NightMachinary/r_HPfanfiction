Also 50% of Harry/Hermione fics turn her into an overbearing prodigy who bosses Harry around, so those should suit you. The other 50% turn her into a bimbo trophy girlfriend. And because this is fanfiction, there is no middle ground.

Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG
