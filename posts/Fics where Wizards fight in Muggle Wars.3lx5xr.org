I have seen a couple of these. I think the muggles even referred to the wizards as "chopsticks" in one.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn(The Skitterleap by enembee)

Super AU, with an abrupt ending. Not too much wizard on muggle conflict but its there

As other people have suggested Emporer has a lot more of that, although a lot of it reads more like a Full Metal Alchemist fan fic than a HP one, at least what I've read so far (not that this is necessarily a bad thing)

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

*** Technically, "Old Soldiers Never die" only mentions squibs fighting in muggle wars, but has squibs fighting muggle-style in a wizard war.

Are you specifically looking for wizards fighting in muggle wars, or will any war where muggles and wizards fight side by side, and you have spells and machine guns mixing it up do? I've written linkffn(10595005), which for the most part (after chapter 10 or so) deals with such a war.

***** I hope you like the story then. Next to tactics for "combined arms" (or my take on how to use both muggles and wizards together in combat), I tried to show how politics and logistics play a major role in a war, unlike skirmishes or individual fights, and how tactics adapt to those used by the enemy - though usually from the perspective of individual soldiers.

Quick answer: yes.

What makes a fic enjoyable is relative. What is it about /"this kinda fic"/ that has turned you off? Overall the writing is very good, the pacing is great, characterization is good, the OC's are interesting, it has a real world sort of feel, the war scenes/tactics are large scale and well done.

 

Here are some things that I can imagine turning people off: [[#s][Spoilers]]

***** I said it wrong. I never looked into these kind of fics, wizards fighting in muggle wars, I didn't even know that they existed until I read this post.

I'll start reading this fic then, thanks for the response. And I haven't read the spoilers in case of well, spoiling something.

** Not quite what you're asking for, but here's a short Moody/McGonagall fic about them going undercover against Grindelwald's forces during WWII. Their mission requires them to pass as Muggles while traveling through war-torn Europe.
