I've never read a 'wrong boy who lived' fanfic and now I want to give this trope a shot. Please recommend some good ones to me but only the very best, like your favourite one. I don't ask for much but it MUST have good grammar, an interesting plot and No fem!Harry please.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(The Green in the Grey)

I typically don't read WBWL fics but I started this one because of the Harry/Tonks pairing (Harry is older than in canon). It's pretty good despite being somewhat convoluted at the start. It's still a work in progress.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

** It's not complete, but so much is written, ready for you to sink your teeth into it. Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is absolutely a great story and I eagerly wait for every update. It avoids a lot of tropes and I see a lot of things that I haven't found in other fics. I heartily recommend it!

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.
