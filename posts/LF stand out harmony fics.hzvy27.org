I've read quite a lot of harmony and good stories are getting harder and harder to find. Ron-bashing is especially frustrating and i'm also getting tired of fics where hermione's parents play a big role and have zero flaws. I'm looking for stories that avoid these cliches.

Let me know if you have any suggestions!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22249729/chapters/53129767]] Post DH. Explores a relationship between a ptsd ridden Harry and Hermione and their journey to heal. Fair warning, there's sex in it. A lot.

*** Straight up THANK YOU. I'm working on a triad fic and was having the hardest time characterizing Harry with him being an OP God or a boring place holder.

This is perfect.

** If you don't mind a love triangle with Draco (but Harmony endgame), then I'd recommend [[https://dracotrilogy.livejournal.com/][The Draco Trilogy]]
