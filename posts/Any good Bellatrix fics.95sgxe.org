Hi, I'm looking for a some good Bellatrix-centric fics for an upcoming trip in which I'll spend hours traveling. I prefer femmeslash (but I will read het), and fics over 50k words. Completed is best, but if it's really good I'd be interested in anything updated within the last six months (so if I get hooked there's still a chance it will be updated). Bellatrix can be dark, or light, or grey!

Thank you for your time!


** Linkffn(Sanity is Quite Simply Overrated)

It's a Fem Harry story and it is fairly short right now but looks like it'll end up with femharry/bella pairing. Bellatrix is one of the main characters in it.

*** Nemesis13 doesn't really finish any of their fics, and while a lot of them are fun to read, it's a bit of a pain to see something really interesting that I know will never be finished.

Eventually he stumbles upon the Veil of Death, on a whim he decides to walk through and soon awakens in his cupboard under the stairs as one Harriet Potter. The Marauders shall ride again, led by a not quite all there witch. (Black Family revival)

** Not Bellatrix centric, and she only makes a few appearances in it, but the Bellatrix Lestrange we see from the glimpses in linkffn(Dragon Lily) - (which has a fairly decent plot, in spite of the ridiculousness of the pairings and the smut) is by far the most terrifying and deranged I've come across so far.

  Harry Potter finds himself right in the middle of a raging war - caught between two very ambitious women and two warring sides. The very secrets of magic are coming undone at the seams... and Harry finds himself caught right in the middle of it all. Originally published by WerewolfWarrior on hpfanficarchive.

** You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4799264/1/Blind-Faith][Blind Faith]]. linkffn(4799264)

"Blind Faith" is a canon compliant fic which starts from the moment that Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters escape from Azkaban. The story focuses on Bella, but there are PoVs from other characters mixed in. It's a surprisingly unique exploration of behind-the-scenes interactions between Voldemort, Bella and the other Death Eaters during books 5 & 6. I enjoyed the way this fic explores the twisted minds of Bella and the Dark Lord. There are many great creepy moments, along with a few surprisingly heartwarming ones.

  Her collarbone was sharp beneath his hand. He felt her breath rising and falling unevenly, perhaps in panic. In between her silent, wild gasps, Voldemort felt a heart shuddering somewhere. Perhaps she thought he meant to strangle her. Perhaps he should.
