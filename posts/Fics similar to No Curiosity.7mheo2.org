[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8246904/1/No-Curiosity]] Want some more fics similar to this (though with some more dialogue preferably) where the abuse Harry received from the Dursleys leads to him not being as adventurous and curious as he is in canon and more anti social.

Also on the side note, does any know any fics similar to A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel? (and yes I already know about its sequel)

*** I've read the beginning of it before but quit. Don't really like many fics that kick the abuse up to 11. Though I might give it a second shot.
