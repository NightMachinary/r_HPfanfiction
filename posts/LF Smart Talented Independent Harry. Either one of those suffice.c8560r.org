I am looking for a complete or near completion story of a smart, cunning, independent and/or talented Harry.

- I don't need him to be god like
- the story must cover all years or most of them
- Romance/pairings are completely secondary but having them would be nice.
- Ginny/Hermione pairings are boring, but if the story is not focused in there then it is an acceptable recommendation
- if the story is regularly updated then it doesn't matter if it is not complete or it is still at earlier years, so yes, new regularly updated stories can apply.

Harry's father was talented in transfiguration and his mother was talented in charms (and potions?), so why doesn't Harry in cannon shows talent in those areas? I hate how thanks to Ron he wasted years of study and training.

I don't want him to become the second coming of Merlin in one summer just by “reading all books completely”.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is complete with a sporadically updated sequel. Like, /very/ sporadically. That said, the original has a satisfying ending, so I think it can legitimately stand on its own. It features a Harry who is both powerful and skilled for his age, and it follows his development until he can, if not go toe-to-toe with the combatants from the last way, at least put up a damn good fight against them.

*** So... this is not a Voldermort/Harry pairing? Just... friends or master/student, right?

**** Master/student, definitely. Voldemort isn't looking for romance and/or sex, and if he were, it wouldn't be from a prepubescent kid.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
