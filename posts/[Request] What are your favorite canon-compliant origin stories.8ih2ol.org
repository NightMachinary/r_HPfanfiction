Any character, as long as it is good quality and not heavy on romance.


** Oh there's an amazing Severus one and I can't remember the name of it. Dammit that's gonna bug me.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439?view_full_work=true][Into the Fold]] - First War Severus Snape. Has interesting family dynamics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7213144][Let Perpetual Light]] - Albus Dumbledore, Ariana Dumbledore, and Gellert Grindelwald. It does have some Albus/Gellert romance, but I think if you skip over it because of that, you'd be missing out, since the highlight and focus is Ariana. Has an interesting alternate take on the Deathly Hallows, as well.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
