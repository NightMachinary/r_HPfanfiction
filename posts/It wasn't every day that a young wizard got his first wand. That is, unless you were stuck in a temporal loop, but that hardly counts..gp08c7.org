*** Different idea, but a good story nonetheless.

Also /wow/, Petunia was an utter bitch.

***** So far, one of the most realistic redemptions of Petunia I've seen is from /Royal Ward/, a follow-up to a one-shot where Vernon dies of a heart attack.

****** I like linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee) (even using its sequel as part of my story), and stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]] (even wrote one story inspired by it; my username of AO3 is mcepl).

And I have a problem with the Royal Ward, that I almost pathologically dislike Lord Potter stories.

******* So far as I can tell, Harry hasn't been acting like anything more than a precocious child in /Royal Ward/. I've not really seen him do anything that would be comparable your average "Lord Potter" stories. but to each their own.

******** No, it is not him, but whole culture of nobility goes against my skin. I think it is very much against the prevalent spirit of HP universe, which is in my opinion rather bourgeois, middle-class.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
