** Harry/Daphne pairing with a major Dumbledore/Hermione/Order of the Phoenix bashfest. Also just plain not good.

*** Pairing doesn't matter at all to the story.

I can't stand bashing and I didn't interpret anything in this story as bashing. I remember the story not really making Harry look like a good person either. Don't really know, and I haven't read it in a long time.

As for it's quality, like I said, its been a while. I think I at least enjoyed it for it's twists and turns, but if it holds up I can't say for sure. I will say that it's not exactly a fic that I find myself returning to.

***** Oh, I know. I was just kind of half piggybacking off your comment. Instead of my own comment that the pairing didn't matter and a reply to you that despite characters not being portrayed positively, I didn't remember it as bashing, I kind of just combined the two into one.

Edit: added "and"

** Most people don't like this fic because it doesn't show Hermione in a good light. She isn't bashed but she isn't worshiped like in almost every other fic. Dumbledore has good intention, but does it badly. Also not bashed.

There is a big war between muggle and wizards. I saw some comments saying it was genocide, it's not.

Would recommend to read it. Very good writing style, sensible plot and again, the author doesn't like to lick Hermione 's root...

** Sneaky and political Harry starts to hate muggles and dumbldore after misinterpreting 'overheard' pieces of info. Teams up with Draco and manipulates the wizarding and muggle worlds. I liked it.

** Cruel and unnecessary genocide (literally billions that are murdered), Muggle hating, lots of hypocrisy.
