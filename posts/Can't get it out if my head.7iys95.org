Just had a thought that Adam Driver, the guy who plays Kylo Ren in the new Star Wars trilogy, could play Snape. At least he's closer to Snape's actual age in the books than Alan Rickman was. They should have gotten younger actors to play the parts of James, Lily and a whole bunch of other characters. But someone has mentioned that before.

ANYWAY, now I can't help but imagine Kylo Ren as a Hogwarts professor. Or maybe Kylo Ren as Voldemort. Or Kylo Ren as Harry Potter. ðŸ˜…


** Kylo Ren could definitely use some of Snape's Occlumency.

** Vote Kylo Ren for everything HP! :D

I love him. I'd read a fic where he's a new DADA Professor, or with the Harry's transported to the SW universe. Basically, I want Kylo Ren and Harry interactions.

** Not ugly enough. Snape in the books is explicitly an ugly individual with a hooked nose and a very evil goatee.

*** A goatee? What?

Also I mean you're free to picture him however you like but John Nettleship, the person Snape's teaching style and appearance is based on, was not all that ugly. Personally I think that the way we perceive his appearance in the books owes a lot to the Potter filter, since we only ever see him described by Harry, who hates him.

I mean before he hates him (at the feast in Book 1) he just says he has sallow skin, greasy hair, and a hooked nose. None of those things necessarily make a person ugly, so I'm willing to believe that seem from the POV of someone who doesn't hate him, Snape might not ever win any beauty contests, but isn't a total gargoyle either.

**** It's just Rowling's style. Ron and Hermione were rather unattractive people too from their descriptions, and Dumbledore's nose was apparently broken on two places.

I think the only people who got favourable descriptions were Fleur Delacour, Bill Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks.
