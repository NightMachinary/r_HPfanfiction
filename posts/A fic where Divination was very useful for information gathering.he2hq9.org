:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I forget almost everything about this fic besides the fact that they took Divination and made it so cool by using it to gather information about anyone or anything. I have no clue when or where I read it but it's been in my mind all day.


** You might be thinking of stealing witches and dodging prison - revenge is best served cold??

They learn â€˜old' divination from a ghost lady and through that can gather information. But that is nowhere near the main plot of the story so it might not.

** There's one where Harry becomes the divination teacher (in the past I think) and he's really good at it, only people still think it's fake. Can't remember its name unfortunately.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Welp guys I was completely wrong! It isn't even a Harry Potter Fanfic or the Universe! It's a Diviner, Analyst, or Seer from Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1) by: Andrew Rowe. I read so much HP FanFics, WebNovels, Translated Chinese Novels & Manga and then regular old Fantasy n SciFi novels! Sometimes I just get them all mixed up! But I found it and it's awesome! Thank you guys for helping though I'm Reread dodging soon and going to check out the other recs!
