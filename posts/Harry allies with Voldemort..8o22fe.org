I'm trying to find a fic where Harry was Voldemort's ally. He was relatively powerful(I think he could even beat Voldemort, and Dumbledore in a fight). He knew wandless magic, and I think he had some very unique skills, or a unique perspective on magic which is why he could get as powerful as he did. It was also around GOF when I stopped reading it. I'm not sure if I stopped, because I forgot, or it was incomplete.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** It sounds like there could be a lot of fics that match this description. Do you remember any specific scenes or plot points? Pairing(s)? You stopped at fifth year, but do you remember how long it took to get to that point (e.g. started in first year or later)?

*** I remember that there was something different about the TWT. Also one thing I was happy about was that it wasn't a Lord Harry fic. He made his own money, and the goblins actually respected him for it since he didn't inherit his money like the spoiled brats do.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  Revised! Harry has found out that the light has been keeping many of secrets from him that push him over the edge. He returns to Hogwarts after the death of his godfather seemingly unaware of the light's manipulations, but in the shadows the notorious assassin Sang Lys has arose. Dark!Evil!Harry. Major OOC! Light!Bashing

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
