In this fiction, Harry leaves the Dursleys with the help of Dobby. He settles in an isolated place preparing and training. He has a slight limp for some time due to something but I don't remember exactly what. He also trains the DA while having the limp, I believe. He is also possibly beaten close to death by Vernon before his escape with Dobby, I don't remember exactly. That's pretty much all I can remember.

If anyone could help me with the name of the fiction, I will be very grateful. Thank you.
