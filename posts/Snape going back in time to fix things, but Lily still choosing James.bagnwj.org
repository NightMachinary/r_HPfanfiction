I would love a story that explores the idea that even with Snape cleaning up his act, Lily is just not interested in him as more than a friend and just so much more attracted to James and just loves him more.


** I've had a similar idea for a long time, only from Snape's perspective. He goes back in time, intent on doing everything right and get the girl this time, but quickly realizes that while he's mentally a grown man, Lily is a 15 y.o. teenager who has much more in common with annoying dunderheads he used to teach than with him anymore. So Lily still ends up with James and Snape finally gets over her.

A distinction the canon Snape didn't exactly qualify for with flying colours, it has to be said.

**** Yeah, fair point lol. It'd be funny if he actually matured while reliving his Hogwart years, realizing his obsession with her is actually kind of creepy at this point.

***** Snape realized returning in time was a grave mistake

when he found himself saying to Lily that James Potter was actually pretty funny once you got past his ego

**** Could still be interesting. Like canon Snape seem to be automaticaly nasty to pretty much everyone, was he already like this when he was a teen or does he have to be very carefull when he talks because he wants to call everyone a dunderhead the moment they ask him a question, including Lily.\\
Also, what would happen with the Marauder? Does he use his futur knowledge to juste "beat" them, or does he kill the four of them the first day he is back?

** There's a really good time travel fic in which a whole bunch of people are bounced back to Snape/Lily's start of Hogwarts. There was a Ravenclaw and a Hufflepuff that also got time-displaced.

I wish I could remember the name. In it, Severus has his memories from like 1996, but Lily only up to 1980, and the Ravenclaw from when he died to Snatchers in 1998 or so.

It was really good since it showed that traveling back in time isn't some automatic easy-mode fix-it. They're all real people with real problems, and Snape finds it difficult to relate to a 19 year-old Lily.

I can't remember exactly how it ended, but I'm pretty sure Lily doesn't end up with either James or Severus (I mean how could, even at 19 or 20, hook back up with someone who is now a decade younger?)

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

*** James/Lily is a nonstarter in that fic (James found someone else), Severus/Lily is attempted but ultimately fails -- IIRC, because Lily never actually feels the spark needed for something to develop.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
