It's been something I've been thinking about, I don't know what Rowling says about the USA, Japan, Mexico, et cetra, but this is just something I've thought about.

It'd make sense. With Grindelwald's own ideals, and then with Voldemort's ideals, the UK didn't really have much of a chance to be different/change.

I'd imagine that other places are a lot more open about Half-Bloods, Muggleborns and Squibs. While they might be wary about Werewolves or Vampires I imagine them to have less prejudice then the UK.

I'd also imagine that they'd be more open/forward about Muggle stuff in general, like notebook paper instead of parchment paper, pencils or pens instead of ink and quill, being more in the know about what's happening in the Muggle world in able to be able to blend in.

Now, it's not perfect of course, I'd imagine there's families like the Lestrange and Malfoy's who believe in Pureblood Purity, but I'd imagine that they'd be back down compared to the others.

What do you think? Again I don't know what Rowling's said, but sometimes some of what she's said years after the books has turned me iffy, so I was just curious what you guys thought, if you had any headcanons of anywhere outside of the UK.

Edit: As well as wanting to discuss it with you guys, if anyone has any stories that explore this idea or a variation let me know.


** I don't think so. Durmstrang barred muggleborn entry and a lot of continental Europe and the US had to join in with Grindelwald, no?

*** Did the US have to join in with Grindelwald? Either way, years has passed, surely there'd be change there compared to the UK, who had Grindelwald and then Voldemort.

**** "Had" as in "there had to be some Americans with him" (because of the movie) not that they were forced, but that's not impossible either.

From my recollection, Britain and Ireland didn't have Grindelwald. Sure, he had some supporters there, but he was on the mainland and from the Henry Potter stuff it looks like most were content to ignore it all.

** What gives you the idea that we have moved past such things? Racism, sexism, etc are still a thing in our world. Far right political movements are on the rise. Lycanthropy is a metaphor for stigmatized illnesses (hiv). That's also still a problem. Most of the things you criticize are metaphors for problems in the real world which are still very much problems nowadays, and not just in the UK but everywhere.

A very poor one because of how it is transmitted. Unless Rowling wanted to imply that the Hi virus makes someone into a bloodthirsty murder-machine once a month, it is very unfitting. Because werewolves do not get infected through accidents, bad medical standards or lack of knowledge about safe-sex, but through acts of violence. Also, all but one werewolves we see join magical Hitler, so I am really not sold on the metaphor.

*** His only canonical tie to Germany is his defeat in 1945. He certainly lived in the UK for some time, and Durmstrang is implied to be elsewhere.

** I tend to be of the view that the "national character" of wizarding nations largely mirrors that of the Muggle world. So wizarding Europe is likely to be a lot more socially progressive than the rest of the world, to the point that much of the world considers European wizards deviant and dangerous.

I imagine in most of the world, there's no conflict around Muggleborns on the basis that it's universal consensus that Muggleborns should be excluded from wizarding society.
