** Might be neat if Hermione finds that her parents were bakers that were turned into dentists with accidental magic on the first day they opened their business.

*** Wut? I don't understand what you mean on this one. Are you saying that accidental magic would change their profession?

**** Change their memories. Obliviator department finds it easier to make up the fake documentation than it is to reverse the memory change.

***** Ok. Well that's some damn piece of accidental magic if you can make competent Doctor in dentistry by changing their memory.

Except if you meant the obliviator made them dentist which is equally surprising because while they may be better armed to deal with memories, do they even know what is a dentist.

******* Yes ForumWarrior you are right! That is why you can conjure and transfigure super complex animals without learning biology about them first. :) Magic just DOES IT for you. Which is why I always will maintain that magic could ALSO create a complex MECHANICAL system, like a wholesale car or a computer. Because a car is just a bunch of shaped metal tubes and sticks and gears, and it would be super easy for magic to create a bunch of metal thingies.

******* I suppose that's why every wizard is able to casually do any task of infinite complexity. Hogwarts is more of a daycare than a school.

*** Was this from that fic where Hermione's parents were convinced they were wizards by a house elf? Shit goes wrong in the oblivator's department gets involved. Let me see if I can find it.
