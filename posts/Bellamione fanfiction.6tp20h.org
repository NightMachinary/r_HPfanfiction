Hey guys! If anyone is looking for some Bellamione fanfiction I'm currently working on one! It's called Who is the Real Evil? On both Fanfiction.net and AO3!


** I like the idea of the plot, though I've seen it done better. Additionally, the writing is mostly in big walls of text. I can't follow that very well. I've seen many Manipulative!Dumbledore stories do it better, in both plot and writing. Perhaps come up with a new reason for /why/ Dumbledore did what he did?

Best of luck with your writing. I haven't read very many Bellatrix/Hermione stories, so I'll have to assimilate myself to the pairing at some point.

*** It's one of the first fanfiction writings I've done to be honest. Yeah formatting is quite difficult because the sites keep changing it when I add it in. Thank you!

**** It's best to manually change the formatting to what you like when preparing to publish on fanfiction.net. It's worth the frustration and tedium, as your writing will be easier to follow. I have trouble focusing on a wall of text, so unless the writing is extremely fluid, I can't read them.

***** Oooh thanks for the tip! I completely understand, I'm not huge into reading huge walls of text either.
