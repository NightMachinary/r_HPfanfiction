There are tons of godlike harry fics out there, but what about actual fics where harry IS a god? I assume most of those would be crack fics, but im interrested in any kind of fics, but prefer if there was no slash for main character


** linkffn(2686394)

Not crack, and surprisingly good.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus sort of qualifies and is one of my favorite fics. Plus there are 3 spin off crossovers that are also good based off of it, one Naruto, one Star Wars, and the newest one Pokemon.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

** Core Threads - linkffn(10136172) - has Harry who's not a god (Death is a significant character), but is functionally indistinguishable from one as of the latest chapters. It's not /quite/ crack, but it is extremely fluffy and has basically no conflict. If you need warm fuzzies, Core Threads is your story.

Some things of note:

- Harry has a "harem", except it's composed of eleven-year-olds that are far too pure and innocent for anything sexual.
- He's functionally immortal. You'd need to hit him with a killing curse several million times to even start hurting him.
- He raised an island out of the ocean and made an entire magical country /by himself./ And by magical, I mean that he enchanted the island itself to be a fucking wonderland.
- He's traveled between dimensions to see and help other versions of himself.
- He's got that classic OP!Harry time-accelerated mindscape thing. In fact, that's perhaps the source of his power and skill.

**** I found this one. A Xianxia attempt. 1st instalment is fun, I'm gonna continue it for now.\\
I mention it because, as it has MoD!Harry as its premise, it already qualifies, if barely (and probably even technically), to the God!Harry requirement. From the get-go.\\
And as it's a Xianxia, you never know how high these things go in the power level department, except it's really high.

  In a world where magic doesn't exist, supernatural power goes by another name. Hogwarts is not a school of witchcraft and wizardry but of cultivation, and new student Harry Potter has been scouted by the venerable Grand Master Riddle for his mysterious potential in martial arts.Little does he know, the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not' takes on a different meaning.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
