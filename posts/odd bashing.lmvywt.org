now we often see things like Dumbles stealing potter money, putting Harry with Dursleys to manipulate him, Weasleys using love potions, Ron being a greedy jealous git, so what i want to ask you is this, what is the oddest/most unique reasoning behind someone being bashed? don't care who it is just kind off want to see what you have.

** Hagrid for saying Voldemort was a Slytherin because that apparently means that he's prejudicing Harry against Slytherin on Dumbledore's orders

** Ron For eating. the author literally just said he likes food and it made him evil. Sirius For riding buckbeak. Because that's animal cruelty. James For being friends with Sirius Black. that was the only reason given. Snape Greasey hair. Again only reason given. Dumbledore Lemon drops. The were used as mind controlling devices, but thee author never showed them actually controlling anyone so???? Molly Wants a house elf. Not wanting to do housework is BAD!!!!! Harry getting better grade the Hermione. Ginny Playing sports. Again only reason given. Remus Being mean to peeves. Dobby Being mean to kreature/ goblins.

** I read one where Tonks was bashed for using her powers to make herself more attractive to Remus. I also read one that bashed Fleur for being French (can't blame the author on that one though). I also read one that presented Dobby as a rapist who would do his things while Winky was drunk in the room of requirements.
