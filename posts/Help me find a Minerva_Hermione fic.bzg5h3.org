I'm looking for a specific story I read a long time ago. I think it was called Bound or something similar. It is very Minerva centric and focuses on some kind of binding magic between her and Hermione. I remember it being a few hundred thousand words and still a wip. I cant seem to find it anywhere.


** Well, that's a pairing I've never heard of before.

*** Yeah I didnt see it coming either. It had a lot of buildup though. Like 300 thousand words before they kissed. I was wondering how it ends since it wasnt finished when i read it. It was very plot driven too. There was another Big Bad that the order had to be reformed to go up against, I just cant quite remember the details
