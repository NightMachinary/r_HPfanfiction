** Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and it's sequel is a very well-written story by White Squirrel. It takes fanon cliche tropes and subverts expectations or simply writes them well. It also diverge immensely by the fifth year and is very original (at least I never read any other story going in that direction) and it's not just Harry and co that change, but also the antagonists. Malfoy is more cunning and knows when to back off compared to his canon self to match Harry's more mature personality. There is some 11 year olds politician, but that's mostly just Harry because he doesn't have a parent/relative that can officially take the title â€˜Lord Potter' like Malfoy and Nott, and even then he defers mostly to his proxy because they're adults and experienced in politics. He's also raised by the Grangers and has no Harmony. All in all it does a good job at worldbuilding inside and outside Britain and even involves certain historical events that happened in the Muggle world or at least refers to them like the Rwandan Genocide and Ebola and the Caucasus Wars and the Dissolution of the USSR. The adults are also responsible and there's no bashing?

10/10 would recommend.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** This is a wacky fic but I enjoyed it. It's what Cursed Child should have been. Complies with all your requests. Starts just before 5th year. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13788267/chapters/31695750]])

Romilda Vane gets into a bunch of crazy stuff trying to convince Harry that she's the one for him in a Question of When. One-shot. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

This doesn't check all your preference boxes, but it's still pretty good. In my opinion, this is the best written story on the Department of Mysteries debacle in OotP. Note: it ignores DH canon completely.

This one is unfinished, but it's my favorite OP!Harry. The description turned me away from it originally (and doesn't really set the tone at all for the work), but when I finally got around to reading it I had a lot of fun. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness]])

For Lack of a Bezoar is canon compliant up to partway through HBP. Starts out sad, but is really good and doesn't have an unhappy ending. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]]) It's got a pretty interesting sequel where the Grey!Harry from the above work plus Canon!Harry and friends get transported into an AU where Voldemort won and Evil!Harry is his second in command. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog]])

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

** I came across a really well executed Harry/Hermione fic not long ago. Normally I tend to find that Harmony fics invent an attraction that just wasn't present in canon, but this one really does it organically and convincingly. Diverges from canon in fourth year.
