Any fic focusing on Snape's canon treatment of his students. One-shot or multichapters are both fine, but no Good Death Eaters or Severitus of any kind.


** Which canon, for one thing?

Movie Snape was far different from Book Snape. They cut a lot of his asshole moments.

*** Book canon, preferably, but I suppose movie canon would also be fine if he's not whitwashed.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
