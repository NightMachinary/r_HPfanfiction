I've recommended the following fic a couple of times here (it's HHr). And it is VERY underrated. 300-something favourites and follows do not do it justice at all. One of the best (and fairest) HHr fics I've ever read. The name of the fic is Beautiful Boy, by AmazingGracie1992. Post DH, canon compliant (except epilogue). Give it a read! linkffn(8954326) Does anyone have any other HHr recommendations similar to this fic, that they feel are also underrated?

  Something had happened in that tent. Something had happened to Harry. He wasn't sure why or how, but he longed for those days when it was just him and Hermione against the world. Somewhere along the lines Harry had done something he had never intended to do. Harry had fallen irrevocably in love with his best friend. Takes place directly after DH. Harry/Hermione

** I can't believe that linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) still only has 142 favourites. Well logically I can: for one, being posted all in one go hardly helped its exposure. That said, it may be one of the best fics I've ever seen.

** linkffn(11690341)

May be abandoned, I don't really know, but the length of the chapters makes me believe that they just take forever to write. Its a decent story if you like crossovers.

** *Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), only has 44 favorites. I think the low number of favorites has something to do with its choice of listed main characters (Ron, Hermione). Had the author listed all 4 (Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione), this fic could top 1000 favs.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
