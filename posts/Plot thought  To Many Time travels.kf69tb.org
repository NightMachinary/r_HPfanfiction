One my favorite fics is a crack fic from Lord Jeram

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers]]

​

Basically many people outside harry become time travelers who go back to create a crack fic,

​

though this gave me a thought? what if this was done in a serious way.

What if a few time travelers from different time lines all came back to preserve or stop different time lines and how could that go?


** Once it is all a mess, a last time traveler has to arrive. A stranger in a strange suit and strange helmet. Then, he takes his helmet and the face beneath it surprises everyone... It's a boy almost the same age of Harry, his messy hair is Green and his eyes are black. His glasses are round-shaped, but with wings, as if to resemble snitches. They are black, appearing as sunglasses as first, but when the boy presses a button near his left ear, they become translucent.

"Who the hell are you?" Ron asks, as Harry is speechless.

It's clear now that the boy's face is pretty similar to Harry's.

"I'm Hardwing Omicron Potter, the third. I come from 1234 years into the future." the boy said, then his frown turns grave, "We messed up. We need to change everything again. Otherwise, the space-monkey-house-elf hybrids who own the Chudley Cannons are going to the destroy the world!"

"But... what?"

"S.P.E.W, we have to get rid of it!"

"Hermione gasped audibly, "But---"

"It's the only way... we have 3 hours! We need to stop Reginald Cattermole from inventing the intergalatic apparition by mistake... oh, also do you guys know a boy named Lee Jordan? Apparently, he shouldn't be teaching Quidditch to some psycho elf named Bibbly."
