It's canon that Lucius Malfoy I unsuccessfully courted Queen Elizabeth I, yet I see only one story with this pairing on AO3. We need more. We need the Shakespearean sonnets he wrote for her, lyrics of the songs he played on his lute, descriptions of him dancing in yellow cross-gartered stockings, and how she played him to her advantage.


** I'm honestly just picturing Draco's father courting the current Queen Liz

** This would be great. I would do it, but I can only imagine a meme version with Lucius saying something like, "My dear muggle queen, your ugly pale face is just as pale as my luxurious hair. Even though you're a filthy muggle you've bewitched my heart. I would gladly make a few half-bloods with you <3"
