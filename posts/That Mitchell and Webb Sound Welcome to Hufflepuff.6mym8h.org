*** As a fellow Hufflepuff, I'm not. :) Partly because David Mitchell is awesome and partly because this skit manages to do something that most Hufflefuff-mocking comedy does not: It keeps the sympathy on the 'Puff's side.

The tone of the skit isn't "ha ha, those loser Hufflepuffs are losers, it's more "it sucks when nobody takes you seriously because you're a Hufflepuff."
