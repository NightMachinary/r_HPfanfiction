I'm looking for a pretty old and big HP fanfiction work. It's about elements magic and the main characters are HP, DM, LL & PP all living happily in polyamory. They also have teach younger magicians because elements magic is being treated as a threat by government. I don't remember the name and googling doesn't help ><


** Who is 'PP'?

**** Ah, okay. I completely blanked on those two there. Thank you. I was trying to work out if Penelope Clearwater married a P-name person after Hogwarts or something. :D

*** That's one of the worst initials in the series, cause it could be either

Padma or Parvati Patil, or Pansy Parkinson

***** Indeed. The less said about Peter Pettigrew or Piers Polkiss in a polyamory relationship... the better!
