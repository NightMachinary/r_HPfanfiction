I am looking for a certain fic that I read years ago and suddenly remembered about a week ago and would like to reread.

I have looked for a few good hours and couldn't for the life of me find it. So I created a Reddit account in the hopes you lovely people might be able to find it.

â€‹

I read a lot of fanfics so sometimes I get plot points mixed up so I will start with the ones I am a 100% sure are in the fic I am looking for.

- Harry uses Computers.
- Harry lives somewhere in Diagon Alley.
- Harry sets up security cameras in the Alley.

Ones I am not sure about but believe are in it.

- Harry can scan books into his computer system.
- Harry builds an AI
- Harry uses his computer to do Arithmancy to find new spells

The ones I am least sure about.

- Harry uses his ability to scan books on the library (or records) within the ministry while he is on a tour.

I can't remember if this fic is good or bad it is just bothering me that I cant find it and that it is stuck in my head.
