#+TITLE: Tom Riddle gravely miscalculated when he made his horcruxes. When the killing curse backfired, his soul shattered. There’s a reason no dark wizard had ever made more than one.

** Now I have an idea for a fic where Voldemort is right that seven is ok, but you can't go above seven. Harry learns two things:

1) He is a Horcrux, and Voldemort has seven. But Voldemort only thinks he has six.

2) He cannot beat Voldemort, or find all his Horcruxes.

Instead, he endeavors to trick Voldemort into making one more Horcrux, which he eventually does, causing this effect.

Tom, you did untested back-alley surgery on your soul. Based on plans you picked up out of a school library as a teenager and then asked a /potions/ professor about. I'm shocked, shocked that such a brilliant plan actually took until 81 to backfire catastrophically.

***** You can be very smart and do very stupid things at the same time. Academical success and even general intelligence doesn't save you from making stupid decisions. It makes you even more in risk to do something stupid because your brain is able to think of more possibilities than that of an average person.

I am a teacher. My cleverest students almost always manage to get themselves in the greatest trouble.

  [AU] Upon his bodily dissolution on October 31, 1981, Voldemort discovers that his Horcruxes do, indeed, anchor him to immortality. In fact, they anchor him all too well. Oneshot.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU
