I have read quite a few fics where either one of them is a Death Eater, (some of them were excellent) and I couldn't find any decent fics ( where nobody is bashed) where both Harry and Ginny are Death Eaters committed to Mr. Riddle doing the typical evil stuff. Harry x Ginny would be preferable.


** Sorry I donâ€˜t know any, but could you maybe recommend the ones you know? Would love to read them

*** I know only those fics in which either one of them is a Death Eater. linkao3(19381933) for Death Eater Ginny and linkffn(12867536) for Death Eater Harry Potter, both of them by the same author.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
