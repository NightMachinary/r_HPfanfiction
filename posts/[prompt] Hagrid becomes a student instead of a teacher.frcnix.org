After the events of Chamber of Secrets, they decide Hagrid isn't qualified to become a teacher so they make him join the class of '97 in their third year. Could be hilarious.

  "You see, the thing that really finishes a Boggart is /laughter/. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing."

  "Now hold on jus' a moment, there's no call for bein' cruel to it. It jus' wants to be left alone, most likely, so it tries to scare yeh off, see. Like them fish and lizards that puff themselves up bigger. Jus' close the door on it an' leave it be, I reckon."

  "The trick with a Grindylow is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle."

  "Wait up, yeh can't mean to say yeh want us to break its fingers? That's 'orrible, that is! They only bother yeh if yeh invaded their home in the firs' place, after all. Jus' swim away from 'em."

**** You're forgetting how old Hagrid is. He went to school with Voldemort and was already groundskeeper when Snape was in school. So Snape's used to looking at Hagrid as an authority figure. A bit like how, yeah, I think I could take my nan in a fist fight but she can still intimidate the hell out of me.

** There's a oneshot that depicts this. Hagrid receives a wand and words of encouragement from McGonagall and Dumblebore. It's one of my favorite one shots but I can't find it anymore.

** This means Hagrid gets a wand. One that isn't hidden in his umbrella!

Be an interesting fic, I'll have to remember to come back here and see if anyone has any recs for it.

*** He got one after he was cleared, but the point is he had no formal schooling from age 13. He should've had at least a year or so of training...he was not a good teacher.

**** I read a fic that explained how Dumbledore and the other professors would teach Hagrid in somewhat of secrecy while Dippet was still headmaster, and that while he never completed /formal/ schooling, he had covered everything he could and merely had to sit for his OWLS and NEWTS in the summer after second year.

*** I like the headcanon that Dumbledore used the Elder Wand's power to repair broken wands on Hagrid's wand, which they then embedded into the umbrella to be inconspicuous. In Britain, it's not weird to carry around an umbrella everywhere you go, even when it's august, 30° and the sky is cloudless.

I'd say that's a great time to have an umbrella, you could use it as a portable sun shade to keep the worst of the heat off you.
