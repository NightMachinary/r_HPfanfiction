Trailer for /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Never Lived: Part 1/

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwCHV3sAuWM]]

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Never Lived: Part 1 is a full-length fan edited film based on the Harry Potter series that explores an alternative magical universe in which Snape and Lily never grew apart, creating a number of ripple effects, one of which is that Harry Potter was never born. Through a restructured narrative and a number of special effects, the character Harry Potter is completely removed from the movie.

This fanedit includes Never-Before-Seen Content including Rik Mayall (as Drop Dead Fred) as Peeves, Jim Dale as Ludo Bagman, the Year 1 Sorting Hat Song, and "Weasley is Our King". The main audio track is 5.1 Surround Sound, but a second audio track including an Editor's Commentary provides insight into the narrative choices made and how many of the special effects were achieved.

This edited version may interest viewers not just as a work of fandom, but also as a demonstration of the strength and depth of the side characters when viewed as an ensemble instead of the supporting cast for a single central character. This edit is not intended to fix anything wrong the original films, or improve them in any way. Instead, it is presented as an entertaining piece of fan art that answers the question, "what if...?"
