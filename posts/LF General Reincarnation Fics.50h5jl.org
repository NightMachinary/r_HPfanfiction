Since my request for Founder-reincarnation fics yielded a surprisingly small amount of results, I'm asking for general reincarnation. Crossovers are fine and it doesn't matter which character is reincarnated as long as it's not a romance-centric fic. Thank you!

*** I love that fic so much. Really i love pretty much everything written by Tsume Yuki i just wish she would actually finish some of her stuff.

This one was one of my favorites though. I love Regulus' transformation, his realization that the things he got taught during his last live can't really be true by observing Lily.

I just felt like the author understood the character. There are quite a few fics that make Regulus out to be a secret supporter for Muggleborn rights when really all he found repulsive about Voldemort was making a Horcrux and realizing that he didn't actually care about the Pureblood cause.

** Might not be what you're looking for, but linkao3(6614155) is a crack(ish) fic about Harry & Voldemort being continuously reincarnated. It's pretty funny.

*** Whoa whoa whoa, is that a new, recently written, still updating Harry/Tom fanfic that's not only readable but actually good? A chorus of angels have descended from the heavens, the crops are watered, my skin is cleared, a miracle has happened.

It's also somewhat reminiscent of linkffn(On a Train, Switching Tracks), which is one my favorite fanfics ever, which makes it extra awesome.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate') Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (crack with a hint of seriousness, my specialty)
