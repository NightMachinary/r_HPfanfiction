Really any time travel/alternative dimension where the main character is a minor character from the books or OC. Minor as in just not the usual suspects (Harry, Snape, Hermione.. etc).

  Romilda Vane realized she'd been going after Harry Potter the wrong way; it wasn't a question of how, it was a question of when.

** How's your tolerance for Blaise Zambini? There's a pretty good one where he's thrown into Tom Riddle's school days. It's believable, and while it still uses the Time Turner excuse, the reason makes sense and it does some worldbuilding on the Department of Mysteries. It was unfinished, and I don't think it will be finished, but it was a fun few chapters. linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/12636499/1/]])

#+begin_quote
  Blaise's mother always taught him that self-preservation was the only rule in life, but he finds that it's easier said than done when he ends up having to use all his deception and intelligence to live through being thrown into Slytherin house in 1944. When joining a young Voldemort is just as dangerous as opposing him, Blaise doesn't have many appealing options to choose from.

** What was the fanfic where at least Harry and Ginny went back in time, and there was one other person but they had no idea who it was, and it ended up being Snape and/or Lupin? There was a story like that, and then another story where the third person was changed and Ginny was in Azkaban, I think?

** If you think about it, the safest person to send back in time to fix the past would be someone who had no interaction in the past with the canon characters so that they couldn't mess up their own past.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  A subtle manipulation. A time event. A surprising revelation from a desolate future. A monster unleashed. Follow the fate of the wizarding world when Albus Dumbledore is forced to change his way of thought. The lines of present, past and future blur and for once, Voldemort isnt the deadliest threat. Starts after the fourth year. Time-Travel! Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.
