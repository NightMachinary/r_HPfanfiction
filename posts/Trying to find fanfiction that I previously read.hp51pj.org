:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is going to be a long shot as I remember very little about this fanfic but one detail and its driving me insane that I can't find it again. So from what I remember snape gets a second head at some point that annoys him throughout the story. I know this is a long shot but if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.


** Um, if Snape's "second head" is his dick that's been charmed to insult him, you're looking for Brother Z by DrT that was on FictionAlley.

*** No he actually had a other head on his shoulder but that is an interpretation that I did not think of while asking this question.

**** I have never read that one but this one came to mind, and because it's not on AO3 or FFN I thought it might be harder to find. DrT is fantastic.
