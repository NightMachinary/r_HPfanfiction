** Everyone likes different things, jm not one for a ton of OCs, but even I am vaguely curious. Go ahead and post it, even if only one person finds it and enjoys it, you gave someone joy, ya know?

** I love stories that play between the lines of the canon books and don't mind OCs at all, but I don't think I'd be a big fan of your story as you describe it. (In general I am not a fan of Harry/Tom Riddle.)

Still, post the thing, somebody will enjoy it, I am sure.

** No, but if you enjoy it, publish it, remembering the claim by Michael Crichton “Books aren't written --- they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.”

**** I feel your pain: I have just decided that nothing less than complete rewrite (and changing from normal prose to the screenplay) won't help my story (and I have already published few chapters on AO3). :(

****** Everybody scolded me for being too heavy on dialogue (and they were right), so instead of keeping myself back I decided to run ahead and make it dialogue-only ;). Yes, and it keeps me to be more brief: 80+% of all fanfiction stories could (and should) be cut in half or more without loosing any information ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][some]] to 20 %), and I don't want to follow in the common footsteps.

******** Really? You know, that 200k words is Herman Mellive's “Moby-Dick”? OK, Moby-Dick is the adventure story, so let's compare apples with apples ... Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë is 183k words and Pride and Prejudice is 98k words.

Do you really think that “Grow Young With Me” (233k words and it is still WIP) has the same amount of plot? Do you really think that “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” (181k words) could be put next to “the real literature”? I have tried both of these with my Mum (former editor in the publishing house), and she was ranting about both of these how she would love to go through those stories with red pen. I am afraid, she is right.

** Yes. Gimme. Need a beta? I'm in. You wanna trade? I get this feeling we would REALLY like each other's fics. I have written 400K of an 800K-ish OBSCENE-LENGTH epfic. The pairing is OC/SS where OC is one year older than HP, and I'm so glad you like exploring Tom. My fic takes place during HBP and DH, and the Dark Lord IS the Black Hole Sun. Won't you come?

** Linkffn(Whats her name in Hufflepuff) and Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) are two fics with precisely this premise.

I've been sketching out a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fxhwif/how_would_you_feel_about_a_fic_that_uses_nothing/][Fallout crossover]] following an OC as well, and the responses I got for that were generally positive. Not really the same thing, but it's similar enough for the response to be applicable here as well, I'd say.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

** When I was starting to outline my fic, a lot of people told me this.\\
In the HP fandom writing a fic with OCs (even one) is going to guarantee unpopularity, pretty much.

Honestly? I wouldn't care about how much popular or how many views it'd get. I wanted to write it and I'm currently writing an AU fic with two OCs in it. I love them and I love my idea. They make sense with my plotline and they fit.

If you love it and want to repost, go for it. There's way more outrageous fanfiction in the HP fandom on AO3 and there IS audience even for that. So don't worry.

**** Yeah, It was a little sad and it felt like they were trying to dissuade me from writing it. Probably in fear it would be another Mary Sue/Gary Stu fic. If you can trust my word they are not that kind of OCs at all haha

No problem, as a fellow OC-writing author I kind of feel like it's my duty to encourage others to write what they like. Without fearing whatever stigma is attached to OCs.\\
Which btw I frankly think it's ridiculous to classify every single fic with an OC in it as automatically bad.\\
As if fanfiction with exclusively canon character were all good, /right/. /\/sarcasm**\\
Many people proved they can write very compelling fanfiction with an OC as the main character.\\
So you do you.\\
If you want I can help you, beta-ing or revising. Whatever you need.
