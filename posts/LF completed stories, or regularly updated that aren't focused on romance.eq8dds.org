The romance can be part of the story, but I'd rather it not be the main thing. I'm more looking for that Rowling vibe, with the characters interacting with each other, with some mystery and suspense, with some twists, et cetra. Or maybe more slice of life esque, or something like that, I don't care, not too picky.

It can be ANY ERA.

It can be on ANY Site

ANYONE can be the main character, it doesn't have to be Harry centric. Though it can be.

NO OP Harry. NO Harem Harry. No Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, et cetra.

If there are pairings, I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

I do NOT want: Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

NO character bashing.

I'd rather not have rehashes, if possible.


** Here are some non romance centered fics I've enjoyed :)

My first two recs won't work with the bot, so I'll put them first. They are also old fics and were written before the series was finished! Despite that they hold up really well, and I highly recommend them! [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1]]

*Shifts* and *Shades* by Fernwithy are are about what the Order was up to during OotP and HBP. POV characters are Remus, Tonks, and Sirius. Their summaries are-

#+begin_quote
  During the year of "Order of the Phoenix," Remus Lupin is assigned to protect Dudley Dursley by posing as a teacher at Smeltings.With the wizarding world at war, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin find themselves separated and facing a world with no masks left to hide behind. Alternative point of view of Half-Blood Prince; sequel to Shifts.

linkao3(1038392) *Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard* is essentially a sequel to Shifts and Shades. It's the first in a four part series about Teddy's time at Hogwarts and the growing pains of the Wizarding World post war. Imo this an excellent series, though heads up its old enough that it doesn't match up with info from Pottermore, so Teddy is in Gryffindor, not Hufflepuff.

linkao3(11914698) *renascienta: from the ashes* is the first in a regularly updated series about Regulus who did not die and instead hid in France until Voldemort is resurrected. One of my fave fics.

linkao3(15465966) *The Second String* is an AU that diverges at the beginning of OotP when Harry is kissed by the dementor on Privet Drive and his soul is sent to another place/time.

linkao3(7549384) *Sunshine in My Eyes* is an AU where Minerva raises Petunia and Lily.

linkao3(12424344) *Grey Space* is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until students are 14.

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels after getting hit by AK in DH, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early. Harry/Regulus

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. Petunia/Sirius pairing, which works far better than you'd think.

linkao3(15687453) *proof* is a fic about Harry recovering from the war and baking bread.

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels after getting hit by AK in DH, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early. Super slowburn romance, like it hasn't even happened in the fic yet.

linkao3(3652266) *And the brave man with a sword* is an AU set in 5th year where the Founders are basically immortal and come back to Hogwarts as students due to the rise of Voldemort and Ministry corruption. Pairings are Godric/Salazar and Helga/Rowena

linkao3(9191315) *tell me whether he is dead* where Harry has some unexpected problems after dying and coming back.

linkao3(15735828) *La Magique etude du Bonheur* is the first fic in a series where Regulus is sorted into Ravenclaw.

** The only one that I really like (and comes to mind) is linkao3(13968495). I know very little about Supernatural, but it was easy enough to follow the story.

** I firmly believe Weasley Girl is better than canon in some ways.

** I am really excited about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] by Cauchy updating again! Check it out - it has plenty of suspence and twists, and, in my opinion, a rowlingesque vibe. No romance at all since since that Harry is young, but it's not a childish fic at all. Harry has been through some dark shit in it; at the same time, his classmates act pretty age-appropriate.

** Here's a copy/paste of some of my favourites that fit your criteria:

Ongoing: *Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay* by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. *Saving Harry* [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.

Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' *The Heir Of House Black* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however, Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in-depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the style of canon with mysteries. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to canon. It's just an overall good quality fic.

Finished: *In Care Of* by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

Out of these, I think that *The Heir Of House Black* is the most mystery filled Rowling-esque story.
