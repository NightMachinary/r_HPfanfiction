How far would the magical world go to Try to be different to the muggle one?

Like instead of use Glass in there windows they use magic to stop things like rain,snow,cold, intruders,animal from getting in threw there windows?

or Making things hover instead of using the Wheel

Just how many Magical solution can you come up with to replace things that are to muggle in the magical world?

Things like glass windows , the Wheel, ect

just how magical can you make the magical world? (even if its probably more work than its worth they make a magical solution anyway just to be different)

*** Well would would/could you replace with a more magical solution?

So far I have thought of hover magic instead of the wheel,a magical barrier instead of glass in Windows and fuseing building materials together instead of mortar,nails,screw,ect

Other people,have suggested other stuff but what would you do?

**** But why would you want to replace stuff like the wheel? Sure, hovering is nice in theory, but you can always lift whatever you are "improving" with magic and let the wheels be there for the rest of the time. It's like the refrigerator. You can have the same effect with magic, but it is easier to simply plug it in and be done with. Not using magic is often the low effort solution and replacing muggle stuff with magic just for the sake of it is pointless.

***** I think OP meant more in a worlbuilding sort of way: things that may be easier the Muggle way, but, also like a refrigerator, rely on Muggle knowledge the wizards never discovered themselves and relied on the Muggles for. So that if you were worldbuilding a truly isolated wizard community, they would have developped some other solution.

I don't think the refrigerator is the best example for the point you are trying to make when to make one with magic all you need is a Box and a permanent charm to help in the preservation of food of which there are probably many, its so simple just a box and a charm and you don't even need to plug it in.

****** "Permanent Charm" is not a canon thing. You'd need to reapply it every now and then and if you forget to do that your food is spoiled. Whereas plug and forget is easier. (You'd need to clean both options occasionally, but that is just one charm and you are done).

******* Go re read the fifth book again, Permanent charms are a thing in canon although it's was a permanent sticking charm that was mentioned as the thing stopping them from getting rid of Sirus blacks mothers portrait off the wall.

But if one kind of permanent charm existed in canon it's a most likely that others do as well.

** Where does the distinction lie? You give an example of glass, but I don't think it's a particularly muggle thing.

Are houses muggle? Clothes? Books? Even the language then.

*** as long as you can think of a magic solution to replace them i would be interested in hearing it.

I think Houses and cloths are things that there is not a complete magical solutions for although you can change how they are made like instead of using mortar as an adhesive for stone and brick they could instead use magic to fuse the stone together

***** I am not sure how to answer that, its just to subjective.

I would say that concept of Creating shelter, cloths and written and spoken language are Universal , although that doesn't mean that some wizards might try and find magical solution for even them.

Edit :mabye anything that has been invented in the muggle world since the statute of secrecy (although the wizarding world would not be adverse to stealing a muggle idea and recreating it with magic)

** Not much.

The magical radio is a bit odd, but I don't know what you could replace it with that isn't significantly more Muggle even if it's more complex magically. The most sensible replacement would be a device which can remotely access and play a musical library, but your options there are to either use existing spells to create that effect, which would make it like a magical computer and probably "too Muggle," or create an absurdly complex spell with at least 4 separate functions specifically for that purpose. The most analog solution I can think of would be some kind of dynamic Protean Charm network which copied the grooves of a record and then just cheesed the electronic function with a simple charm that replicates the needle-to-sound function, which is far simpler. That's still pretty Muggle though, even if it is a bit more fantastic.

I don't know that things like structure or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine][simple machines]] are necessarily "Muggle" anyways. At some point, trying to shoehorn in magic makes your daily life more complicated than it would have been otherwise, without anything close to an equivalent benefit, which defeats the point.

Like, let's look at the typical office chair. You put wheels on the legs, now the chair is mobile. They're pretty simple to make and any craftsman, particularly one who can use basic spells, can almost certainly produce them with no problem. Or, you could put actual mobile legs on your chair. Now you need to be able to animate your chair, and it has to be able to not walk into walls, and it needs to be able to obey commands, most of which is overkill to slide a chair a few feet to the side on occasion, and makes the production of the chair many times more complicated than it needs to be.

Fact is, the simplest solution is usually the most effective, and a mundane, physical solution is usually simpler than a specially-crafted magical one.

Unless you want to blow something up, but that's another topic.

*** Or mabye a knowledge collective that all children born into the magical world are connected to at birth that allows then to draw knowledge from it about anything they need. And when a wizard dies there knowledge is completely uploaded to the information cloud so that no magical knowledge is lost.(It would probably filter out personal information and there would be a manual way to upload information while still alive)

And muggleborns would be connected to the knowledge collective at age 11

***** it wouldn't download all at once it would be more like a search engine, they ask it a Question and it supplies the information they want. Like they see an animal they don't know the name of the Information collective would give them the name.

since harry was born in the magical world he would be connected to it so it would drive the Dursleys nuts

****** okay but I don't think they should be able to access all of this as babies that would be weird af, maybe everyone should gain access at 11, instead of just muggleborns, and they learn how to use it at school?

******* I agree they would not be able to access all of it as baby's but they should maybe have a connection that grows stronger with time. the more they use it the more information they can get and the more control over what the information they get.

so say they see a bee as a child they should get its name and the fact that it can sting them and then as they grow older they would be able to access more information like the type of Bee.

they can learn to enquire for specific information like they find a plant they can ask its name and if it can be used as ingredients in potions, it wouldn't tell them what potions only yes or no and then they could ask for information on how to harvest the plant to see at the apothecary to make some pocket money
