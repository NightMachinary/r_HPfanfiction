#+TITLE: I’ve seen lots of fics where creatures are magically resistant and a big deal because of it but would you say their also resistant to damage in general? Would incendio be a magical fire and they be resistant or a normal one. Would a banister be physical force or a magical one.

I'd think that a vanished would create a physical force but even if not surely transfiguration or just picking stuff up and launching it could cause damage. I'd think magical creatures would be dangerous not just because of magical resistance but their traits. Like a Phoenix being dangerous in spite of little magical resistance (maybe) or a demiguise being dangerous because their hard to find.


** I'd treat it like Magic Resistance in D&D. At 100% MR you're immune to the Fireball that was just thrown at you. Unless you are also immune NORMAL fire, you better hope the forest/room didn't just burst into flame.

Conjuring is incredibly powerful here. A werewolf for example may be able to brush off a banisher or a stunner, but conjured ropes/chains will be effective. Bonus points if the conjured chains are silver.

** I'd assume they're resistant to everything. We never see any indication that people use nonmagical or conjured weapons against creatures like dragons or giants.

They just focus of magic resistance because it's unusual and extremely dangerous.

As for other creatures not being dangerous it's because anything not resistant to magic is always a single spell away from being defeated. There are spells to find the invisible, bezoars counteract almost any venom and a simple stupefy will drop most things, to say nothing of more powerful magic.

*** Wouldn't it be possible to asphyxiate them though? Whether something like the spell dumbledore used in the movie or modded bubblehead charm or even just something similar to a plastic bag?

**** I suppose if you could encase them in something they can't break, but the only time we've ever seen anything like that was Dumbledore dueling Voldemort, and Dumbledore is the strongest wizard of the century, so I doubt many could duplicate his spell.
