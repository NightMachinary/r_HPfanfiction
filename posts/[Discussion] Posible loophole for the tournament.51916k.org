What do you think about the suggestion that Harry can basicly go to every task but imidiatly surrenders and doesnt do anything?


** It's certainly not excluded by canon.

However, it should be noted that even in the Muggle world, contracts can contain terms which refer to parties using their "best endeavours" or "reasonable endeavours" to procure some result. I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that the binding magical contract of the Goblet of Fire contains such a provision, simply because if it didn't, you'd think Dumbledore (not to mention Maxime and Karkaroff) would have taken advantage of it to de facto exclude Harry from the tournament.

Further, consider the alternative. The Goblet can't bind you into winning the tournament, because then the losers would be in breach of contract. So it surely must bind you only into participation. You'd think any definition of participation worth its weight would be one of active participation.

** There was recently a story request thread about that:

  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yqea0/any_stories_in_which_harry_deliberately_flanks/][Any stories in which Harry deliberately flunks the Tournament tasks after being roped into it?]] I don't see how even a “magically binding” artefact could make him not merely participate in it but aim to win as well. /(submitted 15 days ago)/

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/][/Harry Potter: Unchampion/]] (25,236 WL; Complete) --- the most realistic outcome portrayed. In other stories Harry's decisions of non-competition suddenly ends up being beneficial for him in various ways. Here it's mostly what it is, him saving himself the trouble and risks attached to TWT.

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/][/Muggle-Raised Champion/]] (106,020 WL; WiP) --- technically well-written story and interesting to read, but unfortunately also has wishful thinking elements. Harry decides to waste minimal effort on each task, but somehow the odds end up on his side each time and he ends up winning without even planning to.

    - +/Here's to the Losers/+ --- badly written, wishful thinking, crackfic

    - +/Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion/+ --- badly written, toilet humour, wishful thinking, crackfic, Weasley bashing

** I think that it's definitely a possibility, as I've never read a fic where you can't forfeit a task. Whenever I've seen forfeiting mentioned, it has always been allowed, but I usually see Harry do something else rather than forfeiting, even though it is really the easiest way out.

** You could write it that way if you so desire. That said, at least some people are of the opinion that if we assume that there is a binding contract that forces the contestant to participate then said contract would also force them to actually try, and immediately surrendering is not, in any way, trying.

** The goblet binds you to participate. It may bind you to participate actively, but it certainly doesn't bind you to use a given strategy or type of strategy.

I'd like to read the story of Harry in the first task. He enters the arena, sits in a corner and simply waits for the dragon to fall asleep and then catch the egg.

Meanwhile, the story would focus on an impossible (and really cracky) situation that would emerge from the actions of some people in the public and grow out of control. Something with a lot of misunderstandings and shenanigans. Some slapstick maybe...

Is there something like that out there?

** You could certainly write that. You could also have it require at least a token effort, so Harry can't just step across the starting line and immediately retreat. Or the Goblet might produce a mental compulsion that forces Harry to try to win. Or it might track his intention to compete, so that he must try as hard as he can, and Dumbledore could shut him in the dungeons during the event and trap him in bonds he can't break.

There are a lot of ways to play with the tournament relative to Harry's degree of participation and desire to win.

** I dont think he could simply forfeit without breaching the contract as its "participation" implies active participation. But without reading the contract no one really knows so it could certainly be written and be perfectly believable.

That said, the loophole I have always been curious about relates more to "cheating". You never hear about whether there are any provisions in the contract relating to cheating. And since many of the champions do get "help" from someone, what constitutes cheating and if someone does cheat, what would happen. Cheating of course covers a pretty wide variety of possibilities, from spells that are darker, to useage of things that bypass aspects of challenges (for example a portkey to the bottom of the lake or secret path directly to the center of the maze).
