I've been thinking about this Fic a lot lately but can't seem to find it. But here are some of the main plot points:

I believe it begins right after graduation.

Harry and Hermione decide to get together, but that isn't really thefocus.

Andromeda dies so Harry becomes Teddy Lupin's guardian.

Kingsley becomes a kind of frenemy because he has aspirations for Minister of Magic and Harry is seen as too much of a wild card.

Lucius Malfoy and others get off and are planning a political takeover of the Ministry.

I remember it being fairly brutal but there wasn't much sexual content.

Also Luna plays a big role and helps Harry a lot with Teddy.


** I don't re all how involved Luna is, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]? Linkffn(11858167)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** This one is definitely not it. The trio live together in this one, and while they're all 'together', it is more Ron and Hermione always retreating upstairs for some alone time without any real Harry/Hermione interactions.

*** Nice one. I took a look but I don't think this it. Looks interesting though, might have to give it a read. Thanks

**** I'll look. I used to be a fan of the pairing, but now I'm more apathetic to it. But I've read quite a bit.
