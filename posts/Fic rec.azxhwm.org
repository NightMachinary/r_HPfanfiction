Hi I just found this subreddit and wanted to mention a fic series called ‚ÄúSacrifices‚Äù there's 8 stories in it, completely AU, following all 7 yrs of Harry's ordeal at Hogwarts, slow moving HPDM.

** The good old Arc of Sacrifices. As far as I can remember thats the first fic I ever read. And boy was I sad after discovering that most fanfics dont have that quality level worldbuilding.

**** 85% of fanfiction is utter crap. Another 10% of fanfiction is tolerable. 4% of fanfiction is good. 1% of fanfiction is legitimately amazing. This series you recommended falls into the last category.

** I remember I was really tempted to read this because of how much of it was complete even though I've never particularly been a fan of slash. I read up to around the third or fourth story (I don't quite remember) and I agree that there was a lot of nice world-building from what I recall. But (SPOILER) once Harry lost his hand, I just gave up because it seemed like every bad thing possible kept happening to Harry and it didn't seem like there would be an end to it. I'm a fan of angst but it became too much and too frustrating for me.

*** Yeah it was a whole new level of angst üòÖ sometimes I'd put it down and walk away for a while coz damn that's a lot of angst to take in all at once.

** I've just finished this fic now and I can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever read! I see a lot of people bashing draco/the slash and Snape's portrayal, but I thought they were both very consistent and wonderfully developed. Awesome read
