  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.

** linkffn(12597395)

Harry has been reborn 27 times (making this his 28th life). He always retains his memories, so as a baby he's very much an adult. Though, as he laments on several occasions, he can't really do anything about it until he can "relearn" his muscles to walk and talk.

EDIT: Just to clarify, this rebirth has never been again as "Harry Potter" until the events of this story take place.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
