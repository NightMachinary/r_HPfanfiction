** It is not Harry, but Sirius, linkffn(Royal Ward by Catstaff). It is incredibly tropey and I don't think I have ever finished reading it. The setup of the story is incredibly good, but that setup has enough power for one-shot, not for novel-length story.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
