Basically, I find it ridiculous just how many fics that have Harry with a veritable harem of women after him all decide that they're okay with sharing him and set up a time-share for his junk. So, I want a fic that tears that idea down, and instead turns it into a free-for-all for who can snag the Boy-Who-Lived's heart, ala Ranma 1/2. Bonus points if there's no clear winner and everyone is unhappy with the situation, including Harry.


** NonJon did that in 'You did what?' Harry broke it off with all of them and declared his love for Nicholas Flamel. I honestly suggest everyone to read the whole 'Where in the World is Harry Potter?' trilogy.

** Sounds amazing my number one thing about these fics is that when and if the girls come to him or he finds the girls "together" he is super ok with it. Make no sense to me so a free for all sounds awesome.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** Linkffn(Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg) seems to have Harry accidentally gaining a harem and he's completely resisting it. I loathe harem fics but this one is well written to the point that if it does go down that road I'd be okay with it. It's definitely not the focus of the story, though.
