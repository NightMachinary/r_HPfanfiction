** Dumbledore starts throwing massive spells at the aurors. Most of them soon prove to be no match to the powerful wizard. The air rushes cold as a strong depulso throws Dawlish against the wall, Dumbledore is quick in letting a huge gargoyle crush him to his death.

Gracefully, the headmaster swirls out of a spell and stares defiantly at Kingsley Shacklebolt and Hestia Jones. Only Kingsley, the mightiest of them, all manages to stand his ground. Hestia soon dies from a nasty reducto, but Shacklebolt dodges a severing charm successfully.

Dumbledore animates a huge gargoyle, but Kingsley jumps and blasts the gargoyle to debris. The planet maps on the ceiling are the only witnesses to the epic duel that's taking place.

Kingsley sees an opening, manages to push Dumbledore against the Astronomy Tower's window, where a cold gust of air blows. Dumbledore stumbles, the most vulnerable he has ever been since the fight started.

That's when Harry Potter arrives at the tower.

"You are under arrest, Professor." says Kingsley.

"Harry! My boy! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Aurors are taking over." cries the headmaster, heaving. His hat is in the floor and his silvery hair is now playing with the night wind.

Kingsley Shacklebolt isn't fazed by the apparent vulnerability. "You old coot! The oppression of your 'Greater Good' will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Ministry is over . . . you have lost . . ."

"No! No! You will die!"

Dumbledore unexpectedly raises his wand, and a ring of fire emerges from it. It's blocked by Kingsley's aguamenti just in the nick of time. Water and fire collide in a struggle of smoke and thunder.

"He is a traitor, Harry." Dumbledore pleads, doing a collosal effort.

Kingsley tries to get to Harry as well, the old wizard proving to be more resistant than he had imagined. "He's the traitor. Stop him!"

A big brass or representing Neptune comes crashing don with a metallic echo. Harry barely jumps out of the way and stares back at the fight, wide-eyed. Unable to decide who is right.

It is true Dumbledore has proven deceitful, what with the manipulations he has been pulling. Still, Harry needs him. Dumbledore assured him he had the resurrection stone, which he promised to use on Sirius and his parents.

"Come to your senses, my boy. The Aurors are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me."

"Aarrrrggghhhhh !" struggles Kingsley.

Dumbledore's voice relaxes, but the twinkling of his eyes seem to be fading. "You are not one of them, Harry. Don't let him kill me."

"Aarrrrggghhhhh !" continues Kingsley

The voice of the headmaster is more tempting than ever "I am your pathway to defeating death. I have the power to bring back the ones you love. You must choose. You must stop him."

"Don't listen to him, Harry."

The headmaster seems weaker, yet he is putting all his energy into his fire spell. The very walls of the Astronomy Tower seem to be a dance of flames. The shadows make them seem as melting. They might not be in hell just yet, but they are getting there.

"Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . ."

Suddenly, Kingsley Shacklebolt manages to beat Dumbledore's fire, bringing it on top of its caster. Dumbledore raises his other hand to protect his face. The fire is burning his left hand now.

With a searing scream Dumbledore pleas to Harry. "I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer."

Dumbledore's hand is getting charred and black much too quickly.

Kingsley's blue hat flies away. His Blu runic robes swinging violently with the wind. He yells at his former headmaster. "You are a disease. I am going to end this once and for all."

Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head. His scar seems to be hurting now. He opens his eyes again and sees his dream of seeing his loved ones fade with the headmaster's strengths.

"You can't kill him, Kingsley." Harry begs, pulling his own wand out. "He must stand trial."

"He has too much control of the Wizengamot and the Department of Law Enforcement. He is too dangerous to be kept alive."

"I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please." Dumbledore's voice is barely whisper now.

"It is not the Auror way . . ."

Kingsley comes on top. The fire disperses and Dumbledore's wand falls from his hand, exhausted. The auror raises his wand again.

"He must live . . ." Harry takes a step forward.

"Please don't, please don't . . ."

Kingsley's wand starts shinning.

Harry can't seem to hold it any longer, "I need him . . ."

"Please don't . . ."

"NO!!!" Harry yells. Just as Kingsley is about to curse the headmaster, Harry steps forward "Sectumsempra!"

Kingsley stares at Harry in shock as his face and chest is cut by invisible razors. Dumbledore laughs like a maniac, picks his wand up and curses the Auror out of the window. "Avada Kedabra!" the old coot yells. "Power! Unlimited power!"

His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. Harry looks on in horror. Albus Dumbledore cackles.
