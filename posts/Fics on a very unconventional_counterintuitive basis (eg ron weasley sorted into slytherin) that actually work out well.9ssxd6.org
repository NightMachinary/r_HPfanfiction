Ron can see the future by touching people. He saw Fred die, and the sorting hat forces him to confront the situation. That results in him ending up in Slytherin.

**** These two fics I've linked are the only fics, Ron wise, that I'll probably ever read. Everything else is either bashing or clumsy handling when it comes to Ron.

I'm saying this as someone who doesn't really like the canon pairings.

***** There's this really promising fic that's just started that's about Ron as an Auror with a some good relationship development with Hermione in which Death Eaters return and old secrets from the First War and the Prewett family emerge. Good pacing so far, and I'm impressed with the set up but there are some sex scenes. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13085565/1/The-Ancient-and-Most-Noble-House-of-Prewett]])

****** If we're talking good Ron stories:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2056512/1/Invisible-Circus]] (Fairly canon, through it was started pre Deathly Hallows)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died]] (Massive Au from the the days after Voldemort first was defeated)

Edit:

Also, I forgot my favourite Slytherin!Ron fic (of the 4 or 5 that have been written). [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7287138/1/To-Be-By-Your-Side]]

****** I'll take a look, but canon pairings aren't really my thing. Prewetts are barely used outside of the First War's era, so that sounds interesting.

*** just tried "Choices", but I had to tap out after one and a half chapters. the writing is atrocious.

skipped to chapter 10 to see whether it improved... first sentence:

#+begin_quote
  Ron was in a foul mood the following day, shooting dark glares toward Lockhart's direction who would return it with a wide smile...
#+end_quote

**** Yikes. I honestly can't remember when it was that the author got a beta reader. It's been a while since I read it. I guess I was hooked by the premise and characterization to really care for the errors. I can't remember.

** Not the specific example you mentioned, but going by unconventional ideas there's this fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13090712/1/Headshot][Headshot]] which has Voldemort working as a catalog photographer while he's establishing the Death Eaters, and Bellatrix meeting him as one of his models. It's rated M.
