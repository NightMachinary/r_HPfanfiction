I have been reading Quantum Leap and I love the treatment Hedwig is receiving from the fic. Is there more? Perhaps where becomes 'human-magus' and turns into an adorable and witty beauty?\\
Also in Time Warp she is featuring as a 'Laser Owl', part of a team of magical animals fighting evil with laser beams shooting out of her eyes :P\\

** The only time-travelling Hedwig story I know: A Familiar's Work is Never Done by Triscribe linkao3(22428418)

And can you provide author names and/or links to the two stories you referenced? Both of those titles are a bit generic. I know I've read the one with laser eyes before but can't remember any details.

  (Have you ever read a time travel fix-it where a *bird* is the one to travel to the past? No? Didn't think so, which is why I decided one needed to be written.)
