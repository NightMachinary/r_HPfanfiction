** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Reads like a heist movie. Voldemort is a side plot in the first half. Hermione becomes a literal catburglar playing a cat and mouse game with Harry and Ron who work as aurors. Harry and Hermione centric, alternating.

Linkffn(Invincible)

Wizards in space adventure after earth got destroyed leading into a Battlestar Galactica crossover. Harry centric.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Still in progress, weekly updates. Backstory is that in the middle of the anti Voldemort war Hermione got catapulted into a different dimension, and has to get back. Story is told from the perspective of the Ron in this alternative universe.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

The Statute of Secrecy goes down the drain, muggles start experimenting with magic, Voldemort changes strategy and works with muggle terrorist groups and North Korea, Rasputin makes a big comeback, portkeys replace rockets both in space travel and in nuclear weapons delivery, and someone installs a time turner in a DeLorean and does a time trip to get lottery numbers. Crazy, weird and full of interesting concepts.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again.

** If you count crossovers, I'm a big fan of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality). Sure, the HP universe is present, but so is the Matrix and the author integrated the two fairly well. Voldemort isn't at all a focus or even an issue in this fic.

Otherwise, there are all the fics that occur outside the canon time line, since most of them don't involve the stations of canon. I was a big fan of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]) Where Draco needs to learn to be a muggle for a few years to avoid being put into Azkaban. Or say linkffn(In the Bleak Midwinter) where a time traveling Hermione Granger convinces Tom Riddle Sr. to take care of Jr. rather than leaving him to the orphanage.

As far as stuff that occurs during the canon timeline, normally fics with a heavy AU tend to be more divergent from the stations of canon. Like say linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) where Lily lives by conducting some kind of underworld ritual to spare Harry, which has ramifications as he grows older.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Methods of Rationality has some elements inspired by canonical first year but is essentially a whole new story. OTOH, the characters are quite a bit different to canon, so you might not feel like it's a HP story at all.
