** I only know of one. It's fem!Harry, hasn't reached Hogwarts yet, and hasn't been updated since January this year, but it's the only one I've seen. Take it or leave it, I guess?

  Emily J. Potter was a relatively normal child, except for that bizarre ghostly-friend of hers. Then the letter from Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft & Wizardry arrived and nothing has been quite the same anymore.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/database-dive-gamer-si-multi-crossover.505634/]]

It's a gamer/multicross story (/a la/ jumpchain), but the MC does wind up in the Harry Potter universe, and both Harry and Voldemort get stands. It's a fun story even considering the non-HP elements. Also, it splits into two stories running in parallel at one point.

  A power-granting bow and arrow, Stands, and immovable objects... And here Harry Potter thought his life was crazy enough even without being related to some dudes with stars on the backs of their necks. Being born into the bloodline of the most bizarre family on the planet, however, meant that his life was destined for insanity. He just didn't know it yet.
