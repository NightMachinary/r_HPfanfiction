Harry became the Master of Death a long time ago..but really that meant he was just the New Death. He watched as society would rise and collapse many times, until Earth reset itself. He wasn't just called Death anymore. He was called one of the Old Gods, the Stranger, the Many Faced God, The Crow, Namo.

He never understood why he had so many. flipping. names. But it no longer mattered. He really didn't care about being worshipped or being a god. He just wanted the world to hurry up and invent Cheetos again (it'd been so l o n g since he tasted them, he was obsessed). Harry had tried to tell someone about how to make his favorite snack before...the only problem with that was that wearing a shimmering black cloak and having green glowing eyes was APPARENTLY terrifying.

It's a crappy prompt since I can't write. You're welcome to take any elements from this! Tag me if you do, I'd love to read!


** I would read that. Also... pumpkin tart flavored cheetos.

** That would be hilarious. He keeps popping up asking people for cheetos, and scaring them to death. The only ones who don't, are too emo to listen.

*** Omg Jon Snow, emo boy extraordinaire, tells Harry he doesn't know what a "chi-toe" is, only to receive a scowl and a curt reply of, "you know nothing Jon Snow."

OR

Thranduil being too concerned about his twiggy crown to acknowledge that maybe one of the Valar is probably insane.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

** Bonus points if the cloak of invisibility is like the magic carpet from Aladdin. Sassy af and gets pouty when Harry wears other clothes.
