And, I'll be honest, I'm unfortunately not expecting much. What I'm looking for here is probably a difficult combination to get right.

1. No Slash
2. Complete
3. Quality

Those things in that order are what I'm looking for. More than anything, I am /not/ looking for an Alpha/Omega fest either slash or het but particularly not slash. I'm just looking for a story that plays interestingly with the concept of a Harry transformed into a werewolf by whatever means the author wishes to do so.

Story is called forever knight.

Pretty good harmony story. Takes place post war. Hermione is a vampire. It is a harmony story though there is a stretch of the book where they aren't together due to hermione being bullheaded about being a vampire

Edit: sorry I reread your title, didn't realize your looking for harry to be the vampire or werewolf
