Reading Fanon, it seems like many people have concluded that the Longbottom fortune has always been based on their Herbology skills. This seems to have developed as a way to either explain how Neville is so good at Herbology or to show how Herbology can be a useful skill, growing potion ingredients and getting rich and such.

However, I don't believe that the Longbottom fortune is based on Herbology. If that were the case, Neville's grandmother would have always praised his skill at Herbology and not minded so much that he didn't show much accidental magic or was very good at "wand courses". Instead, we see Neville always being an...object of concern...in the eyes of his grandmother. She seems to think that he isn't skilled and that he will be unable to live up to the legacy of his family.

This leads me to believe that the Longbottom fortune is based on something else. Maybe enchanting? A very complicated subject that takes a lot of magical power and skill at "wand courses", like Charms. On a side note, many fanfics say that Augusta was very good at Charms, maybe she was an Enchantress or similar and that is how she contributed to the family's finances. If the Longbottoms had always gotten rich from plants, I think that Neville would have always been praised and encouraged to continue his love of plants, instead of it being merely tolerated.

I do love the idea that Herbology can be the basis of a great family fortune, but I do think that it is what the Longbottoms got rich from originally. However, I think it is cool to imagine the resurgence of the House of Longbottom having a foundation on Herbology. Maybe Neville writes a grimoire full of his Herbology discoveries/notes to pass down to his children. Maybe Neville is the cause, not a symptom, of the Longbottom fortune being thought to be from Herbology.

Just an idea I had this morning. Thoughts?

Edit: so apparently Augusta wasn't good at Charms. The fanfic I read not too long ago caused me to remember differently. But that wasn't really the main point of the post.

Edit: I realize there isn't a lot of evidence in Canon about the Longbottom wealth. I was referring to a common Fanon theme however


** Wasn't it canon that Augusta failed her Charms OWL? And thats why she didn't want Neville taking a NEWT in it?

I think your idea is interesting, that Neville's talents lie far outside what the family is traditionally known for. I don't know that they have to be super wealthy, just solidly upper middle class. Frank was an Auror. What if the Longbottom's have a tradition of ministry service? It'd be quite reasonable, given the small size of the UK wizarding community, that you'd have a few families known for always joining the Ministry, and always rising reasonably high within it. That sort of family history would likely lead to a reasonable level of wealth, nothing truly amazing, but definitely enough to become some generational wealth as long as no one too profligate took control of it. Neville being focused on herbology would put the kibosh on a Ministry career, which Augusta might think of as the only proper route for him to go.

Alternatively, if we assume that the Longbottom's are truly wealthy, part of the aristocracy of the wizarding world...maybe their fortune is based on Herbology but Augusta has a snobbish attitude that "one doesn't actually work for a living, one has people who take care of that". They used to do herbology themselves, now they employ people to do it all and rely on the Longbottom brand to sell the products.

*** All valid points!

And i can't remember Augusta much in Canon. So I may very well have made a mistake.

And I was mostly going off the Fanon I've read, which is the Longbottoms are pretty wealthy.

**** The Longbottom's wealth is never established at all, its just the assumption that as a pureblood family they're wealthy. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea that they're just 10 generations of mid to senior ranked Ministry workers. Maybe the occasional Department Head, Frank was probably on track to become Chief Auror in 30 or 40 years time if he'd survived. Maybe Frank's dad was Undersecretary for Magical Disasters and Catastrophes when he retired, and his father was Head of the Obliviators.

That sort of steady, solid job with a decent wage, in a society where magical talent results in reduced living costs, would definitely result in a good amount of wealth passing on to each new generation.

Don't knock the department heads. Arthur Weasley could afford all of those kids with a Department Head's salary.

******* Then he would be a division/office head.

I don't know though, the DMLE seems like half the government itself. A division/office head there might be equivalent to the Department heads in the rest of the MOM.

** There is no basis to think the Longbottoms were particularly wealthy, they were clearly in the middle of Weasley-poor and Malfoy-rich.

In 6th year when Neville want to do NEWT level Transfiguration clases, McGonagall tells him he won't be able to keep up with course-load with only an Acceptable in his OWL, but that he should take Charms (in which Neville got an E, apparently). And then Mcgonagall says that she is going to write to Augusta to tell her that just because /she/ (Augusta) failed her Charms OWL, it doesn't mean that the subject is worthless. So clearly Neville's grandmother valued Transfiguration over Charms (I think she called Charms the 'soft' option)

Maybe Neville's ability in Herbology was inherited from her mother's side and so it is not a Longbottom tradition. I truly believe that his ability in the subject was.uaed to show how it can be an useful area of study.

** I admit, I haven't really seen anything like this beyond the usual "House of Longbottom, Earl of Somewhereshire, Lord of Tuckus" things from Lord Harry Potter-Black-Merlin-etc-etc-de-Rollo-III-Huzzah! trope fics.

Do you have any recs where the Longbottoms are the Big Herb family of the Magical World? I'm curious what that might look like.

** Since you are looking for Fanon alternatives, one option could be Landed Genrty. You want the Longbottoms wealthy and in high society, but in such a way that Frank serving as a Dark Wizard hunter isn't a negative the way it would be if he was expected to carry on some sort of family business such as managing greenhouses or an import company, etc. Wealthy landowners works well though, they could own a number of wizarding properties or some sort of magical forest/preserve, collecting rent, subsidizes from the ministry for preserving magical plants and animals, and fees for collecting resources from their preserves. Something where the hard work was done generations ago, someone has been hired to manage everything, and the Longbottoms get a nice fat deposit in Gringotts every month.

Augusta is obviously proud of her son and his decision, if you want to tie in with that the original land could have been granted to them by the crown centuries ago for services rendered in defeating a Dark Lord.
