Similar to that fic where Ron is a wreck, gets drunk and accidentally pushes a kid into a pool. Not looking for Ron bashing specifically but that reaction to Harry if that makes sense?

Bonus points if Hermione has a bitchy aunt/cousin.


** Linkffn(How to get engaged to Hermione Granger by Flora Jones)

That should fall in a similar bracket :)

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. M-rating for smut in ch. 4 and up.

** I don't have anything to suggest but do you have a link for the fic you mentioned? I feel like maybe I've read it before but I would like to read it again.
