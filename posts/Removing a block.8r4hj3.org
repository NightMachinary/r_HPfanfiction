****** It's like the typical FFN clich√©s taken to their logical conclusion. Might as well stop writing those at this point, because nothing is going to top this fic.

** linkffn(HP and the Refiner's Fire by Abraxan) - not from being unhexed or something, but Harry goes through a serious power-up process.

And there's always [[https://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]] - experimental mutant mix Harry awakens to his awesomeness with the help of ridiculous and over-the-top underage sex, then gets taught how to be godlike by Norse spirits. Plus bike racing.
