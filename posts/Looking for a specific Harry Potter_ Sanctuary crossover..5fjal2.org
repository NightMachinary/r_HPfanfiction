In which Harry is discovered by a Mr. Weatherby sealed into the old Weasley family ring. Old Earth is a burning dead world, with the exception of the Pheonix's and the Goblins. The former because their imortal and the later because they live in the old Potter family vault, the only vault left. Any help would be much appreciated.


** I am not certain, but that sounds suspiciously similar to the HP/Firefly crossover by Nonjon, though it has been some time since I have read it. Browncoat, Green Eyes is its name, but someone more familiar with it would be able to confirm it.

** Yeah that's Browncoat, Green Eyes. And it's HP/Firefly.
