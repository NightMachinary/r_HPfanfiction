Look, I don't know how it would happen. Maybe after the ministry heist, when the Order's hiding place is revealed?

Just come up with whatever shenanigans you must to get Draco to the doorstep of No. 12 Grimmauld Place.

I just want Draco Malfoy to face that shadow of Dumbledore, that attacks anyone who steps through the door. What does he feel, as he sees the vengeful shade of the man he was supposed to kill? In the books, Harry deactivates the protection by saying, "I didn't kill you." to the shade. What happens if you don't do that?

Please, somebody cleverer than me write a one-shot exploring this. Maybe it sparks some kind of redemption arc for Draco? Maybe it's the reason he was so reluctant to identify Harry at Malfoy Manor?
