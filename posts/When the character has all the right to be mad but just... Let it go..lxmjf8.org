I'll not be able to mention any specific fanfiction, but I'm sure anyone has come across it at least 1 time.

There's s conflict and, let's say Ron and Hermione do something that thoroughly upset Harry, it might be telling on him, or saying something that they think is right but, regardless if it really is or not, Harry disagrees. Anything like that.

And then. THEN. They don't apologize for upsetting their friend. No. It's HARRY who has to apologize or recognize he was wrong (even if he wasn't).

Or even, if characters have a fight or something and person A says some shit to person B. It's never person A who has to go and say they were wrong, bc they weren't affected and don't understand why person B is so mad.

If there's one thing I think Rowling did right was, during books 3 and 4, not to deal with the trio's fighting as if they were nothing. It took months for them to actually get back talking. And that's so much more realistic than just... Whatever I described before.

I find it so fucking frustrating and unrealistic that fights that should last for days at least, just don't because of lazy writing. It feels like the author is just too lazy to put effort into creating a believable conflict.

/EDIT - I have an example now: in the fanfiction Innocent (witch is brilliant, my favorite fanfic and usually pretty good with these kinda stuff). So, Tonks is a trainee and she has a boyfriend. Said boyfriend does not want her to be an auror bc it's too dangerous, but mainly because she *doesn't have time for him/. She actually resolves the situation, she doesn't leave it open, witch was good. But the approach she took, where Tonks kinda acted like the guy had the right to ask her to leave her dream job just because of him, and did stuff she wasn't even allowd to, to try and save her relationship is infuriating to me. She wasn't in the wrong and had to go out of her way to please him. And I know this is realistic, people do this IRL, but this same situation happens time and time again in fanfics and isn't believable at all.


** Similar to this, when character A does something that character B would rightly get upset about, the author has every other character act like character B is wrong to be upset and essentially bashes character B for it. The most frequent example that comes to mind is Hermione hooks up with canon-Draco during or very soon after Hogwarts and Ron is viewed as the unreasonable one for being upset about that.

*** I remember one fic where history repeated itself and Draco pulled a prank that nearly killed Harry and Dumbledore covered the whole thing. So Hermione was angry at Harry because he wanted to hold Draco accountable. It was just so out of character for Hermione to go off on Harry for being the victim and wanting justice. Well, the fic was tagged as Snape/ Hermione so I honestly don't know what I was expecting.

** The ultimate example in my view is the way Harry treats the Dursleys. Even in fanfics where the abuse is made worse than in canon (which it already was), even in the case where they steal from Harry's vault to pay for his upbringing, many fanfic writers still make Harry just forgive them with no further conflict. The worst thing is when his friends then laud him for his forgiveness. Like you said, it's lazy writing, but it's also one of many harmful character traits that get wrongly praised in fanfics.

I just don't like that I keep reading the same reaction of Harry, but also everyone agreeing with him that it is the right and mature or morally good thing to do. Hell no! It is not right to let child abusers continue with their lives with no consequences. Especially if the school / a teacher knows, they are morally obligated to report that to the authorities who by law have to follow up on it.

**** I think this choice that annoys you is valid (though I agree that Harry's reaction is annoying). HP could take 3 general approaches to the Dursleys:

1) Positive - confront them about their abuses without being violent. Will likely be a heated convo; might salvage a relationship, at least with Dudley 2) Negative - Revenge/justice meted out to the Dursleys by either Harry or other magical person 3) Neutral - ignore them and never think about them again. No chance of them hurting HP with more venomous words, no chance of regrets for hurting them. Heck, let them think he is dead. Simply pretend they never existed. Compared to 1 and 2, this minimizes the chance of getting sucked into further interactions, which I think matters most.

** JKR brushes away apologies, surely thinks she doesn't need to acknowledge that someone apologized and keeps it off screen because it's either not in Harry's POV or it doesn't add to the story. Sometimes she even shields in how she made the trio really close but not that open to each other to skip it (the trio is really awkward bunch of close friends, but that helps enhance the tension, they don't tell some things to each other, they don't hug, they don't discuss romantic interests...)

I guess she had a point in wanting to keep the book more concise, but a single sentence from time to time would have been good.

Some of them:

Ron to Hermione for what he said before the troll: It certainly happened off screen. But it was a quick one or two sentence thing between other conversation. Harry might or might not been there.

The pet fiasco in book 3: There might have been a deeper conversation about between Ron and Hermione, without Harry. But maybe, awkward as they are, decided to leave it like that. "The other must know I am sorry anyway, why do I have to say it?"

Ron and Harry in book 4... I think book version was realistic and that was it. Just the boys shrug it over

Ron and Hermione to Harry and the other at around in book 5 is more difficult. It wasn't that big conflict and a lot of minor rudeness from Harry and blaming them for something they didn't do. Harry felt himself to be the victim, but Hermione and Ron had no real issue there. And Dumbledore did apologize by the end of the book, I think. The discovery of the scar thing makes it difficult, as Harry had an excuse to being rude, but no one knew for a long while. Then Umbridge just put everyone in crappy humour all year. There might have been dozens of minor "I'm sorry for what I said yesterday" exchanges... But they couldn't be on screen, not that important and draw away from the story. Cho was looking for an apology from Harry and Hermione for what happened to her friend though, she just didn't get it.

Book 6 was a mess. We don't see Ron and Hermione apologizing to each other... But I want to believe they did at some point. The birds was intense. Not sure if Ron and Hermione Would apologize for not believing Harry on Malfoy or him for not beliy Hermione with the Prince book... but with Dumbledore's death, blaming people is the last thing they needed then.

In book 7 the big one is Ron, who does apologize. But I guess there's a bunch of things in the tent we don't see anyone apologize for... But given the "it's the locket fault" argument, that's hardly an issue and they very well aware what the offending part is good through as well.

*** My issue is that in fanfics mostly, authors will never build conflict. They will generally just treat things like minor inconveniences that might as well be brushed over.

I think Rowling could have written a bunch of apologies. And I also think she should have. But I like that she didn't just pretend that, The Firebolt Incident was nothing, for example. It really did upset Harry and I don't think he should just accept that Hermione did it because she thought it was the right thing. He was 13. I do think he should apologize to her eventually and I think she should as well.

What I don't like is when, let's use the Pet Fiasco in POA as an example: Ron, in the end was in the wrong, we all know that. And I also don't think he should've treated Hermione like he did, but at some point we didn't know if the cat had really eaten the rat or not. I've seen it a bunch of times: Ron would end up apologizing for being upset and lashing out (when he thought he had lost his pet) and Hermione would be "benevolent" and nice for apologizing him, never really recognizing she might be in the wrong as well.

It's so so common, the person who has been wronged has to apologize for being upset, or lashing out when they have a solid reason and the other person doesn't even apologize... It just frustrates me to no end.

***** My problem is with who's apologizing, not the apology itself (or lack of it).

A good example someone gave was: Hermione hooks up with canon-draco right after the battle, Ron gets upset and everyone acts like he's unreasonable and he has to apologize for being upset/hurt.

I've seen it countless times and I just don't see it being believable, realistic. It's lazy writing in my opinion. It's not just about narrative economy, but about not wanting/being able to write a conflict and opt for the easy way out (even if both parts should apologize in the end - and it doesn't need to be a whole scene, the good "they apologized afterwards" would be enough).

But the broom? I don't think there's any reason for the boys to be upset for longer than a day. Harry was supposedly in danger, and receives such a gift? I'd gladly do the same thing as Hermione if it meant I could sleep better knowing one of my BEST FRIENDS won't be killed due to the broom

** My take on this:

Many authors write their MC's as somewhat of an extension of themselves. They do not have or want the ability to have their MC's make decisions that they themselves wouldn't make, even if they make sense for the character.

Example: not punishing Snape in fic, even if he's atrocious in said fic, because the author might like the character. Same with Draco or many women or guys attracted to the same gender digging Harry/Tom Riddle. Morally wrong and completely nonsensical, yet very popular. Often times the good guys are being have to made the villains for it to be atleast somewhat acceptable.

I myself like stories where Harry is almost a punisher like character that is extremely hard on his enemies. And I realise that's a representation of who I am/like to be. But maybe not many people have that same level of self awareness when writing their fics? Like how people that enjoy 6 lordships, super rich, harem Harry fics want to be victimized playboy billionaires in real life?

Of course, it's also just lazy writing or a low level of emotional understanding, as you pointed out.

P.S. I once, unfortunately, read a story that was supposedly written by an author who experienced sexual assault/rape in their life. Their MC (Harry) gets raped in the story by Snape. And he just...let's it go. Maybe the author never had some closure themselves? Maybe they were so damaged that they actually accepted it? Maybe they're an extremely forgiving person? Who knows. Case in point, their MC's are often almost SI's.

But at the end of the day, this IS fanfiction, and not an extension of canon. So the stories and its characters can be completely different than how they are in canon. Reading fanfiction over the years I've come to learn/accept to not get affected by certain stories as much because they're not the characters I love. They're creations from authors I either completely disagree with or are the results of depraved minds. And it's really not worth getting worked up over.

We're allowed to enjoy this wonderful phenomenon of fanfiction, and to expres ourselves and create within this fictional world. There's some absolutely incredible works out there that I adore, but it also means there's a LOT of shit included as well.

I just cherish the many gems out there and ignore the rest.
