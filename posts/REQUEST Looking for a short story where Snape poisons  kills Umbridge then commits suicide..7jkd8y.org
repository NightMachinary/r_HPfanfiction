However it is Remus & Sirius using polyjuice that kill both of them. While Hermione arranges a cast iron alibi for both herself & Harry Potter. Later Pansy Parkinson uses the killing curse on Harry and then Hermione uses the crucio curse on Pansy's dark mark, somehow killing Voldemort/Riddle and all of his marked death eaters in some type of magical feedback loop. Harry then wakes up free of Riddle's soul piece. All is well, except Dumbledore has no clue how the prophecy became fulfilled

It's not nearly as bad as the summary makes it sound. Though I suppose that doesn't really say much.

With the current tumblrinas I will probably learn that every word is offensive that way, so that's absolutely useless advice.

#+end_quote

No, I actually have an idea, it's just you are simply wrong. It's about the word r****d (censored so you won't remove this post) - a word that once was used mentally handicapped people, but is now just another synonym to stupid. Just like idiot, moron, imbecile or cretin - all words that posts don't get removed for. It's just that this word is much more recent and thus easily triggered people actually know what it meant.

Either you should remove posts for all those words or for none. To do otherwise is a pure hypocrisy.
