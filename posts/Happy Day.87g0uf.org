It was the most terrified he had been in his entire life.

 

He'd faught off Slytherin's monster at the age of 12, that was nothing compared to this.

 

He had defeated about 100 Dementors at the age of 13, he was more terrified now than he was then.

 

At the age of 14 he had won the Triward Tournament, a competition that had claimed the lives of past competitors.

 

He'd escaped the most evil Dark Wizard of all time in numerous occasions then defeated him at the age of 17.

 

He glanced beside him and saw Ron, just across from Ron was Hermione. Knowing his two best friends were with him was a major comfort, but their presence couldn't stop his hands from shaking.

 

He was frozen with fear, couldn't speak, couldn't think properly, he knew what he had to do but doing it was a completely different thing.

 

He looked at Ron and Hermione once more, Ron had a look of concern about his face, Hermione's was nervous, expectant, waiting...of course they were waiting for him to take the lead.

 

He took a deep breath and concentrated, all the happiest moments of his life began rapidly flashing before his eyes, so many of them but nothing was helping, more flashes still no help, "why was this so hard?", he thought.

 

He concentrated hard, then it happened, the happiest memory of his life, the moment she said "Yes".

 

He mustered all his courage and looked at her, Ginny, his bride the most beautiful women in the world and said what he knew he must say, "I do".

 

"And do you Ginerva Molly Weasley take Harry James Potter to be your husband?".

 

"I do".

 

"Then by the power vested in me by the Ministry of Magic, I declare you bonded for life, you may kiss the bride".


** Four aspects you need to work on:

Conjugation/grammar

Spelling

Showing v telling

Characterisation

**** Spelling and grammar you're right I have spotted some errors that I simply overlooked, will get to them.

Can you please explain what you mean by Characterization and Showing v Telling more?

This scene isn't supposed to be incredibly detailed (I prefer leaving that to the readers imagination).

This and the "Sad Day" story I shared are my first headcanons I have ever written so yeah I'm sorta new to this.

***** Characterisation: There's a couple of moments where Harry doesn't quite feel like Harry. The most obvious one is the underlying tone of the piece. Harry's emotions were mostly fear/terror/nervousness. It's not that someone wouldn't feel terrified by their wedding- but that Harry has always desired a family, and therefore there should be (at least) a small part of joy. This can be done by carefully selecting your verbs and adjectives.

Showing v telling: a couple of moments felt very exposition-y. Especially the bit about his memories flashing before him, his hands and the bits with Ron & Hermione. This is because the reader is given Harry's interpretations and thoughts rather than his reactions- which would have been nice if your piece was more focused on thoughts. Rather, I feel you should have focused more on Harry's actions and reactions and let the reader guesstimate the thoughts and feelings.
