So, anyone who's read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][Island of Fire by Esama]], remember the bit about feeding newborn dragons lots of alcohol and how it has about the same effect as feeding alcohol to human babies?

Does anyone know any other stories where that thought is explored? Where Hermione goes "Uh, Hagrid, feeding brandy to a human child would probably damage their brain a lot. Are you sure your book is right?"\\
Or one where a dragon /isn't/ fed brandy and they grow up intelligent as a result?


** Im just curius about how wild dragons gets hold of brandy for their young...

*** Hmm...I'm fairly sure I read a short story, maybe 5 chapters or so, which had Harry bribing the dragon in the first task with lots of firewhiskey (or butterbeer, I don't remember) to give him the golden egg...

*** Welcome to tonight's episode of "Deconstructing Harry Potter".\\
On this episode, we're looking at 'what everyone knows' about magical creatures:

- House-elves; willing minions, or terrified of saying no?\\
- Centaurs; is it really by their own request that they're classified as Beasts?
- Dragons; what impact does alcohol /really/ have on hatchlings?
