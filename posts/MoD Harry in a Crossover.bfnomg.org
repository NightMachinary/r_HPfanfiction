  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

** You might want to use the "Request" flair as your requesting and not recommending. Why do no one even read the 7th rule? Is it me or is it ever more frequent recently?

Anyway as it seems Kathryn518 is back and may update her fics "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" (Star Wars) and Invincible (DC) linkffn(11157943; 11779002)

This one is partially in your request (the MoD part) as it's only partially and temporarily a thing, "A Third Path to The Future" (Marvel) linkffn(9443327)

I'd be hard pressed to call having no contact and waiting until the girl meets you the first time in her timeline before you go for the reunion grooming. He's not manipulating her into a relationship, nor is he trying to make her into someone who would go for someone like him. He's completely hands off where she's concerned.

Well, it's not exactly grooming but he does show up in the Witcher World about a CENTURY before she is born and is only there to marry her because "she's the one." That's really creepy. But it's probably not grooming, just gross.

****** I don't think it's creepy at all. He didn't even know he was going to arrive in the Witcher universe and he definitely didn't know how to decide when to arrive in the universe.

It's a fairly similar situation to Rory/Amelia Pond in Doctor Who. Rory waiting 2000 years wasn't creepy or gross. It was a sign of his devotion to the woman who saved him and the one he loves more than anything that comes their way over a few crappy centuries.

****** Well yeah he'll be old. Damn old but I think more like it was a renaissance to him. He was dead to the world without any goal until coming to this world (a theme with this author). He has known her when he was young he has (in my opinion) a relatively pure vision of her. Something that is caused by a moral attachment (even more so in a great time of need) and not a dirty physical one. For a Harry who would do pretty much anything for who he loves this doesn't seem to far-fetched to me. He has the memory of her he had when he was young and I think it would maybe, hopefully return him to a maybe nicer Harry, less desensitized to people. Or at least she would counter-balance him a bit. And he didn't talk about marriage. He didn't do it on purpose (partially but he was not trying to arrive at the time he arrived) but when he saw when and where he was, with the power he had, of course he planned to wait for her and ensure she would be. And when she left as he knew she would he prepared for her return to help her like he thinks she helped him in his darkest hour. It's more about returning/finding back a loved one but with a longer span of time. It it were elves in LotR it wouldn't seem so strange. Think also that if she hadn't been what he knew she was and if she hadn't gone to his world, he wouldn't be there either.

This brings me to the next point. With Harry Potter brand of time travel (like with the time turners. Yes it's not a time turner but this time travel feels like it) he already did that. Of course in the Witcher it was different and we could argue he was not needed but the way I see it he's only doing what was already, unknowingly, done (think of him saving Buckbeak and Sirius). So yeah he saved her grandmother because he couldn't do anything but that. For sentimental reasons as well as logical ones.

I wrote too damn much for this.

**** He doesn't groom her... he's not met her since yet. The only thing he's doing is trying to prepare the world for her return to help her. Sure it may look creepy but not as much as I've seen in many other fics.

That and maybe to Harry it will have been long time before their reunion but to Ciri it might well have been a few months if not only weeks.

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
