  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

** A Cruel & Beautiful World by Lena Phoria. I'm not sure if it's readily available online anymore, but if you can find it - it's amazing. Voldy won, Harry's in hiding but the DA/resistance are still active. Hermione was captured and enslaved, but escapes. Dramione.

Manacled by Sen Lin Yu Starts post-war, Voldy won. Hermione had been kept in sound & light deprived isolation as a prisoner, but is put into a ‘repopulation' program (inspired by Handmaids Tale) and given to Draco. Awesome story that has about 20 chapters of ‘flashbacks' in the middle, which are from during the war and explain what happens to each character, relationships, capture etc. Its a beautifully written piece. Flashbacks are my favourite part :)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  The Dark Lord wanted a consort and had decided to host a competition that involved nearly everyone in Britain. If they thought they were good enough, they could enter to compete in a certain amount of tasks set by the Lord of the lands himself. Only the victor would have the skills necessary to become Voldemort's consort. Harry unfortunately nabs the Dark Lord's attention. Voldemort does as he pleases.Hermione enters to win, Bellatrix takes interest in certain people, and of course there's the villain causing trouble.A/N: SLASH/Harrymort/AU. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how this sounds like Harry is a slave. Please do so. Nothing at all would suggest it. How about we don't assume that because the word "consort" is involved, it must *obviously* be about slavery. Does anyone actually know what a consort is?
