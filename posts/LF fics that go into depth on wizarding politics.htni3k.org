** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) does this somewhat well. Sort of falls victim to the twelve-year-old politicians trope but it's not as awful as some others.

linkffn(Blood and Water by LF74) is an ongoing fic that deals with politics brilliantly, and also has some of the most compact storytelling in the fandom.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?

** Maybe a bit more culture in general but there is some politics and it seems like there will be even more in the sequal. Extremely well written with lots of fun takes on the wizarding world based on historical things.

â€‹

This one is more of an /Grey purebloods are superior to everyone else and most bad guys are just missunderstood/ but it is still a decent read.
