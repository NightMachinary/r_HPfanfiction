Can I get your favorite time travel fics? I don't mean Peggysue fics (though I like a lot of those!) I mean, Harry, or Hermione or whoever goes to school with Snape, or Voldemort or Dumbledore or is their teacher, or maybe they were born in that period.

Birds of a Feather by Babylonsheep is my standout favorite of this type of timetravel fic. Open to all genres

Prof Binns notices no one is paying attention in class ans gets annoyed. He sends the class back in time so they can have a greater appreciation for history. Harry ends up in Marauders era.

Fred and George time travel to marauders era, though with incomplete information (Sirius is believed to be the traitor, Peter's the hero).

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]] Of a Linear Circle Creator: flamethrower Description: In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.

On 31st July 1995, Harry Potter disappears from Little Whinging a few minutes after midnight. The means of his departure are unfathomable, and the Order's only relief in their concern is the fact that Voldemort was not responsible.

The rest of Wizarding Britain is too busy tearing down their Wizarding Savior via the press to be much concerned, at least until certain Slytherin allies decide that enough is fucking well enough.

Notes: Unashamedly cribbed from Tumbler user @bookworm-2692:

"Here is a fic with a competent adult at Hogwarts! It's called Of A Linear Circle by @deadcatwithaflamethrower. The competent adult is Nizar Slytherin, Salazar's younger brother who was a portrait and climbed out of his portrait during the start of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts (so [Harry's] first to fourth years are canon in the fic). Nizar pops out and gets rid of Umbridge, which, honestly, if that was all he accomplished in the entire fic would still be enough to label him as a “competent adult” in my mind. He starts teaching Defence, and there's so much of him just competently teaching his students, which is a joy to read. There's a full on plot going on as well, and excellent worldbuilding (expanding and what magic is and how it works in marvellous ways), but when I was chatting to a friend about this fic, all I could talk about was how competent Nizar is and how glad I was that he was there being a competent adult. Everything is so well detailed and so well researched that it's a joy to read, but honestly, even if the larger plot was not occurring, I would still be happy reading about Nizar's teaching competence. It's just so good. Read the fic for so many reasons, but if you want a competent adult then here's your fic."
