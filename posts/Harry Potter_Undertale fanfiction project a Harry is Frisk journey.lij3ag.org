Okay so, context first

I saw a lot of super!harry, independant!harry, assholish-garystu!harry and practically no real crossover of fictions that I like, the ones existing just being childish, badly written depiction of the story that are more set on insulting the original work than create a story with it ( seriously why there are not crossover with re zero, with subaru as main character ! that's killing me ! I know it would be kinda hard to writte but come on ! and practically no harry is shirou too argh ! )

but paradoxically I have also seen a lot of good ideas for plots that never started, wich leave me eager to try to spark somes idead to life

so now, even thought I kind of suck at writting in english, I test the water to see if anyone is interested in this kind of story or if this is a bad idea that I even start a potentially 100k or more story for 0 or 2 peoples

and so what I have in store for thoses interested are this plot bunny

when the dursleys try to outrun the letters from hogwart they don't go on a phare but in a secluded town near Mont Ebott, here a more physically and mentally damaged harry, who is more called freak than anything else ( no billy calm down, it's not one of thoses story, it get relevant later ), hear about how peoples, especially childs, that climb Mont Ebott never come back

and so harry try and fall into the underground

he learn about what he know, cruelty and destroying others by flowey, and what he don't know, kindness and mercy by toriel and decides through his journey to make his trauma into a strength and goes from being called freak ( the unnatural ) to being called frisk ( the one that search )

​

from here i am in a bit of a crossroad, either harry/frisk succesfully save asriel by cutting his soul in half making an interesting comparison in contrast with voldemort wich would deepen their nemesis relationship, playing on the themes of love and sacrifice that caracterize the canon harry too and being more centered on canon themes

or

having asriel staying flowey when the fanfiction begin and go with harry in hogwart, the benefits would be to add more meaningfull drama and conflict, more undertale lore involved ( with genocide timeline explored ) and having a sassy flowey trash talking snape, dumbledore, the students, harry/frisk friends, everyone, except harry/frisk because of bittersweet redemption arc with theses two

​

including the political aspect of the delta angel prophecy would be really fun to writte too, I have goods ideas on this one, including the one that the prophecy was made by Merlin or Flamel wich if coupled with the whole " boy who lived " celebrity of Harry/Frisk will be quit interesting when wizards have their first interactions with said ambassador of monsterkind

​

what this story would not be about : independant manipulated godlike sue harry, bashing of ( insert character here ) infantilization and extreme simplification of characters like frisk/asriel/chara/voldemort/sans ( frisk and asriel would not be just innocent and naive, chara would not be the antichrist, voldemort would be taken seriously and sans would not be either a walking meme or a megalovania/angst trigger, that would be too lazy to writte and bore me before I even finish the first chapter ) and if you plan to writte a story like this don't do these things please, they just destroy the story they are in

if you are wondering what kind of frisk and tone I would try to writte, here are my primary inspirations :

【手描き】♡UT SlDER 【Undertale/NGP】

Undertale the Musicale

Harry Potter Farewell

Strength Of Will (JedoTime Cover)

UNDERTALE ANNIVERSARY - ANIMATED

here what I have to offer in terms of fanfiction to start, I don't know if this is the kind of story anyone would like so let me know in the comments


** Guess I'm the only undertale trash here, but I really like the idea and would read. I prefer crossovers where the characters stay the characters they are, but frisk is such a blank slate anyway...
