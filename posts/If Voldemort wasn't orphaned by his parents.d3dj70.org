Is there a story where Tom Marvolo Riddle wasn't raised at an orphanage but by his biological parents?

The story of Voldemort's parents is tragic and fascinating in showing how his heritage lead to his destiny of becoming the Dark Lord. Being conceived under a love potion and not true love Voldemort was born unable to understand or feel love as well as other emotions such as kindness and compassion.

In the original story Tom Riddle Senior left his pregnant wife Merope when she stopped giving him the love potion hoping that he would fall in love for real. This did not happen and she died shortly after giving birth to Voldemort.

But what if Tom Senior actually accepted Merope's feelings and raised his son Tom junior wit his wife. What would have been different?


** I've seen several fics in which Merope survived to raise her son, or Tom Riddle Sr. took his son in after discovering his existence. However, I've never read one in which both of his parents were a happy family together.

I can link some of those if you like.

*** Unless you totally AU the premise, there isn't a way they could be a happy family together, sadly.

**** I suppose Merope could just keep him on love potion forever. It'd at least seem happy.

** You want a story with the message of an abuse victim giving in to their abuser's manipulations and coercion and just staying with them anyway? Jesus. Tom would turn out /worse,/ having to actually grow up watching his father being abused by his mother all the time. He might even grow up to hate/fear witches in particular, broadly women in general.

If you want an awesomely dark story, write that. Show it as sick and unhealthy, with Merope coercing and raping Tom's dad all the time, using her magic to make him obey her all the time. And Tom would be having to deal with that by the time he gets into Hogwarts.

Maybe Dumbledore or someone steps in to help once they notice Tom's getting affected by it all, but probably not, since it was 50 years ago from today. Bad times.

It'd be real nice to make some stories that shed some light on female on male domestic abuse situations though. We need more awareness of that in the world. It'd even work out okay in the magical world, since there isn't any gender stereotyping/roles going on there like the muggle world has. They're gender equal. Nice way to show victims being treated the same - and perpetrators. To show the situation being treated /just as seriously/ by magical law enforcement, and by other people too. And, for readers who wouldn't really see it the same way unless it was classic husband-on-wife stuff, they might get their eyes opened too.

*** The thing is, it wouldn't be obvious abuse. If Merope keeps Tom Sr hopped up AND she doesn't act like the rest of her family, it would create a dynamic where it's her fantasy fulfillment of a happy gentle family with Tom Sr being puppetted to be loving.
