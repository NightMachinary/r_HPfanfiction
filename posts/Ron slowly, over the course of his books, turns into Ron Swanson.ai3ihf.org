Bonus points if Hermione becomes like Leslie, Neville is like Andy, Daphne is like April, Ginny is like Tom, Harry is like Ben, Luna is like Ann, and Dean is like Chris.

If you want all the internet cookies, make it so the characters of Parks and Rec are children attending Hogwarts as well.

** I think Harry Potter is Leslie no? Always does the right thing by his/her friends even at the expense of himself? And Ben is Ginny? Initially they can't be together but Harry gets jealous and they fall in love over time?

** To fit their personalities better but ignore the pairings I think:

Harry is Mark Brendanawicz. The bland audience insert.\\
Hermione is Leslie\\
Ron is Ron\\
Ginny is Donna\\
Neville is Garry/Larry/Jerry\\
Luna is April\\
The twins are Tom\\
Dobby is Andy

Dumbledore is Chris\\
Snape is Ben\\
Mcgonagall is Ann

Ginny and Mcgonagall's roles could swap though.
