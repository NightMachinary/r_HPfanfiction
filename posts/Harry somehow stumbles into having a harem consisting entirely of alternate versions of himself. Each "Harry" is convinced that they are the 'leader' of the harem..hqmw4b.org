Notes: all the Harrys are adults.

"Harry" is in quotes because not all fem!Harrys would be named Harry.

** Every-time Harry has an idea they think would get pushback from the group, everyone ends up super into it, confirming the idea that they are leading the Harem. Of course, when other Harry's suggest something they are just being good minions who have pretty good ideas, and deserve all praise they get.

And why not? Harry can call herself anything she wants to. #Feminism

Because if you look over the vast majority of fem!Harry fics, most of the Harrys aren't named Harry.
