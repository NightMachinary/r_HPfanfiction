Ron successfully pretends to be sick an convinces the whole school he is on death's door. In the meantime, he grabs Harry and Hermione and they have a day of adventure and fun in London. Bonus points if Ron gets on a parade float and sings “Twist and Shout”.


** As much as I love Ron as a character, he's definitely Cameron in this scenario: a regular guy with an insanely popular friend, a strong desire to be special, and in love with the girl of their friend group. He even takes his dad's car without permission in canon!

Or, if you want to go really dark, you embrace the fan theory that Cameron imagined the entire movie and Ferris is just who Cameron wishes he was and tell canon from Ron's point of view, only for it to end with Ron sick in bed at the Burrow, imagining he's friends with the Boy Who Lived and the girl he has a crush on
