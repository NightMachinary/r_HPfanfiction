My favorite romance in HPFF so far is Lady Thief by Starfox5. I can't really figure out why. I just like it a lot. I /think/ Hermione's jealousy of Harry before they get together is just very endearing to me. Are there any other stories like that?

I guess other pairings with this dynamic are ok too.


** What sort of jealousy are you looking for? What sort of dynamic? Are they still friends? What sort of Harry are you looking for, canon, super, or in-between?

Hermione in the books isn't the social paragon that she is in the movies (Emma Watson was perfecf for the roles when she was a kid, definitely had the attitude down, but the writers removed any flaws from the character and she turned into a bombshell.) She displayed jealousy of Lavender, she displayed jealousy of Harry for potions. She was jealous of Fleur for captivating Ron.

Do you want ongoing jealousy or resolved jealousy? I personally like Hermione having real character growth, but dislike a Harry that tells her that preaches about how she is wrong. Sinyk comes to mind.
