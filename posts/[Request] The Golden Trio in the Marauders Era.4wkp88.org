** I don't think i have ever read any with all three of the Trio, but if you filter Marauders Era with Harry and Hermione, you'll come across some really good ones.

**** Blame the movies for that, where Hermione gets all the things that made Ron a lovable character.

** I believe it's called (linkffn)Harry Potter and The Amulet of Time. They go back in time to the founders era, World War 1, and the Marauders time before coming home. Ginny is with them, too. It's a long one, but very well written.
