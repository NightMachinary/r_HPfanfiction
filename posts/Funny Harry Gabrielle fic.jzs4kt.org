I don't know if something like this is even out there?

I really want a fic w/ HarryxGabrielle. Not a threesome, however if it has a love triangle between Fleur, Gabrielle and Harry, then that is welcomed and appreciated. Basically, Gabrielle has this huge crush on Harry after he saves her, and she is trying to get him to fall in love with her. Poor Harry doesn't know what's going on....

In the meantime, Fleur decides she loves Harry too, and realizes what her sister is trying to do. So on, so forth. Doesn't have to be exactly like this, just something similar. If it's funny/parody, that would be great!


** linkffn(Taking Hostages by The-Caitiff).

I remember reading another story, in which Gabrielle changes herself into a bird (a falcon, I believe), and has herself mailed to Harry, but I can't find the name of it right now.

I don't believe Fleur goes for Harry in either of those.

There is another story I've read in which Gabrielle is going after Harry, but Fleur doesn't until she gets too irked by Gabrielle saying Fleur is "too old" and "not enough woman" for her Harry. I don't remember the name of that one, either.

**** Thank you for reminding me of that. It turns out the other one is also one of Rorschach's Odd Ideas chapters.

  Not your usual veela bonding story. When young veela enter puberty, their instincts guide them to the perfect man. It's either love or death for these beings of lust and flame, and Gabrielle Delacour has her mind set on love. HPGD
