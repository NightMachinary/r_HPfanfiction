For me its lily evans x original character because it's never happened before and would add an interesting twist to canon( I mean can you imagine both snape and james hating harry because his father is some random oc that swoops in and takes the girl of their dreams?)


** Albus Dumbledore/Florean Fortescue - in addition to their shared interests in making treats, it'd be nice for Albus to move on from his issues with Gellert.

*** Agree with this. My suspicion at this showing in the fandom is partly due to the portrayal of the characters even more poorly in the movies than in the books (where they are already cast in a negative light).

If anything I actually have a soft spot for them, as their flaws and issues as characters are more realistic than those of many of the main cast (ex. Harry only caring about rules and laws when its convenient, Hermione caring about rules and laws because of where or who they come from, Snape being bitter about James and Lily for two decades and never moving on, etc.). By contrast, Cho is caught up between divided loyalties (in more than one way) and Lavender is a girly-girl who hasn't yet been knocked from the invincibility pedestal that most teenagers think themselves on.

Ron atoning for his treatment of Lavender* sounds like a fertile ground for developing his character and exploring the sexism of "not like other girls" syndrome.

*I think 1-5 Ron wouldn't be that big of a douche and this is yet another example of HBP making every character a far worse person than they had been.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

*** Canon?

The Diary could have merged with the original Ginny after all. She (he?) has the memories and powers of both, and this secret might be the reason why canon Ginny suddenly becomes so awesome. Of course, it takes some time for her to recover and redevelop her (his?) skills.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

Tom comes back from the Diary but he's eleven years old and a girl with a heavy love potion making Harry list after Tom who goes by Marvy. It becomes like James and Lily with Harry asking Marvy on a date every other week and trying to impress her. Marvy kills Voldemort as revenge for making her this way and she has changed enough because of how she came to be that Voldemort really dies.

** More well written Sirius-centric romances with girls and/or boys that aren't SI-OCs, or Remus. No hate for Wolfstar, but I love the idea of Sirius Black as a Romance Hero (yes caps), and very often Wolfstar doesn't do enough to capture the sheer romantic potential of Sirius' character individually.

Like, even if it's Wolfstar, I'd just like a romance where they're learning each other anew as they fall in love rather than just wallowing in their familiarity as they fall into each others arms dick first.

** Severus Snape/Luna Lovegood, Severus Snape/Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter/Lavender Brown, Ron Weasley/Viktor Krum, Ron Weasley/OMC, Ron Weasley/OFC, Umbridge/whatever can stand her, Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Ron Weasley, Severus Snape/Petunia Evans

I really want to read a story where Lavender or one of the girls is a bodybuilder. Nataliya Kutnetsova is my hero. Sorry that's random.

*** I actually think Severus will be more lenient with say, Harry Longbottom, because his main animosity was towards James and Sirius. If she married someone neutral, he would rue, but ultimately be more accepting and learn to think of Harry as a neutral likeable person...especially if Harry ended up in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.

James I'm not sure. I think he's probably same as Severus. Rue that its not himself but ultimately thunk of Harry as being his own person.

**** It's hard to say about Snape - with this prompt, is Harry still the Boy Who Lived? If so, Snape's behavior wouldn't be very changed - Lily would still be dead, Snape would still on some level blame Harry, and Snape would still have to publicly hate on Harry to preserve his cover as a double agent

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** Hermione/Umbridge or Hermione/Trelawney or Hermione/Marietta Edgecomb. If people can ship Hermione with McGonagall I can ship her with them. Granted, it's because I'm a big fan of Hermione's more vicious and sociopathic moments, and I kinda want to see how that would factor into a ship.
