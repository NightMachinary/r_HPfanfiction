** Reach the top shelves.

Jkjk. The only canon indication we have that he does anything special is when Dumbledore mentions having Filch restore the Fat Lady portrait after Sirius broke into the Gryffindor rooms. It was said that the portrait was "expertly restored".

We can tentatively make a jump and say that Filch is there to maintain the ridiculous number of magical portraits in the castle. Presumably he uses tools that are magical in and of themselves: paints/potions/glue/etc. It's possible that this is something that he's actually very skilled at.

Also, keep in mind that house elves aren't quite all there, it seems. They're a bit strange. Having a human who's job it is to keep an eye on things might be beneficial.

I've seen someone mention a head-canon that I liked; Filch is a serious art aficionado. An ancient castle filled with thousands of ancient magical portraits, likely done by a number of talented artists, is exactly where he wants to be. The whole school for children thing is just a sacrifice that he's willing to make. I think it fits neatly in with his mean grouchiness - all these rambunctious magical kids causing trouble, with no respect for the priceless art all around them.

*** I can second this for the fact that he uses words like "befouling" to describe tracking mud. Granted, this was to stretch the reasoning for him giving Harry detention in CoS, but either way, the man has to have /some/ appreciation and respect for Hogwarts as a whole.

** Interact with students. Filch is in charge of student discipline; good luck giving that job to House Elves. Detention would become a tea party with 10 varieties of cake.

*** You joke but that, to a House Elf /would/ be punishment. If a teacher told the Elves that a student needed to spend 2 hours cleaning the trophy room and to supervise them the House Elves would probably assume it's a reward instead of a punishment, so if the teacher didn't think things through and asked the elves to punish the students during detention they probably would host a tea party and just ask them to sit there and do nothing.

In my headcanon House Elf matrons punish the adolescents for misbehaving by forcing them to sit still and do nothing instead of cleaning or cooking.

*** Tea party... Or totally horrifying. Just observing how Kreacher acts, or what Dobby considers "protection" and how he punishes himself, I honestly don't want to know what they would do should an angry professor ever tell them ti punish a student.
