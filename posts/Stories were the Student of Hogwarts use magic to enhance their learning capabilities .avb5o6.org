In canon we don't really see much of this in canon apart from the Weasley twins self correcting quill or the fanon dictation quill that take notes for you , but there are probably a lot of other ways that students could enhance their learning, like spell to record teachers lectures or out right just using a spell to make it so you Remember it perfectly.

Like learning to Animate the Quill to write essays even if writing them would be more efficient in the short term, or out right just ditch the Quill and Animate the Ink to write itself. or just conjuring the essay based their current knowledge even if its only good for a first draft.

I have already read Harry the Hufflepuff By BajaB

** In linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow), all Ancient Runes students are on Wit-Sharpening Potion to help them learn multiple ancient languages in a relatively short time. (This comes up when Harry is selected for TWT held at Durmstrang and given some to learn whatever language is spoken there quickly---and it turns out that Hermione is already on it.)

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
