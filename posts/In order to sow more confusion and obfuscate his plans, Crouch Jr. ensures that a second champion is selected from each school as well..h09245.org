** When Harry was half-way through the way to the backdoor, the Goblet started spluttering again, to the surprise of everyone, immediately murmurs started again, until another scrap of paper came out, caught by the trembling hand of Albus Dumbledore, who looked at it for long five seconds, before announcing.

"Natalia Ivanova"

There was a gasp and a redheaded girl rose from the Slytherin table, looking around, before catching the eyes of her Headmaster, who merely nodded, she went to join Harry, but didn't look at him. They seemed to be the same age.

The Goblet started sputtering /again/, and the whispering followed it, only those at the table heard Madam Maxine curse under her breath, another paper came out and Dumbledore picked it and read the name much faster than the last time.

"Aurelie Dubois"

Another gasp as the Beauxbatons students turned as one to a beautiful strawberry blonde girl who looked shocked, she quickly schooled her features after a nod from her Headmistress and went to join the duo next to the head table, merely exchanging a brusque nod with both.

On an unspoken agreement the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth champions went towards the door, somber expressions on their face.

Almost the entirety of the Great Hall started whispering and muttering excitedly, while Albus Dumbledore was staring hard at the Goblet of Fire, and the remains of the age line ward he himself had cast using the /Elder Wand/, and so couldn't have been breached, `perhaps only another Hallow could've done it' but as far as he knew Harry didn't know those girls and the boy would never have entered himself.

He turned towards the head table but no one caught the one uncommon expression to leave his lips.

"Fuck"

Only him and another noticed these girls had greenish eyes and red hair(or the closest thing to), not unlike the Fourth Champion's mother, a third already knew it and was internally laughing at the irony. Barty Jr. had always hated Lily Potter and her `undeserved` talent in magic.

**** I know that one, but could never read too far into it. Is it the names? Because I pulled those from thin air, probably offending some conventions or something.
