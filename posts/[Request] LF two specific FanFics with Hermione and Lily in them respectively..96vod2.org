Hey there! First, I apologize if the title somewhat confused you. Now, I am looking for two specific FanFics that feature Hermione and Lily respectively and separately (not both in two fics but one of Hermione in it and one with Lily in it)

The first Fanfic is one where Harry befriend a muggle girl (I think it was a new neighbour) and slowly begin to share details about his life including his thoughts on Hermione. However, the girl isn't a muggle and is actually a popyjuiced Hermione with Dumbledore's consent (it was also his idea) and the help of her mother. I think the faux identity of Hermione was perhaps named Michelle Granger and is supposedly Hermione's sister. (I am unsure so don't take me on that).

The second Fanfic is an odd one. Basically it's a fic where Harry was kidnapped by Voldemort by portkey where the Dark Lord has revived Lily Potter (which somehow benfited him) and he tells Harry that he needs to have sex with Lily or he'll fire nuclear weapons on Muggle cities. I remember that it was relatively short and abandoned as well. However, there is a possibility that Harry was a necromancer in this story and was forced to revive Lily by Voldemort. I also remember that in the story when Harry and Lily went to Hogwarts the ghosts there became frantic/excited by the presence of a Necromancer in the castle which shocked everyone before being more shocked when Peeves reveals it to be Harry.

Anyway... If anyone knows what those FanFics are and where I can read them I'll be glad if you'll link them here.
