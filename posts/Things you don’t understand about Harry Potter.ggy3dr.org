I personally don't understand why the house system exists and why the common rooms are password protected.


** It exists in real boarding schools as well. You have to divide them into dorms somehow and as soon as you do that, some type of rivalry forms. I studies abroad at an American college that had several dorms and over the decades, each had developed traditions and a reputation. There'd also always be friendly competition between them and a dance battle in the first week back on campus.

With the racism and the war going on, it was probably a good idea to have the dorms protected in some way.

** It's not quite that I don't understand it, but I have a really hard time picturing robes in my head. Like how they would be cut, what fabric they would be, how the sleeves look like, how long the are, how different styles might look, how robes differ in age groups.

So if anyone has any ideas about that feel free to share.

*** Book robes (as opposed to the ones in the movie) appear to resemble a thawb/thobe or a cassock. They should be floor or almost floor length, people can wear only underwear underneath them but you can put one on over other clothes.

My guess would be that your bog-standard Hogwarts robe is made of a heavy linen or possibly a heavy cotton. Something that is warm enough for winter but is at least mildly breathable for summer. Those who are better off would have several different sets of robes made - woolen ones for winter, lighter cotton or silk for summer, etc etc. Dress robes...well anything goes although I would guess that the wizarding world does not have polyester or other synthetic fibres.

I'm also going to guess that the sleeves are moderately close fitting. Having gaping sleeves in Scotland, in winter seems like a recipe for cold winds up your arms but the sleeves do ride up, get pulled back etc etc so they can't be that tight.

As for seaming, I have three options; there is magic which means that seams simply aren't a thing in the wizarding world (ie, the fabric just magically weaves itself together in exactly the way you want it); robes are cut loosely enough that only side seams joining the back and front parts are required; or princess seams for a better fit. Quite possibly all three can co-exist (seams are for poor people because the fabric-weaving magic thing is expensive, Hogwarts robes are cut very loosely to allow for growth, fancy dress robes have princess seams).

Different styles/dress robes. Male dress robes as we see them during the book seem to be very like Hogwarts robes but in brighter colours. They might have more flowing sleeves, a better cut, heavy embroidery, patterns etc etc. We know at one point lace ruffs were the fashion. Female dress robes are basically just dresses, or so it seems. Perhaps more old-fashioned women's dress robes resemble more Edwardian style dresses.

If you need visual inspiration. [[https://i.gyazo.com/1e3199cf36ef1d624bb2fb5a37bb5d56.png][This]] is something I doodled up as Ye Olde Bog-Standard Hogwarts Robe. [[https://i.gyazo.com/9f64ad91536a42eb84dae10114e74c47.jpg][This]] is something I nicked off a website which is also quite close to how I visualise them.

Astronomy is important to potions and herbology where the /Care/ of Magical Creatures isn't. I believe it also plays a part in alchemy.

***** We're not told outright why it's important, but there's an ingredient in Polyjuice potion that needs to be picked at the full moon and Veritaserum needs to sit for a lunar phase. JKR adds on to this with the Animagus potion requiring the use of the moon.

** how is arithmancy Hermione's favorite subject, when it looks like it's a form of divination? why isn't it just a part of divination but instead it's a subject by itself.

why isn't alchemy a class in Hogwarts?

same for healing. during a war, that would be a pretty important class.

Hermione's problem with divination wasn't about predicting the future, it was how much guessing it involves, I think we can assume that arithmancy is more reliable.

Rowling mentioned that it is offered as a N.E.W.T class when sufficient demand exist.

Because healing isn't a single branch of magic, its a combination of most of them. Like it's not only some charms, but also about stuff like counter charms and counter cures, potions also play an important role and we know even transfiguration is required to be a healer.

Overall it just seems to be something which cant be reliably taught without a sufficient foundation, and most students should at least be able to heal basic stuff to potions they can brew, otherwise they always have access to St Mungo's and can easily get their through apparition and floo powder.

** Actually the one that bugged me was that a discussion about possible careers happens in 5th year (two years after you starting taking electives). I could see the conversation going like this.

McG- so Harry have you thought about what you would like to do when you graduate?

Harry- Well I met Bill Weasley and I think being a cursebreaker would be interesting.

McG- Well you should have started taking Ancient Runes in 3 year as you can't be a cursebreaker without them. So that career isn't possible.

Harry- I didn't know that. Why didn't anyone say something back when we were first picking electives?

McG- It's not our job to tell people what electives to take.

Harry- how are students supposed to intelligently select electives in 3rd year if no one tells us what career requires which electives?

McG- oh......

** I don't understand why most Hogwarts students don't really seem to care and treat learning magic the same as normal students treat useless compulsory high school classes.\\
I'd think people either 1 get obsessed learn what they can and research to push the boundaries 2 just look for cool/ fun stuff like the marauders and twins or 3 learn lifehacks to use magic to make being a lazy gluttonous sloth a sustainable lifestyle.

*** When you grow up with magic/get exposed to it for a long time, it no longer seems magical. Yes there's amazing potential in magic but just because there is doesn't mean that people will be really fascinated by it. Magic for them is normal and school will always be boring for kids no matter how interesting the subject. Normal high school students could theoretically be super interested in technology/science and try to find to cure for cancer or develop supercomputer AI, but they usually don't. Obviously there are limitations and that's why they don't, but even if you could potentially do stuff like that as a high schooler most students wouldn't be bothered.

**** Partially true, but when out science teacher let us play with stuff that blew up we got excited.

At the very least I'd expect there to be more messing around with dangerous/ illegal stuff, recreational potions and magical ways to cheat xD And for muggleborns I'd definitely expect a high percentage of crazy scientists/ aspiring dread lords/ dangerously curious kids.
