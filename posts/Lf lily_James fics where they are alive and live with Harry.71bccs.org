As the title states. Would prefer it to be fluff - like them living in a family together (since Voldemort's attempt to murder them or halfway for whatever reason)

I rlly enjoyed Blank slate by tresmaraudeur but it's a pity he/she did not complete the story.

Ps: Looking for completed stories it rlly irks me to read until a point but stop suddenly because the story isn't completed.

Thanks guys!!

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

*** When I saw the title of this post, I was going to suggest this very same fanfiction. I loved how a small change can have a great effect and give Harry a very enjoyable life.

**** James and Lily raising Harry by themselves are actually very rare. They often survive in those WBWL fics and are mercilessly bashed, which I really hate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717;10871795), are both Hermione time travels in which they were saved. There are glimpses into their family lives, but not much.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is 680k words long and still in progress, but the author already has the final story arc mapped out and will post it after editing. This is a very different HP fic from most others though.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
