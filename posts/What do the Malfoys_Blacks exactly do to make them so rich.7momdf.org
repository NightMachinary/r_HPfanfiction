** Basically, whatever fills your plothole. If you need the Blacks to have made their money as mercenary necromancers, you can. Or maybe they partnered with the potters to make sleakeazy's hair potion, or patented sorrowful solution or whatever.

Most commonly though, they're just rich, and once you're rich, people will pay you to borrow your money.

** All of the above. They are the magical equivalent of noble families in countries with monarchies. They've had money for centuries and no one can really remember how they made it---usually property, but the easiest measure is the size of their vault at Gringott's. But as others have said, whatever works for you and your story. That's the best part of fic.

** Adding on to everyone else, yes, it is fanfiction so you can basically figure whatever you want in the realm of credibility and you're good, but on Pottermore, there is a good history up about the Malfoys. They were basically tied into the monarchy (muggle monarchy) up until the Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. They collected many artifacts, art (paintings, statues, etc), and they were able to get high positions (Lucius is a governor for Hogwarts). You can also assume that these families own a boat load of real estate because of how old and big these families are (think the Black family tree, I imagine not all of them were cooped up in 12 Grimmauld Place). They could have also a lot of money invested.

  Is there anything about inheritance as such in the wizarding world?
#+end_quote

The first thing that came to my mind when you said inheritance is Harry's inheritance of the Potter vaults in Gringotts, and his inheritance of the Invisibility Cloak. So yes, we know that familial items/possessions do get passed on to their children.

We can assume that the house was meant to be inherited by Regulus (after Sirius was disowned), but his young & sudden death caused the house to end up basically null (since the only other Blacks that were left were Narcissa and Bellatrix-- who were both married by that time, I assume). You can go into it and logically come to the conclusion that either Bellatrix Lestrange or Narcissa Malfoy were the rightful heirs to 12 Grimmauld Place (and even anything owned by the Blacks, really).

#+begin_quote
  so instead the place was her husband's (Cygnus? Black's) ancestral home.
#+end_quote

I think it's the original Black ancestral home, but then they spread out once their family got too big (I'm pretty sure their family goes back to Medieval Times).

It makes sense that it's Orion who holds the deed (I believe). Not Walbruga because she has a brother, unless inheritance in the wizarding world isn't sexist and goes to the eldest despite whether they're witch or wizard, which wouldn't make sense since this runs the risk of the house falling n the hands of a non-Black. Maybe an exception was made for Walburga because she did keep the Black last name. (Cygnus is brother, btw).

UNLESS Walburga, Cygnus, Alphard, Orion and whoever Orion's sister is grew up in the same home (but then we have to take into account parents and grandparents and this theory kind of becomes close to impossible, so it's not really believable that all five of them + parents lived in the same home).

#+begin_quote
  isn't it too "quaint" to be their main home?
#+end_quote

It's creepy and dark, there's nothing warm or comforting about this home. I think also the fact that we see/read about it years after anyone has lived in it, basically leaving it to rot away, doesn't help either. It might have been a beautiful, noble home once upon a time, but remember, the Gaunts ended up driving themselves to insanity, what's to say that Walburga didn't let them all live in a dusty, rotting home because she couldn't think rationally?

Again, all of these are theories based off of what I know/what we have in the stories and the movies. It's really all left to the imagination, which is the wonderful thing about the Potterverse.

  But much importance is given to this townhouse but for someone their stature, isn't it too "quaint" to be their main home?
#+end_quote

Not really. A lot of old money English families sold off their ancestral country seats at various points (a lot during the world wars), and kept the London townhouses - a lot of the Chelsea and Kensington set for example are inherited wealth with the townhouse as the main home.

London properties are worth far more than something half the size in the countryside, so the townhouse, despite it's size, is a much bigger status symbol.

Assuming the wizarding world has even vaguely similar social rules, then the London townhouse with enough room for half the Order to be living in was /some/ inheritance.

** The canon wizard economy doesn't actually make any sense (as has been extensively discussed on this subreddit and elsewhere). So SeekerOfTruth's answer is probably the best one: the Malfoy money comes from Rowling's need for a rich snooty antagonist. So what ideas can we suggest to play with to fill those plotholes?

Well, one option is Rowling's own explanation on [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family][Pottermore]]. She implies without explicitly saying it that the Malfoy fortune is built on land and treasure extorted from muggles:

#+begin_quote
  ...the Malfoys have never been above ingratiating themselves with the non-magical community when it suits them. The result is that they are one of the richest wizarding families in Britain, and it has been rumoured for many years (though never proven) that over the centuries the family has dabbled successfully in Muggle currency and assets. Over hundreds of years, they have managed to add to their lands in Wiltshire by annexing those of neighbouring Muggles, and the favour they curried with royalty added Muggle treasures and works of art to an ever-expanding collection.
#+end_quote

A second option is to assume that the Malfoy fortune is built on some element of the magical economy. Pottermore says the Potter family fortune is built on a successful potion business. Ignatia Wildsmith got rich from inventing floo powder. So what other magical economic sectors might be tapped to fund the Malfoys? They're landed gentry, maybe they farm magical plants or creatures? Maybe they grow wood used for broomsticks? Pick a magical commodity and run with it.

A third option is the one mentioned by several other users; the Malfoy's are rich due to their success in finance; they loan out money or otherwise invest and profit from the return on these loans and investments, much like mundane rich people. This works fine, but is slightly more boring in my opinion.

Another option is to follow the lead of fanfic authors like AJ Hall or Vera Rozalsky and assume that the Malfoy fortune is a lie; a mirage based in overextended credit and financial chicanery. From chapter 49 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/49/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][this fic]]:

#+begin_quote
  the Malfoy school of accountancy is a branch of the dark arts... the bulk of the so-called Malfoy fortune is a mass of promissory notes cantilevered out over the void, and it has been so for generations.
#+end_quote

(That story implies that this malfeasance is so extensive that revealing it may trigger a debt crisis that tanks the entire British magical economy.)

Hope this gives some ideas. Cheers!

#+end_quote

Holy shit... This implies that the Malfoys are essentially landed gentry going back centuries in the muggle world, especially during the days where assembling large estates became a popular pastime amongst the upper echelons of British society during the Georgian Era.

Currency and Asset market involvement means that there are a lot of opportunities for the Malfoys to have left their mark on the British Economy and currying favor with the royal families isn't an easy thing to do, especially when living in Wiltshire...

This is an extremely interesting and incongruous statement Rowling's made here for several reasons;

A, the Malfoys would leave one hell of a trace behind if they're dabbling in the higher echelons of British society for hundreds of years by virtue of expense or connections alone. Malfoy's a name that would have come up quite a lot in establishment circles as a result of their activities, which means that there are likely quite a number of documents written to or by historical figures that would have at least made mention of them somewhere.

B, the stance the Malfoys take vis-a-vis pureblood supremacy makes zero sense as a result. The muggle world made them richer than even the most influential and affluential of their peers ever could hope to be, after all. They would have learned to recognise and exploit prejudice towards others as a means of furthering their own position in the muggle world, so having the same strategies turned against them should not have worked... at all.

C, an extension to B really, is that their deep and abiding involvement with Voldemort makes no sense either. If he wins, they likely lose their position because any and all interaction with the muggle world is subjected to heavy scrutiny. I think Voldemort would not be forgiving to his own high command breaking ranks to consort with the muggles for whatever reason. Which means that the Malfoys no longer have access to their muggle holdings and assets until the immortal Dark Lord... dies. Yep.

D, this provides both an explanation for and against the Malfoys walking away scot free. Because they're landed gentry on the muggle side, up and imprisoning them for life would likely send alarm bells blaring in the muggle world. An entire family of kinda-if-you-squint quasi-nobles does not go missing without concern being expressed. But, if the Prime Minister is briefed by the Ministry of Magic on what happened, I don't see the Malfoys actually keeping their assets for very long. The British Government takes a very dim view of rich ponces sponsoring terrorist movements on British soil after all. It's likely that if the Ministry let them walk but told the PM what happened that the first foray the Malfoys undertake in the muggle world is likely to last the rest of their natural lives-which would be quite short indeed if they resist arrest.

E, it raises the question of exactly what their magical interests actually look like on the inside. It tickles me pink to imagine walking into Malfoy Inc. down a corner of Diagon Alley only to find myself in the middle of a richly appointed lobby of an upscale investment bank.

**** Eh, the pureblood supremacy stuff is perfectly consistent to me. Just because the Malfoys might have gotten rich from dealing with Muggles doesn't mean they would view them favorably. Voldemort seems to view muggles as something akin to cattle; beasts to be controlled once he takes power in Britain. I can see Lucius' long term plan being that he will do well for himself as Voldemort's majordomo managing the subjugated muggles.

**** Seeing business opportunities in the muggle world is not the same as respecting the muggles. Trading becomes much more easy when you use the confundus charm. In addition, there are many opportunities to subtly influence the muggle world.

For example, Lucius invests a few million pounds in a business. Then the dark lord orders Lucius to attack a muggle village. Lucius sees an opportunity and attacks a competitor to the person he invested in. Not only does he get a favor of the dark lord but he also presents an opportunity to one of his businesses.

The dark lord might even "know" this but doesn't care if Lucius donates sufficient money. All in all, both Voldemort and the Malfoy's become richer in this way.

*** Alright, let's just clear up something about how banks work. (I'm not aiming this at you so much as all the others who might take your statement at face value)

Gold, in and of itself, does not grow. When someone stores money in a bank (more specifically a savings and loan institution), the money is taken from the person and they're given a paper representation of that money- a ledger that basically says 'we will give you the value of what you have listed, if we have enough to cover it when you ask for it'. The bank then uses the actual money to buy things that will accumulate value (commodities), or lend it out to others who pay interest on their loan.

If all the coins are in a vault, they're worth nothing to the bank, because they can't leverage the value to their own uses.

The interest charged for a loan will always be significantly higher than the interest given to a savings of the same amount. Otherwise the bank loses money.

******** Fair enough but without knowing just how much the fortune was, we don't know if fees were being taken from it, or if the Potters had investments that continued to pay. Unfortunately, we never see that side of the financial system of the wizarding world.. one of the reasons fics involving world building or simple explanations about it are so intriguing to many.

We do know that more than gold is maintained in the vaults. We also know that money can be withdrawn in ways beyond the simple owner has key situation. And simply by looking at how the world works, there has to be ways to deposit, withdraw, invest, and transfer money beyond needing to walk into Gringotts to do so. It would not be feasible to require all Wizarding kind to have to literally visit a bank, travel to a vault, and perform transactions every time they needed to, even with near instantaneous travel.

This implies that Gringotts has a lot more flexibility with regards to the "gold" in their banks than perhaps many think. Even if that flexibility were to simply be on paper with internal money shuffling.

** The way I think makes sense is if you look at the meaning behind the last name (Potter, Black, Bones) and derive meaning from it.

The Potter family seems to mean that they were involved in pottery way back when, which then wouldn't be a far stretch to say they traded heavily, therefore creating their fortune.

For the Blacks you could say they were heavily steeped in Dark Magic (the blackest of magicks) and hired out their services for whatever end the buyer wanted.

Bones could be either the medical usage from way back when (shamanism or some such) or necromancy (how one would make that profitable I don't know, this is just me spitballing).

This way seems like the best way (imo) to look at the old families and their fortunes.

** ARE the Blacks all that rich? I know the general agreement is that they are/were, but... is that ever really addressed or confirmed in canon? I mean... We know that Sirius had enough money to buy a Firebolt and still have "a reasonable amount of gold" left in his vault when he died, so they clearly weren't struggling financially... but I don't really see anything that indicates they were anything as rich as the Malfoys. At first I thought maybe the treasure-filled vault where Bellatrix hid Hufflepuff's cup, but that was the Lestrange family vault and had little to do with the Blacks.

So if anyone has any canon sources that say that the Blacks were anything beyond "comfortably well off," I'd be interested in hearing about that!

As for the Malfoys, they are "old money." Their wealth lie in owning a lot of land and property, and according to Pottermore, "it has been rumoured for many years (though never proven) that over the centuries the family has dabbled successfully in Muggle currency and assets."

No I agree - they come across like the cliche of old blood and out of money. They pride themselves so much on breeding and quality of the family, but with no sign of wealth equivalent to the Malfoys.

** The answer for the Black family is simple: there's no canon evidence that they are particularly rich. Well off, sure, but they've never been presented as noteworthy in their wealth.

Pottermore provides the answer for the Malfoy family: they were gifted land by William the Conqueror for aiding his conquest of England. The main way in which money is earned from agricultural land is farming, so the Malfoys may have a number of tenant farmers. Whether they grow regular crops or if they rear magical animals and grow magical plants is unknown. It's also possible they have some urban holdings from which they gain rent.

*** I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're going for, but SilentlyWatches 'Black Queen' series does a really great job with world-building in regards to this, so much so it's become one of my absolute favorite works even though it incorporates a version of Fem!Harry, which until I read the first fic in the 'Black Queen' series, I had never once remotely enjoyed.

Without giving too much away, it starts as an AU where James and Lily have twins, Danny and Jenny (Harry's traits are split between the two). The prophecy still happens but James and Lily become stir crazy and join the Order on a mission on Halloween night 1981, leaving James' father Charlus to babysit. Voldemort attacks, Charlus sacrifices himself in the same manner Lily did in canon. Danny becomes the BWL. The prophecy for Danny is more or less canon, but it also implies that Jenny will become dark and evil. Dumbledore, acting in the "Greater Good", secretly performs a ritual to make Jen a squib, then, while examining the twins post attack, breaks the tragic news to James and Lily, convincing them her future in the wizarding world will be nothing but pain and exclusion, her only chance at a normal life is with Muggles. Of course this means being dropped off with the Dursley's, who are even more upset about the situation than in canon because Lily and James aren't dead. Once Jen showed signs of magic, they became outright abusive, eventually discarding her in the worst part of London.

Once Sirius escapes from Azkaban, he arrives at Hogwarts expecting to find the twins, shocked to see only Danny there. Once he caught Pettigrew, proved his innocence then recovered from the decade he was in Azkaban, he finds out from the Potters that they'd sent her to live with her Muggle relatives because Dumbledore's tests showed she was a Squib. Sirius finds Jen (managing a child brothel that she worked at for years) and takes her in. She's quickly adopted as a Black, easily shedding the Potter name since Lily and James had been so secretive in, to them hiding, to Jen abandoning, her with the Dursley's.

As a Black, Jen eagerly becomes next in line as Head of House. With Sirius, they reunite the bulk of the Black family, Narcissa escapes from an abusive attempt to make her take the Dark Mark, Andromeda (Andi) brings Ted and Nymphadora (Dora), and once the surviving, not incarcerated, Blacks are together, a lot of explanations are given, for the structure of the "nobility" (more accurately aristocracy) in magical Britain. The Blacks along with a handful of other families like the Bones are the highest ranking 'Ancient and Most Noble Houses', followed by the still incredibly wealthy but newer Houses like the Malfoys, then the more modest but still noble Houses like the Potters. It reflects pretty similarly the hierarchy of Muggle Britain. There's a lot of talk about House business, something Jen aspires to be in charge of someday when Sirius steps down as Head of House. A lot of the social expectations and customs are brought up and explained. There's a lot of talk of the political climate, currently and in the past and how the different families fit. Business ventures are brought up as matters of House business, so even if it's not completely laid out how all wealth was acquired in the past, there's networking happening in real time where mutually beneficial ventures are agreed upon.

Sorry for the long explanation, kind of hard to do a short summary of a AU tetralogy. If nothing else, it's definitely worth the read for the world building aspects of the economy, culture, politics, etc. At least in terms of background and world building, my head canon is very similar
