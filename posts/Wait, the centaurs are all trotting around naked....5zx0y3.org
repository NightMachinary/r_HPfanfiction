Just something that randomly occurred to me; do we ever see centaurs wearing any clothes at all in the Harry Potter books and movies? I'm fairly sure not.

I mean, sure, we're used to the idea of horses not wearing clothes, but shouldn't a highly intelligent, civilized species, some of whom are living next to a school for teenagers, put some clothes on?

It'd be funny if Dumbledore worked that into his start-of-term speech; "I must once again remind all students that the Forbidden Forest is forbidden, on account of various hazards including wolves, giant spiders, toxic plants and all the naked people galloping around."

Or when Firenze offers to carry Harry on his back, Harry's a bit /iffy/ about the whole thing. Everyone politely averting their eyes when centaurs walk into their field of view.

Does anyone know any non-adult fics that have characters notice this? It probably can't be the main focus of a longer fic, but maybe it's in a one-shot somewhere, or a running gag..?


** Centaurs are people of the forest, with a deep connection to nature. I would guess that clothing isn't exactly part of their culture. High intelligence and the existence of a civilization / culture / society doesn't necessarily include clothes. We humans adapted clothes because it allowed us to stay literally anywhere on the planet instead of only the savannas and jungles of Africa. If centaurs don't need clothing to survive in Britain, then there is no necessity for it.

I'd guess that seeing naked centaurs is just normal to most magicals. And I've read plenty of fics where, as a sidenote, there is talk of some rather peculiar fetishes.

However, I also remember that I've once read a fic in which a centaur orphan, adopted by a magical family, got used to wearing clothes over both her human and her horse parts. I also remember that it was a horrible fic, but thats neither here nor there.

#+begin_quote
  For our detention, Hagrid took us out to the Forbidden Forest.

  The /Forbidden/ Forest.

  Hagrid was concerned about unicorns being attacked and drained of blood out in the Forbidden Forest. His brilliant plan was to have four firsties and his cowardly boarhound Fang accompany him in his search for the thing in the Forbidden Forest that could actually catch a unicorn with the intent of draining their blood. I am not a fearful person, but I try to avoid useless damage.

  The thing I encountered in the Forbidden Forest with its face dripping of silvery unicorn blood was like something from Tales from the Crypt. I would be having nightmares about it but something else happened then. As the thing charged at me I was knocked over from behind. When I sat up to see what happened, I discovered that a centaur was standing over me, chasing the thing away. More specifically, I was sitting directly under Firenze's quite impressive fur-covered twitching Man- -or rather- Horse-parts. They're bigger than my leg. It was distracting. After the creature retreated, Firenze stepped forward, turned around and spoke about some stuff.

  I honestly can't remember what he said.

#+end_quote

Why should they? They have a perfect excuse to legally be naked in the woods next to a school full of children.

I just love Harry Potter.

But really, why should a species so close to nature bother with human prudity? They probably think we're weird for wearing clothes when it's warm. Not to mention swimsuits, the most illogical piece of clothing imaginable.
