:END:
I recall reading a fic where Harry reads a lot and has an amicable relationship with Snape. I think Harry was still a student. I don't remember what was going on during the rest of the fic. I remember Harry would drop muggle book titles in conversation and Snape had to go find and secretly read them to understand what Harry was talking about.

Wish I could add more, but that's literally all I can recall.
