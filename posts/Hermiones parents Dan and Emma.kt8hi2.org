So I suddenly had a thought as to why everyone names Hermione's parents Dan and Emma and I feel really stupid if that's the case.

It's cause Daniel radcliffe and Emma Watson right? Cause like after years of reading fanfic it just came to me. Am I right or am I delusional cause I feel really stupid :P


** Yes, that's why. And don't feel too bad. I didn't realize until someone pointed it out after years of reading fics.

** It is, but now it is kind of tradition, which some almost violently oppose. I really think that some people spent too much time on names (the other violent point of contention is name of fem!Harry).

**** And to be fair: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] is one of my most favourite series. However, it is next-generation story (Holly is Dudley's magical daughter; no, it is A WAY more complicated story than just that).

My first fem!Harry fic was "A Long Journey Home", which has more or less cemented fem!Harry as Jasmine in my mind.

*** I think that's more just because there is a certain type of fic that has Dan and Emma as the parents, like you're guaranteed to have a lot of muggle wank and the ship will be harmony if Hermione's parents are called that

** I'm low key fond of Dan and Emma, particularly when I delve back into FanFiction after long periods of abstaining, it's an immediate ‚Äúah, yes, I'm back.‚Äù It does quite quickly get me rolling my eyes, but in an amused kind of way. I'm one of those people who love fanon, though; I almost wrote my undergrad thesis on fanfiction/fanon and how communities can continue developing static creative works, evolving new terminology and motifs. In many ways fanfiction is the most (if not only) democratic art form, and damn I fucking love all it's weird little signifiers like Dan and Emma. But I also get why they probably irritate some people üòÇ

*** They're unnamed characters. Dan and Emma are just easy to remember and there not stale names like Jane and Max or something like that. Dan and Emma meen somthing to the HP community so why not give the names to some of the people who dont have one.

**** I don't like it because it's too meta. I know I'm reading a story, but I don't need to be reminded of the fact while I'm reading it. It's like the author is saying "hey, look! I've named them after the two lead actors in the movies! Wink wink!"

To me, it just stands out and breaks the immersion.
