Fanfiction exposes a lot of JKR's plot holes and poor worldbuilding.

I can't even say "I love Harry Potter" any more. I love the idea of a wizarding world. I love HP fanfiction. But my opinion of the original books are pretty low.

Thoughts?


** Nah, it's easier to patch holes million other people have noticed than be original. I think if the same number of people read those fanfictions and applied the same scrutiny to them, they wouldn't fare much better. And it's easier to focus on world building when you were already given all that basis.

I personally value the books more. I still can reread now them and enjoy them, though there some things I don't really dig there. I also low key think, that a lot of fans forgot that the books are actually like, after reading fanfics that focus on their negatives for years.

*** I don't think your last point holds, at least in my case. I reread all the HP books before delving into fan fiction for the first time a few months ago. I started with Alexandra Quick and I liked it better.

I considered the possibility that I have read them so many times by now that this is the reason I don't like them as much anymore. Basically, what I think is OOTP was her only good book and that once Sirius died the series began its premature ending. Book five was marvelous. DADA, the Order and Grimauld 12, Arthur's mishap - so many subplots. I feel like it's pretty much the only book this rich in content. And then, instead of keeping this golden formula as it was, and describing a more exciting war against Voldemort and his Death Eaters via the Order itself and even DADA at Hogwarts, I feel like it all became a parody of itself at the end, and in the later two books. I personally wasn't thrilled with anything that happened in Half-Blood Prince, it was pretty underwhelming overall. It felt like a set-up to book 7, with one major character death and the introduction of Horcruxes. And that's it. Compare this to book 5 where so many things happen and never truly take off. And then there's the Horcrux hunt itself, camping, betrayal, and a big old fight. Whooptie fucking doo.

So I turned to fan fiction in the hope to find stories where the Order takes more of a central role and the war itself is described at greater length. I basically wanted to read a divergence from the series that starts right before the Ministry expedition. Maybe the prophecy itself can be non-existent and Voldemort's big weapon can be something else. Maybe the Horcruxes don't exist.

Sadly I haven't found what I'm looking for but I'm still hoping. Maybe one day I'll write it myself.

**** I loved the 5th book so much, I found fanfiction in-between book 4 and 5 but during the wait for book 6 is when I really got into it, and unfortunately book 6 and 7 never really lived up my hopes and dreams. Book 5 really was packed, and it felt a bit jarring to go from Sirius is dead, the war is well and truly on the way, everyone knows Voldemort is back, to.. teen drama and romance angst..

***** The sad part is it wasn't even that. Had it been teen drama and romance angst it would have been at least a little interesting.

I genuinely have no idea what you mean. I don't think Ron leaving Harry and Hermione and then him kissing Hermione during the last act can be considered any of those. I don't know what kind of young adult dramas you've been consuming. They are a lot better than that.

I'm not even going to mention Harry/Ginny. That was as tame as tame can be. Really, Rowling didn't do anything of the sort of going extreme in those directions, she barely even touched on them.

No, the problem lies in the action itself. It all felt rushed and not like the Rowling that wrote OOTP. It's like an impostor took her place just to get the series over with.

** I personally have a different take on this. Sure, Harry Potter is full of plot holes and the world building can be rather poor, a consequence of it starting out as solely a children's series then getting progressively darker. But fanfiction rarely can compare on the sheer strength of the writing, with only the cream of the crop comparable. And the magic that effuses throughout the work, hardly anything gives that feeling. Fanfic authors are great at building a darker, more logical world, of creating greater urgency for the characters and more well thought-out motivations, but that magical feeling just often isn't there. And ultimately, that's what I loved about the series, and why I'm willing to forgive the plot holes and inconsistencies; why I'm willing to go back and reread the books time and time again.

*** I could not agree more with this. I've read more Harry Potter fanfiction than I care to admit. I can't even estimate how many individual stories I've read. But no matter what is happening in it, what plot holes they delve into, or what characters they expand upon, it just does not feel the same as reading one of the actual books. I know my fandom devotion has waned over the years, and my opinions on Rowling and her work have certainly had their ups and downs (especially in the last couple of years), but it doesn't change how I feel about the original HP series. I keep going back to them, and it still feels magical every time.

**** Maybe I just haven't read enough fanfiction then. I completely respect your opinions, but since I really got /into/ fanfic, maybe 2-3 years ago, normal books/movies have lost almost all appeal. Everything feels cliche and boring, the other day my family was watching a movie and I could predict exactly what was going to happen. The point of fanfiction is to take one of these works and revamp it in an interesting way, and I love that.

I'm quite young, but I read HP about 6 years ago now. And though it was interesting learning about this new world, once it stopped being new, it also stopped being interesting to me. The plot was very bread and butter, your classic 2-boys-1-girl, three main characters, the MC is recklessly brave, the girl is insanely smart, and the sidekick is pretty dumb (tbh) but fiercely loyal. You have your hero face many obstacles, and ends with a behemoth of a David-vs-Goliath battle where your MC is in no way on their foe's level, yet somehow still wins through the power of sheer luck.

JKR's books obviously have better writing than fanfic, which is often riddled with mistakes in grammar, spelling and punctuation. But fanfiction doesn't have your bread and butter plots, fanfic explores the fictional world more, explores deeper into the original characters, fanfic is /different/ and /interesting/. So I would rather read the fanfiction than the original works.

***** I hear what you're saying. I also have had that problem with that kind of cynicism. Modern media is just everyone trying to copy each other, telling the same stories over and over again. But I realize the it's because tropes make things more accessible to a general audience. There are tons of things out there that so-called cultured people love but the average person off the street would absolutely hate. At the end of the day, many authors and filmmakers want their work to sell, and those cliches can go either way.

As for fanfiction though, I approach it the same way I would any piece of work. I suspend my sense of disbelief and just appreciate it for what it is. I've read fanfiction that's so well done, it could be Pulitzer worthy. But it doesn't change how I view the original property. It's fun to see different versions of characters, but I don't believe that makes their original portrayal wrong or flawed in some way. It's difficult to explain, but I have a hard time enjoying fanfiction without at least a respect for the original form. They are separate and yet connected if that makes any sense at all.

That's not to say it's not fun to get away from the cliches. I love seeing all the different directions writers can take a story we already know, how they can expand upon it. It's like all the stories about the Hogwarts founders. It's something that could go anywhere, but it's rooted in something we already appreciate. I too wish that mainstream authors did try something different, but, I hate to say, even that eventually becomes predictable. Or it just flat out doesn't work. Crimes of Grindlewald anyone?

**** I was considering mentioning that! That and Alexandra Quick are the only two fanfics that come straight to mind when I imagine something that has that same magical charm. I think it has to do with the fact that both follow the school story roots of Harry Potter, and take the effort to introduce whimsy and mystery, instead of turning Hogwarts into a giant dueling ground or some political battlefield. Not that dueling grounds or politics are bad of course, but they aren't quite the same. The Pureblood Pretense is another story that does keep pretty well to its school story roots, but the politics and hypergenius of Harry makes it not as magical, but nevertheless an amazing read.

** Yeah, there are some plot holes in the original series (time turner anyone?) but I think the bigger point of Harry Potter is that we all fell in love with the universe she created. We love the characters, the setting, the concept of magic itself. The beauty of fan fiction is that you can take the story anywhere you want to because there really aren't that many restrictions on magic in the original books. I think you can still love, or at least enjoy, both things without being completely enamoured with the books.

****** The first book was released, and the rest of the storyline was established, years ago, likely at a time when this trope wasn't as beaten to death as it is now. Are you suggesting that stories shouldn't be written if they fall under one of the established archetypes of storytelling? How would you have changed the plot to not fall into this trap but still make it as captivating for the millions of people who enjoyed these books? Of course it would be interesting to read more about some of the minor characters and have their stories fleshed out but that's something that I feel happens in every book and movie we enjoy. I'd love to learn more about Gimli or Legolas and less about Frodo, I'd love to have a Black Widow movie instead of a third Iron Man. But that single fact doesn't discredit the original stories.

Also, I'm really curious now. What plot holes do you see in Harry Potter?

However, without the original story, none of the innovations of fanfiction would matter. Time-travel fix-it is obviously meaningless without the original story. Even manipulations of characters like Regulus Black and Gilderoy Lockhart are only rich because of the small snippets we get from canon. JKR built us a world full of all these little moving parts that fully captured our imagination.

** I mean it totally depends on how you viewed the original stories but I get it. There are LOADS of books where the story itself is mediocre, disappointing, controversial, or the like.. but the world around it is AMAZING.

One of the most egregious examples of this is the Eragon series. The world had such amazing potential, and the story itself did as well, but unfortunately, it suffered with time over the course of the series, and the ending is still one of the most disappointing endings I have ever read in a book series. And yet, I go back over and over to take a look at the world and enjoy its fan fiction potential.

Harry Potter has the same problem but to a much lesser degree, as its story is stronger overall in my view. That said, it definitely has issues. Not just plot holes, but underdevelopment of characters, lack of direction at times, and an ending that leaves quite a chunk of the reader base a bit disappointed, or at least, unimpressed. And the controversies surrounding the various pairings don't help the situation.

While I do think the HP fanfiction community has been helped by the aspects people found lacking, I personally don't think it has made me view the original works more poorly than before.

** I'm actually very surprised that the responses here are almost unanimous disagreement (respectfully and well articulated, which is awesome.)

For me, an important distinction is 'Books 1-4', 'Book 5', and 'Books 6 & 7'.

I used to reread the whole series pretty regularly after GoF came out, and while waiting for OotP. When OotP became part of the series, the desire to reread it wasn't very strong, so I only read it again before HBP came out.

I didn't care for HBP very much, and started to pretty actively dislike many main characters at this point. I was already feeling let down and disappointed by the series direction. I felt that quality was suffering quite a bit as the whole thing grew beyond what anyone could have imagined when PS paperbacks were on grocery store shelves.

I flat out disliked DH. Almost gave up reading it at times because I was so frustrated with it. I have not reread it once, which makes that the only HP book I haven't read multiple times.

There was a lengthy discussion a while back about a lot of folks feeling let down or disappointed by the series because we aged as it was being written, the characters did too, etc. which is likely why I feel the way I do about them. Doesn't mean they were bad books, but I definitely think that JKR's strength is not world-building. At least not a world that stands up to any scrutiny.

That said, I have read many, many fanfics I enjoyed more than some of the originals (because I didn't really enjoy some of the Canon books that much - it's a low bar.)

I still think a couple of 6th year stories that were written before HBP came out, and were intentionally written as much as possible in the style and tone of Canon, would have or could have easily been published in place of HBP.

**** Eh. There are /reasons/ why I prefer reading fanfiction over original fantasy - I prefer to stay in a single universe and see it get fleshed out more and more, and fanfiction is basically the perfect way to enjoy such a thing. Fanfiction lets me see ever more unique/interesting takes and new facets to existing stories. Basically like how there are about a million different ways that Shakespeare's plays have been played.

Original fantasy, outside of gigantic series and web serials, is often too thin for my tastes.

(You had to take tests on books to see if you read them, and earned points for passing the tests, trying to reach a goal. HP books were worth 20+ points, so my goals were in the hundreds, and the tests reset each school year. This was when the books were coming out, so each year or so, I'd have another book to read. I had the books memorized to a T.)

** I have to agree with this.

I write a lot for fun in my spare time. And I read even more. What I have noticed about the cannon books is that JKR did the worst thing an author could do imo.

She changed the characters personality to fit the story because she wanted it to end a specific way. Now I'm not saying that your plot isn't important, but as you write characters they start to take on their own voices. And if by the end you have created a character that wouldn't do the things you originally planned, you have to follow that and let the characters speak for themselves. The plot flows better if you don't change who your characters become just to fit an arbitrary idea.

That is why I think fanfiction is better written at times. They take the time to really delve into the history of the characters and build something out of them. Rather than stuffing a character into a situation and forcing them to react a differnet way, I let my characters speak for themselves and then change my plot in a way that makes sense for my characters to have gotten themselves into or gotten themselves out of. This is I think what JKR did worst.

Harry is the easiest example of that. The has a "saving people thing" but has never had a family to show him love. Kids who grow up in abused situations like that, don't turn out to be all loving, self sacrificing heroes. Unless something happens to inspire that inside of them. Which I don't think she really did. She kept this shy boy, a 'normally adjusted kid' even though there was no chance of that with his childhood.

Hermione is a great example as well. She is touted as the rule loving, authority following good girl. But we don't know what made her that way, at all. We know next to nothing about her parents since she is always willing to leave them behind for the wizarding world. That doesn't seem like something she would do. Halfway through the first book she is already breaking rules and lighting people on fire. Is this because she craved friends so bad she was willing to do anything to have them? Does it have something to do with rebelling agains the bullies from her childhood (if she had some). We don't know because she was never fleshed out past "rule loving" even though she breaks more laws with her supreme intelligence over and over again. And yet by the end of the series she is still seen as the rule lover. Going on to be part of the goverment that had rejected her her entire life.

Ron, youngest male of 7. Clings to Harry like a lifeline when it suites him best. He cares about Harry until Harry starts to really become another brother for him to fight with. The Weasley parents are the ones that came to support Harry at the Tournament despite Ron being furious at him at the time, He is still fighting his feelings of insecurity about siblings. Harry getting his parents attention doesn't help. But again, we only remember Ron for the other things. The times when he verbally abused and bullied others gets slipped past because he is a good chess player.

The characters are all written to end up filling specific roles in the plot. While in fanfiction we as writers get to explore why and make sense of those situations, or throw out the ones that truely didn't make sense. (H/G and R/Hr coming to mind) she even admitted afterwards that she is sad that she forced that. She wanted them to end up the reluctant couple. But Ron had spend the entire series either hurting her, or letting her down. Is Hermione that damaged that all she can cling to is someone that treats her that way? And if so, why?

Too many hanging questions about who the characters are and what makes them do the things they are doing. These are the things that fanfiction does better.

So in the end, yes I like fanfiction better because I feel it is more real to what would happen in a school full of teenagers who can use magic and a small number adults. We are supposed to believe that sex is not mentioned in a single book or that the teenagers don't swear all the time? It makes them feel fake to me.

*** I really don't mean this to be rude, but I think you have a very shallow understanding of the HP plot and Harry/Ron/Hermione's etc. characterizations. They all have realistic and understandable character arcs. They weren't just manipulated to fit Rowling's plot without consideration for who they are as characters.

You say Harry is the best example of this because he was abused, and JKR gave no reason why he would turn into a hero after his childhood. But she absolutely does - he goes from his awful home at the Dursley's and arrives in this magical universe where people love him and care for him unconditionally. OF COURSE he's going to be the kind of person who would do absolutely anything to protect that. It means all the more to him because of where he came from.

And then you bring up Hermione and how we have no understanding of “why” she doesn't like breaking the rules. But...so what? People have various personalities as we don't always know where those traits arise from. But it's an integral part of her character arc that through her friendships with Harry and Ron, and through her increasing understanding of what's at stake, that she comes to understand that rules aren't everything and sometimes they need to be broken.

I could go on and on with this. She absolutely did not just manipulate the characters in ways that don't make sense to fit her predetermined plot.

Also - really? You need sex for a book about teenagers to feel realistic? That blows my mind. Teenagers aren't just sex crazed fiends, and it's possible to focus a story on the other issues they're dealing with.

**** Yeah I think I have plenty of understanding of her characterization. I've been reading the books since the came out and reading fanfiction since I was 12. I've read the books at least a dozen times each. The characters are no mystery to me.

Let's just go with Hermione. You said it yourself, Hermione learns over time the importance and the stake of everything. Yet at 17 in the the sixth book, she is only concerned about boys and completely ignores the dangers that are in the school all because she is worried about a potions text book that is taking her grades. That was a DRAMATIC shift from the Hermione that wanted to start an army the year before. Explaining that away with 'hormones' and them 'being teenagers' doesn't hold water when a few weeks before they (under Hermione's command)

1. Started an Army and used that army to defend the school
2. Lied to a Ministry official and led her into the Forbidden Forest and left her for dead.
3. Flew across the country to break into the heart of the government.
4. Fought death eaters and broke their way into the most secret level of the government.

Then the summer goes by and next thing you know, Hermione is boy crazy and can't stop yelling at Harry over a text book.

uhhhhh what? She was shoehorned into being a female love interest by removing all her critical thinking and the character development that she had gotten from the first 5 books, so that way she and Ron could fall in love.

Another few months go by and now we are in the thick of it. Back from being boy crazy, she goes ultra hardcore and sends her parents away to Australia, possibly forever. She packs for all of her friends everything they might need. Saves their lives multiple times and roams around the country. The final battle happens and Hermione's biggest mention in the entire thing is that she kisses Ron after he mentions the house elves.

Yes that sounds like the same Hermione that has been running around the rest of the time, being tortured, having her arm branded, seeing death and destruction, only to get to the school and be remembered for a kiss.

That is just ONE example. I could go on and on about which characters don't make sense and why, but Hermione is the easiest example.

***** What dangers are lurking that Hermione knows about in sixth year, which she should be taking action against? The Draco plot? She flat out doesn't believe Harry and for good reason - he has repeatedly been wrong about Draco in the past, and on its surface it's silly to think Draco would be made a death eater at 16. So what exactly is she supposed to be doing??? And of course she's worried about the textbook - they've been shown in the past the power that can be in a book of unknown origins (the diary).

So given that there's no major danger in sixth year that Hermione would reasonably take seriously, of course she's going to act like a normal teenage girl. She's a bad ass and has saved the day multiple times, but that doesn't change that she's a 16 year old girl at the end of the day, and is going to have normal 16 year old girl concerns. You are diminishing her character by relegating her to the one personality trait you consider important - her brains. You complain about no sex in the books, but somehow Hermione having a crush is out of character apparently.

Also WHO is only remembering Hermione for that kiss with Ron? Certainly not me and certainly not most other people I know who have read the books. I really don't understand what you're getting at with that point.

Regardless, I don't think I'm going to convince you. It would take too long. But yeah, I think the last two books are trash and fanfiction can do a better job filling in the last of the story than those two books did.

** I still dearly love the original property, no matter how problematic I find certain aspects of the books as an adult or how many plot holes there are. Ultimately, JK wrote a very, very successful commercial book, which is a rarity, and the more successful it became, the more her editors and publishers would have wanted to avoid alienating any potential buyers. I don't know how much creative control JK had, but it does seem like at the end she was writing a world that could bend to her specifications and allow Harry's story to end on relatively happy note, with most of the good characters being rewarded. Deepening her world and giving diverse characters a voice didn't seem like a priority there, which is why I take so much more pleasure from fanfic, because I get to explore tiny characters she didn't care about, or read about ways to resolve the whole war mess written by people that don't have to care about whether the Harry fans would lose their shit if Harry died/didn't defeat Voldemort himself. I don't think JK had the luxury to alienate the fans by writing half of things some of the really good fics do. And it's hard to find amazing fics that do such an extensive and great job at world-building. Looking at a known Universe, finding the flaws, and fixing them is a lot easier, and I still find that a lot of fics are wish-fulfilling for the authors--more about rewarding the characters they like than anything else. It's hard finding a balance between writing characters that are flawed and sometimes even evil who still get their way, and fixing all the plot holes.

** "Harry Potter" is amazing for what it is. A series of novels aimed at children. It's filled with wonder and amazement and excitement and it really sparked a lot of young readers imaginations. What it is not (and at the time didn't try to be) is a detailed, logical, and internally consistent attempt at world building. This is one of the reasons I really detest JKs post series "canon enhancements" she's trying to make the world something it fundamentally wasn't and doing so just results in a trainwreck.

Now personally, I enjoy the numerous fanfics I've read more than canon. Not for any flaw on the books part, but simply because I am no longer a member of the target audience. I am not looking to be awed by the fantastic. I am not looking to be told a fairy tale story. I am looking for other things, and it is unfair to say a beloved series is poorly written just because I am no longer its target audience.

TL:DR "Harry Potter" is a children's book and should be judged as such. ASoIaF or "The Witcher" would be objectively terrible if judged by the metrics of a children's book, just as HP is a terrible series if judged by their metrics.

** What I've recently come to find (and it's only because I'm older now and I've read more widely than when I first fell in love with Harry Potter) is that JK Rowling is not a good writer. She's a good STORYTELLER. And there's a massive difference.

The Harry Potter books are so incredibly well planned out. Nothing is perfect so of course there will be plot holes and things that could've been resolved “if only x, y and z had done this” but that's simplifying and completely overlooking the brilliance of the worldbuilding JK has achieved. She created a world people long to be in, a place people long to go, she created something that people use to identify themselves (patronus forms, wand types, the Houses). It's such an incredible feat. She created characters that everyone can relate to and every character is grey. Sure, the fandom often either vilify or hero-worship characters (SNAPE, looking at you) but the beauty of the books and JK's writing is that there's ALWAYS a counter-argument. It might not be balanced but sometimes stuff isn't. The Harry Potter books are incredible pieces of literature for what they represent and for the impact they have on people. The story is brilliant, it's heartbreaking, it forces you to look at the world around you. It teaches you to love, to learn, about friendship, family, morality, death, life. For a children's book, it's incredibly nuanced and her story-telling ability is of such a high standard.

But that doesn't make them well written. JK's actual writing ability isn't anything special, there are books out there (and FanFictions in fact) that are much better written than the HP series, whether that's because of the descriptions, the speech, the detail, but it doesn't negate the fact that JK created something wholly unique and special that is a piece of magic in itself.

It's certainly true that at some point, the brilliance of the storytelling starts to get overshadowed by the plainness of the writing, but I guess it's all about finding what about the books made it so magical for you in the first place :)

​

1) Norse magic practicers- volvas- used wands, not romans. I also assume most of the world does not use wands as a rule; why she has not explored this I have no idea;

2)Wizards were supposed to have had a superior society for most part, so I would assume they would have left many more written documents regarding their origins and History than it is sadi; instead, JKR makes a mockery of it by having a ghost teaching History and not doing a good job at it. Why? I have no idea!

​

3) Hogwarts is free; tuition is paid by the Ministry according to JKR. fine, then why the hell they cannot afford to hire a History teacher? Why they need Muggle studies to be subpar when they have muggle borns there? Why the twenty century muggle born parents had not created an association to fight for the Rights of their children? Why a rich guy like Justin would not simply leave Hogwarts, hire tutoes, sit his O.W.L and be done witha society that mostly would see him as a second class citizen, espeicially when he was from a muggle elite?

I could go on and on...
