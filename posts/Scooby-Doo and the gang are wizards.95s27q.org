This idea just popped into my head with Scooby and the gang all as wizards working for the department of the misuse of muggle artifacts. No idea where it came from, but as soon as it hit me, it made perfect sense. Almost every episode ever made can be easily adapted to this concept.


** I already gave similar thoughts to this in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8s7q2y/is_harry_potter_a_good_friend_to_ron_and_hermione/][this]] thread. It works better if the trio is Mystery Inc., rather than a crossover style story.

** Scooby-Doo has been canonically crossed over with basically everything under the sun ( or at least everything Hana Barbera could aqcuire some right to use), so why not use that idea?

You are right, the idea would have some merits, though, and it probably could work.
