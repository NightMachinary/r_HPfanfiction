** Read and Understand The Elements of Style. It's available on multiple websites.

I doubt there's anything that will effectively test grammar readily available for free on the internet. Grammar too large of a concept to be effectively tested. Before composing this response I googled 'grammar test' and took three that popped up.

All three were rather pointless and did not require any understanding of grammar to actually complete. Every answer was simply what 'sounds' the best. Neither test took me more than three minutes and I didn't get a question wrong.

Of course, grammar is more of a set of guidelines as opposed to hard and fast rules. That being said, you should be able to defend whether or not you chose follow those guidelines or not. And to be able to defend it, one must understand it.

For example: English grammar will state that you should never end a sentence in a preposition. And, in most cases, one should not. However; this rule exists because ancient English grammarians were trying to conform English, a Germanic language, to Latin, a romance language. One literally cannot end a sentence in a preposition in Latin, so they applied that to English, without fully understanding what they were working on.

Writing, like any other artistic skill, requires practice more than study. Yes, it's important to understand grammar and why grammar exists. But knowing that will not make one a better writer. The only way to improve at writing is to write. One does not understand one percent of what it is to write a story, until one actually bothers to write said story.

You could probably make a tool like that in Google docs or Word fairly easily with formatting links and differing documents and what not. I'm not particularly sure why you'd want to go through the effort though. Just make a document, label it characters, and use the find feature if you need to look something up.

Practical writing advice though. If you need to make a 'Master List' of all of your characters in a story that would require the ability to sort and comb through like that, well, then you have too many characters in the story.

Vague is often better than specific. Characters rarely need a specific age. And appearances should only be described if they are entirely necessary to the plot. See two examples to follow.

Titus Button, twenty-two, the former Slytherin beater stood in the doorway. He was a good six foot four and possessed toned muscles from long runs and workouts. He had light brown hair, styled upwards, not a strand out of place, but he also sported matching beard that suggested more a laziness with a razor than an attempt to grow it out. Or perhaps, it just existed to hide his dual dimples. His large almond, chestnut shaped eyes always contained a playful glint and his thin lips always curved upward in a smirk. When he smiled, which was often, he showed perfectly straight white teeth. He looked every bit one would imagine a roguish athlete to look. His playful eyes found Harry as soon as he entered the room and he walked to join his friend.

Vs:

Titus Button, a twenty-something beater for the Ballycastle Bats entered the room. He paused for a moment to survey the scene before finding Harry and stepping over toward his friend.

Both descriptions do the same thing. Character A enters room to find Character B. The first takes far too long to get to the point and slows down the writing and the story with details that are totally unnecessary in the story.

Your post history indicates you haven't really written anything of length before. Do not go in with a cast of characters. Plan the plot and then fill in characters as needed to suit the plot. If the author needs something to organize all of the characters in a story, than the reader will too. And the reader shouldn't have to be expected to follow that. They will not be handing you a book report on your fanfic. And you're not Charles Dickens and being paid by the line.

And, on a random, totally unrelated side note. I think that is the first time I penned a description of Titus Button and it made me feel dirty.

*** As far as grammar goes, I've found grammarly to be great if you do most of your writing online (like Gdocs). If you do most of your writing offline you may want to look into the paid version, but I'm too cheap to do that :p

**** Poor Planning Promotes Poor Performance.

What you are describing is not what Rowling did. (And you may not know this, but every writer of any note plans their stories. I have an entire bookcase that's just handwritten plans for stories). Rowling plotted her stories, and then built the world around the plot.

You want tips for improvement as a writer? Easy Peasy.

Nothing matters but the plot. Everything should exist for the purpose of getting the story from point A to point B. Until you've planned the Where, What, When, Why and How of the plot. You have not done any planning at all.

Every single detail that goes into the plan must be important to the plot. Every single item you list in your second paragraph I'd ask the same question about: "Why does this matter to the plot?"

If you simply want to do a pedantic rewrite of the novels, well, fine that's your prerogative. But, well, at what point in Harry Potter does it matter, say, spells are classified? At what point in a story would it be interesting to read the pedagogy behind that? Why does it matter to the plot?

Also putting hard rules in for magic is just limiting and going to lead into a plot hole. As with your final paragraph, the more you put in, the more likely you are to make the mistake you're trying to avoid. You're less likely to make that mistake if you plan out the chapters and their contents specifically.

But the best advice is really, write. If you want to write. Do it. Saying, "I can't get into the writing of the actual plot until I have everything figured out." just translates to me as, "I can't write." I can already tell you're trying to do way too much. And it will lead to probably never completing a story.

So I say write something. Set specific goals. Say 80k words or so. See what 80k words actually is. See what it takes to plot a story, to formulate chapter, to understand characters in those chapters. What you're doing now is a very backwards approach to what I would advise young writers. And you're setting yourself up for failure. You'll spend more time trying to shoehorn ideas into the text, than actually writing a good story.

World Building is fine and dandy, but A Game of Thrones existed before The World of Ice And Fire. And there's a reason for that.

**** I'm definitely very similar in how I've planned my writing, while writing is twice as hard as I thought, exploring the world and digging up details to plan the story is five times as fun. For two reasons though I've handwritten it all; I was concerned I'd make the mistake TE7 pointed out and have too many characters/pointless facts and it's just my personal preference. Something to keep in mind while writing, especially since you're redoing canon, is that most fanfiction readers are intimately familiar with the world, so there are some things that are 'given' and you really only need to address the things that come about as any divergence you have. Maybe save the recent thread on what irks people when reading a rehash fic and skim through it before writing or something.

** [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][WritingExcuses.com]] --- Really good podcast on writing co-led by Brandon Sanderson.

Also, Brandon teaches university writing courses and someone put several whole semesters worth of his material on youtube. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4ZDBOc2tX8&list=PLH3mK1NZn9QqOSj3ObrP3xL8tEJQ12-vL][Here's the playlist for his most recent one]]

That's all I've got. Most of the other resources I've used are books from Amazon but saying, 'amazon.com,' probably isn't what you had in mind :)

As for your tool request... I'd look into a databasing software package. That's basically what you've just described. Can't give any good recommendations from personal experience unfortunately, but maybe someone else can?

Finally, I know it isn't what you asked for, but top tip for improving your writing skill mechanics would be to get a hold of the Chicago Manual of Style and the Oxford Modern English Grammar, print off a bunch of random fics, and go through them with a red-tip pen. Your paper will bleed and your mind will sharpen.
