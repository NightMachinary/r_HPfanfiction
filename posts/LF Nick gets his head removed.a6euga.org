I've been reading linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic) and there's a recurring joke about trying to cut off Nick's head. Are there any fics where they succeed?


** "Well.../technically/, your head is now completely separated from your body. Your ghost body, I mean."\\
Formerly-Nearly-Headless-Nick just fixed a blushing Harry with a stern glare, his detached arms crossing each other, one of his separated feet making a tapping-against-the-floor motion. Whatever snarky comment the ghost wanted to make would have to remain unheard, seeing as the bottom half of his head was missing. Along with his chest, his torso, his pelvis, and 80% of his legs.\\
"I would like to propose that Harry Potter never again be allowed to build a Ghost-Decapitating Device without competent supervision." Neville announced into the silence.\\
"Can we still call him Nearly-Headless-Nick? He's still...nearly headless, in a different sense." Hermione asked.\\
"A better question would be, is he one ghost now, or five?" Ron added.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr
