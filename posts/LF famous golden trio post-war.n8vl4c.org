I always found so weird that after the war, only Harry was given the “celebrity/famous” status. Like Ron and Hermione were super important too. The 3 are the “golden trio” for a reason, in the end, they were the one who brought Voldemort down. So any fic that plays with the idea would be great!!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]]: The Trio are playing hardball with reactionary elements in the Wizengamot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: This is a more AU fic in which the Trio won through a far more militaristic and ruthless campaign. Consequently, they continue their hard hitting way after Voldemort fell.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247?view_adult=true][The Sum of Their Parts]]: The Trio declares war on the Wizarding Britain's incorrigible establishment, and is receiving tremendous popular support.

--------------

In addition, I want to see fics in which Molly Weasley, slayer of Voldemort's second in command in single combat, gets more recognition and also takes a more proactive role. In most postwar fics however, she's basically reduced to a non functional crying house witch.

I'm actually quite pissed at this depiction of this rather strong and hot tempered woman. She would not take Fred's death passively, but would use her newly gained fame to push for some serious revenge!
