I've already read Black Bond, Unknowns, and a few other fics that fit my req I can dig up if anyone is interested.

I'd prefer if they actually got together at some point during the fic, I'm mostly wanting the romance. I can deal with slow burn provided it isn't too angsty, and it's written already. I'd also prefer longer stuff, but not 1m+ words (/cough/Black Bond/cough/)

Also if I read one more damned fic where Harry's love interest has a thing for Cedric Diggory I'm going to blow a gasket.

That said, I'm looking for anything HP/OC so hit me with it all.

Edit: Ooh, bonus points if the OC is really unique somehow. Like linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) where the of in question is a vampire or linkffn(Eclipse Of The Sky, by Firefawn) where she's basically a magical mutant.


** I know of a few Harry/OC-Black fics, but haven't actually read any of them.

*** I've already read Black's Daughter, was okay.

Have not read Whenever you need me, that looks quite good. Thanks for that rec.

I've been avoiding I Believe You, because the summary kinda turns me off of it. I might give it a shot, though.

Diary Of An Orphan also looks pretty good.

I've been avoiding Potter And Black primarily because of the length and the fact that it's unfinished and the romance only starts in the last book(I am assuming this from summaries, though so if anyone knows otherwise feel free to correct me), which isn't even finished.

Thanks for the recs! I appreciate it.

**** The romance starts a bit earlier, round 5 fifth, they have their first night in sixth and then it gets put on hold till halfway seventh. Eighth they get back together for a couple of reasons.

To be honest, its a fucking massive canon rehash that if I had a choice, I'd go back and stop myself from reading. There's absolutely no difference at all from canon, except who's tortured by Bellatrix in the seventh book. That's it.

Oh and the usual "I hate you, your father killed my parents" shaneningans during third book. Quite similar to Black Bond during their first Christmass (if I'm remembering correctly.)

I didn't even realize it went past book 5. That's the most recently updated one so I assumed that was all that was written so far.

Thanks for mentioning that it's a canon rehash. I really dislike those. To a point, it's fine. But if every scene is exactly the same with a new character slipped in, I'm not interested.

I'm fine with that.. trope? I guess it's a trope. It's a pretty reasonable reaction, imo, so it doesn't bother me so long as it's not extremely drawn out.

Thanks for the info, I most likely won't bother reading it now.

****** The only parts that aren't a rehash are Arabella's past and her mother's (together with the backstory of Moody and his 2 friends) which are covered, I think, in book 6 and 7. Book 8 is quite nice actually, Harry and Ara are expecting a baby and are looking to buy/build a house(they had sex in Bill and Fleur's cottage during the seventh book, after they rescue her from Malfoy's Manor, from when she was captured during the raid in Xeno's Rookery) So that's all new. Aside from that, yeah, its quite boring. I mostly skimmed after book 4, when it got clear to me it would never stop being a rehash.

The reason I mentioned the "I hate you, your father killed my parents" was because I think about 90% of all "Sirus' Daughter" fics I've read, this always happens. And its usually the same dialogues, even if the writters are different.

For me, the only one I could stomach was from Black Bond, because they were way younger than usual, so makes a bit more sense. Though, I'd say that Black Bond made me hate any love interest of Harry's to have a relationship with Cedric. The angst is too much for me, without any sort of necessity to be there. Specially Acquila's refusal to accept the bond. It annoys the ever-living shit out of me, but I love her and her personality, and Sirius' has the most character dev. I've ever seen in BB, and the most relatable. Sadly, its either abandoned or in a huge massive hiatus.

There's only so many ways you can write that conversation, and it's gonna go in the same basic paths. Either way, it's a pretty small part of the fic usually so even if I do find it annoying I can just keep reading through it.

I fuckin despise Cedric as 'the other guy' in fics. It's so common in HP/OC fics, and I'm /so/ sick of it. I didn't even dislike the character at first, but he just plays more or less the same role in every fic I've read recently.

And yeah- that aspect of Black Bond bugged me enough that I didn't even finish it. Like, I sort of understand. Rejecting the bond (or trying to, rather.) fits her character reasonably well, but that doesn't make it less frustrating. Especially when the whole thing ends unresolved.

Could I just pick it up at book 5-6, and just read from there? I might be more inclined to read it, then. I'm not concerned with the overall plot being a total rehash if there's at least some fluff and romance added in. You don't really get that with the lower years, which is sort of my problem.

Same. Exact. Reaction.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, if you want I can give you a background on Ara, even though its been close to a year now that I've read it, I, for some reason, still remember the story quite clearly.

So, Arabella's mum didn't end up marrying Sirius, but they had a kid, obviously. When Sirius was thrown in Azkaban, even though she didn't believe he was guilty, she couldn't/wouldn't do anything about it. In this AU, the Lestrange's and Crouch Jr. weren't arested after their torture of the Longbottom's, so when Ara was about 3 or 4 yo, they broke in to Ara's house and tortured both her and her mother(don't remember the name of her mother), Bella being the most sadistic little fuck as possible, slicing Ara's arms with a knife, enough to make it look like a crisscross pattern of scars, and Crucio's like its candy. Bella ended up killing Ara's mum in front of her and then Alastor (really good friend of Arabella's mother, who was a spy/DE/Auror/Order member) finally came and arrested Bella-psycho.

Remus is the one that ends up raising Arabella, simply because he was in love with Arabella's aunt (also name Arabella, if I'm not mistaken, and really similar in appearance) and was best friends with both Sirius (before he "knew" he was the traitor) and Arabellas's mum.

Flash-forward, every time Arabella has a nightmare about that day, her scars bleed, and she's (quite understandably) traumatised by being called Bella by anyone (notice that I've never once referenced her by Bella).

Alastor was the mentor of Arabella's mum and best friends with her grandparents, (they went to school together) and was a bit against (as was Sirius and Remus) her becoming a DE to spy for the Order. There's also a fic with the background of Moody and his friends.

Is there anything else I missed or you need ?
