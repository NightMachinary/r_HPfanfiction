With a serious tone to it, not crack y and without slash.


** Isn't Voldemort already the magical equivalent of Orochimaru?

- Obsessed with immortality.

- Has a thing for snakes.

- Unhealthily fixated on a single pubescent boy.

In fact, now that I think about it, both left a piece of themselves in Harry and Sasuke. From the Naruto Wiki: "In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind." So the Cursed Seal of Heaven is like a Horcrux.

My god, they're basically the same person.

  There are some things the human race is not meant to know. Harry didn't care instead, he made it his life's purpose to learn them. Oneshot
