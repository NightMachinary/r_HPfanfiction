Are there any Fics that feature the founders, or in which they play a major role?


** I think linkffn(4610832) is the best Founder's fic, and by a large margin. That's not so much singing its praises, as it is there being a large lack of stories for this era.

  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.

** The entire Dangerverse series by whydoyouneedtoknow is complete and has a very heavy involvement by the founders.
