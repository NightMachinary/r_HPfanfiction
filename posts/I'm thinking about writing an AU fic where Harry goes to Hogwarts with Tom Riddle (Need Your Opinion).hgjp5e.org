I know, I know, there are countless of fanfics that have the same premise. However, I'm going to make things a little different.

On the one hand, I'm making Harry a genius, so there will be a rivalry between him and Tom. (OOC Harry, I guess)

But academically speaking Harry, in the end, will be slightly better than Tom, and that will frustrate him. This leading to Tom being obsessed with being better than Harry (but never being able to).

Harry, on the other hand, will think of Tom as mediocre, just as the rest of his classmates. I'm not sure if this fic will be slash. What I know for sure is that Tom will eventually "fall in love" (or rather, will become super obsessed) with Harry, but I'm thinking that Tom's feelings will be one-sided.

So, what do you think? Would you read a fic with this premise? Is it too clichÃ©?


** Dumbledore described Tom Riddle as one of the most talented students in Hogwarts' history, and as an adult, "the most dangerous dark wizard of all time." Making Harry significantly better than him sounds like a boring, OP Harry. Being a 'genius' isn't enough for Harry to be enough ahead of one of the most powerful wizards in history to see him as 'mediocre'.

*** Not significantly better. Just a little bit, enough to achieve better marks than him, but not like too much.

** Yes, too cliched.

However, you can have Diary Riddle merge with Ginny and become a new player.

On Harry's end, you can have his scarcrux merge with him and give him a power boost.

Together they make things happen.

*** I wanted to write a fic where Diary Riddle merged with Ginny and became an entirely new person, it's not tom because Ginny's soul knows what love is, and understands it, but it's not Ginny either...idk it was a fun idea though when i was brain storming it

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** Sounds like OOC Harry not just in intelligence but also character - I don't see him being so dismissive of his classmates abilities (remember the DA? He doesn't really think he's special, even when he has genuine grounds to think so). I also believe he'd take notice of someone as talented as Tom, who Dumbledore said was 'probably the most brilliant student' Hogwarts had ever seen. Also, I'm not sure where his reckless/investigative streaks are, or his temper.

Maybe you can make Harry better intuitively, but Tom better understands theory and knows more spells? And Harry is held back by his adventurous and less studious nature so they are more evenly matched. Tom would still be obsessed because he can't stand the thought of someone being as good as him, and because he knows Harry could be better than him if he wanted to.

** Wouldn't have Riddle fall in love with him but an obsession kind of similar to the one joker has with batmanwould be awesome. Its really just not his character if its actual love. Just make sure to make Harry a ravenclaw so he can beat Slytherin in the house cup too lol

** I've read multiple fics with a similar premise. Harry genius. Tom genius. Tom creates his knights of walpurgis group. Harry ignores their power. Around fifth year Harry slips up and Tom notices his power. Chaos ensues.

** I think it would be more interesting if they were more equal, but Harry's side comes more from luck? So Tom is more charismatic, but perhaps Harry has his feats of heroism saving others from bullies or whatever plot you have. And then perhaps Tom is the perfect student, but Harry throws caution to the wind and puts too much power in all his spells making him look better. So he's not just a better Tom, because Tom is very powerful and smart, but Harry in canon put in a different time period I think would aggravate Tom to no end.

*** The thing is, I have already read this in a lot of fics. I don't know, it's just that Tom is always better, more smart, powerful, etc. while Harry is the typical Gryffindor. And somehow, Tom always 'falls in love' with him.

And I really don't understand that. I'm sure that if Tom had to feel something akin to 'love', he would only recognise somebody who is as perfect as him or even more. Is it preposterous to think that Tom is narcissistic? ðŸ¤” I don't know, but I would assume so.
