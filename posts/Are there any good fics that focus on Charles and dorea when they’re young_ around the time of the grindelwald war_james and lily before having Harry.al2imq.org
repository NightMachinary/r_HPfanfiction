*** But this a (relatively) newer development and there is a lot of fannon where they were his parents. Especially when the Black family tree was new. I'll be back with a rec, but I can't link from this computer so I'll have to do it when I get home.

** */Honour thy Blood/*, by /TheBlack'sResurgence/

This story creates a lot of family backstory for both the Potters and Blacks, focusing on Harry's Grandparents' generation. Lots of flashbacks to Charlus Potter and Dorea Black and how they got together.

It is still, ultimately, a Harry Potter story. But "growing up to be like his Grandfather Charlus" really becomes Harry focus and inspiration in this fic.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Sorry this took so long, I've been having tech issues. I've reread this even though it is incomplete so that means I like it a lot!

Edit: Doh, I just realized that (obviously) this focuses on the Weasley's but it might interest you because it is the time period and Charles is mentioned as is Dorea.

  In Canon, Septimus Weasley and Cedrella Weasley nee Black were either dead or played no real part in events.What if they had? What if they had made different choices, made different stands? What if they stood between the Light and the Dark and did everything in their power to see the Dark defeated? What would have changed?This is that story. A story of a man and a woman from completely different sides of the fence politically and socially. A man and a woman who joined forces and changed the fate of the Wizarding world in general - and of more than one person in particular.
