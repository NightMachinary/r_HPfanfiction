Be it a secret department of the Vatican which hunts down magicals, or a shadow war between the ICW and a muggle organisation trying to crack open the statute of secrecy. I'd prefer fics in the Harry Potter timeframe, but I know that some exist set in the seventeenth century too.


** Unless these Muggles had special powers, I fail to see how they could possibly be of a threat to HP wizards who could resort to following actions:

- Imperius or memory charm leaders of these organizations
- Send Dementors to assassinate their members
- Set Muggle governments to go after them
- Imperius Muggles go after them, for example Imperiused suicide bombers

*** Yea it just doesn't work with the HP magic capabilities, especially since they can repel Muggles or else hide from them in numerous, protected ways. Outside of initial surprise from gunfire or bombs, it's an uneven fight.

Hold on... Templars and Seekers (/especially/ Seekers) would stand a damn fine chance in this. They can dispel magic and, in case of Seekers, can't be influenced by mind control abilities anyway.

*** Hmm...I wonder...what if you had a story where a dementor attack was caught on camera?

They're invisible to normal light, of course, only witches and wizards can see them (whether other magical creatures can, I'm not sure). But they have an extremely blatant effect of freezing up the nearby surroundings, messing with the weather and putting out the lights.

So, what if one were caught on a thermal-imaging camera? A vaguely humanoid cold spot that's seen swooping towards several people in turn, leaving them in a seemingly-incurable vegetative state? Or, if they disrupt electronics (like Hogwarts supposedly does), that would be suspicious in itself, a sudden unusual winter storm followed by all electronics going static-y and gutting out.

Imagine it; a livestreaming hitchhiker, talking to his YouTube fans as he goes, when the weather unexpectedly goes cold, clouds come from nowhere to block out the skies, nearby plants start wilting and little puddles left over from the rain turn to ice.

The hitchhiker guy starts to tremble, right as the livestream starts to turn to static. Confusion follows for the viewing audience; some are worried, some think it's a prank, the hiker's family tries desperately to ring him. Search parties are eventually sent out to his last known position, and there they find him, in a cold, vegetative state.

He's immediately taken for medical care, but the doctors can't find what's wrong; no evidence of external, or internal injuries, can explain why he won't wake up. Their only option is to go back to where he was found and follow the trail of ice and wilted plants, in hopes of perhaps finding the cause...

**** That's a movie only affect. In the books, at most they're shown to snuff out the visibility of local light sources, including starlight. But even in the movies, there's not so much a cold spot as there is just a 360 degree frost effect. I still think the Muggles would fail to find anything. They're invisible and if they go to an Unplottable or otherwise magically hidden location, they won't find it.

*** I guess either they do have some kind of weapon to even the playing field, the witch hunters aren't entirely human, or they have ingenuity in spades.

Ideas on your points:

- complex verification measures and hidden archives to combat memory/imperious
- stick to crowded areas to use statute against the wizards (they can hardly release dementors in the middle of a crowded city) or employ secrecy - if they don't know who to kill, they can't.
- turning muggle governments is interesting, but how would they do this without further endangering the statute?
- I think defences against this are covered by the first few, and the use of heightened security/long range weapons and/or communication.

  complex verification measures and hidden archives to combat memory/imperious
#+end_quote

These are already present in a world with no (one hopes) hidden magical threat. Accountability and record-keeping have been an ongoing thing from the year dot, rising to their current committees-for-everything and audit-trails-everywhere level as absolutism and dictatorship died out.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Modern government in developed countries is sufficiently non-autocratic and distributed that your hypothetical wizard wouldn't just have to enthrall the decision-maker, but all of his colleagues and everyone they're accountable to /and/ cover up the paper trail and hide everything from the internal audit department to boot. It'd be a full-time job for a whole team of wizards per each government department they wanted control of and at least a few watchers in the departments they /didn't/ want control of. And every point of interaction is a potential mistake that blows the statute and makes future control harder by reason of everyone being on their guard...

These would have absolutely no effect at combating Imperius. One can simply compel the victim to perform normally to fool such procedures.

...But Muggles can't see Dementors. Voldemort literally released them into London and no one had any inkling it was anything supernatural.

Simply turn the appropriate people into sleeper agents via Imperius. I don't know why this would endanger the SoS at all.

***** I feel like if I was a bit cleverer I would be able to think up an imperius-proof verification scheme. And I had a complete mind blank over dementors being invisible to muggles until you reminded me. I've never thought of dementors as being good at assassination, though - I don't think they would be very good at taking down specific targets.

****** I can't really think how you'd ever verify the Imperius. That's why the Death Eaters used that excuse, because the victims who succumb to it will act normally to onlookers. As for Dementors not being good at finding targets. Well, they didn't seem to have trouble tracking down Harry in Little Whinging on Umbridge's order!

**** How's this:

Hunters were created by Wizards themselves to kill their enemies. Hunters were made by ripping half of a wizards magic out (this kills the wizard) and placing it within the belly of a pregnant muggle. The half-magic that was removed is completely defensive in nature. The child that is born is anti-magical.

What the wizards of old did not know is that this counter magic was also self-preserving. When a Hunter dies a new Hunter is born somewhere else. Many of them do not know they have this anti-power within them but there are always X number of Hunters in the world.

Wizards themselves have an odd relationship with Hunters.

In Africa they are considered to be a more useful Squib and usually inducted into the magical world and raised for various things from farming dangerous magical plants that they are immune too to taking care of magic creatures that just do not affect them.

In Europe they are killed on discovery. This creates a common situation where young Hunters start becoming aware of magic that affects crowds but not them. They survive one or more attempts on their life and learn to avoid wizards. Hunter groups will investigate and often find these people and invite them to join their militia. Thus the wizards own actions perpetuate an on-going militarization of people who are immune to magic.

Transfiguration is the primary method of killing a Hunter, usually by making a golem that hits them over the head with non-magical objects laying around. Basically make a golem from the asphalt of a road and have it brain them with a street lamp or throw a dumpster at them.

*** Or the muggles are actually just squibs who has a vendetta for magicals. They have the knowledge of magic. They can probably throw off an imperius and know the signs of someone who is imperius because of that knowledge. They can blend in with muggles and while they can't see Dementors they know enough to recognize the signs if one is near.

** Not quite what you seem to be looking for, but, consider checking out With Strength of Steel Wings. It has a private group of muggles who are somewhat aware of he wizarding world and are up to some fairly devious shit. Don't want to say more and give too much away. All in all an excellent read

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]]

You could also try the firebird trilogy, again, certain muggles are aware of wizards and get up to devious shit

** I agree that without magic of their own, muggle witch hunters won't be a threat to wizards. If they get bothersome, the Minister of Magic informs the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has the "religious, delusional fanatics" taken care of by the police.

I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy", a crossover with Buffy, where the Watcher's Council hunts some dark wizards and witches (and is quite feared among the general population of Wizarding Britain) but they recruit muggleborn witches and wizards, and their reputation is at least partially based on a bluff. And, as mentioned, they hunt dark wizards once they attack muggles, not all wizards.

** A way you could deal with some of the problems inherent with this idea is make an AU where some people are born (even if non-magical) completely immune or resistant to mind-altering affects. Maybe this witch-hunter organization is really big on tracking down and recruiting them as memebers and they act as a sort of elite assassin. It wohld be a cool idea. Someone should write it.
