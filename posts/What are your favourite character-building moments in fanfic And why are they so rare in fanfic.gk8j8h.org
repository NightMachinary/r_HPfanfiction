What are your favorite moments in fanfic, which builds -- and/or establishes -- a character/set of character?

For example, Harry has to decide if he wants to: a) stop the main antagonist, b) save a random family from being killed. Said main antagonist has been his no.1 priority for years -- if he doesn't pursue them NOW, he might lose the chance for years, i.e. consequences.

It doesn't even have to be life-or-death; e.g. Ron barters with a shopkeeper -- this shows off his bartering skills, his knowledge of wizarding economy etc.

Question: And why are such moments rare in fanfic? Especially in an AU, you need to establish characters and build them up. Give readers some reasons to understand and care.


** I don't think they're rare in fanfic, per se. I just think well-crafted stories in general are relatively rare in fanfic.

** It's rare for me to see characters/protagonists who make a mistake or huge fuck up every chapter, and learn from them (slowly, usually) afterwards.

It's rare for me to see characters who make real life sense. Who don't suddenly do the right thing even though everything they've been raised to do is against that and there's no big thing pushing it.

It's rare for me to find Dark! characters who are not dark just for drama and angst.

It's rare for a writer to instead of relying on just the connections and attachments from cannon to actually write a character.

I'm fed up of seeing carbon cutouts, rather than actual people. That might actually be stupid, because that's the reason that most people read/write fanfiction. But that doesn't matter, because I'm going by my own reasons, and noone elses!

** My favourite was in chapter one of my fanfiction. Where Dudley has finally seen the wrong in his ways in the summer after the Goblet of Fire, because he met a girl of all things. It's the embodiment of all things opposite to him. He fell in love with a girl and it changed him, he wants to do better because of it and he stands up for his cousin. Not Harry, his cousin, when Dudley's father seeks to belittle him.

He gains the courage to do so because of a girl of all people.

Harry is bewildered but learns why when they're hanging out one evening in the town nearby Little Whinging. It was brought to a local cafe, and Dudley surprises him by introducing him to the waitress, Ava, his girlfriend. Who was surprisingly a Scottish lady, which Harry was able to understand when her accent got heavy momentarily, thanks to Seamus being his roommate for years.

They bond over the early parts of the summer, celebrating Dudley's birthday even. It's one of the weirdest things for Harry because it was such a pleasant surprise since he's dealing with PTSD and Depression following the death of Cedric. Dudley becomes one of Harry's greatest aids in dealing with his trauma.

**** Thick accents are easier to decipher when you're used to it. Irish, Scottish, Japanese, any. A sort of training for your ears. Take it from a guy who has lived in all the lands that touch the Pacific Ocean.

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

  Bad things happen to good people, it's a fact of life. We can either grow strong from it or be crushed by it's weight. Watch as Luna and her sisters handle the weight of losing their brother. But is he lost for good or is there hope for the future? Only time will tell.
