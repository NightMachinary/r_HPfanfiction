As the title suggest.


** The two famous complete series are NoahPhantom's Albus Potter - linkffn(8417562) for first book - and Venkin87's Albus Potter seriers - linkffn(4380964). Both series are written in the same style as Harry Potter and both have seven complete books. The first one takes it one step further and explores cosmic magic and stuff like that, while the second is a little more like Harry Potter style with no significant world building contribution except for the after-war effects but it's also a feel-good story with no grand plots or anything (the main antagonist is the typical cartoonish villain who wants to rule the world through fear). Both are really well written though

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** The two best ones (one of them is a trilogy) that I've come across over the 10 ish years that I have read next-gen centric fics are Ignite (and Starfall & Oblivion that succeed it) by Slide linkffn(8255131), as well as Clash by shezwriter linkffn(12383732).

Note that Ignite is more of a POV fic with Albus as one of the main characters, and Clash is a for the most part dual-perspective fic. Clash is an acquired taste though, for reasons that you can surmise quite early on in the fic (not the writing though, I can assure you that the writing is excellent - not quite Ignite level, perhaps). Ignite, on the other hand, presents its readers one of the best writings - both in terms of plot and of the linguistic commands that Slide has - that I have ever seen amongst the hundreds of fanfictions that I have read over the years.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself? (on haitus)
