Are there any fics like make a wish by Rorschach's blot where instead of everything being a coincidence or accident harry actually does all the awesome badass stuff?


** Linkffn(Where in the world is Harry potter? by nonjon) is similar, though the accounts are more secondhand.

*** Thanks. Have read this already Though. Was looking for something more firsthand. Where harry doesn't tell any of his friends and they find out by themselves when harry does something awesome while saving them and his secret gets out

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149140/1/Best-Served-Cold]]) was the closest thing I found to Harry just being an op badass doing wacky things.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!
