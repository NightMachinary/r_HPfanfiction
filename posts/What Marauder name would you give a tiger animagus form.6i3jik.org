** Just Stripes. Has the nice ambiguity that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs have.

*** Yea, I like the sound of Stripes. It's simple and doesn't sound like it's trying to be cool or convey anything except what it is. Those are important qualities to have in a nickname, an alias is only useful if people can't see through it and it doesn't draw attention. John Doe is a much subtler name than Janus Doerian.

**** Great minds think alike.

Of course, mediocre ones do too, so I'm not sure if it's a ringing endorsement or not.

** Whiskers.

Any Marauder name is given by the others, not chosen by the individual, and the name would be mocking at some level or it wouldn't be fair.

*** "So, my Auror partner, you're telling me we're hunting a /cat/?"

"Apparently it's some kneazle breed - tricky, clever thing. Almost as smart as a wizard, I was told."

"Dispatch said it's called /Mr. Whiskers./ How smart could it be? By the way, where did the tip come from?"

"James Potter, one of the trainees. Moody seemed more insistent than usual with his constant vigilance when he heard that name."

"Whatever. We'll bag the cat and deliver it to Macnair for declawing. Hey, kitty kitty..."

"There! I saw the tip of the tail!"

/"Lumos./ Now, where did the furball go..."

ROARRRRR

/"Holyshittiger!"/ --crack!--

"Wait for meeeeee!" --crack!--

--swoosh--

"I do believe that went swimmingly, Mr. Prongs."

"Indeed, Mr. Whiskers."

*** Yep, I would choose Stripes if I could do so for myself. But for others?? Whiskers is the way to go!

** Raspy.

The Animagus Marauders had a name about a body feature, and they're all 'goofy' names. Not trying to be cool, awesome, or edgy. Since a tiger has a really rough tongue, like a steel rasp, have a nickname based on the tongue.

If the animagus in question is Lily, then that leads to a hilarious dynamic with James being a deer.
