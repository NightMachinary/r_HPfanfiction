Kind of like how we age alcohol, with The goal of temporarily sealing away the magic being to smooth the rougher/harsh parts of the persons magic while adding and strengthening characteristics and Quality's\\
they want and The longer the magic is sealed, (for want of a better term) the smoother their magic gets.

So for *example* if someone like Voldemort were to do the Ritual he would use a Basilisk Venom as the main magical Reagent and the killing cures to power the sealing. sealing away his ability to use the Killing curse but when the Sealing ends his Killing curse is much more powerful and his magic is just all round more powerful and deadly.

Dumbledore would use Phoenix tears, ash or a feather as his magical Reagent and power it with either a powerful Transfiguration spell, Fidelius Charm, Partonus charm or Phoenix Song.

A potions master could Liquid luck or veritaserum as their magical Reagent.( I imagen Snape would use veritaserum as his Reagent and Legilimency to power it making his Legilimency more powerful and better at seeking out and finding the Truth when he uses Legilimency or magic in general, Slughorn would use Liquid luck don't know what spell he would use though, maybe he would seal away the way a potions magic interacts with the potion they are making to give him a weaker version of what Liquid luck give when brewing potions).

I imagen there would be three main things that would effect it the magical Reagent/s, the spell, Branch of magic that is used to power the seal and that the person cant use while the Seal is in effect and the Time that the seal lasts..

That got Pretty long and maybe I should making it a Discussion about what different wizards in canon would use? and what effect it would have?


** In Linkffn(7092871)A Wizard in Gotham Harry seals a large part of his magic away for a year to strengthen it but the story hasn't been updated since 2012.

*** I mean more like Distilling their magic the way we Distilling alcohol or aging it like we do with alcohol.

The weighted clothing analogy dosent really work becaue they Can take the weighted clothing off anytime they want. were as I see the Sealed magic, spell or Branch of magic being locked away from the person for a fixed period of time that is decided when they do the Riutal. Like if you seal away a Spell for 10 years there is no way at all to gain access to that spell for those Ten years you just have to wait it out.
