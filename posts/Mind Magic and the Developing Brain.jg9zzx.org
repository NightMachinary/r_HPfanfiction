:FlairText: Discussion / What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic I read a while back (and could use some help re-finding) that had it be standard Ministry practice to Obliviate pre-Hogwarts-age Muggleborn children and their families when responding to incidents of accidental magic. Unfortunately, possibly due to the children's own magic or maybe just the nature of the spell, these erasures/alterations weren't always perfect, leaving the children with an unconscious awareness that they'd lost memories. The fic used this to explain Hermione's voracious hunt for knowledge (futilely trying to re-find whatever it is she /knows/ she's lost) and Colin Creevey's constant photography (keeping a record of things, in case he's made to /forget/ again). One could even suggest that something similar led to a young Tom Riddle keeping a diary...

Thinking of all of this today had me wondering: What other cases could there be of mind magic having unintended consequences when used on a child's still-developing brain? Could some of the behaviors, eccentricities, stupidity, and/or insanity we see from wizarding-raised wizards and witches be due to spells cast upon them when their brains were still young and much more malleable?

For example, what if Ron Weasley was originally a very fussy eater as a baby? Perhaps Molly was stressed and exhausted from dealing with his older brothers (including twin toddler terrors), and frustrated and worried because her newest child just would. not. eat. Maybe she cast a mild compulsion spell or Confundus Charm or the like to encourage him a bit. Couple how plastic the brains of young children are with how susceptible we see Ron being to mind magic in GoF...


** I can't help but feel that the usual fanon version of occlumency would be bad for the emotional development of a child and that people shouldn't start learning it until they're a bit older. If they do learn it too young risk becoming sociopathic because they suppressed their emotions instead of developing and learning to deal with them.

*** A while back I had the idea that maybe Occlumency is generally bad to keep running all the time because it defends the mind against anything that might affect it, /including new information./ Like, you still learn new things, but new information/ideas/events are unable to change your mind about anything. For example, it doesn't matter how obvious the signs of abuse are, you simply can't see the Potter brat as anything but the spoiled, arrogant, pampered little prince he is (just like his father) until you're literally dying and either can't keep your Occlumency up any more or just stop bothering to.

**** Op did you write another comment or post on this recently? Because someone did and I think it's a really valid idea and worth exploring.

Esp as Snape is in many ways still acting like a resentful teenager, and while trauma can do that too the occlumency is also worth exploring. Voldie and bumblebee are also quite unbending in their opinions and the way the choose to go about things, even they're both of a scholarly bent

Again it's not like old men are known for being flexible, but it could be explored that way.

But [[/u/thecowofalltime][u/thecowofalltime]]'s point is also interesting, esp as a lot of people write Tom riddle as being a natural Legilimens from birth, so if he was using it all the time since he was a kid...it is interesting.

And I mean I'm not an expert but apparently the empathy part if your brain is developed really early as a baby, and kids who aren't held or hugged as a newborn are effected in that department. But I think if a kid is reading others minds instead of doing empathy the way we muggles do, which is trying to see things from another's' perspective etc, I can see that part of the brain being underdeveloped. You don't need to put yourself in their shoes because a peek into their brain will tell you what they're thinking

Sorry this is so long, I just think it's interesting

***** I did post about the Occlumency thing a while back, yeah. Your ideas about Riddle and Legilimency are also interesting...

****** On a similar note I've been writing a fic where compulsions on muggles can have far more effect than the magical peeps realise. This plays out in Petunia Dursleys life after Dumbledore put a compulsion on his â€˜fuck off you're a muggle' reply to her letter as a kid and results in what I call The Loathing in the fic which is that she fears magic and being abnormal. I think it's really interesting to think about the way magic making things so convenient for magic society might not be as helpful or harmless as they thing or assume, because they never follow up

** Interesting thought.

Notice-me-not spells could have the effect of making people ignore anything they're not already interested in.

Glamor (or glamour) spells could cause body image problems.

I've seen a number of stories that have pureblood males ignoring personal hygiene. Perhaps that's the result of their mothers applying cleaning spells?

Maybe Mollie Weasley overused sonorous when her children were younger, and that's why she sends howlers.
