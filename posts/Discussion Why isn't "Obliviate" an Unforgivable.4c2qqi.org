The more fanfics I read the stranger it seems to me that many have such a careless attitude towards mind rape.

The implications of that spell are truly horrific: It permanently removes a part of your identity. It seems much worse to me than imperio (which harbors huge potential for abuse, but might even have some benign applications: why shouldn't Aurors imperio a Death Eater guard to let them inside for a raid?). Not to mention its effects are usually temporary... Obliviation is permanent, largely irreversible and has some truly devious applications (taking away free will without outright turning into a puppet).

When killing under the impetus you are no different from a gun or other deadly weapon, just an extension of the actual perpetrator. Obliviation can make you believe you are doing the right/necessary thing through careful manipulation.

Are there any good fics that explore the (sick) consequences of cleverly abusing the potential of mind magic (obliviation, legilimency, imperio...)


** Easy answer: because it's a charm not a curse.

Even easier answer: because the Unforgiveables are an arbitrary set of unconnected illegal curses and not necessary the worst dark magic possible. See: horcruxes.

More complex speculative answer: wizards know the soul exists. We don't know much about what souls are in the context of HP, but traditionally they constitute your essential identity/self. That means that unlike most Muggles, wizards will not consider their minds to constitute their sense of self. They have a spirit which contains their essential nature/character/self and that spirit has primacy over body and mind.

This may go some way to explaining the cavalier approach wizards have to mind altering magic of all kinds, not just obliviation. It also explains why horcruxes are considered so horrific, even though to a Muggle it would seem that making one is no worse than killing someone in any other manner.

It also explains why wizards do not consider the Dementor's kiss to be death, contra LessWrong et al. The Dementor's kiss takes your soul, but not your body /or mind/.

*** Yeah, exactly. If you kill with incendio, burning a person alive is way worse than the instant painless killing curse. However you can argue in court you didn't mean to kill. If you cast Avada Kedavra there is no defense, you meant to kill them or you couldn't have cast the spell. Thus, unforgivable.

*** heh, to expand on that - their modern world (Statute of Secrecy, and resulting Ministry of Magic) is based entirely on the concept of secrecy. This means departments largely if no solely formed to obliviate any muggles and reverse the signs. I have the least problem with that use however. Ex.

- Ministry Wizards wiped the camp officials memory many many times (taking away memory, without further harm- gets paid/not taken advantage of)

However other uses I've had trouble accepting, which the good guys see no issue with (or very little with general mind magics.)

- Even Hermione who doesn't want Ron to confund the driving instructor zapped her parents. (Taking away free will)

- Even Dumbledore whose wisdom says choices matter, they are what makes you etc. confunds and gives alcohol to Mrs. Cole. (taking away sound judgement)

- Love potions sold by good guy shops like Weasleys iirc (.... do you want Voldemort, because this is how we got Voldemort)

- Possibly maybe my own theory.... the Ministry does experiments on the mind akin to what would be considered a mad scientist without much compunction. (I took the brains to be wizards)

So I still have trouble understanding or accepting it, but Taure must be right. In contrast to my last point the experimenting on the soul is considered the worst of crimes or the worst punishment for crimes. So wizards simply don't think the mind is sacred and value it a good deal less. For me I just try not to think about it because otherwise I have trouble seeing the good guys in a good light.

**** I don't think Hermione is a great example here. She altered her parents' minds for their safety, and I'm sure it took an intense emotional and mental toll on her to do it, and destroy her relationship with them. I don't think you can write off this incident as her not having an issue with it/very little issue. Knowing how cruel Voldemort and his followers are, what else was she supposed to do to protect them for an unknown amount of time from an unknown distance? She's a very logical person, and I'm sure she thought out every option and the consequences of each.

***** That's fair, it doesn't fall under 'very little' issue. However no matter how much she struggled with it the ends do not justify the means.

I'm reminded of the Gandalf quote about "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."

Voldemort and Death Eaters are absolute scum who have absolutely no redeeming features. They deserve to die. But Harry wouldn't be Harry if he killed them or if he killed Voldemort, nor would Dumbledore be the wise mentor. And Dumbledore makes it clear that it is our choices that define us.

Yet we see the removal of free will, of identity, of life experiences, of removing pieces disallowing informed thought. These are truly heinous ideas if they were abused in our society. To me if Voldemort manipulated Pettigrew through solely fear and despair to be his spy then that is morally superior to altering his desire through other means: Imperius, Obliviate, Emotion inducing potions etc.

Hermione does choose to use obliviate and whether through spell or potion induces them to leave their home, country, friends, and family. It is not put in a bad light the way other evils are. It might have been tough, but SHE CHOSE. She chose to enforce her will for her parents over their will for themselves (every option must include talking with and failing to convince them to leave). Did it save their life?- quite possibly. Whatever the result, whatever her reasons that doesn't hold water against playing god over able minded persons. Reading it again Hermione doesn't have an issue with confunding itself, only using it to pass a drivers test (which is both cheating and potentially dangerous). This isn't to hate on Hermione but to show that wizards, including her, do things which are legal for them and yet would to us be a heinous crime either literally or morally.

** It's pretty simple. Let's look at the purposes of the spells.

1. Imperius - No purpose except to dominate the will of another.

2. Cruciatus - No purpose except to cause pain, terrible terrible pain, that can cause insanity. And none of that "it was made to cause the nerves to get excited to help bring people back from heart failure" crap either. Torture, plain and simple.

3. Killing Curse - Kills. That's it. No purpose other than death. Instant, (virtually) magically unblockable death.

These curses have no use for good when used on another sentient being, and the cruciatus has no good use period.

Obliviate? There is the oft mentioned "Ministry needs it because Statute of Secrecy," so I'm going to ignore that for another potentially useful area.

Therapy.

Obliviate could be used to remove memories people can't cope with. We don't know whether obliviation is permanent or not. We know that Lockhart can't get his memory back, but that was through a misfired wand. There are probably forms that are reversible, as seen with Hermione's parents. So obliviate or related charms can be used as a therapy tool to get people past traumatic memories.

** It depends on whom you ask, to be honest. An easy explanation is that it's because the government needs it to deal with some muggles, and also because it's a charm rather than a curse.

That being said, *my personal headcanon* is that the most powerful curses actually require one to---in addition to being powerful enough a wizard to control magic well enough to cast them---have intent or desires of a given kind when casting them and when there is no strong enough intent of that sort the curse becomes nothing more than a highly inefficient (not like it matters, since there aren't any “magical cores”) discharge of magical energy that can at most throw the target into a wall but won't do what the caster wanted them to; on that note, this is also why those curses can go through shields as rather than being bolts of magic they are bolt-sized torrents of it and a single shield is nowhere near enough to stop them, and why they explode non-human stuff they hit as that magic has to do /something/. And with the three unforgivables the intent required would be the intent to murder, torture, or enslave, respectively for Avada Kedavra, Cruciatus, and Imperius. If you go with that, then it's easy to see why a potentially bad spell that does not require any such feelings to be present would not be thought as vile as those.

** I always thought it was because the proof of the casting is in of itself proof of the motive, and in a perfect retributive justice system you don't discriminate against attempted crime and successful crime.

To cast imperio, a person has to want to totally dominate the victim with no regrets. To cast crucio, a person must want to totally want to torture the victim and enjoy it, not for any retributive reason but simply because they want to. AK, of course you have to want them to die with every fibre of your being.

I've always assumed obliviate is reversible, but even without this it can be cast with totally good intentions. Imperio doesn't really fit too well with this but perhaps the wizarding world in general doesn't see any reason to use Imperio except in war conditions, so its "unforgivable until made ok by Ministry xox"

Consider two attempted killings. Both shot at a man they wanted to murder and had perfect aim, but only were able to shoot once before being apprehended. One killed the man, the other failed because a bird flew in the way of the bullet. Would one get life the other 10 years? But that doesn't seem just, as they are both equally as guilty as the eachother.

That's why, in my opinion, the instant life sentences are justified. They are their own proof and require severe, intense motive.

Memory charms? They don't have a psychological effect on the caster, so they're not Unforgivable.
