** What can I say? It's far from perfect, but I'll do what I can to finish it (and, in time, my other stories too) without making it any worse than it currently is.

I think it'll really hit its stride when Harry regresses to a child-like state and falls in love with Legolas and his dreamy blond locks.

It is 100% irony, no trace of similar stupidity is in this fic. It is truly unfortunate that this post is necessary.

**** I presume it's because Legolas and Draco look similar in some people's eyes, and some people are really into Harry/Draco so they go for the closest substitute when it's not possible.

But it's really just a guess and honestly I haven't the foggiest.

*** You've probably heard this a million times already but I'm gonna say it to you (entirely) because I havnt said it to you myself. I love they way you turned potion making into something magical, rather than the step by step process it's shown to be in the canon It's been an absolute treat reading your fic and I can't wait for the next update.

*** Your LOTR crossovers are great.

But I'm wondering why you always have Harry going there alone.

**** This is a good question.

The reason, such as it is, is that I want to balance the two crossover elements in such a way that Harry is forced to immerse himself in the world. If Harry comes to the world with a companion, there is a very real problem where I would expect them to become completely reliant on each other for support. They would also be quite likely to keep the characters of Middle-earth at arms length. They'd also have less impetus to learn about how the world works, as with even two people they could likely become almost completely self-sufficient.

Basically, by bringing Harry in on his own, he is more likely to form deeper connections with the people of Middle-earth, and therefore have more incentive to get involved in the events of that world.

There is perhaps an interesting story in something like Harry and Dudley stranded in Middle-earth, but I'm not yet confident that I could maintain two main characters simultaneously, and well.

***** It's an interesting point. I usually feel that crossovers where only one character enters a new world and has to adapt are not as much crossovers, but more alternate universes/timelines of the universe entered. The more the character adapts and is immersed, the less it feels like a crossover where worlds and cultures meet and might clash.

****** See, I would say the opposite. I feel that while 'cultures meet and clash' has a great potential for exciting and enjoyable spectacle, it lacks depth. I think there is much more potential in exploring the similarities between worlds. While our circumstances may be different, we all are still human, we still desire the same things, we still love, we still fear, and we still die.

It is easy to be blinded by the the flashy stuff, especially in the case of the Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings is not about Aragorn; the great Lord of Men born to rule. It is not about Gandalf, the incarnate angel sent to guide the fates of Men. It is about Frodo, it is about Sam. The Lord of the Rings is, at its core, a story about the triumph of a 'small' person's bravery over all the great heriocs that go on around him. As great as Gandalf and Aragorn are, they would have achieved nought in their endeavors had Frodo annd Sam failed on their quest. And none of those 'Great' Men had the ability to do what Frodo did, despite being so small, and seemingly insignificant. 'You are only quite a little fellow in a wide world, after all.' Yet it is upon the shoulders of such little fellows that the world may turn.

It is about love, and not the romantic kind, either. It is love that kept Sam at Frodo's side through thick and thin. It is about their willingness to sacrifice their lives, without a second thought, if it would save their friends, and loved ones.

It is about the evil that is borne from fear, and hatred. It is about the need for courage, and the need to take a stand no matter how overwhelming the odds. It tells us not to fear death, for it is but the beginning of something even greater upon distant green shores.

Really, it teaches us exactly the same lessons as the Harry Potter books, and that is what I find so compelling about mixing the two settings. No matter how much the scenery may change, Man is still Man, and we should never let surface details cloud that.

But you're welcome to disagree.

******* I think you misunderstood my post, I try to be more clear:

When I read a crossover with a single HP character entering a new world, often it feels as if there's not much "Harry Potter" in the crossover. Some thoughts of how Hermione or Harry would deal with this, a few lines of thinking back to what their friends might do, but the new world tends to dominate the crossover - as is logical, if there's just one HP character but an entire world of other characters.

The more the character adapts, the less "HP flavor" I think there is. The character cannot talk to other characters who share their background. They cannot show their own world to others. Cannot take them there to visit. Often, it's either impossible or a bad idea for them to keep their clothes and general attitude/manners. They get assimilated (apart from those stories where the character takes over the new setting).

It just seems a bit unbalanced, if that's the right word.

As an example of a story where that doesn't happen, there's "Island of Fire". A bunch of students get displaced to the World of Temeraire, and they don't join the Dragon Rider Corps, they create their own island civilisation instead. They adapt, but it's still "HP meets Temeraire", not "A HP wizard in Temeraire's world".

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]

And there are the "Wizarding Britain meets (insert current TV Show)" stories, where two worlds adapt to each other (or try to).

It's not a "that's wrong and that's right", just an Observation on different styles of crossovers. I noticed that when I started reading a story where Hermione ends up reincarnated as a ninja. It's not a bad story, but there's not really much about HP in it.

**** My other (completed) Harry Potter/LotR story contains a fairly prominent romance element, though I'd like to think I never devolve into fluff.

My Harry Potter/Tomb Raider story (such as it is) may involve romance one day, but I'm leaning towards not; the setting really isn't all that conducive to it. Though Harry and Lara will be rather close, with everything they've been through.

I don't really write smut as part of larger stories, as I tend to feel it is often rather egregious. It wouldn't really serve much of a purpose within my stories, and so I have no real pressing need to include it.

I also shied away from any detailed discussion of torture in my story. I'm not really a 'shock' writer, and again it simply didn't feel like a graphic description was warranted.

Generally, my focus is on world and character building.

** It's one of the rare few crossovers where Harry actually explores the strange world he's dropped into, misunderstandings and all, rather than getting dropped into the middle of a completely alien country/planet/landscape/war/magical system and instantly win at everything.

You, Steelbadger, have earned my absolute jealousy in being able to actually write a believeable crossover without coming across as a shyster-a category I struggle to escape, though my recent endeavours should prove sufficient to overcome this barrier.

Thank you and godspeed with your writing. May you never face the dreaded blank page syndrome.

**** I posted my last one (an HP/PMMM cross) in 'The Random Craziness Files'. It's a decent intro to the fic I have in mind, but inspiration has somewhat petered out for it so its future incarnation is languishing within my brain's Development Hell. The others are ones I am working on before posting them as they're about as rough as a gravel road at the moment. When I do post them, though, they should be pretty fleshed out.

Check 'em out if you want.
