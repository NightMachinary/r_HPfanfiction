Also Harry puts a spell on Hermione (with her consent) protecting against anyone who tries to sexually assault her.

Not 100% sure about the magical soulmate but I'm fairly certain it was there.

From what I remember, it was very well written, but not actually very good, if you know what I mean. But a great guilty pleasure for powerful Harry lovers. It wasn't on ff.net, it was on another site.

Thanks!
