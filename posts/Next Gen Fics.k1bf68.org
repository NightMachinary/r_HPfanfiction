Can be het/slash/femslash/threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, any length, old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Would love to see a lot of family moments/Bantering, etc. But not mandatory.


** One of the best next-generation stories in my opinion is “Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox” linkao3(373224).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  In the end, they're all just parts of a whole. An exploration of the next generation.

** For balance between plot/characters/family I really like the Fabula Post Bellum series. For slightly more drama but a better story/writing/pretty much everything check out Slide's Stygian Trilogy, which is pretty much in a class of its own among next gen fics.

  CHAPTER 28 NOW UP! The academic year at Hogwarts reaches its end, but its closing weeks have left more questions than answers. Was the late-spring incident an unfortunate accident - or was it a sign of a darker agenda within Hogwarts's very walls?

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
