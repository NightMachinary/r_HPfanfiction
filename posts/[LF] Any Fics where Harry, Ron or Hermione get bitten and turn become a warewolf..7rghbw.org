My original idea included that Bellatrix Lestrange takes Hermione to Fenrir Greyback while he is in his wolfish form where Hermione is bitten before being rescued by Harry and Ron. This idea just seems, to me, to be something that Bellatrix would do. Have an somebody intentionally bitten.

The above are just my thoughts. Recommendations can include any of the three being bitten by any warewolf at any time/place.


** linkffn(8106168) comes to mind.

*** ...It doesn't look like the fanfiction bot is working. Again.

Anyway, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][you were trying to link to Weres Harry]]. In that story, Harry is bitten by a werewolf in the first chapter, but the curse conflicts with the Voldemort soul-shard in his skull. Both break down, and Harry is left with the ability to shapeshift to and from a wolfman form at will.

The story only skims over the first three years, which are fairly canon, but gets a bit more inventive with year 4, before steering a good distance away from canon in year 5. Sadly, it hasn't updated for years.
