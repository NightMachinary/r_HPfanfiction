#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** A little late to the party, but I'm sure linkffn(The Life And Times) fit the bill. Another one is linkffn(Rogue's Bet).

Glad to see someone else interested in this genre.
