Hey All, I'm searching for Any and all HP/Addams family Crossovers I can find. I've read Family Values by Ishtar (great fic. I was going to post alink, but it looks like it's been taken down? Well worth your time if you can find it, despite being unfinished.)

Anyone seen any others they'd recommend?


** Jeconais has a great series 'Perfect Slytherins', with Harry raised as Wednesday's sibling. First through third year are complete, fourth year gets occasional updates. I think they're only on his site: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/]]

Direct link to first story: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/]]

I think you need to register there to read.

The only other fic I read and enjoyed that is still available is this one:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8503064/1/Harry-Addams][Harry Addams]] It continues up to the sorting of second year, sadly hasn't been updated since 2013.

**** Oh, I have no doubt. Jeconais is one of my favourite fanfic authors for a reason (and Hogwarts Dawn is very much fun).

I just want to warn OP and any other new readers that Perfect Slytherins 4 is not complete yet and has no fixed update schedule.

*** I tried "Perfect Slytherins", and I found it preachy and bashy, complete with Super!Harry and doing very little interesting with it. As far as Slytherinness is concerned, they are about as "perfect" as Draco, but in a different way.

** Okay, this isn't a fic, but is really amusing. It's a series on youtube called [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7_LetEm-ez8YH4XGJPdSXgg1oTMZ0n5T][Adult Wednesday Addams]] Watch it if you want to be amused for a couple of minutes. It's great!

These next two are Addams only and not crossovers, but I liked them: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1629482]] The Bridal Path (Joel/Wednesday) by Vyola

*** This series is slash later on so be warned. Although the slash is not very visible at all. Its mostly just jokes between the characters.

*** Seconding this, and I am not into slash either, but it maintains the morbit humor of the Addams Family and integrates the two settings well. Definitely recommended.
