That other thread about SPEW put this idea into my head. So yeah, is there a fic that discusses the origins of House Elves position in society in this narrow sense? In this case, they'd devolve much like the Snow Elves did in their time under the Dwemer. Maybe thousands of years ago they were separate and distinct from humans, but some kind of catastrophe forced them into tying themselves to wizards. Eventually they became the frankly pathetic species we know and love. Honestly, I just find them so interesting. They're capable of wandless magic and can circumvent even the most powerful of wizards, yet they are looked upon like slaves.


** I'm pretty sure I once read a crackfit where they were revealed to have once been lotr style elves and harry magically reversed them and formed an army with them. I would love to read a serious one with this theme though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent Into Darkness]] explores a similar idea. It's an HP/LV fic with a sequel that seems to be dead.

Harry and Hermione translate an ancient book written in the elven language which he found in Slytherin's library. They find out that elves were apparently the dominant magical race on earth before wizards became common. House elves are the cursed descendants of elves who defied the elven high council. The rest of the elves apparently left earth to escape the prophesied end of the world.
