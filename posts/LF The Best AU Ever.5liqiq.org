What, in your opinion, is the best AU - be that an alternate sorting, a different time period, or something which completely differentiates itself from cannon?


** Some people give it to linkffn(The Skitterleap) or linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). While both are good, I disagree. For me, Skitterleap is enembee's least appealing fic (ignoring Sundog, which I haven't actually read) and I've only read the first 2/3s of PotDK because I stopped caring about /literally/ every character.

I break AUs into three categories: Divergent, Different but Similar and Full/True.

Divergent is fairly straightforward. Follows canon, but an event changes the path. The purest and best I'd say is linkffn(Forging The Sword), for it's nailing of canon characterizations, good magic and brilliance in details of the divergence. Honorable mentions:

- linkffn(What You Leave Behind). A brilliant fic, with three departure points which is why it doesn't get the gold for this category, yet doesn't fit into the others. Great magic, a fun Hogwarts and great whimsy.

- linkffn(The One He Feared). Another damn brilliant fic, but one cut short by overly clever plot planning, giving it an honorable mention. Amazing magic, best canon Dumbledore characterization and matches canon tone/style very well.

- linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress). A pretty good fic, but has multiple points of departure, and I disagree with a core assertion about dark magic. Still good.

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone). One of my two favorite fics, but it just doesn't feel AU enough. Probably because it takes place during a summer. Best Sorting Hat.

Different but Similar fics are AUs in which the worldbuilding and magic are different yet still follows canon plot points. My favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) for how it plays well/great with bad tropes and general intelligence. Gets very good at the end of first year onwards. Honorable mentions:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Just not as good.

- linkffn(By the Diving Light; Conloadh's Song). Good fics by enembee with a Neville BWL featuring Old Magic. I'm just not a fan of that style of Old Magic.

Full/True AUs are exactly that, the essence of Alternate Universe. Noncanon plotlines, noncanon worldbuilding and noncanon magic. I believe [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]]' criminally underrated linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), the other of my two favorite fics, is the best of these. Great magical theory, a Wizarding World that truly feels like its own culture that diverged from the rest of humankind centuries ago, a great vocabulary, every character has a unique voice, magical synesthesia in the form of Wandsong is brilliantly handled, a version of wizarding religion that I think is the most realistic as compared to the faux-paganism it usually is and all the small touches. The only thing I dislike is the update rate. No honorable mentions, because I don't read a ton of these, but check out The Skitterleap and PotDK if you haven't already.

*** I second The Untitled Tome. That shit is so cash.

In fact while reading it I noticed something extremely strange. I usually don't care much for romance and almost skim through the relevant parts.

However, in the Untitled Tome, the characters felt so lifelike and compelling, that I found myself giddy about crushes and hints of teenage romance.

I can honestly say I'm reading this like a soap opera, just to see who ends up with who, the central plot is an afterthought at this point :D

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** That's an awfully broad question, but if you're looking for a total AU, then "Reign of the Serpent" might be my favorite. The premise is Salazar Slytherin becoming an immortal dictator and building his own little empire. The plot is Hermione being kidnapped from her parents and forced to enter this new world where blood purity reigns and "Mudbloods" are slaves -- but Hermione manages to raise above her station and attend a much different Hogwarts, where she makes some new friends and starts plotting a revolution.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Well that's an incredibly vague question. You're not even asking for significant AU's which means this is basically a 'what is the best fanfiction' post.

*** Ah, perhaps in form but not intent. I search instead for ones opinion on an alternate universe. There are few FanFiction which are entirely AU. Meaning, that they run away from cannon - introduce new elements and characters which change the way things fall apart. I'm not looking for a story that dances around the original plot, I'm looking for one that alters it. You know, an AU.

** I'm fond of linkffn(Hogwarts Sanitarium), but it's only 42k words and unfinished. An obvious concept, I think, but I'd never seen it done before and it was really intriguing.

**** No, no, it wasn't trying to confuse the readers into thinking that maybe it was all made-up, it was just telling the story of what-if, I think. I remember being annoyed that it was unfinished. It's worth a glance.
