Stories where her snottiness and elitist personality is played up.

Like that one story where she harshly rejected Ron because he was poor, then married Krum.


** Snotty? Yes. Elitist? Since when has Hermione been elitist?

In any case, I remember A Cadmean Victory, linkffn(11446957), plays up her pettiness and arrogance, while also significantly downplaying her positive personality traits, like canon Hermione's sense of loyalty and justice. That being said, there are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hpf6o/a_cadmean_victory_by_darknessenthroned_gof_au/cu9cm0v][a lot of flaws with this fic]], even if you like Hermione bashing, so YMMV.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** In a way she is - she asumes that she's morally right every time (everybody else should just bow to her wisdom, even if it's not a question of knowledge but morals and upbringing etc. - like her "let's free the houselfs"-crusade, despite the elfs not wanting to be free (except Dobby who's an oddball, an outcast, a pariah because of wanting payment etc.) and she can't admit being wrong (remember Lockhart? She liked him to, despite the fact that the guy was a total fraud!))

That has more to do with her being naive than elitist.

She was a thirteen year-old with a crush, you can forgive her for being a little bit stupid about Lockhart.

It's just hard to imagine Hermione being elitist, because in context of the HP world, there's really only two things for people to be elitist about: blood status and money. While we know Hermione is well-off due to both her parents being dentists, she rarely (if ever) brings it up. And since she's a muggleborn, she can't exactly be elitist about her blood status, either.

***** I would call it "elitism" or "snobbery" if you try to impose your morals and world-view on other people/beings!

Not really - crushes should deflate in seconds (and vanish shortly afterwards) if you get to know the object of your desire and it's glaringly obvious that the object of your desires is a FRAUD! (come on we know Lockhart was a fraud at the very latest after his first lesson and we have Harry's POV and Harry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed - you could even argue that he's a rather dense idiot!)

** If playing up her snottiness and elitist personality can be considered bashing, then a fic like Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution is Hermione bashing. She's snotty, elitist and unlikeable, but it's presented as if those are good things, because it's Hermione and fits the muggleborn supremacy theme. Which, really, is doubly tragic and doubly hilarious.

*** Really? I thought she felt more like Octavian or Oliver Cromwell in that story, two highly respected leaders in history. Some of you people have a problem distinguish between perpetrators and victims, whenever victims fight back hard, you lot seem to find every reason to blame them, while trying to find every excuse for perpetrators.

Of course, she's not a likable or sympathetic character in that fic, because strong political leaders can never be.

**** The /idea/ of a strong leader has little to do with the fact that Hermione in that fic is snotty, elitist and unlikeable. If that was what Starfox was aiming for, the execution was bad.

I have nothing against a good revenge story, but the way Hermione goes about it is just cartoonishly ridiculous. It's absolutely possible to write about a cruel, elitist leader and make it good (good doesn't mean making the character likeable, mind).

Also, the entire victim vs perpetrator is a fairly baseless argument when it comes to that fic. The revolution starts right away, Hermione wasn't given an opportunity to be a victim. She cries rape literally from the first paragraph.

**** Well, that you have been a victim doesn't grant you the right to become a perpetrator.

And a lot of us really do enjoy a good revenge story.

***** I disagree. The people they killed were those who willingly supported and abetted the genocide against Muggleborns. By the standard of the Allies after WW2, they had committed war crimes and deserved to be executed. On top of that, Magical world had veritaserum so the probability of catching innocents was relatively small.

In addition, it was the marriage law that eventually led to the revolution. Do you have an idea what kind of tyranny a marriage law implies? Even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to implement similar laws. It was a violation of private rights of the worst kind.

** Well, maybe linkffn(The Book of Dobby Reboot: Per Arcana ad Astra) qualifies? Not really bashing at all, but from Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  But Hermione wasn't in the mood to listen. She didn't have a whole lot of flaws, but her worst was that she was, frankly, an intellectual snob.

  "You really don't know what you're talking about, Dobby." She said.

  Dobby looked extremely put out.

  "Miss Grangy Ma'am is being rude!" He complained. "Dobby is being a house elf and Miss Grangy Ma'am is being a Bigger so how is Dobby not knows more about what it is being like to be being house elfses?"

  "Sometimes the truth isn't good manners, Dobby." Hermione told him. "The truth is, you're an escaped slave, and all of your people are slaves."
#+end_quote

If you want some Hermione snobbery without actual bashing, that might do. It's also incomplete, and by far one of the oddest crackfics you'll ever read.

** I'm not a great fan of this story but it does have Hermione's attitude in a realistic work place. Her domineering attitude combined with Gryffindor tendencies to leap without looking have landed her in a spot of bother although its not the centre of the story at all. linkffn(6257522)
