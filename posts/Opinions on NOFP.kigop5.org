So, one of my favourite fics is Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past, but according to TVTropes this is somewhat controversial.

To quote them, "you either love this fic, hate it, or respect the authorial style while disliking the plot. No other ground seems to exist."

I fall in the "love it" category, but I'm interested to know other people's opinions, and reasons why they love/hate it.

Discuss!


** Well it's burdened by its own success. The tropes laid out in its earlier chapters have become so foundational to HPFF as a whole that for anyone who didn't catch the wave at the right time, it now seems derivative. But that's not the fault of the fic, but the audience who have endlessly recycled, remixed and reused every different element of NOFP.

It a problem all prototypical works have.

Add to that, the writing quality remains high to this day. I cannot imagine how impressive it must have been to those finding it in 2005!

Still I think it's a fantastic summation of HPFF in general and it's one of the only fics started before the seventh book was released that is still going. That makes it rather exceptional and it's worth your time just for that.

Though I do acknowledge that newer, genre savvy readers will have a harder time of loving it.

*** I found it in 2005. It blew my fucking mind and I read it a dozen times or more. You also hit the nail on the head. It only doesn't hold up that well because all of the plot points are so overdone now. But the reason they are overdone is because of this fic and how good it was, everyone wanted to emulate it.

** I love it. I think that the flashbacks were slightly too drawn out and artificial, but generally I think it is one of better time travel fix-it stories.

** I really enjoy it. It was the first time travel fix it fic that I ever read and it definitely set my expectations for the genre. I like Harry's difficulty with adjusting to life as an 11 year old and what that means for his relationships. I also like the pace of how the changes to canon were made.
