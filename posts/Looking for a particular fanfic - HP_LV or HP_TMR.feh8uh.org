What I remember about the fanfic: 1. Sirius was out of the Azkaban. I don't remember if he escaped or there was a trial, but I think it was a trial.

1. Harry and Sirius were living in the Grimmauld Place.

2. Harry was in contact with LV/TMR and I think they had two way mirrors or charmed diaries.

3. I remember a part where Harry was saying/writting that he was now living in the Order Headquarters or rather they were living with him and Sirius (they weren't before) and LV/TMR replied that it was given to Harry on a silver plate.

It is good guess it's slash or slash-to-be, dark Harry and even different sorting.

I am searching for this fic since yesterday and I haven't found it yet. Anyone anything?


** I feel like I've read a few of these and don't remember their name. To help In the search can you answer these questions.

1. Where there death eaters involved (Barty and Bellatrix) that we're living at #12 along with maybe Remus or Sirius?

2. Did Harry have a larger group of friends back at Hogwarts? Was Cedric part of this group? Did the population think Cedric and Harry were dating but Cedric was actually dating Cho?

*** I don't think they were living with them. I remember only Sirius and Harry. (IDK about Remus.)

Hmm. When I read "did the students think C. and H. were dating but C. was actually dating Cho", Full Circle came to my mind but I don't think it was this fic.
