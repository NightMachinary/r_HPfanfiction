Canonically speaking, do we get the feeling that squibs are just wizards too weak to bother training (hence why Filch would have a correspondence course on his desk) or just Muggles with wizarding heritage?

I want to write a OC just barely magical enough to get into Hogwarts, but it seems like canon's a bit fuzzy on this.

  SQUIBS

  I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‘Chamber of Secrets'. *A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent*. Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.

  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it. Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore's liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds. *Neither of these characters can perform magic* (Filch's Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‘t know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you). Incidentally, Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.

  Do all young people in Britain's Wizarding World go to Hogwarts? For example, did Stan Shunpike attend Hogwarts? Or is Hogwarts a school just for those who are particularly good at magic while others go into trades without formal schooling? [Mugglenet/Lexicon question]

  Everyone who shows magical ability before their eleventh birthday will automatically gain a place at Hogwarts; *there is no question of not being ‘magical enough'; you are either magical or you are not*. There is no obligation to take up the place, however; a family might not want their child to attend Hogwarts.

** Neville's family feared he was a squib until he performed some accidental magic. After that, they knew he was a wizard, full stop. This argues against the "weak wizard" hypothesis and suggests it isn't a broad continuum of power. Otherwise, they'd still be worried about him being a /weak/ wizard, and they don't seem to be.

This could however just be about the stigma, and being a weak wizard simply isn't the same level of shame for the family or the person involved. I could see it going either way.

--------------

Some magical children seem to have more or less trouble with magic, but this doesn't seem to be based on innate magical power in canon. Voldemort is said to be very magically powerful, but this is presented by Dumbledore as a Dark Powers thing, not that he was born that way. Dumbledore himself was really smart as a kid, and learned a lot as an adult. This is a "knowledge is power" thing in canon, not him having the biggest "magical core" or some such.

Arguing against this is how both Harry and Tom seemed to have some rather dramatic accidental magic (for Tom, not so accidental) before Hogwarts, and they both seem to have more /umph/ in their spells than their classmates usually show. Think figuring out Horcruxes before twenty, /confundus/-ing adult wizards, mastering summoning and combat spells beyond grade level, and driving off hundreds of Dementors with a single spell. This argues for a broad "average wizard" level of power, with people like Harry, Dumbledore, and Riddle at the high and rare end.

--------------

This continuum could include magicals who never had childhood accidental magic and were naturally magically weak. But not as a genetic thing or some such. Unlike in a lot of fannon, the Gaunt family was not nearly squibs. The father and brother both displayed very strong and silently cast magic. They did, however, verbally and physically abuse Merope, who was never confirmed as a squib and actually had a wand.

Dumbledore didn't know for sure if she used the Imperius curse on her husband or a potion. That he didn't know suggests she was /not/ a squib, but had been abused into being unable to use magic very well. This also suggests that inbreeding doesn't screw up magic, but maybe having been raised by really screwed up people could result in magicals hitting the lower end of the scale.

Thus, there /are/ people in canon who are barely wizards. But it seems to be an emotional issue. I could see a non-abused child being tied up in emotional knots to the point where the effect could be the same.

Those magical families who had kids like that would be relieved just to have them accepted to Hogwarts at all, but what about Muggles who were like that? That would be a fun conversation for McGonagall to have with some Muggle parents whose child had never done anything strange /at all/. At Hogwarts it would be hell for them, a kid with some real problems also getting picked on by Pure-bloods who think their every prejudice has just been validated. Ouch.

--------------

Then there are squibs, who don't even get to go to Hogwarts. Filch is a squib, but isn't affected by the charms making Hogwarts look like a ruin to Muggles--and this isn't a special exemption as no Muggles are ever allowed on castle grounds, even when, say, their daughter is paralyzed by a rampaging monster. This suggests that squibs are not simply Muggles born to magical people.

Squibs aren't just weak wizards and they aren't Muggles. Things like not being affected by Muggle repelling charms (like around wizard villages and Hogwarts); possibly being able to use magical items like cleaning compounds, healing potions, and activating things like Diagon Alley's magical wall; and possibly being eventually capable of some very small, non-wand magics point to them still having some magical abilities. How they are expected to leave the magical world suggests these minor abilities aren't enough to make them useful to magicals, or that they are just that embarrassing.

--------------

From canon, I'd argue for a very sharp separation on a tiered power system. Rare super-star wizards who show up once a generation and can do "great things" if they apply themselves, average wizards who are 99.99% of magicals, emotionally compromised and magically "weak" kids who can grow out of it (like Neville) or never do (like Dumbledore's sister and Merope), squibs who still have some magical tendencies, and Muggles who can even be specifically targeted by some magics and have absolutely none of their own.

--------------

I say if you want to stick close to canon, go for your weak wizard idea but make it clear that it is just as unusual as Tom Riddle being able to magically torture kids when he was ten. And maybe make your OC a bit emotionally messed up, like Neville was at first.

Incidentally, JKR said [[http://web.archive.org/web/20110721042840/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19][on her site]] (way back in the day) that they can't see dementors. But it depends on your own preference on whether or not you want to make that strictly canon, I suppose.

***** The thing is I'm not so sure it would be easily disproved. I doubt there were many instances in which Squibs would encounter Dementors, since they were under Ministry control whenever Voldemort wasn't openly in power. They probably could have brought in a couple Dementors from Azkaban to prove it, but really the trial wasn't important enough to necessitate those measures (though Fudge and Umbridge certainly wanted it to be, to blow up a simple case of underaged magic to prove Dumbledore and Harry to be nutters).

** Please do write it! I've been wanting to read something like that for a while!

It would be pretty interesting to see how they function in the world with a bit of magic but not enough. Could they travel by broom or Floo? Can they use a wand at all? Maybe they can brew Potions after figuring out some modification. What about Divination? It's an interesting idea.

*** Thanks for the encouragement! Right now I'm still at the note-taking / outlining stage, but I've already got some idea about how some classes will be more or less okay, while others (like Charms and Transfiguration) will be pretty much impossible except on a theoretical level. I don't think you'd want this character on a broom. Olivander's isn't going to go well either, but she'll get a wand - of a sort.

I'm a little nervous about execution, since I have't done much creative writing recently, just a lot of technical papers in grad school. We'll see how it goes.

** I've always figured that it's a continuum, a bell curve with squibs at one end, and exceptionally powerful wizards like Dumbledore at the other. Most folks would fall somewhere in the middle.

I like to think that muggles would actually fall within the curve, too. I can't help but wonder if there would be variations in muggles' ability to sense magic. Normal, non-magical people who are drawn to magical places and artifacts, even if they can't use them. I seem to recall reading a fic ages ago that explored this, where the absolute bottom end of the spectrum were muggles who were so magically inert that they couldn't even be affected by spells.

** So, so many wrong things being said in this thread.

I'll preface with this: it's your story, write it however you want. BajaB wrote a similar story with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] and it was pretty great, actually.

That said, don't try to rationalize canon as having anything but a yes/no system when it comes to magic - it's like having opposable thumbs, you either have it or not.

Why are some wizards like Neville and some like Dumbledore? A bit of skill (dexterity for wand movements), a mind that makes sense of the inherently non-sensical magic, and a hell of a lot of practice and study.

Dumbledore wasn't born better. He was born smarter, and worked his ass off for many years. He also had opportunities, like studying with Nicholas Flamel to discover uses for dragon's blood.

There is some evidence for confidence, too, having an effect (i.e. Neville who used to be worthless until he grew some balls).

There are no magical cores, and you can't make it bigger. Magic isn't exhausting any more than conducting an orchestra is - though if you're fighting, you're probably running around and whatnot, so that could leave you breathless.

Even the Quikspell course is explainable by this - teaching proper wand movements and spells you might not have learned in school (or forgotten), along with a bit of placebo effect to boost confidence gives better magic (of note, it didn't work at all with Filch - he has no magic, so he can't get better at it). To use a real-world analogy, this is a Kaplan course for magic - you're reviewing the material in a different way to make sure you can provide the effect, but it's light on theory.

[[/u/Taure]] can correct me, as he is the magical theory guru of the universe.
