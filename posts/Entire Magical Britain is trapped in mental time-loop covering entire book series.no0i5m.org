I have seen a lot of mental time travel ideas, so I decided to take them to their logical extreme. Time loop starts the moment Killing Curse hits Harry on 31 October 1981 and ends the moment either Harry or Voldemort dies (in the Cycle 0 it is when Voldemort's own Killing Curse kills him for good at the finale of Battle for Hogwarts, original books' content).

​

Every magical being that ever visited British Isles during the first cycle is mentally trapped in this time loop. All people have knowledge about previous cycles, but no creepy "adult-in-child body" stuff. Imagine you made from memory a movie series about all important episodes in your life and then sent it to watch to your younger self, but this movie directly projects your emotions as well as sensory experiences. Capabilities of comprehension and memory for certain ages apply. For example, one year old Harry after receiving this information just develops a Deja Vu. Non-magicals, British or not as well as magical being that didn't visit the Isles during the original cycle don't experience time loop. Time travel with any magical means (such as Time Turner) can't bring you outside of cycle margins. Divination can't foresee any events outside of cycle.

​

No one, even Dumbledore or Voldemort have a slightest idea about about the nature of time loop, how it came to be and how to break it. During the first cycle after original, DMLE and the Order of the Phoenix swiftly acted against all Death Eaters and destroyed all horcruxes, killing Voldemort within less then month. Cycle immediately restarted. After several increasingly short and violent cycles during which rules became more or less understood by everyone, came long cycle were DMLE and OP managed to imprison incapacitated Voldemort and destroy all but one horcrux. This cycle lasted till Harry's death from old age in 2115. Then wised up Voldemort and DEs managed to take over in the next cycle and Voldemort hid gruesomely incapacitated Harry hooked on Elixir of Life and unicorn blood life support and ruled for centuries till some accidental mess up in Harry's life-support killed him restarting the cycle again.

​

Then comes current cycle. What new status quo will be in this cycle? In what mental state all characters will be? What will change about their personalities? How relationships will change? How the rest of the world will be weirded out with Britain suddenly treating death as bad weather? How non-British characters involved in series such as Fleur and Krum would feel about it?


** Oh my God. Original Content I craved for. Instead of time travel, there's a time LOOP. This will be a game changer for fanfiction if this is ever made.

*** It could be entire "Timeloopverse AU" with many short personal stories from Dumbledore getting increasing bored with Voldemort, Snape giving up on his love on Lily and trying dating, etc. Unfortunately, I am not talented enough to kickstart this idea with epic LF, so I just hope someone can write something like this.

*** While at some point people would just grow apathetic to the whole situation, there is important asymmetry that would most likely prevent or severely disrupt Dumbledore and Voldemort having a chat: if Voldemort dies - entire cycle restarts, he is guaranteed to live; Dumbledore on the other hand is most valid candidate to break the loop and he gets new cycle if and only if either Harry or Voldemort die, so for him new start is not guaranteed if Voldemort kills him. So both are motivated to attack one another at the first sight.

** A while back I came up with an idea for a writing prompt, or a game concept; the idea was that a supervillain goes back in time to conquer the world, far before any superheroes have ever been born.\\
However, rather than successfully changing the timeline as he believed, this villain actually inadvertently created a parallel Earth in a pocket dimension; he ruled over this world as an immortal god-king, hoarding technology for himself and treating his subjects like slaves, but the 'real' Earth was untouched save for the supervillain disappearing from it.\\
 \\
Except not quite, because once the parallel Earth's 'timeline' reaches the point in the real Earth's timeline where the supervillain disappeared, an inadvertent merger occurs; people are shuffled between the two Earths, buildings and infrastructure are swapped over, et-cetera. For the people on parallel Earth, millions of them suddenly remember lives where they had far more advanced technology and freedom, with their god-king's monuments spontaneously being graffiti'd with mechanical instructions and unfamiliar pop culture; on the real Earth, millions are shaken by memories of servitude to a tyrannical overlord, and the Empire State Building is replaced by a way-too-big statue of a certain time-travelling supervillain.\\
 \\
I wonder if such an idea could be reused here? Voldemort tries to rewrite the timeline to his whims, only to create a parallel Britain, one that automatically rewinds in time whenever he or one of his Horcruxes is destroyed (which unfortunately includes his archnemesis Harry).\\
However, this parallel Britain has a flaw; at the point of temporal intersection, the time on real-Earth when Voldemort initiated his time-manipulating ritual (and made a parallel dimension instead), souls and matter bleed over, leading to a sudden insurrection when dozens if not hundreds of Voldemort's servants spontaneously remember what it's like to /not/ live under Voldemort.\\
...I want to come up with something-something about what happens to the temporal intersection when a horcrux is destroyed but it's getting too late at night...

*** Yeah, entire world is reset, but only magical sapient beings that were in Britain at some point during the original Cycle 0 retain memories. Non-magical animals and muggles (such as Dursleys) don't retain any memories, wizards in other countries that didn't visit Britain during the series don't experience this cycle.

While centuries of memories sound maddening, in my particular treatment of time loop, characters don't suddenly get all their memories from previous time loop, more like if they read book or watched movie about their previous timeloops with all emotionally unimportant moments left out. And those characters that are too small at the beginning of the timeloop (Harry's generation) barely can recollect their revelation because this is how much toddler can comprehend and memorize, getting déjà vu when encountering certain terms, people, creature, places, objects, situations, etc.

Those individuals that are born during the cycle don't get recollection at all, because of butterfly effect they are different people each time even if produced from the same parents at the same time chances that the same gametes collide again are astronomically small.

** Next idea: Dumbledore captures both Harry and one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, puts them in a magical artefact and lets it accelerate to 99.999...9%c. Time dilation gives everyone on Earth hundreds of thousands of years. Dumbledore and most others live a good life and die of old age, after that Voldemort spends a few millenia ruling and collects pretty much all the information there is to collect. A minor strange particle accident is caused by muggles in 5270, and Voldemort spends the next hundred thousand years as the only human in this solar system, developing his own branch of magic far surpassing anything that ever existed before. Then Harry's ship hits a speck of interstellar dust at enough speed to have energy equivalent to a supernova, and the cycle restarts.

This time Voldemort has magic he spent more time developing on than mankind has experienced since the invention of fire. Meanwhile everyone else only has one additional lifetime of experience. Voldemort enslaves everyone on Earth in a fraction of a second, then makes a hundred copies of Earth a second later. Harry is immediately put under time stasis again. Everyone else gets a small subset of Voldemort's discoveries, including immortality, and is put to work on figuring out how to break the loop. 132 million years later, Dumbledore copy #328 makes a breakthrough discovery. Voldemort double checks the theory and kills Harry, restarting the cycle.

Voldemort snaps his fingers. Instantly his Horcruxes are hidden in intergalactic space billions of lightyears away. He snaps his fingers again. Spacetime refolds itself. He snaps his fingers a third time. Harry Potter bursts into flames. The cycle does not restart. A fourth snap, and everyone else's memories of the time loop are erased.

Voldemort has billions of man-years worth of magical research in his brain. He's a god amongst mortals. And this time around he can do whatever he wants.

He strolls down Diagon Alley and buys a cone of ice cream.

*** While existential crisis that classifies as angst is inevitable for many characters, explicit descriptions of rape are completely avoidable, in fact even the explicit mentioning of rape is avoidable. I am sure in canon DEs raped a lot of people, aside from just murdering them, but we never hear even hints about it in the books because this gruesome detail wouldn't add anything of value to the story.
