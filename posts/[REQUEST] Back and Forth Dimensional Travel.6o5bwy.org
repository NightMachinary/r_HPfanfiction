Hey everyone, I'm trying to write a novel featuring a protagonist who travels back and forth between two or more dimensions. Having been an avid reader of Harry Potter fanfic, I know that there have been many stories where Harry either reincarnates, travels, or what have you, to a different dimension. However, in the vast majority of these stories, Harry never actually travels back to his original universe. I've been stuck thinking of a viable method for my protagonist to return to his home world and thought that where else would be better to get inspiration than by reading amazing fanfic?

I remember reading several stories where all it took for Harry to cross dimensions was the accidental use of some artifact and while I'll still appreciate the recommendation, I'd much rather prefer a story which doesn't involve the use of an artifact, thank you!

** There's one I basically just read, but the title is slipping my mind. The premise is that right after defeating Voldemort/talking to Luna/finding a place to rest, Harry opens his eyes and finds out he's been summoned to another world, but he's the fourth Harry so far. The original and previous two summoned were Slytherins and are all dead. Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape are all alive, and much of the focus of the story is on the relationship between a mentoring relationship Snape and Harry. At the end, Harry does end up returning to his original world.

If you're just interested in the mechanics of the dimension travel, [[/spoiler][Dumbledore uses some Black family book/ritual to summon Harry once the original Harry of that world dies, but has no way to return him. Hermione shows him a book that makes it possible for him to verbally communicate with Ron and Hermione from his world. They eventually essentially "lock-on" to his coordinates when he focuses on using magic and have to create a bridge for him to cross the gap, held up by one person in each world and coordinated by the clothes he originally had with him from his original world.]]

  Lily uses a dark ritual to protect her son which has long term ramifications for him. Not that he's complaining about the perks of the matter. Harry/Multi, obviously. Very dark and may offend delicate sensibilities. More information inside. Reposted after accidental deletion. Don't ask even though someone end up will doing so.
