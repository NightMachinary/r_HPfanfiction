Here's a basic intro to Harry Potter Fanfiction.

Since you're new, I'll provide you a few tools to get started. You can find a list of fanfiction terminology at [[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html][this site]]. These terms apply to all fanfiction, not just Harry Potter. If you see acronyms and weird terms you've never seen before, it most likely will be on that site. Some additional Harry Potter specific terms may be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/112420890/Fanfiction-Terminology-Dictionary][here]].

Since a lot of fanfiction is written specifically to pair two or more characters together, called shipping, (from the shortened "relationship") people have come up with several names which pop up frequently, so don't be alarmed when you see them. Most writers don't really use them anymore, but [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names][here's a list]] anyway.

The bulk of the content is now located at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/]] (aka ffnet). That wasn't always the case, and even today there are dozens of archives across the net that cater to specific types of stories, usually split by ship. Most of them are available on [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives][this list]] though sadly a lot are not only dead in that nobody is using them, but some have been lost entirely, such as the only HP/HG/RW site on the net, TheQuidditchPitch.

If you're not happy with the search function on Fanfiction.net, a forum called DarkLordPotter maintains a better search engine called the [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.com][Scryer]]. It still only searches the fanfiction.net archive. The other big site is [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works][ArchiveOfOurOwn]] (aka ao3).

A tip for using FFNet: [[https://gyazo.com/5e4a947fade2233f2af99eefe2a345c0.gif][Sort by reviews (gif)]], and read at the very least the first two pages of stories. Not all of them are great, and some are actually really bad both objectively and subjectively, but they are popular for a reason and at the very least deserve a look because you're going to find references and cliches from those stories appear all over the place.

Next, when you look at an author's page, make use of the [[https://gyazo.com/ac1f4176295f4be77f49234a035f9315.png][hide bio button in the top center of the screen (img)]], it makes the page much cleaner. Finally, [[https://gyazo.com/efc08921d79cf905c43a9b605e9a05be.gif][check out the author's favorites pages (gif)]]. Many authors, especially the ones I am going to list below, maintain massive lists of good stories.

**When looking for stories to read, there are four things to really keep in mind. First is the summary: f there's spelling/grammar errors or it's really incoherent, the rest of the story will be worse. Next is the wordcount: between 2k and 5k per chapter is the best possible range. Lower and it feels rushed, higher and it feels too dense. Your preferences may vary. Then consider the status: is it complete or not, and is there a note in the summary saying it's abandoned, on hiatus, has a sequel, etc. Obviously completed stories takes away the possibility of them never being finished but following a story is cool too.

**Lastly there's the update date. If it's incomplete but recently updated, that's good to know and bodes well for the completion of the story, and if it's complete but updated years ago, you know you should give it an extra bit of leeway as it may have been before some of the books came out or before some plot points and cliches became overdone and lame.

** Creating an account, especially on ffnet, is extremely useful for three reasons: [[https://gyazo.com/abca272b8fabac94df0a4c0350816de7.gif][follows, favorites (gif)]], and reviews. Following a story or author gives you [[https://gyazo.com/ae1cfc091be35db337008506431fdd95.gif][updates via email (gif)]] when something is posted. This makes it super easy to keep track of new stories. I personally have over 100 follows currently, though less than a quarter have updated in the last three months.

**Favorites allows you to place fics you want to come back to on a [[https://gyazo.com/52da05b093e1ed0ad0bf0ab45f8942aa.gif][list on your profile (gif)]]. You can use this list however you like, though most of us redditors have migrated to using personal documents where we can summarize and annotate our recs. Reviewing is fairly straightforward. It allows you to communicate with the author.

** Review etiquette: Never ever post anything along the lines of "please update more/faster". It doesn't help anything. Also don't be a dick. It's pretty simple. If something makes you angry and want to yell at the author, just close the tab. There's no reason to put that negativity out there. If the person is breaking rules, just use the report button. The admins almost never respond to reports directly but usually take care of them within a week.

** If you want to typo or grammar bust, be polite about it, including asking the author if they mind if you do so. Most of the time if they do mind, they will have said so in an authors note somewhere, so definitely don't just skip those. If you want to make suggestions (on in-progress stories only), again be polite about it. Telling the author to do something will just annoy them. If you want to offer praise, that's fine, but under 10 word reviews such as "I liked this" are generally frowned upon. If you want to review, take an extra minute to tell them what you liked and why.

There are several tools on this subreddit's sidebar that you should read. You will see a lot of us here using the fanfictionbot by summoning it with linkffn(). That information is on the sidebar. One of the tools included in the bot is downloading stories from ffnet to ereader files. That's done with this site: [[http://www.p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/download.php?id=]] where the id is found [[https://gyazo.com/88849c936a5cbbab70d4e154c8fc7012.gif][like this (gif)]].

There's also the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/][Most Recommended Stories thread]] (edit: check the bot's replies to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/cz8rk2c][my comment]] for a better formatted list) and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hsfw0/general_recommendations_thread/][General Recommendation thread]]. If you use the search bar, you can look for terms like "best" and come up with threads like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ofzz6/best_fic_ever_read/?ref=search_posts][this one]] which have lots of discussion and suggestions. A thread I always like to comment on is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zqz17/your_favorite_emotionalheartwrenching_fics/][recommending sad stories]]

Taure, an author and user here maintains a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/][headcanon document]] which may help both authors and readers understand canon better. Contrasting this is ARedHair's canon deconstruction located on [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][his profile]]. Don't take that to mean he hates Harry Potter or JKR, but he discusses all the little things that fanfiction authors see and change in their own worlds.

** I always recommend A Black Comedy as a good first story. The only problem is that while it will likely get a novice reader to be entranced by fanfiction, they will likely be forever disappointed that there's so few fics of a similar quality to it.

** I remember way back in the day when the 7th book was coming out and I was all hyped up about it. I looked online a week or so before it came out to see if anyone had put up a scan or a pdf or something, but instead, I accidentally stumbled upon melindaleo's the Seventh Horcrux.

By the time I realized it wasn't actually the real version (lol) I was in too deep and invested in the story. Since then I've read countless fics and all. Perhaps this will be a good first step for you too. It was written pretty well but I did read this years ago, so the nostalgia glasses may be blurring my vision a little bit. It's also very long, pretty much novel length.

** For a first fic, I recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan).

The reasons are: It's written well (the author has published professionally). It's long (longer than any of the canon texts). It stays with canon pairings (adding Neville/Luna) and stays in the book universe. It doesn't depart too far from canon events until well into the story. It popularized many of the fanfiction tropes (PTSD Harry, magical cores, etc.) And, it was one of the first popular Peggy Sue fics, introducing the reader to one of the most frequently employed divergence points in fanfiction.

Additionally, it's incomplete and slowly updating, meaning that the reader new to fanfiction can experience all the heartbreak of getting to the end of a compelling story and finding the final chapters missing.

** This is a short piece; something just to prove what fanfiction can achieve; linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair)

Usually, the first instinct of someone looking for fanfiction is to continue the story as it was. Northumbrian specializes in this sort of story. His most accessible work (though unfinished) is linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh).

On the flipside, you might be interested in a slightly more raunchy interpretation of the Potterverse, with humor interleaved. Try linkffn(A Black Comedy).

It's so representative of the quality of average fanfiction and the fact that it sucks sets your standards to a low level so you can enjoy more stories that way. It also introduces you to a lot of (overused) tropes and cliches in the fandom - all in one story!
