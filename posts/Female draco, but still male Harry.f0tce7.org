I'm looking for fanfics where Draco is female instead of male and harry still being male. Really makes me wonder how that'd affect their ''relationship''


** Not much in the first five years, I think. Though maybe something could be done during year 6, assuming the events on year 5 affected fem!Draco in "that" way.

** Tbh I think it's surprising how few Harry/femDraco fics there are. I'm not sure that I've seen even one.
