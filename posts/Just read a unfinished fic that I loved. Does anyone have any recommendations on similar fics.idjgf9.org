I just got finished reading all the current chapters of Of Blacks and Boarhounds by Zorak23. I really loved the blend of fix-it, romance, slice-of-life, humor, and smut. I was disappointed when I reached the last published chapter, though it was last updated in June, so there is hope for more to come.

Does anyone have any fanfics that are similar, I would love to have something more to read.

I seriously recommend it. Perfect blend of adorably funny humor and heartwarming romance and friendship. Now I just need more.

** That is surprisingly cute. I'm not usually an OC fan either.
