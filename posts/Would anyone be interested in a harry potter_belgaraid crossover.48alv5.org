The belgaraid is a old fantasy series but very very good imo it's my favorite and wanted to know if 1 one their are fans on here ? 2 if they ever wanted a crossover


** As clichee as it sounds: It depends on how it is written. For example, I loathe WH40K, but I absolutely love the "Inquisitor Carrow" series.

*** I have to concur. I /think/ that such a crossover has potential, but it would have to be done very, very, very carefully. Mostly because of the difference in the magic systems.

If it's Belgariad/Mallorean characters appearing in the HP universe, there's going to be a huuuge power difference between them and the HP wizards/witches (if the characters crossing over are sorcerers/sorceress). Really, the only areas that the HP universe has them beat are enchanting, potions and vanishing objects.

If it is, say, Harry Potter showing up during the Belgariad, that would have more potential, I would think.

** I would definitely want to read it. The Belgariad is a well-written classic that led the way for much of what we now think of as standard. Combining the two would be fun. Harry and Garion have much in common, as do Belgarath and Dumbledore, though there are obvious power differences.

*** Have you read the Mallorean? It's the follow-up series, and much more mature. I agree that the Belgariad is rather cliche'd and childish compared to most adult fantasy, but the Mallorean does most things that the Belgariad did well, and a few extra parts on top, while being written for an older audience.

The Belgariad is Eddings' only series aimed at children, afaik. The Elenium/Tamuli is also aimed for an adult audience, as is The Redemption of Althalus, and the Belgarath the Sorcerer/Polgara the Sorceress/Rivan Codex extensions are written more like the Mallorean.

** Just the franchise being old (or relatively unknown) shouldn't be a problem if the fanfic itself is well-written and interesting. For instance, I have never played [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-298][/Baldur's Gate/]] or [[http://addventure.bast-enterprises.de/frecent.php?tag=Dungeon+Keeper+Ami][/Dungeon Keeper/, watched /Sailor Moon/]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/][/RWBY/]]; yet the Ã—-fics that featured these universes were interesting to read because the narrative and contained tropes were relevant to my interests. Even if the original storyline didn't age well, you can [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction][deconstruct]] those of its parts that would've otherwise been boring by today's standards.

** I'd be interested, just be very careful with it. There are definitely power balance issues when you look at the two magic systems, so you wouldn't want say, more than one Sorcerer from Belgariad showing up in HP but a group of wizards from HP to Belgariad would be very interesting. Maybe the Ministry 6 (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, Ginny) end up somewhere during the Belgariad after an accident during the Ministry fight? I'd read the shit out of that.

**** Have you read all the extended books? There's obviously also the Mallorean, but then there's also Belgarath the Sorcerer, Polgara the Sorceress and the Rivan Codex. I enjoyed those more than either series, although I thnk the Mallorean has fewer cliche's than the Belgariad.

** Yes, I wouldn't mind one. You'd have to be pretty thorough in researching it though. Dropping an HP wizard in the Belgarion Universe would be the equivalent of dropping a tasty morsel into a piranha tank since they're pretty heavily outclassed by the gods, the immortal sorcerer and his daughter as well as, oh, that one guy that wields the ultimate god-killing sword & has command over an island of sturdy bastards.

The second anyone finds out that there's a guy/gal/group running around that can fuck with reality by waving their sticks and spouting gibberish, someone's going to start paying attention to them. They are highly unlikely to survive said attention for very long unless they drop in at just the right time & place.

*** An HP wizard in the world of the Belgariad wouldn't be a power hitter of any means, but I doubt their magic would make the same kind of noise as the Will and the Word, so they would be (if intelligently used) as spies/assassins.

**** Personally, I think they would make a very loud squish given how territorial and prone to stumbling over their soulmates everyone seems to be in that series. I mean seriously, Aldur would smite the crap out of anyone showing up with a wand solely so that his chosen ones remained the only game in town.

***** That's only if you assume the two magic systems are compatible/the same at the core. I think it would be more entertaining if they weren't. And why would they have soulmates in that world? They don't belong there. It'd be an accident, like the star exploding.

****** Oh god, the hilarity. One side /knows/ that fated marriages exist, the other thinks that it's the stuff of cheap-ass romance novels read (and probably written) by vulture-hatted spinsters.

As for the magic systems, oh hell yes there's a disconnect there. The Belgariad wizards affect macro-scale changes to the environment through magic (Belgarion makes a storm happen and unintentionally fucks up global weather patterns doing so) and other really cool stuff while the HP wizards effectively channel and refine magic for vastly smaller-scale stuff that, in their own way, are just as bullshit (stunning spells that work on non-human biologies, spells that cancel kinetic force, spells that send an item somewhere crazy, the works).

That, and the HP wizards are basically batshit insane by Belgariad standards. Some of the good guys make the Malloreans, Nadraks and Murgos look sane and well-adjusted by comparison. Imagine the hilarity of dropping Bellatrix Lestrange on them-though not Voldemort, they'd probably confuse him for an Avatar of Torak.

Just picture angry Belgarath (ie Ctuchik and Zedar fights) facing, well, literally ANYONE from HP. I can't decide if Voldemort, Bellatrix or Dumbledore would be the most entertaining.
