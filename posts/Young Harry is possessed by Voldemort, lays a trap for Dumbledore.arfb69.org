This is before Hogwarts. I think Harry has the ring horcrux for some reason. Voldemort possessing Harry has a trap set up with runes or something in an attempt to kill Dumbledore when he comes to investigate why Harry is in an orphanage.

It's almost successful, but Harry is able to put up enough of a fight at a critical moment that Dumbledore recovers and incapacitates Harrymorte.

He takes Harry to the Flamels where the horcrux is dealt with, and I think Harry lives there for a while.

Anyone recognize this fic?

  On the night of Halloween 1981, Harry Potter vanished for eight years, reappearing at a Muggle orphanage with no recollection of his past. The deck stacked heavily against him, Harry arrives at Hogwarts, his past the key to the present's brewing storm.

** Hmm...nope. But I do know one where Harry is possessed by the scar Horcrux. It's pretty dark, but it eventually has a happy ending. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis]]
