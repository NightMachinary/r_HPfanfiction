  Voldemort is gone, now the question is: What to do with the Marked Ones that haven't really committed any crimes? The Wizarding World's solution: Place them under the care and â€˜protection' of a Guide from the Light. The problem is most of these Guides are wizards and witches who have lost love ones in the years of battle against the deranged wizard. As in the case of one Harry James Potter who cannot see Severus Snape go free after having killed his parents, godfather, and mentor. Severus Snape agrees. Snarry! This story is nothing like my other two. Harry will be way out of character. You have been warned.
