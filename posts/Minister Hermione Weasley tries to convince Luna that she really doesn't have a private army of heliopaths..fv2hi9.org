The Lovegoods seem to have really been into conspiracy's against the government and reported it in the Quibbler. Luna herself seemed to really believe stuff like Fudge turning Goblins into pie,Rufus Scrimgeour being a vampire or that the Auror's office is part of the Rotfang conspiracy and plans to give people gum disease to take over the ministry.

This prompt is basically, what if they didn't stop just because Luna's friends now control the government.


** "I know you don't Hermione." Luna said with a wink.

"No, really Luna I want you to understand this."

"I do." Luna said with a wink.

"Than why are you winking?"

"I'm not." Luna said with a wink.

*** Aww, okay but that would be so sweet. Imagine the Quibbler going crazy and Luna writing so much about all the “evidence” and Hermione being really mad at first and then she sees George laughing like he hasn't in years and it's all okay again.

*** I dont think there is any combination with the name Hermione that doesn't sound jarring, we simply have gotten used to it over the years.

*** Not particularly.

I never liked "Granger-Weasely" as a surname, as I saw it as a mouthful.

Granted, "Finch-Fletchy" isn't much shorter, but its alliterative and rolls off the tongue.

** Not my best work, but I had fun.

"Luna, please, have a seat."

"Is this a chair that will chain me up, so I'll be a prisoner?"

"No, Luna. Those are only in the Wizegamot."

"The chairs themselves aren't bolted in place. You could have moved one up to your office."

"I suppose I could have, but I didn't. Besides, the chairs bind the guilty. You are not on trial, so the chair would not bind you in the first place."

"Oh, right. This is a very nice chair. So Hermione, what did you want to talk to me about?"

"Your latest article in the Quibbler...."

"Oooh! Are you going to start a sanctuary for Crumple-Horned Snoracks? Hermione, you're wonderful!"

"No, Luna, I was talking about the one on heliopaths. Luna, they don't exist."

"Yes, they do."

"No, Luna. They do not!"

"Hermione, there's nobody here but us. You don't have to pretend."

"I am not pretending! Stop undermining my authority in your magazine!"

"But I haven't been undermining your authority. I agree with your protections with House Elves."

"Saying that the Department of Mysteries has a private army of heliopaths that are being trained as a weapon of mass destruction is too undermining me! You will cease it at once!"

"Hmmm...curious."

"What's curious?"

"I notice that when you get angry, your face turns red and your hair goes bushier than usual. Were you bitten by a Blittering Humdinger as a little girl?"

"No, I was not!"

"Pity. They're an effective technique against heliopaths."

"That's it! Come with me, I am taking you to the Department of Mysteries and I will show you that there are no heliopaths in the Ministry."

--------------

"Well, you were right about the heliopaths. But the Rotfang Conspiracy..."

"Quiet, Luna."

"I must say, taking our wands and hogtying us to the chandeliers is a rather effective technique."

"Quiet, Luna."

"It's rather uncomfortable, but it gives one a rather nice view of the battle though. The Rotfangers against Harry and Ron and oh, is that Ernie? He's lost weight!"

"Quiet, Luna."

"My shoulders ache, but I must say that it is rather nice to be able to watch the battle rather than fight for our lives in it. And Harry and Ron are winning!"

"Quiet, Luna."

"Oh dear. Poor Dawlish, do you think they'll be able to mend that at St. Mungo's?"
