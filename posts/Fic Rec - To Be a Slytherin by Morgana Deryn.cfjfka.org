If anyone's looking for a good, very long fic with an interesting premise and some nice character interactions, check this one out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/14/]]

Basic premise: Harry Potter is still the BWL, but has a twin sister, Lorena. They both went through 11 years at the Dursleys, and both have a scar (hers having been carved into her face by Voldie before he AKd Harry). She is more aggressive and cutting than him, so is sorted into Slytherin while he goes to Gryffindor. She becomes very good at Potions and builds a good relationship with Snape. Hijinks ensue.

I'm not very far in considering it's over 1 million words, but if it keeps even half its quality I'll stick with it to the end happily.

Someone here recommended it in another thread, so I wanted to pay it forward in case anyone else enjoyed it. Also, if you're the one who recommended it yesterday or the day before, thanks!


** Just finished. SO freaking good. SO sad it's over.
