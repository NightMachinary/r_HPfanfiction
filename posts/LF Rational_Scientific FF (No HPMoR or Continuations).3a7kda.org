I'm searching fictions in which the characters don't hold the idiot ball and throw it arround. Also avoid the Sue family if possible please.

To give some examples i like a lot :

The Arithmancer -con : not much conflict and slow pace , but i like the mathematical side

Hermione Granger and The Perfectly Reasonable Explanation -con : doesn't update so i can't really say much , it's stuck at her convincing McGonagall to learn Muggle Science , so it has potential.

-Runemaster Good, way too weak conflict , he's awesome and voldemort sucks ... wish fufillment but not entrataining.

Firebird triology Exceptional worldbuilding and background for the world he built , the best of the list given the conflict is real , too bad it hasn't really much rationality.

I've also read one in which harry become's barty jr's apprentice and they discover that voldemort is not so evil , can't remember the name

Anyway since FFN search feature cannot satisfy my thirst for a decent read i cry to help to my fellows.

Any suggestion is welcome :)


** It's kinda sad that we should settle for /anything/ not containing too many idiot balls because there isn't anything better in this regards.

That would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] (W: 183,000; Abandoned).

Another somewhat similar story to it would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] (W: 226,768; Abandoned) /but/ 1. it's a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue][Peggy Sue]] (and a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog]] one at that) and 2. it has a silly Harry&Voldemort slash subplot, sex scenes, and a Voldlermort that gradually degrades Out Of Character.

Since you've mentioned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation][HG & the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]], I reckon *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]* ([Slytherin Hermione]; W: 121,468; WiP) will also fit here.

--------------

Anyway, here's the main recommendation list:

- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]*;
- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]* (W: 232,797; WiP) --- portrays a [slytherin Harry] who tries to survive in a gradually worsening environment;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] (W: 152,578; WiP) --- [rational trio], [genre savvy trio];
- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]]* (W: 301,307; WiP) --- protagonist here has some similarities to HPMoR!Harry in his style of reasoning and actions;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][HE & the Spiral Path]] (W: 462,303; on hiatus) --- pretty rational protagonist and a world with some similarities to Firebird Triology in its harshness (contains sexual content and femslash though);
- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][LV & the Intricate Plots]]* (W: 110,202; WiP)--- tries to explore what a rational Voldemort would do;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] (W: 619,123; WiP) --- tries to portray a rational, brutal and ambitious Harry but has its Idiot Ball moments. Pretty much all the characters are OoCed.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*** I've read applied cultural antropology, hoping that it starts updating soon. I don't agree with slytherin hermione depiction but it's not unfathomable for a character development, so i find it rational enought. I also liked how lockhart has been characterized, way better than canon imho. Forging the sword is not my cup of tea. 12 years old swearing vengence on the universe beacuse a friend's death doesn't sound believable to me, it's poetic, sure, but not beliveable . I'm reading Holly evans and it's hilaros. Petunia trying to get her pregnant and her doing snarky comments about centaurs' "tools" is Killing me :D Added to the list also the rational Voldemort story. I'll check it later.

** It might not be exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] has a Scientist!Harry. The author has a well developed theory of magic and how it relates to (muggle) theories about force, substance, etc. I think the fact that Harry is blind adds to the story; he not only looks at the magical world in a more scientific way, he also literally preceives it differently. In general I would really recommend this story; it is one of the best out there.

** If you're bored and its rational(ish) fiction that you're looking for, I would recommend reading [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]], a web serial by Wildbow. It is essentially a rational story about superhumans. It is not scientific in the sense that stories such as HPMoR are, but there is a distinct lack of idiot balls. It's also just fucking amazing.

** Check out /Harry Potter and the Golden Needle/. Harry doesn't become a alchemy genius because he stumbled on the periodic table of elements. [[/s][Spoiler]] In general, this fic has some unique plot elements. I really enjoyed it. Writing quality is good and doesn't change canon willy nilly. Sadly it appears to be abandoned, but it's uniqueness makes it worth the read.

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

*** Read it recently , it's on hold waiting to be read when i finish more exciting ones. The main critic i have for that one is is that the wizarding word is far too stupid for it's own good.

I don't want a Rationalist story but at least a Rational one , that nobody did look up muggle science papers is just absurd , at least some intellectualy honest wizards must exist.

Hell a wizard in the first film is reading a Brief History of Time by stephen hawking , so curious wizards are at least partially canon.

That is only in the movies, correct? To me that doesn't hold as much weight as the books. That being said, I like that bit and it does stand to reason that there would be wizards like him.

Professor Vector meets those qualifications in this stories, she has studied in both the wizard and muggle worlds. I believe the author explains that other wizards have tried applying atomic or molecular thinking during transfiguration but without good results.

I agree that it's frustrating. But that is the world JKR wrote. I know that some people get upset that many fics portray magical Britain as a ignorant and backward, but it's just the way it is. They ARE ignorant and backward. There are probably plenty of examples to the contrary, i.e. half bloods or muggleborns who operate in both worlds. For all we know, the guy reading Hawking's book could have been curious but disdainful of it, gets a kick out of reading crazy muggle theories. He might treat it like Mr Weasely treats muggle things. It could be interpreted either way.

Remember that the books are wrote from Harry's POV , what harry doesn't think or doesn't explore isn't in the book.

There might completly functional Wizarding Scientific society that we know nothing about. (i've a fiction in my mind that i probably will never write with these connotation).

Practical applications of hard science are not obvious to the causal observer , expecially in a world of magic where distinguishing between sofisticated and simple magics is hard for an inexperienced obeserver (harry).

If the story was from Hermione's POV i would agree , she's really inquisitive , but harry's not so yeah ....

True, but the entire book is not Harry's internal narration. We get scenes from other's perspectives when Harry is not around, we here conversations that don't happen around him. Plus we do see him interact with a lot of prominent members of the society.

This is a great point. There are probably thousands of scientific innovations that have directly or indirectly influenced wizard life, but it would be hard to see the influence.

The hardest evidence i have to support this are brooms.

Doesn't it seem strange that for such a famous sport as quiddich , that went on for centuries there isn't an optimal broom yet? Sure there's always room for improvement but there are physical limits too , but cleansweeps are blown out of the water by the nimbus 2000 , which is blown away by the firebolt.

Such advancements are in a short timeframe too , it's glaringly obvious to me that the manifacturers are adapting enchantments with the most recent muggle knowledge of aereodynamics.

For other things we don't have much evidence , but at least i would add in Time Turners , it doesn't feel right having Time Turners without having a good knowledge of Relativity . Sure there might be almightly magic that blows quantuum computers out of the water , but it's a big might.

Edit : Oh i forgot , if you add computers with time magic you get something similar to P = NP ( i don't know the details) , you can do whatever calculation you want in any timeframe you want because you can loop the results back in time , the head of a computer scientist would explode. If i will ever write FF i will ban timeturners!

Ok i'll stop ranting .... i gave way too much thought to this topic ;)

******** I've heard about the P=NP. That would make some geads explode. I think your right, the time turner is a good example. As far as brooms, I don't think there are any significant ways to change the aerodynamics of a stick, pretty minimal drag in any form. But I could see phosics being a boon to the industry: calculating the inertial forces to determine cthe controls, etc.

  Somewhere on Tumblr, there is a GIF from the HP movies of a wizard sat in the Leaky Cauldron, using wandless magic to make a spoon stir his coffee, while he reads Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time". This story is a snapshot of his life.
