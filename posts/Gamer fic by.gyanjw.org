:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am trying to find a story I read a while back. It's a gamer fic that was left uncompleted. There's a scene where Harry is killed after his wand is stolen during the QWC, but he manages to go back to his last save point, which so happens to be at the top box. His reaction at his sudden death and return is misread by Fleur and her family, thinking it is the appearance of the Veela's down in the stadium. Please help me find this! Thank you!
