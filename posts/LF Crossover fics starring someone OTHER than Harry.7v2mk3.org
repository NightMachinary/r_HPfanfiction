I'd like to read a good crossover fic. It can be any other franchise you like....

...but I don't want Harry to be the main HP character in it. He can be IN the story, but I do not want him as the main character, or one of the main characters. I especially don't want any "Harry is raised by crossover character" stories. I'd much rather read a crossover story where someone other than Harry gets the chance to shine. It can be any character(s) at all, hero or villain, wizard or witch or Muggle.

But no Harry, no fem-Harry, no Harry-in-name-only, no Harry-possessed-by-Voldemort-so-he's-technically-not-Harry, no OC-who-is-the-Boy-Who-Lived-instead-of-Harry.

Got anything? :)

** So I am at a point where I am basically only reading Hermione-centric or fem!Harry stories, and Hermione-centric crossovers are my complete jam.

Marion Hood's HP/Supernatural and HP/Sherlock fics are excellent. I would start with Hermione's Angel linkffn(10076491) (I know it's not the best title, but it's worth the read), which is the oneshot prequel to The Family Business linkffn(10638344), or Flatmates linkffn(9835690).

Treeson's VanillaVerse is also HP/Supernatural and very fun if slightly cracky, starting with Hermione, an Abridged History linkffn(7033463).

Those are the only ones I can recommend unreservedly, so I'm definitely also looking into some of the other recs here!

** This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words. Plus Luna is so badass in this series.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is posted by MerciaLachesis or on Ao3, Mercia. Here are the links to both sites.

***** Read through most of them and... they're okay. Kind of lightweight, though, like the narration breezes through the events in a fairly superficial way without bothering to go into any depth or detail. But at least they weren't boring. :)

I'll admit I'm not really a big fan of Marvel's Loki. When you've grown up with the old Norse stories like I have, it's hard to accept Tom Hiddleston's tortured portrayal as the "real deal."

****** True. From what I gather from the author's notes, these stories are more of collective drabbles until the author decided to actually write out a more cohesive story with the most recent fics. The Love is Blindness one is where the author finally decided to write out a multi chaptered story. The narration should level out there.

I guess I can see where you are coming from with Loki. Personally, I do no have much knowledge about the actual Norse myths prior to the movies. But I imagine I would just keep Marvel's stories separate from the actual Norse legends. For example, in Thor: Ragnarok Hela was portrayed as the elder sister of both Thor and Loki when in the legends she was the daughter of Loki. You don't exactly have accept Huddleston's portrayal of Loki as the ‘real deal' , simply keep the two worlds apart.

******** I'm curious, how different is the Norse Loki that made him more fun? I really only know of a basic few stories off the top of my head, so I don't have enough information to compare them.

********* Well, for one thing he's a lot more unpredictable, certainly a lot less tormented and a lot more unapologetic. He's not necessarily evil, but he's definitely amoral, and he doesn't see anything wrong with this.

Whether or not he's a good guy or a bad guy is completely up in the air sometimes... he often causes the gods great harm, but just as often he gets them out of impossibly situations. And on several occasions he helps them out because he's played one too many pranks or crosses some line and been threatened with severe beatings unless he makes things right again.

He has an incredible gift of the gab and can talk his way out of anything... problem is that he can't stop himself from talking himself INTO trouble as well. Just as he thinks he's on top of the game and everything is going smoothly, he'll inevitably make some kind of snarky remark or ill-adviced boast that makes everything come crashing down around him.

He's got this sort of "vitriolistic best friend" vibe going on with Thor... that's probably why Marvel decided to turn them into brothers even if they aren't even related in the original myths; they do have that certain brotherly way of being best buds in one moment and be ready to kill each other the next, and then after they've cooled down they go out on several-week-long trips together and have many adventures.

Oh, and he's an incredible horn-dog. He's the most notorious of the gods for sleeping around, with men and women alike. An adept shapeshifter, he can take on both male or female form... or even animal form. (One of Odin's lines in the Poetic Edda claims that Loki once spent eight years as a woman, during which he gave birth to several children, apparently Just Because.)

Tom Hiddleston's Loki comes across more like a petulant and ungrateful "I hate you, adoptive dad" adoptive son, and is often framed in a more underdog-like way to make him more sympathetic. There's a certain "look how awful his life has been" angle here, leading to angst and internal torment...

The Loki of the myths would just have laughed at MCU-Loki, told him to get over himself and then gone on his merry way. Or alternately grown annoyed that MCU-Loki was getting more popular, and conspire to play some trick on him to humiliate him or take him down a peg.

********** Huh, I have heard a few of those. Loki certainly sounds more interesting in the stories. Especially the shapeshifter thing. I definitely found that amusing. Though I'm not going to lie, there's a certain charm to MCU-Loki that I can appreciate. I guess that why I see them as two different Loki's. Their base characteristics are there, but they have different stories to make them who they are. Similar to how I keep so many other writers' take on Harry Potter characters separate.

Anyways, I do wonder what the outcome of the two Loki's meeting would turn out.

  "But Loki decided that only the other moon was really worth mentioning." Luna sees too little(none at all) and then too much. Loki needs a hug. But if you close your eyes (does it almost feel like nothing's changed at all? PART ONE of the Under the Moon Series.
