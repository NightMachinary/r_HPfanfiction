I made a post about this the other day but I thought I should type it up properly and try and see if people will take part.

I also really want this to be a community thing rather than a "i'm really bored and thought this would be fun so i'm going to take total control" thing. So i've left some gaps below that can hopefully be worked out in the comments of this thread.

*The Format*

Knockout debating tournament, 1v1 leading to the final where a champion would be crowned.

Each debate will have a topic to be discussed with the two competitors getting 24 hours to prepare their arguments after being informed of the topic.

Each will then make their own starting point in a separate comment, one persons being pro and the others against the topic (so two starting comments in the thread). Then each competitor will get the chance to reply to the others starting comment and so on for 5 replies in each starting comment. So a total of 11 comments per competitor (Starting comment, 5 replies in the other comment, 5 to their own).

*The Rules*

1) All sidebar rules apply.

2) (See comments)

*Determining the victor*

Can't decide here but my ideas so far are; we can either have a panel of judges that will openly discuss the debate then take a vote for the winner, we can have a strawpoll open for a certain period of time for the community to vote, or a combination of the two where we can have judges comment and then have a community vote after.

Anyway, let me know what you think. I'd really like to get this started soonish so i'm going to make comments for rule ideas, debate topic ideas and a sign up sheet below, hope a lot of people take part. :)

** I think the number of posts is a but much. Giving people that much leeway is an invitation to tangential spirals and bickering over minor technicalities rather than the central issue of the debate.

Three posts should be sufficient: opening statement, reply, concluding remarks.

Word limits are also wise to keep the debate focused and readability high. I would suggest upper limits as follows:

Opening: 1000 words

Reply: 1500 words

Conclusion: 500 words

** There needs to be some kind of rule about interaction with non-debaters.

I'd propose:

1. After the concluding remarks are finished, but before the vote, the debate moderator creates a top level comment which is for official audience Q&A. Audience members are allowed to ask short, narrowly focused questions at a specific debater, who must give a short reply. Maximum question length: 50 words. Maximum answer length: 250 words. Audience "questions" that aren't questions but rather grandstanding are deleted.

2. Any post by the audience before the vote, except those in the official Q&A, will be deleted.

3. After the vote is closed and the victor declared, posting is a free for all.

EDIT: by which I mean some of those can start mini-shitstorms on DLP, so they'll probably explode the sub here.
