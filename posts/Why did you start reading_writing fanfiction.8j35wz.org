I know a lot of you nice people on this sub are fanfic writers (I know about that 350k word Dramoine smut fic on your alt account by the way you filthy animals). Just exactly why did you start writing fanfiction? Like was it a spur of the moment thing, like "I can't sleep, better write about Snape banging Harry" sort of thing, or were you introduced by friends into the fandom and started writing?

Personally, I started reading fanfiction after discovering linkffn(Weasley Family Heartbreak) from somewhere, I'm sure. It got me hooked, and now I'm about to fail my finals because I spend most of the time I should be studying reading about inane drabbles about fictional characters in a fictional world doing fictional things that I want to do because it warms my cold, dead, ^{^{^{lonely}}} heart.

What's your fanfiction story?


** Technically, I started writing a fanfiction story in the 1990s, when the FFML was a thing. I never really got past the first scene, though, and never started another story until I got too fed up with Marriage Law Stories in the Summer of 2014, and wrote my first HP story. I've been writing regularly - at least one chapter per week - ever since.

** TVtropes. I kept stumbling upon examples from /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, and quotes from it which looked engaging and funny. So eventually I gave in and read it. I read all the fanfanfics thereof, and, craving more, took a recommendation to /The Artihmancer/ and /Seventh Horcrux/. And from there, well, here I am.

** I read Cursed Child and read a couple reviews saying that it is shit (it was) and there are fanfics which are better. Curiosity killed the cat, so here I am.

As for writing, there were stories which I wanted to read but have not been written, so I decided to simply write them. It couldn't be that hard, right? Let's just say that I will never publish the first 50-80k I've written and had to update the early parts of my published stories more than once because I got better at writing and realised how flawed they were (and I am still surprised that anyone faved/followed those atrocities against the English language.

With my most popular story recently breaking 1000 follows, I would argue that I have come a long way but also still have a long way to go.

** It's been so long I'm not even sure I found it in the first place. Just had a quick look through my ff.net account and a lot of my ‘favourite stories' have the pre-2008 tag for when I favourited them so it's been over 10 years. I also have a 1 chapter abandoned story dated mid-2007 that I started then promptly remembered I hate writing, I was 12 when I posted that chapter. So I've been reading fanfiction since I was around 10 or 11 I think. I started with Stargate then found ff.net and discovered the HP category and the rest is history!

** A few years ago I was introduced to the rationalist community by a friend, and HPMoR in specific. It was my first real exposure to fanfiction as such, and a fairly stellar one at that (despite being overly preachy at times, it remains one of my favourites.) From there I wound up at Seventh Horcrux and Natural Twenty by a process I can't begin to remember, and from those three absolutely amazing examples I eventually wandered into fanficdom as a whole.

I started writing fanfiction with KotOR actually, [because Leviathan!Malak annoys me;] my visit to the HP side is relatively recent. I mostly wind up writing what I can't find anywhere yet, even though I'm really not qualified to write them at all. [What was I thinking? Madness. I'm sure in a few years I'll deeply regret this whole attempt.]

Unfortunately, it seems the past year and a half of fanfic reading/writing has broken my mind, because now I can't watch/read /anything/ anymore without immediately being inundated with fic ideas I have no time to write.

** I was about 12ish when I started reading fanfiction, shortly after OotP was published and I think it was just that I needed more Harry Potter while I waited for the next books. As a young girl who fashioned herself like Hermione and was in love with Draco, the Dramione ship let me live out an ending I knew was never going to happen. I don't even remember how I found out it was a thing, just stumbled into it I think.

As for writing? I just like to write and it's nice to be a part of the community.

** I accidentally found a fanfic when searching for something HP related on Google. I read it out of curiosity (it was a dramione I think) and discovered a whole new world. After having read fanfiction for a month or so I decided to write my own because I've always liked writing so why not give it a go. It was a crossover and it was awful, but I had fun.

Anyways, at first I only read HP fanfiction but then I started reading works from other fandoms and now I'm obsessed and I've gone way too long without reading a published book. And I have lots at home that are waiting for me but I prefer fanfiction most of the time.

** I don't really remember! It's just a fun hobby I picked up this past year, like anything else I do. I mean I love Harry Potter and Star Wars, so getting to read fanfiction about them is like continuing the story and staying in the universe and all even after the main books and stuff are over.

Also though, it's sort of become a therapy away from my actual therapy sessions for me, in that I use the stories I've started writing myself to explore and help myself with my issues - my abusive childhood, PTSD resulting from it, and even my issues from being on the autism spectrum.

** Why I started rereading the books when I did is a bit long and boring, but I always liked Sirius and thought he was an underused character. I felt really sorry for him because Rowling made him so useless and he'd have hated that. So I started writing a story about him. And then I discovered that what I was doing was writing fanfiction.

I was never much good as a writer really, but once I was bitten by the bug I just kept working at it. I am better than I used to be but I've probably got as far as I can with it now.

** I probably read less fanfic than most people on this sub.

I love essays about Harry Potter. Breaking down character motivations, etc. A few years ago I went on a binge, but it wasn't too long before I ran out of good essays. Then I found [[/r/harrypotter]], which has some good content, but far too many people posting their latest tattoo or whatever for my taste. That sub led me to this sub, where I read all of the posts with orange Discussion flair, where people talk about character motivations and characterizations. That's what I /really/ like (i.e. the idea of /how/ to write Luna well and in a mainly-canon-compliant way is so much more interesting than an actual story about Luna), but I occasionally try out a fic if it sounds interesting.

** I was vaguely aware of the existence of fanfiction, but the horribleness that was DH and its epilogue gave me the shove I needed. I was hungry for anything that took the story in another direction after HBP or even OotP, in particular when they ignored Rowling's ideas of romance.

I wrote my only one-shot because I wanted to address the common argument "Everything worked out in the end, therefore what Dumbledore did was alright". There's still some more plotbunnies about scenarios where everything could have gone to shit flying around in my head, but lack the writing discipline to bring them out.

** Well I ended up getting into it because a fan comic I had read for Naruto seemed interesting given the trash heap that was the canon ending, and I was actually googling its name in hopes that there was more of it elswhere. Who'd have thought it was actually an illustration of a Naruto fanfic and that it'd suck me into this (hellhole)?

Started writing fanfics for a similar reason. It let me satisfy my desire to write world's where my annoyances with canon were done away with.

** I actually came to fanfiction in a really round about way. I was really into yoai manga (or Japanese comics aimed at women featuring boy/boy) which lead to yoai dojinshi (fan comics) about my favorite anime, to anime fanfiction which lead me to the wide world of fanworks! I started writing it when i became suuuuuper depressed and basically existed only on fanfiction all day, everyday. it was something familiar yet completely engaging. during this time I would make up stories before I slept in order to focus on something that wasn't in any way real life. I've found I'm not nearly so good at coming up with fanfiction and getting written out now that I'm not depressed, so I'm not as active in writing as I was.

** I might be an outlier in that I was already a fairly serious writer when I started. I kept seeing references to HPMoR and checked it out, and that got me hooked on /reading/ fanfiction (even though I had terrible taste at first). /Writing/ came a few months later after I'd read a frankly alarming amount of stories and kept getting ideas about how I could do some of them better, or came up with new angles on the books. At that point, there's a quote fro/m Living Without Dang/er that I always use, which is, "The story kicks at the inside of my head until I let it out." And that's basically how I felt at the time. Luckily, my idea mill has become more refined since then, too.
