TL;DR - go to my last paragraph for Harry's ~~anonymous~~ name

We all know the trope of Harry James Potter Slytherin Gryffindor Peverell Merlin. I was just now reading a fic and to be honest was thinking about stopping my reading in the first chapter. It's a time travel, which I really enjoy when done well, but it has older Harry placed back in his 11 year old body for some reason. I think more of his classmates (Ron, Hermione, Draco, Dean Thomas, Ginny, etc...) are also thrown back in time, but I'm not sure because it's explicitly Harry's POV so far. Anyways, he's been acting very adultish and there a lot of tropes like Bad!Dumbledore who's a theif and a forever extendable trunk with 50 rooms.

To get to my point of this post: it was just revealed that Harry's true name is Hieronymus James Sirius Evan Potter. HIERONYMOUS! I don't know if it's from the old priest (who I googled) or if it's a play on like Diagon Alley of anonymous heir. This is ridiculous! I've never read a dumber first name for Harry in a fanfic (sorry to the author, i'm just not a fan of your naming style)! I actually laughed when I read it and I darted straight here to post this. I guess I just wanted to start a discussion on bad names in fanfiction and in canon.

** Hieronymous is a fantastic name with lots of interesting history.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus]]

A good choice for Harry? Well, unfortunately, that depends on how well an author can execute it.

*** Henry is more believable since they are in England and Hadrian could be explained away because of the Roman emperor if J&L were for some reason fans of him, it's the ridiculously different ones that are hard to swallow, kind of wished that there was a story in which it is revealed that the reason Harry has such a name is that J&L were stoned out of their minds when filling the birth certificate and then ran to do damage control by saying to everyone his name was Hart so he wouldn't get bullied quite as badly at school (can you imagine going to school with a name like Hieronymous?)

** Probably chosen by the author in homage to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Bosch][Harry Bosch]] from the long-running mystery series (and now Amazon TV show) whose legal first name is Heironymous. That one was named after the painter due to having parents who were huge fans and scholars.

*** Hardly anyone in the UK is called Hadrian. Adrian, sure. But Hadrian not so much.

It annoys the crap out of me, because it feels like fic writers are looking for a "posh" name that Harry can be short for, and they default to Hadrian, whereas in the UK Harry is much more likely to be a diminutive of Henry, and if you want a "posh" name I'm not sure it gets posher than the name that eight different kings and countless princes and dukes have gone by...

**** Retroactively, Harry has also become a posh name, even if the bearer is a bit...unorthodox, by royal standards, anyway.

Edit : Said Prince his birthname is also Henry. Your point stands.

*** I like the name Hadrian. Hadrian was one of the best emperors of the Roman Empire and under him it also had its greatest expansion and was very stable. The Hadrian Wall, for example, was designed to secure the empire from the outside. Please excuse the history execution.

**** It is also not that Roman Emperor's true name. Render it as Hadrianus. English has a nasty habit of shortening latin names ending on -us. If you want to be posh, use the Roman rendering of his name, not an English barbarification.

***** That's right, I couldn't agree more. Also in German we have the habit of abbreviating Latin names. although the complete title and name of the Emperor is somewhat lengthy Emperor Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus. But to sound noble, Hadrianus would be better than Hadrian.

** H-H-H-HIERONYMOUS???!!!!! WAS THAT AUTHOR GOOD?? Honestly, I dislike all ‘variations' or as I say, F-ed up versions of Harry's name, whether it be a longer version like Hadrian, Hardiwyn or Harold, or numerous middle names. I can take multiple titles, as long as it's only one , like Harry James Potter-Black. Most of the titles he is given are just Overpowered houses with a ridiculous/strange history that nobody knows how he claimed them, or houses that do not make sense to befall into Harry's hands. Honestly, HOW IS HE RELATED TO HUFFLEPUFF, RAVENCLAW OR MERLIN??? Most of the time I just quit the fic straight away and never read it again, unless it's crack.

Also, here's a brilliant example of what we all love-Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin and many more titles, 11year old politics and an overpowered child. I pray that this is crack/parody, although it's not mentioned in the tags. Without further ado,

Scrap that, I seem to have lost the fic. If anyone can help me find it, I think it's quite short and the title pairing is Harry/Daphne.

  Harry Potter is thrust into a world where manipulations run wild and his friends aren't really his friends at all. Ohno whatever shall he do? Join Harry and the lovd of his life around as they venture into the four corners of the earth. HAPHNE forever! Hooray! Rated M for some slick, wet scenes coated with lime and lemons!
