I have several ideas that I want to write about, and they are essentially in the Transformers Prime or Transformers Cyberverse fandoms.

Blood Bandy Vegas Challenge (is that right?):

Fem Harry (Jade Potter) gets married to either Fem Optimus Prime or Fem Megatron, or both, and has to deal with the consequences of it, (it's fanfiction, so suck up the complaints). And Jade gets transformed into a Cybertronian to be with her wife because, magic/ fanfiction. This is in Transformers Prime, or TFP for short.

For the Cyberverse idea, basically the same thing, but it's with Windfall, when she first arrives on earth and checks out Vegas first, or something like that

​

Or after the war, she moves to Jasper, and gets captured by M.E.C.H (TFP) and gets transformed through the power of Fanfiction, and joins the Autobots or something.

​

So, thoughts?


** Seems to be mostly set in transformers rather than hp. You might find slightly more purchase in one of those subreddits.

Id also encourage you to limit the amount of handwaving you do via magic/fanfiction. Just a little extra time to add in a dimensional gateway or something that comes back into play later will really help stabilize your world for your readers.

Of course, if youre just wanted to get fun ideas onto a page, then the worlds are your sandbox. Ppl interact with writing in very different ways, so you can really do whatever strikes your fancy.
