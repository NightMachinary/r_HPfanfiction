I've seen quite a few fics with a fictional in-universe series of books on Harry's life mentioned. A lot of times, Harry sues the authors and publishers because the books are inaccurate, but marketed as non-fiction. I'd love to see this explored more. Maybe someone could try to recreate some of the books? What are some of the things you think could be written about as an in-universe novel?


** I like the idea of there being children's books with Harry being a kid going on adventures. Like illustrated bedtime books. ‘Harry Potter and the Goblin Princess / Invisible Dragon / Giants Tower'. They all have a little scenario where a child Harry has a mini adventure and there is some kind of moral or learning experience. There's a crossover with that Mad Muggle character. When Harry is 9/10 they get a bit more relatable like ‘Harry Potter goes to school'.

Maybe it's deliberate by the author or just an accident but Harry (in the books) grows to be a bit condescending to others and the readers get a bit put off by him. This is why Rita Skeeter is so effective and believed, because the wizard world has a pre-existing idea of who Harry is.
