What is the difference is there is any?


** Fictionhunt is an archival website largely for HP fanfiction taken from Fanfiction.net. Fanfiction.net is where authors originally published their fanfics, and Fictionhunt trawls the website and backs up the stories.

Fictionhunt has a slicker design and apparently prides itself on its search features, but they also basically just "backup" all the stories without permission from the authors or anything.

** On ff.net, authors post their own stories, receive feedback, interact with readers, and have creative control of their own work.

Fictionhunt is an unauthorized aggregator; it scoops archives and basically steals the stories without the authors' consent in order to re-post content. The only control a writer has, if they even know their work has been copied, is to ask that it be removed. FH is reasonably quick to accommodate take-down requests. (Although I just name-searched myself and discovered two of my fics are still there, damn it.)

*** Thank you for this information. I just checked and two of my stories are there. Hopefully they will be removed soon.

Funny bit is, one of mine has only 15 chapters at this point, but their version has 38 (and they're all out of order).

Maybe I should give it a read through and see if the next twenty chapters are going to be good or not.

**** You're welcome for the heads-up. Someone else did the same for me in the not-so-distant past.

Hah, this is what happens when bots scrape websites using such broad search parameters: incoherent mess.

Although, wouldn't it be interesting if you found chapters there you have no memory of writing? Shades of the future? Literal ghost writer? But no, it's probably just random duplication.

***** Yeah, I decided to read through. The chapters are out of order and a few of them appear three times. No new material.

I'm really disappointed. My next chapter has been impossible to write, and I was hoping for inspiration from my future or ghostly self.

** Yikes, thanks for the heads-up. I just found most of my stories there. It's creepy that they didn't ask my permission to put them up. I just asked them to take them down.

*** To be honest I didn't think my question would end up like this. I happen to stumble on the site I clicked a link for a fanfic from another post. Though I am glad that my post allowed authors to find their stories posted their consent.

** Wow I can't believe how unpopular this site is... At least with writers. All it is doing is storing your stories as a backup it is not trying to to take credit for your work... They even give you credit using the same name.

FH is great for readers because of the search function is much better, the UI is way better and this is just the beginning. There are plans to add more items like collections (think of kinda like a Playlist crossed with ffn communities). More details about story information and others.

FFN is all based on older code that has been needing updated for years but when ws the last time they really did any front-end chances? Years because they stopped trying to improve the site and any tech company that refuses to chance stagnants. So yeah they do not ask permission but they will remove content if asked in a timely way and if ffn devs just want to be lazy why not support a site that is only trying to get you writers more readers?
