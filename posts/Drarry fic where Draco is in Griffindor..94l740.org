I read this fic quite a while ago and I can't find it anywhere now, I think it was on fanfiction.net but I could be wrong. It was a fic where Draco went back in time and tried to make things right but he ends up in Griffindor and becomes really close to Harry, they sleep in the same bed and the other Griffindors call them their 'pet Slytherins'. At some point Draco gets upset that he's messing up the timeline and distances himself from Harry so he can be with Hermione and Ron but they both get really depressed and he finally realises that he had such an influence on Harry that he was a different person than before and that Harry did in fact need him. If this sounds familiar to anyone please tell me what's the fic name.
