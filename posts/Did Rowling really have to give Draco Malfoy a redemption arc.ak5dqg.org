** I don't generally think authors /have/ to do anything. Ultimately, it's up to them and the story they want to tell. That being said, as a fan of redemption arcs, I'm all for it. Draco didn't have much in the way of compelling traits throughout the first several books, but he did have the benefit of being a child/teenager with parents who instilled a certain amount of toxicity. That's an easier sell than a fully grown character espousing the same beliefs and attitudes. A more dramatic shift could have been done. Whether or not it would have been better or worse than canon is hard to say. Personally, I probably would have enjoyed it more than Snape's, but that's just me.

Regardless of Draco's redemption or lack thereof, I generally find Rowling's statements on the subject to be incredibly condescending. Enjoying Draco---or similar characters or redemption arcs in general---is no more or less unhealthy than most other fictional preferences.

*** Yes, I actually would have found Draco's redemption arc more interesting than Snape's. Draco was raised from birth to think muggles were horrible, likely never met a muggle, etc. He was basically brainwashed, and it would have been interesting to see him "shake it off" and become a better person. His childhood isn't an excuse, but it makes his actions more understandable than Snape's imo.

I can't ever sympathize with Snape that much, because he knew there were good muggles (Lily had loving parents) and he had exposure that not all muggles were his dad, etc. He wasn't brainwashed (not that it is an excuse, but at least it provides some context). And he "still" decided to join a hate group hell bent on eradicating muggles and muggleborns.

**** A redemption arc generally requires the character to have done something which warrants the possibility or need for redemption. I'm not sure what Cho or Lavender have done that would be considered such. Being teenage girls? Having feelings? I'd love to see more stories about either or both of them, and they're certainly capable of having wonderfully written arcs and development. However, neither would be my first choice for this specific type of story.

I'd also note that going to prison and having a redemption arc aren't mutually exclusive. One can certainly involve the other. Canon may not have gone in that direction, but that doesn't mean fandom can't. I'm personally open to stories where a character finds redemption separate from the, perhaps, realistic legal consequences, but that's not the only option.

***** Cho picked Marietta's side, who just had completely sabotaged the DA, got Dumbledore booted out of Hogwarts and took away the one chance they had at learning how to defend their lives. She not only collaborated with a woman who tortured and maimed children and considered the Cruciatus an acceptable disciplinary method. Marietta also did more to further Voldemort's cause than almost anyone short of actual Death Eaters and Umbridge. And Cho saw no fault with that, she even defended her.

Lavender needs no redemption, but the fandom loves to shit onto her for being overly affectionate. I like her, but that is not a popular stance in the fandom.

****** Marietta was a teenage girl who probably led a fairly sheltered life. To draw a modern analogy, consider how big a role ISIS plays in the life of your average American high school student (let's call her Mary). For Mary, ISIS is a distant threat seen only in the news.

Then Mary's classmate from NYC (who was at Ground Zero for "bring your child to work" day) starts up a defense club teaching other students how to fire guns and defuse IEDs in case ISIS comes back. She goes because all her friends are going, but never really considers ISIS to be a serious threat- that's what the military is there, right?

One day a member of the President's cabinet shows up at her school and tells her that she can either turn in her friends (who joined an illegal weapons training class without adult supervision or oversight) or her mother will lose her job at the DMV. When Mary does, one of the club members tracks her down and carves the word "SNEAK" into her face.

Hermoine doesn't look so justified now, does she? Marietta was a girl forced to chose between her friends or her family, and she chose her family- and was permanently maimed because Hermoine wasn't mature enough to realize that the world isn't black and white. Can you truly fault Marietta?

******* Only, that one of her classmates was executed by ISIS the previous year, and they had Al Quaida torture children at her school for most of the ongoing year. And while her mother might be a member, that doesn't make it right to collaborate. She had witnessed the atrocities first hand (pun not intended).

Hermione should have put a significantly worse curse on the list. What you can Hermione blame for is not telling the people after they signed, because that would have made it much more effective at keeping their secret.

******** While I can't argue with the Cedric Diggory part, Umbridge was not a supporter of Voldemort during OotP. /At the time/ she was a high ranking member of the official and lawful government of magical Britain. Furthermore, we have no indication that Umbridge used a Blood Quill on any other students besides Harry, and Harry did his best to hide it from his friends. Name one atrocity carried out by the Ministry that Marietta would have realistically known about, given that she was a member of the general public who lacked the information and perspective of our protagonists.

Furthermore, she was a child. Let's disregard the "strong independent teenager with plot armor" fantasy and look at the situation realistically. None of the Hogwarts students should have been involved in the war effort to begin with. Expecting 15 and 16 year old children to pick up arms and lead a resistance movement isn't a brave and noble thing to do, it's a war crime.

For Marietta (and most of the DA) it was a way to pass their OWLs, not a life or death thing. Sure, her classmates said Voldemort's back- but the government and her parents were saying that he wasn't. Even Hermoine fell prey to the "adults know best" mindset in earlier books- but Hermoine had the experiences as Harry's friend to shake her out of that mindset, where Marietta didn't.

If you look at it from her perspective instead that of the protagonist, or the perspective of an omnipotent reader who has an external view of the situation (and possibly several years of experience and maturity on Marietta) I think you'll find that Marietta can be pretty easily forgiven.

People often seem to forget that there are /three/ sides in any civil war, not just two- the government, the rebels, and the civilians caught between them.

Not to disagree with your assessment of Marietta (quite the opposite), but Harry does see Lee Jordan cradling his hand after a detention, and suggests murtlap essence to him.

Also, ignore Hellstrike when he goes like this. He's very excitable, almost like a teenager, and blows things way out of proportion, although he has toned his Marietta angle down somewhat. Last time he talked about her, he was all for trying the girl in a military tribune for high treason or something along those lines. All for snitching her schoolmates to a school teacher.

********* No one was expecting the DA to lead the resistance. It was a self defence training and Harry made it clear that fighting Voldemort is suicidal. I mean, they learned the Patronus charm, which os clearly defensive magic against a creature.

And unless Harry wore gloves 24/7, people would have noticed scars on the back of his hand. Then there was Lee Jordan and it seems implausible that others didn't suffer the same fate. And even disregarding that, the educational decrees were clearly power plays and severe violations of basic rights. It was clear that they were not about improved education.

Lastly and most importantly, Marietta was in her 6th year. So no OWLS or NEWTs for her.

****** Honestly, that's fair. It's been a while since I've read OoTP, so while I did recall Cho's stance on Marietta, I couldn't and still don't quite remember the order of things and how much information she would have had regarding Umbridge's worst traits. That being said, loyalty to a friend who fucked up in an awful way still isn't the type of redemption arc that appeals to me personally. I prefer characters who, for various reasons, really hold awful views or do genuine harm. It makes the character growth which can stem from that point all the more rewarding.

In terms of Lavender, I'm not terribly surprised by the fandom. She's got a combination of traits which are pretty prone to being... badly reacted to. That being said, I've got no problem with her. If we're throwing redemption arcs to the good guys, she'd probably be one of the last ones I'd think of.

If the former is what you enjoy, that's awesome. My interest lies in the latter.

***** Age is not necessarily irrelevant in these circumstances. There are all sorts of international conventions that address children and teenagers (under-18, under-16, etc, depending on the agreement and circumstances) involved in war and hostilities, be it as combatants, material support, messengers, spies, etc.

In most (virtually all) cases, neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment are on the table for minors. A combination of rehabilitation and reintegration is more ideal, though imprisonment is sometimes also involved.

I don't think it's unrealistic to think that Draco, who (despite already being a bigoted bully) was pressed into service under coercion at about 15 or 16 years old. He did some terrible things - and he was always a pretty shitty individual - but he also backed down at times he was compelled to kill (see: Dumbledore), his mother offered some (highly self-serving) support to Harry in the Forbidden Forest, and the entire family walked off when they were reunited and the opportunity presented itself. We have a pretty good sense in the epilogue that Draco wound up being safely reintegrated into the Wizarding World.

****** Do you really want to use the epilogue to measure character worth? The epilogue where Ron assaults a muggle with mind magic to commit fraud? Even then it proves nothing because his father also looked to be well integrated ten years after a war, and look how that turned out.

The British law does not apply underage sentences in case of crimes like murder or attempted murder. By carrying them out the offender proves that he is not a child. Coercion also is not a factor because it only is valid if the threatened punishment is worse than the crime committed. Again, attempted murder cannot be overmatched in that regard.

And the Hague convention has no exemption for being underage. If you are fighting a war, you are responsible for your actions. And given how vocal Malfoy was before his forced service, it wouldn't stick either way.

Narcissa's actions are irrelevant for determining Malfoy's punishment.

I think a redemption arc would need like, visible growth and change over a period of time. all Draco gets is a few scenes where he like tries to commit murder but doesn't have the stomach for anything other than manslaughter :/ (I'm oversimplifying ofc, but that's the gist)

he doesn't display much change in canon, and not being okay with killing ppl is a very low bar for ppl to be setting him. I agree, I don't think a redemption arc was necessary there. there were other characters who reflected that, like you said.

In my mind a redemption arc is where you realize the errors of your ways, help others out and in turn those people you help out realize that you weren't quite as big of a jerk as they thought.

He still hates Muggleborns, and likely still hates "blood traitors" and similar stuff, but he wasn't a killer, he was given the option of killing Dumbledore and he couldn't go through with it.

Doesn't mean he was redeemed. If anything I'd say that Harry still mistrusts him, Ron still hates him, Draco is more than likely trying to keep his nose clean and not do any more damage, than what was already done; nothing more and nothing less.

** The lovely thing about reading books is the freedom to interpret any action of any character; that even though we read the same words we still reach different conclusions and end up liking or relating to characters for different reasons. Our experience of the world of Harry Potter is highly subjective, so is it that hard to believe there are people who like Draco Malfoy and think he deserves a second chance?

It saddens me to see an author failing to notice (or more often choosing to ignore) the good sides they, intentionally or not, had given their characters. I'm not claiming Draco Malfoy was misunderstood or that he had a heart of gold or anything - but he certainly wasn't an evil incarnate that many fans make him out to be. As fanfiction writers/readers, we are often more intrigued by villains than we are by heroes, and I think that has a lot to do with their potential for change. Draco's (canonically established) moral ambiguity gives us something to work with.

Tbh, I don't think Draco's popularity in the fandom has much to do with him having redeeming qualities but rather his huge potential for character development- it's quite a challenge to pull off and is almost always satisfying in the end. We like being surprised by characters and seeing one do a 180 is fascinating, whether from good to bad or bad to good.

It's what makes Dumbledore so damn frustrating. In many ways, Snape is the same as Malfoy. JKR redeems Snape simply because he loved Lily Potter. He didn't actually have any redeemable actions in Canon. He actually sent Harry to his death, which somehow leads to Harry naming a child after him. Malfoy even as late as the last chapters of the last book was still trying to kill Harry and his Friends.

And yet no one wonders about his other crimes, it's all forgiven....

I wish Dumbledore, or McGongall, for once called him out. Said sure, James Potter was a shitty bully towards you as a child, but he grew up and stopped. You never stopped bullying, you bullied children as an adult which is far worse. And judging by your guilt over Lily's death, you know you had a role in the Potters death. So helping to orphan his son and having a role in his death is far worse than whatever James did to you, so you have some nerve to keep harping on the wrongs he did you while he's long dead, and complaining about bullying when you bully children.

** I've had to re-write my post 7-8 times already. Yes 1-5 had seen him not really being active in regards to the Death Eaters yet spouting their ideology because thats what he grew up with. Year 6 had him take an active role and had him realize that this life required a lot more than he expected. Year 7 even has him slowly breaking away from his previous life. So I say that he already had his redemption arc, as internal as it was.

I'd also like to point out that books 1-5 were very black and white in regards to morality (Sirius being a good guy from a bad family) yet in book 6 things became a lot more grey for a lot of characters. We learn that Regulus, a death eater and tried helping to destroy Voldemort, Dumbledor is fallible, Snape while still an asshole tried to do something good, and Draco learned that being a Death Eater is a lot more of a precarious position than he realized.

*** I highly recommend the series "We must unite within her walls or crumble within," which takes another look at background characters and their flaws from a sympathetic standpoint. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2330390][Ugly: In Defense of Pansy Parkinson]]" really stands out in this regard.

#+begin_quote
  Let's talk about how Pansy Parkinson was a bully, how she sliced and cut with words, how she lied, cajoled, and taunted. She probably left some scars that never quite healed.

  Now let's talk about James Potter.

  Let's talk about James and his carefully rumpled hair and his cruel entertainments. Let's talk about how McGonagall wept for him, how Hagrid bawled, how Lily loved him and Harry stood tall in his image.

  No one wept for Pansy Parkinson.

***** I found that story ridiculously frustrating. James was bad, no doubt, but at his worst, he still wasn't a pureblood supremacist or willing to sacrifice an innocent person to save his life. It's as if the author was incapable of seeing any complexity and nuance in their determination to make a point on misogyny. Whatever Rowling's faults, Pansy Parkinson of all people not being redeemed wasn't a mistake.

****** Yeah, thing is even James wasn't "bad" really---he was a shit bully towards Severus, but even then he grew out of it by seventh year and he wasn't that way towards others (it's implied that he was on a different level towards Severus because of his jealously over Lily). That story makes the characters way too one-dimensional. And I'm no fan of Snape, but again, he at least did something semi-good in the end and Pansy did nothing to deserve that semi-redemption.

The only comparison I thought was a bit good was that people were willing to overlook Draco but not her

**** It's a bad comparison. Even at his worst bullying, James wasn't using racial slurs. Pansy was. There's a difference between a bully, and a bully who attacks someone with homophobia, anti-semitism, or racism---something white, straight people can't usually recognize.

I wanted Draco to have a redemption arc, not because the lack of one is unrealistic, but because it's /depressing/.

I like to judge children's fiction partially based on what message they are sending, and I think letting kids know that just because your parents are racist doesn't mean /you/ have to be racist is a better message than whatever it is we actually got. That some people are terrible and you should just avoid them, I guess - which is valid, but again, depressing.

I agree with the post you linked: Draco had such /potential/. It could have been a brilliant transformative arc, showing the demons that come with prejudice, with going against your family, with trying to become /better/. And not having that...just...sucks.

In Season 1-2, Zuko is arrogant, foolish, and consumed by his quest to capture the Avatar. The point is (and the analogy I'm making), is that Zuko has a plethora of faults that he later overcomes /which makes him into the compelling character he is/. Draco, in much the same manner, has that same plethora of faults...but no arc to overcome them.

And there's the similarity with Draco. Zuko tries to conform to his father's demands and expectations -- that's what sets him off on his quest. Draco is the same, just more indoctrinated into the culture of prejudice that surrounds him. But Zuko is given the chance to cast off his shackles, while Draco present a pitiful parallel. And yet, despite all that, even Draco manages to give us a glimpse of bravery in the moment when he refuses to turn in the captured trio. That is really the killer here -- it shows that Draco does have the /potential/ to become better, but is never turned down that path.

********** Draco is heinously abused his father -- and grandfather, just not in a direct manner. It is /their/ choices that steal his own, that lead to a 16-year-old kid taking the dark mark and having the threat of his family's death hanging over his shoulder while being given a suicidal quest.

Regardless... I understand the point you're making. They're not perfect parallels. But they do happen to be characters with major flaws... one of which overcomes them (and this greatly adds to his character) and the other just pitifully waffles by. And this is what I'm lamenting. That Rowling had such an opportunity and then just completely let it pass by.

** I don't think Malfoy from books 1-5 had the qualities to be redeemed as a character, but Malfoy from books 6-7 definitely did. He was a product of his environment (Sirius aside, I doubt many could have been brought up by the Malfoys without absorbing at least some of their privileged, racist mindset), and he never really questioned what he'd been taught until he became a Death Eater and realized he was in over his head. Throughout book 6 he becomes increasingly torn between his views and his reluctance to become a killer, all while knowing that his family is going to pay a price if he fails.

So yes, book 6 Draco was definitely open to that path, and I think Dumbledore's mercy gave him the first push in that direction.

As for whether or not he actually had a redemption arc... we never really get that moment where he officially redeems himself, and that's fitting imo, since he's not going to unlearn everything he's been taught overnight. To me, though, his refusal to identify Harry and Hermione - when that would have won the war and saved his family - is a sign that he didn't want Voldemort to win after all, and I like to think that after the war he was able to change his views.

** Like @solarityy said, authors dont have to do anything. They dont owe their readers custom plots and stories just because a lot of them enjoy /fan theories/ and fanfiction. And as Draco was just a kid, I could see a redemption arc going well for him.

That being said, it really rubs me the wrong way that Rowling thought it a good idea that war criminals not only dodged prison /twice/, but also retained their wealth and political capital. If they were trialed at Nurenberg, they would have hanged faster than they cold say /pureblood/.

snape is the best character in the series. the character arcs described in that post are typical. draco lacks the initiative and courage necessary to actively oppose voldemort/his parents. snape is one of the most unique characters in children's lit. period, imo

I'm sure plenty of people would have their own take on this. For me, though? It's those negative traits you mentioned. Particularly the cowardice. He's not a misunderstood anti-hero or a genuine villain with a change of heart. He's just a brat and a bully who got in over his head. It's not brave or admirable but I find a good break the haughty arc just as (or more) interesting than a true moral redemption.

In the end, it's all subjective. Though he doesn't do much for me as a character, it can't be denied that Snape is fascinating and certainly one of the more complex aspects of the books.
