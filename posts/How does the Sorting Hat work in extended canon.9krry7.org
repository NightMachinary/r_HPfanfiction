So the hat looks at your mind and potential and sorts you accordingly, taking Wishes into account to a certain extend. Makes sense so far.

However, according to extended canon, the hat makes sure that each House gets:

- The same number of students

- The same amount of boys and girls

How the fuck is that supposed to work without running into "you are a real Gryffindor, but I still need two girls in Ravenclaw, so better be RAVENCLAW!" situations?

What if the number of boys and girls is not equal (Rowling's math does not check out either way, but this isn't so much about numbers)? What if the number of students is not dividable by four? Do three students get send home again? Do certain kids not receive their letters in that case?

And if students are not sorted by their personality but due to some quota, how does the hat know which of the students in front of him are best suited for Hufflepuff? What if there are 20 potential Gryffindors but the house is already full? Can the hat retract its earlier sortings or do the students have to bear the consequences?

Or is this simply another case of Rowling talking shit which is better left ignored?


** We know of "fate manipulation magic" already - the jinx on the DADA position, which guarantees that events will conspire to oust the DADA Professor. Felix Felicis might be considered a type of "fate magic" as well.

So the Sorting Hat could be another example of this: fate itself is manipulated to guarantee that the numbers will always work out just right.

I'm kind of surprised you're putting these two on different footings. I always thought the two were precisely the same type of magic --- /Felix/ forces good luck, the Jinx on the Defence Professorship forces terrible luck, same basic principle.

The theory that the Sorting Hat works the same way... is not bad, I suppose, though I'd rather go with the "slightly prescient" explanation, because manipulating what the personalities of the new generation of wizards are going to fundamentally /be/ seems to me to be a much greater, much more god-like type of fate-manipulation that merely encouraging discrete events corresponding (or opposite) to a particular individual's wishes.

**** The thing is, the events which result in the exit of the DADA teacher are sometimes (if not often) the result of events on a grand scale as well. Fake Moody and Snape stand out in particular as individuals whose exit as DADA teacher coincided with events of great importance.

This is why I don't really see the DADA jinx as a "bad luck spell" - it can go beyond the bad luck of a single individual to coincide with events occurring beyond the walls of Hogwarts and involving the fate of wizarding Britain as a whole.

***** That's a fair objection, but I'd look at it the other way around --- those grave events were happening /anyway/, would have happened regardless of whether there was a Jinx on the Defence Professorship. Given that both Snape and Moody were closely associated with these big and dangerous events, it only makes sense the Jinx would "pick" circumstances related to these events to kill or oust them, simply because those were the most statistically-probable way for these people to lose the job/their lives.

This is, of course, assuming luck-spells will gravitate towards more likely ways of achieveing their good or bad effects; but that seems a plausible conjecture; after all, no Defence Professors, to our knowledge, died through all the atoms of oxygen in the room spontaneously migrating to the ceiling, leaving only carbon dioxyde around their lungs (a turn of event which is technically possible, just vanishingly unlikely).

** Time magic fuckery. The hat already knows beforehand where each student is to be sorted and any alteration that needs to be done on-the-fly can be compensated for and won't have a significant impact.

It doesn't hurt that the hat is free to choose the reason for sorting any particular child into one house or another - "this house will benefit your development", "you show the qualities of that house"...

** What does extended canon mean? Pottermore?

I know JKR planned to have equal shares in the early versions of book 1, but I would assume that idea was scrapped, given that it doesn't fit the final version and was absolutely unjustifiable setting-wise. It's hard enough to manipulate the houses into being internally consistent without putting further strain on that poor wretched hat.

** 1. I'm sure there are slight differences in the number of students in each house every year, due to the number of students being indivisible by 4. Likewise, the hat probably attempts to make sure that no house has an obviously disparate sex ratio but doesn't get to concerned if they aren't exactly equal.
2. students are first sorted by personality, but obviously no one is just made of personality traits that embodies one house - and reasonably complex mixtures are probably a question mark anyway - and are what I expect solves the issue of student imbalance in houses.

In all the other universes the head just goes "poof" or just stops working for some weird reason and they have to find a new sorting method.

** To make that work the hat has to be at least slightly prescient, doesn't it? We know that magical artefacts aren't necessarily fixed in time - time turners are the limit case, but the Mirror of Erised can predict how you'll look in a few years' time to give you an image of yourself with the Quidditch Cup and Head Boy's badge, Foe Glasses can predict the movements of enemies at least slightly and there may be others that I'm not thinking of.

So, the Hat is able to shift its data-gathering outside linear thermodynamic time so that its decision matrix is populated before the sorting starts by its foresight of how its readings of and conversations with all of the incoming firsties will go. It sorts them all and then goes through the ceremony to populate its dataset back then with the data it has predicted right at the start, at the same time announcing the decisions it made before the sorting even began. Enough kids are, or ought to be, edge cases between two or more houses that it can divide them evenly.

We also see the Hat issue warnings about future events, which is also suggestive that the Sorting process involves at least some prescience on the part of the Hat.

I dunno, I thought the Mirror's aged-up versions were probably more like photo-realistic extrapolations of how the kid might imagine himself to look like, as opposed to actually fitting what they'll end up as. I mean, we're explicitly told that the Mirror "does not provide true knowledge unknown to the viewer" or something like that, so it would be a bit off if it /was/ a reliable source for one's future appearance.

** I think I read a short fic once where the Hat had some mind altering powers and basically tweaked people's personalities to get an even split. It might start off trying to get people into their most appropriate houses, but as it goes it subtly tries to keep the numbers right by altering their personalities subtly.

** I feel like its better this way honestly. With how much the Hufflepuff is made fun of for being "useless" im sure over time the house would barely have students in it for not wanting to be made fun of. Same with Slytherin it had a reputation of breeding dark wizards according to the students and eventually that would dwindle out as well. You said if theres 20 potential Gryffindors the keyword there is potential. They have potential in other house as well and can fit in to those one as well. The hat wanted Harry to be in Slytherin because it would be the best for him but when Harry asked it to put him in Gryffindor he did because he would do well there also. Theres exceptions to the rules. But whether you choose to make it part of your canon is up to you. If you dont like it just leave it out especially since it such a small part of the universe.
