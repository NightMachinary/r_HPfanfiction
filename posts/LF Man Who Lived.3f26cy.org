Several years ago, I was reading a three or four volume fanfiction. I had copy and pasted it back then into a word file to read offline. I can't remember who wrote the story, but I remember they had at least one other big Star Trek fanfic.

I'm pretty sure the title was The Man Who Lived, or something like that.

EDIT: Post-War, written back way before the series ended. It was Draco/Harry. At the start, Draco was asked to come home by the Ministry after being in exile to work as a cursebreaker. There were several new characters introduced, wizards and witches from America who had come to help a magically unstable Britain. Oh, and Harry was magically and emotionally unstable as well.

I recently moved computers and found that the file I had had gone missing. Whelp, looking to find it again and I couldn't find it anywhere.

Does anybody know where this fanfiction can be found or if it's lost to the world?


** Do you remember any details about the story?

*** After a bit of thought, this is what I can remember:

It was very long ago, and I never finished the story, so that's really all I can remember.
