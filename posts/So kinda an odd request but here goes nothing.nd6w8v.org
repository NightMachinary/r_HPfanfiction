I'm looking for fics that focuses on one main thing, I want ones where instead of Voldemort is trying to kill Harry he changes his mind and they grow close to each other. Doesn't necessarily have to be father/son type relationship (although those are welcomed!) but more like a deep friendship.

This is also important; I'm not looking for anything where Voldemort *never* wanted to kill Harry, or was always good; on the contrary I want ones where he starts out wanting to but then later realizes he does care for him in some way.

wether Harry becomes a dark wizard because of the relationship or stays a light wizard doesn't matter, or vice versa. It would be interesting though if they stayed on opposite sides.

I've already read the ‘Train to Nowhere' and ‘Unlikely Brothers' and enjoyed both of those immensely.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][/Limpieza de Sangre/]] has something similar to that. Once she's got a body again at the end of /Goblet of Fire/ Fem!Voldemort decides that the prophecy has been fulfilled.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** linkao3(You Asked if I Were Happy) is the first entry in a series where Voldemort returns to life in February 1992, and immediately decides he's had enough of being a dark lord. He begins teaching at Hogwarts under an assumed identity, and takes Harry under his wing

linkao3(Unseen Perspective) is a story of my own writing. The basic premise is inspired by Limpieza de Sangre, which was already linked, but the story goes in a very different direction. Voldemort is more laid back and has a very different personal history.

** Oh, I've got ya! (Some these ARE Slash “Tomarry” so apologies if that isn't your cup of tea. - But the characterisation/development is great!)

linkffn(Meddling of a Mischief Maker by Athey) - certain...circumstances cause Tom and Harry to start building a bond and working together.

linkffn(The Darkening Of Your Soul by MaeglinYedi) - a second chance after their previous life. Tom's soul and sanity are restored and many harsh truths are revealed.

linkffn(One Cannot Live Without the Other: Book 1 by blackstarlight17) - instead of becoming a Wraith after failing to kill Harry, Voldemort is turned into an infant. Harry and Tom grow up together.

linkffn(Of Your Making by Purplewitch156) - they're trapped together, remorse is eventually felt.

linkffn(The Mirror of Eidrokcuf) - the more extreme, smutty, cracky version of the above.

linkffn(An Idle Mind Is The Devil's Playground by night flame miko) - Owl Post; addressed to thy Enemy.

linkffn(Embracing His True Self by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan) - Dumbledore's evil, and Harry doesn't want to fight Tom anymore...

  The curse cast by Voldemort failed but instead of being destroyed, he was reduced to an infant with no memories of his previous life. He ends up living with the very boy he intended to kill and grows alongside him. As they start Hogwarts and learn magic, they begin to encounter things that don't make sense. The question is, do they want to know the answers?
