I remember reading a Goblet of Fire fic quite a while ago where Harry was a badass, he kept getting marriage contracts, the Tasks were different, and Fleur kept getting violated by creatures during the Tasks. Any ideas?


** "Fleur kept getting violated by creatures during the tasks."

I'm not the only one who's thoughts turned dirty at that line, right?

*** Trust me, it was dirty as hell. She kept losing control of her Allure, and monsters violated her during the Tasks. Things like zombies, and stuff.

***** No, it was actually really funny. Fleur wasn't the focus of the story, just a sort of comic relief.
