Does anybody have any good Black family redemption (or Harry growing up w them/Harry being a Black/etc) fanfics? I've read many like Growing up Black, Rewind to Black, Reclamation of Black Magic, etc. I'm very interested in those types of fanfics but I feel like I've read all of them. I don't want them on Dumbledore's side though. Or even time travel fanfics that involve the Black Family (e.g Black Fortunes, Wish upon a star).
