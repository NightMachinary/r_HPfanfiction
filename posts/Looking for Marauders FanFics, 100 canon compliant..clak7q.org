I'm looking for fics about The Marauders plus Lilly and Snape. The ideal would be a fic starting in their first year and going through their whole schooltime and ending at the Potter's death. I'd like stories about the things the Marauders discover at Hogwarts as well as an adventure, that wasn't so big as to be mentioned in the books but still puts them into danger. No Slash, at least nothing that would go against canon, and the original pairings we know of. Thanks in advance for your suggestions!!

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

Kinda what you're looking for. I haven't read the whole thing, so I can't truly speak on the quality, but the chapters I read were pretty good.
