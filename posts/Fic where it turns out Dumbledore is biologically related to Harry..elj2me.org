Before or after hi death, but I would rather a good!Dumbledore.


** Now I really want to see a fic where Albus Severus goes back in time somehow and becomes Albus etc etc Dumbledore (coining the ridiculous middle names that neither of his siblings have as a method of disguising his name) and is technically named for himself. Could have a lot of fun with him griping over influencing history until he finally accepts that he is Albus Dumbledore and whatever decision he makes is probably the one he made before anyway.

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.
