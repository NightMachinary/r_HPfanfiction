Basically like the title says,

It was about Harry going into first year and dealing with the culture shock etc, wizards were basically second class citizens and were controlled through multiple marriage bonds to witches because they were way more powerful. It followed Harry through 1 year to when he was forced to get married. It was a bit dark from what I can remember, and I'm pretty sure it was completed.

It was on FanFiction net

Pls and thanks I've been searching for a few days now!
