Ok, this might be pretty far fetched. I don't remember much about this one and some of the details i might have confused with a couple of other ones i read around the same time. It was a fairly mature one if i remember correctly, but nothing very graphic. It was also pretty long, not just a 50 page short or something like that. This was placed I think just after the 5th book.

Some of the things i remember are:

-Harry ends up going to stay with Hermione and her parents for the rest of the summer.

-One or both of the Dursleys possibly could have died? Or maybe they just had to leave the house to be safe. I remember something about The Order telling them to leave for a while and Vernon struggling with the decision to either listen to it or ignore it so he keeps having his family pack and unpack. Though i think that might have been in The Deathly Hallows...

-Hermione and her parents take Harry to see Cats (the play).

-Harry and Hermione go either ice skating or roller skating and while they are they run into one of Hermione's former muggle classmates and she antagonizes Herminone, Harry acts like hes dating Hermione to get her classmate off her back.

-Harry is sleeping in a room down the hall from Hermiones room and one night he hears something so he goes to check it out and realizes its Hermione masturbating in her bed. I remember it describing the bed as one of those with the curtains hanging down from the bed frame so you can close yourself in.

-After they get back to school Hermione becomes a Prefect and gets her own dorm separate from the girls and the boys dorms.

-The new defense against the dark arts teacher is an attractive lady with red eyes that all the boys like but all the girls hate.

-Harry is worried about making Ron upset because they both want to be with Hermione.

-Harry constantly notices how Hermione sometimes chews on her bottom lip, making it red.

-Harry and Hermione kiss for the first time in the room of requirement while shes tutoring him or something.

-A while into the book Harry and Hermione use the Prefects dorm to have sex, and almost get caught.

-Hermione uses a birth control charm.

-Ron does end up finding out and getting really angry at both of them for a while. But ends up with someone else. Luna i think?

Like i said i might have mixed some of these details up with a different book but from what i can remember thats pretty accurate. I looked around for this for a while but couldn't find it. If you recognize any of these things please let me know, thanks for the help! :)


** Ahaha I just read this on fanfiction.net! It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3805944/1/Forbidden-Love][Forbidden Love]]

They watch the play "Cats" in Chapter Four and Harry's reaction to it was very funny.
