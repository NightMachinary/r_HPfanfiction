** "Jakob," his mother looked down her nose disdainfully at the boy who stood beside him in Madame Malkin's. "What are you doing associating with this mudblood filth?"

"How dare you speak to me like that, Juden! I belong to the master race!" The young boy retorted.

Jakob rolled his eyes and considered introducing the pathetic little worm, who'd said his name was something Schicklgruber, but he knew his mother wouldn't care. And frankly, Jakob had grown weary of the misguided boy's diatribe.

"Perhaps we should go to Twilfitt and Tattings, mother," Jakob put his hand in hers. "It seems that Madame Malkin's has relaxed their standards, and now mudblood filth like this one are allowed to openly disparage Noble Purebloods like us."

Jakob's mother nodded her assent and as they left Madame Malkin's, Jakob shot one last glance at the fuming, dark-haired boy. He'd been polite enough at the beginning, but the longer he had opened his mouth the more Jakob had disliked him.

Is it all started shortly after Jacob told the boy his name and the boy had shown instant disdain for his Jewish heritage. He tried to explain how none of that mattered in The Wizarding World and that the Rothsteins were a prominent pure-blooded family, but the irate boy would have none of it.

As Jakob and his mother made their way way down the alley to Twilfitt and Tattings, Jakob smiled to himself. He looked forward to seeing the boy at Hogwarts, bent over crying in the hallways, the victim of some hex or another from the Slytherins and the other pure-bloods in the school who would be more than eager to show the young mudblood his place.

It would make an intersting premise about the many faces of racism because everyone despite their religions, color can be one ironically.

**** I'm going to assume you're asking this in good faith.

in canon and in a lot of fanon, purebloods are the ones with all the money. purebloods run Hogwarts. if you suddenly make them jewish, it mirrors the existing real-world narrative that some people have that "Jews control the world/banks/society/whatever".

I can see the appeal of trying to reverse roles for the sake of a story, but not when it reinforces harmful stereotypes.

***** ...Except you're the one bringing up this stereotype in the first place? Also the Gaunts and the Weasleys are not rich from what I remember? I'm not going to do a role reversal if I write the story: the Nazi and the Pureblood will both be horrible peoples and will do everything to bring the other down.

If you're triggered by this stereotype does that mean the existence of the Rothschilds trigger you? Because as much you seems to deny this they are Jews. I'm not racist/antisemite or whatever but I begin to get extremely tired of PC.

******* You didn't answer my questions, you think because someone is Jew he can't be a bad person? Imagine if I say this but with "white" instead, are you sure you're not the racist one?

Mate, what I ask for is a story about a Jewish blood supremacist and a Nazi muggleborn. I never say the blood supremacist is rich because he's Jew just like you imply, or a pureblood (Voldemort wasn't even one and he still the one who hates muggles the most).

You're the one who should outside and think about what you said (don't forget your mask because even if you seems like an imbecil, I do not wish you die).

***** Canonically JKR said that students have the same religions as the muggles, it just isn't featured with as much importance. So it's really not much of a stretch to think some Pureblood are Jewish, some Catholic, some Atheists, some neo-pagans... really, having a pureblood Jew isn't really going along with conspiracy theory's or being offensive, statistically if we consider the fact that those who descend from muggleborn Jews may eventually become purebloods then it makes sense that at least some would keep to their grand-grandparents religion, to say nothing of the possibility of a member of the family finding out about the religion, identifying with it, deciding to convert and bringing family members along (maybe only the generations post-convention became pureblood supremacists).

Of course, this is said with the knowledge I have of the matter, if anyone reading it works with statistics or is Jew and find anything I said wrong then please, feel free to correct me.

****** I agree, having a pureblood Jew in and of itself isn't problematic and isn't what I took issue with. a /blood supremacist/ Jew, given what we know of blood supremacist characters in canon, has real potential to stray into antisemitism if written without nuance. /that/ is my complaint.

******* To be fair though in no moment the OP said or even implied that Jews would be particularly inclined to blood-supremacy, the post talked about a particular pureblood-supremacist that so happens to be Jew meeting a muggleborn that just happens to be Nazi. Even the arguments about stereotypes don't really last, seeing as the closer OP came of implying that this Jew family in particular was rich was the mention of that other clothing store, which doesn't really counts seeing that even someone of mid-class could reasonably buy in a higher-end store, though probably not as frequently as someone of upper-class would (even more so as in most cases there wouldn't be a difference as big in price for an uniform), in no moment was there any other mention that even came close to implying that this was a “Malfoy Familly 2.0: The reboot”. Arguing that they must have been from upper-class because they were pureblood-supremacists would be similar as saying that only rich people are racists. Being (or not) a bigoted asshole is not something exclusive to any financial-class in particular.

blood supremacy is literally in the title, though?

I'm not trying to say people can't write stuff. I'm not the purity police. what I am trying to say, possibly poorly, is words have power, and if you want to write about something that might reinforce negative stereotypes about a group of people, be aware of that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
