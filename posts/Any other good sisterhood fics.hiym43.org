I've recently read linkffn(What's her name in hufflepuff) and linkffn(Certain Dark Things) and enjoyed them both massively. Can anyone recommend similar stories?

Either centring around a fem!Harry or otherwise, I'd be glad to hear of others.

Linkffn(Certain Dark Things)

Linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff)

** It's not focused on Harry, or indeed anyone in his generation, but linkffn(9676212) is a short crossover that focuses on Amelia Bones and M from James Bond.
