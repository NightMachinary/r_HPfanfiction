** I don't mind slash per se, but I have no interest whatsoever in the most common slash pairings (Harry + Draco/Tom/Sev). Wolfstar (Sirius/Remus) is the only common slash pairing I don't mind -- allthough I don't /like/ reading it, I'm merely just indifferent (I don't go looking for it, but if a fic I read happen to have Wolfstar, that alone doesn't put me off like some other pairings can do).

I imagine this is why some people shy away -- the fact that the common slash pairings are rather unlikely/implausible or just silly.

** my problem with a lot of slash fics as a gay person is that theyre often written by straight people, and straight women most of the time who hyper-sexualise gay relationships whilst still being homophobic, and they often romanticise abusive behaviour because that's apparently what they think our relationships are like. a slash fic by a gay guy or a lesbian or a bi person is often a lot different and always a lot better than something written by a straight woman.

i do most often read slash fics just bc i cant relate to heteros, but i only read when i know the author isnt straight, or when it's been recced by someone i know and trust.

*** My impression so far has been that most romance fics in general are hyper sexualized, not just the slash ones. I've also seen plenty of non-slash fics that romanticize abusive behavior (seems to be fairly common for pairing of a "good" character with "bad" character.)

Shouldn't that objection apply to romance fic requests in general? It doesn't seem to be a strong reason for why slash fic rec threads would be more downvoted.

**** that's definitely true you do see a lot of awful behaviour and bad porn in het fic too which is another reason i don't normally read them, i was just pointing out that i personally don't like a lot of slash fic because their depictions of gay relationships are just uncomfortable and sometimes plainly offensive. but i do tend to see a lot more long actiony story driven fics that are het than gay, writers tend to think gays are only good for sex apparently.

another reason other people dislike them is purely because they think gay ships are ridiculous and wrong, they get a lot angrier if you ship a gay ship than if you ship a non canon het ship and that's their own homophobic problem. if you argue that all non canon ships are wrong then you have to apply that to straight ships too but they don't and they're happy for you to ship harry/hermione as long as you're not shipping ginny/luna too.

*** This if very true. Most slash fic are trash because it's just unrealistic porn and a lot of the times the pairings are insane (Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort).

LIke if Harry's fucking any of those dudes he's going to be insanely out of character.

However if you have a fic like linkffn(13010260), which is actually written by a gay guy, and the romance is just a part of the story instead of front and center smut, then I think the quality is much much better.

** Because "slash" is more often than not a flanderized, romanticized, hypersexualized and disgusting misrepresentation of actual LGBTQ relationships - normal relationships with people who happen to be LGTQ. "Slash" puts the LGBTQ first and foremost, with absurdly large amounts of references to harmful ideas and terrible views about what "LGBTQ relationships" are even like. Most likely 99% written by straight people who only know misconceptions and stereotypes.

It is not healthy or positive, generally. There is a clear difference between "Slash" and "LGBTQ". One is a human and accurate portrayal, and the other is...not.

The fic is named "A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy][Black Comedy]]", so yes that is the intended satire, showing the absurdity of hypersexual protagonists in other fanfiction.

But to be perfectly accurate, that's not even really what happened in that scene. Harry met a girl at a bar, she had never had sex before, and she chose to have a night of casual sex with a man. That night Harry didn't know that she identified as lesbian, so it's not as if he had any intention of "teaching her the error of her ways" or any such homophobic nonsense.

In my opinion it's grossly inaccurate to extrapolate one young woman's case of personal choice and self-exploration to supposedly represent the entire LGBTQ community. Just as it is unacceptable to discriminate against sexual minorities it is also unacceptable to discriminate against people who are in the process of questioning their sexuality, which seems to have been the case for the young woman in that scene. That's why I mentioned [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism][sex-positive feminism]] the last time this topic was brought up.

****** *Straw man*

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man."

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition.This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery "battle" and the defeat of an "enemy" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

Straw man tactics in the United Kingdom can be known as an Aunt Sally, after a pub game of the same name, where patrons threw sticks or battens at a post to knock off a skittle balanced on top.

I have no interest in participating in an emotionally charged conversation, so I encourage you to read back through that thread and look at what I actually said in my comments. I never claimed to support "fucking lesbians strait," (your words and theirs, never mine) because that is not ok, nor is it an accurate interpretation of that scene in the fic.

** Well first, you have to understand that slash fics are disliked here in particular because this subreddit has a rather large percentage of men at least 50-50, if not more, and people generally like ships that fit their orientation, or are at least 'hot' to them (hence the rather large number of slash fics written by female writers, who make up the majority of the fandom outside of Reddit). That said, there are most definitely a number of other legitimate and illegitimate reasons for disliking slash. It ranges from the pairing choice which others have covered, to disliking romance in general, to straight-up homophobia.

That said, another reason might just be that romance, even when written by professional authors, is generally trash. I like romance, but I'm not ashamed to admit that the vast majority of stuff I read is definitely something of a very guilty pleasure even when it's not the main focus of a story. That applies too to fanfiction, and I'm of the opinion that Sturgeon's law doesn't even apply here; it's worse, with probably something like 98% of all romance being complete crap. And since slash pairings are 1) far rarer in general and 2) already almost always start off with Harry paired with a canonically horrible character (like seriously, where's the Harry/Neville, Harry/Ron, Harry/Weasley pairings?) I generally give them a hard pass in the wild, and I'll only read them if they're brought to my attention.

** I simply cannot relate in a romantic way to a gay dude because I'm not attracted to men. You can call me whatever it is you'd like, but I just can't get into a slash fic.

Which is weird considering I love femHarry fics even if it isn't femslash, like xovers with Eragon or Twilight or w/e.

I tried reading a poly with the trio but even then I just couldn't.

Which is actually really annoying to me because there's a bunch of fics that has a fantastic premise that is love to read but is slash.

** Short:

Most slash stories pair Harry with someone he would never end up with. He'd rather take cyanide than shag the person who murdered his parents. That is bad writing.

Long:

This leaves you with few other shipping options. There are the male Weasleys, who are controversial, Neville (the Gary Stu of fanfics) and you just ran out of important male characters.

Wolfstar is controversial around here because many feel like turning it in a romantic relationship makes the friendship feel less important. There's also a fraction who is convinced that of Sirius was gay, he'd be after James. We had this discussion last week IIRC.

Outside of that, we don't mind slash. It's just the fact that in Rowling's universe, most slash pairings make no sense in the best case and more often than not are a punch in the face of people who care about things like justice and the law. Or morals.

And before someone points out Bellatrix Lestrange, at least she was a badass. A horrible person for sure, but also a credible threat (unlike Malfoy or Snape). She is "cool evil", pretty much like Vader.

Tl;dr: If you exclude Death Eaters, you are left with the Weasleys and Neville. And most Weasley fans ship the canon pairings, leaving little room slash.

*** This is a bit disingenuous. Look at the popular female pairings for Harry: Hermione and Ginny, obviously, but from then you go to Luna, i.e. Manic Pixie Dream Girl, and Daphne Greengrass, who is an OC. Neville is more characterized than Luna in canon, and there are obviously plenty of side characters who can be made into OCs. Hell, that's usually what Draco is when he's a romantic partner.

The fact of the matter is that Rowling really just doesn't give characters unnecessary emphasis. If you want a student other than Harry, Hermione, or the Weasleys to be a major character, you're going to need to dip into original characterization no matter their gender.

And here's the rub - I'd prefer no relationships in my magical adventure stories, but I recognize the stories are written by humans, and most humans like those things. So I accept the relationships. But I won't read a story where romance is the central theme. As for the smut take my dislike of relationships in stories and double it.

We don't, though. We know one of the bounds of their preferential ranges. Harry is capable of attraction /at least/ to Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley. Ron is capable of attraction /at least/ to Lavender Brown and Hermione Granger. Harry and Ron could both be almost exclusively homosexual, and that would still be possible, so the most we can say is that Harry and Ron are both somewhere between "exclusively heterosexual" and "almost exclusively homosexual". JKR never had any of her characters talk or think about sexual preference, so all we have is inference to go by, and the facts of canon leave every single character's sexuality almost entirely open for interpretation.

They could be "exclusively heterosexual", or "almost exclusively heterosexual", or "mostly heterosexual", or "perfectly bisexual", or "mostly homosexual", or "almost exclusively homosexual", but probably not "exclusively homosexual", given the two known heterosexual relationships they had each.

They could still be exclusively homosexual, and their relationships were driven by something other than genuine sexual attraction and romantic interest, but it's rather unlikely.

Hell, Breivik murdered over 70 people and got a PlayStation 2 and a cell which makes the average student dorm look like a prison cell.

So? Someone of Bellatrix calibre would leave a trail of dead bodies if on Harry's side. I take one miserable Neville over hundreds of dead, tortured or orphaned Muggleborns and Muggles because you cannot deny that a defected Bellatrix would be a huge war asset.

Is Bellatrix to blame for that as well? Sorry, but you basically destroyed your own argument by pointing out where his damage truly came from.

Two things. First of all, the person needs to be resonably attractive, which rules Snape out. And no one seriously considering a Bellatrix pairing would want a fairytale romance. I am merely asking for slightly less disturbed than the standard in fanfics (which seem to include Sirius death and the torture of Hermione as bonding moments for some reason. Because those pairings clearly need more drama).

********** Her punishment truly does not matter.If it's 6 months or six decades,Bellatrix did not become rehabilitated or even become a better person.There is literally no reason she would defect.She /enjoys and relishes/ in torturing others.She obviously has the Black family pure blood obsession ingrained in her.

And where was the government during that? Where was the magical child protection agency or whatever you want to call them? Alternativley, why is there no such institution? That's like blaming Voldemort for the Dursley abuse when it was Dumbledore's fault (and maybe Crouch for the whole Sirius affair).

Just to name one scenario, Nymphadora has a "chat" with her a few days before the breakout and berates Bellatrix for messing up Andromeda's life and hurting her sister. Throw in some brutal parting shot, add dementor exposure, let it sit for a few days at -5°C and you have a perfectly valid divergence.

We are talking about fanfiction here, obviously, there is going to be some divergence at some point.

/"There are a number of accepted reasons for the use of imprisonment. One approach aims to deter those who would otherwise commit crimes (general deterrence) and to make it less likely that those who serve a prison sentence will commit crimes after their release (individual deterrence). A second approach focuses on issuing punishment to, or obtaining retribution from, those who have committed serious crimes. A third approach encourages the personal reform of those who are sent to prison."/

- Encyclopedia Britannica

Punishment is just as much purpose of a prison than reform. And criminals are to be punished, otherwise the law is but a joke.

  Blaming voldy for Harry's abuse
#+end_quote

It was his fault.The whole reason Harry was abused was because Petunia gave Harry protection.There is no way to say Neville's condition is not because of Bella.

Let's day I set a building on fire.The fire department can not get their in time is incompetent etc.Someone is horribly disfigured and scarred because the fire spread to a neighboring house.I mock the burn victim later in life.Of course a new treatment is invented and the victim eventually has most of their scars removed.Is this my fault?Yes it is and only an idiot would say it was entirely the fire department's fault for being incompetent.

Bellatrix still does not deserve freedom or even to live.

At this point Draco,/fucking draco/ the guy who bullied Harry relentlessly,tried to use a /torture soell/ on Harry,works a tiny bit more as a pairing.He is more redeemable.At least Draco learned and realized he is a horrible excuse for a human and tried to rectify that.

Bellatrix is literally an insane,murderer,torturer,and psychopath. It became impossible to redeem her when she mocked the child whose life she ruined.

******* 1) Bellatrix was punished for her crimes, Malfoy and Snape were not.

2) Malfoy with his actions also committed hundreds of counts of War crimes. He isn't a better person, he is just incompetent/Harry foiled his plans.

3) You could argue that the only thing Lestrange is guilty of is one count of manslaughter (Sirius) since the Longbottom raid were four people and individual guilt was never determined. Not a fan of this one, but you can make her innocent without violating the letter of canon (just the spirit). You can't do the same for Malfoy or Snape.

4) Unlike Snape, she isn't petty enough to abuse power of a teacher's position to abuse the student body.

5) Unlike Malfoy, she had balls.

Also, there's a way I can see a Malfoy pairing happen, you just need to diverge before the mudblood incident in CoS.

******** 1) How does that change anything at all about her?

2) What are you talking about? War crimes? Do you even know what that word means? Seriously, look up a few examples of what people that were punished for war crimes did. I think you do not really know what you are talking about. Are you aware that Draco Malfoy would definitely go free in real life, since he was blackmailed and a minor while he committed his "war crimes"?

3) Did we read the same books? The ones with the Bellatrix who is proud about what she did to the Longbottoms?

4) ???! What are you talking about? Bellatrix is not a teacher and she abuses EVERY position of power we ever see her in.

5) When you say balls, do you mean sadism?

God, Hellstrike. No, do not even answer, we have been here before and it is like talking to a wall.

********* First of all, coercion is not a valid defence for committing war crimes because there is no safety during a civil war. It isn't even a valid defence for murder charges. The Underage excuse fails due to similar reasons, and because there is simply no minimum age clause in the Hague conventions.

Now to Malfoys war crimes. First of all, he deliberately attacked civilians. Unless you want to argue that Katie Bell or Rosmerta were valid military targets. Perhaps the worst was the lack of clear insignia while carrying out his attacks, which is usually punished with summary execution, even by the Allies. There's also the fact that he hid between civilians by staying at Hogwarts while facilitating an attack on the same school. Which is also a war crime.

And that's just the violations of the Hague conventions, not the regular criminal charges.

And as was established after the second World War, following illegal orders does NOT remove the responsibility from ones carrying them out. Otherwise, 99% of the war criminals in the Third Reich would have been innocent.

** Because votes mean nothing, and you should not read such into them.

Some people vote on what they personally like (a gauge of the communities preferences)

Some people vote on what they think the value of the contribution to the community/discussion was

Some people vote on what they think should get more/less exposure.

Thing is, without a community agreement, all if these are valid. And you don't want to read "the community thinks this is a poor contribution when they are simply disinterested, or vice versa. And without said agreement, noone is voting "wrong"

Now some communities do set such standards. Usually via 'community info' + only letting members vote. We don't do that here, so to overread into voting numbers is a mistake

Harry would literally commit suicide/murder than even entertain the notion of joining with any of those characters in any capacity.

On a side note. What I find exceedingly hilarious about Lesbian Porn/smut and Gay porn/smut is that both guy and girl want to be in the middle of the respective festivities.

I was about to write smut for both demographics (slash for women, and femslash for men) to prove my point, but as I saw what I'd typed down it was a little too much. Long story short, both of the descriptions ended up as denial/neglect porn to drive the point home.

Harry killed a fucking Basilisk with a bloody sword at age 12, he ain't give a fuck about some idiot students. He was hated by pretty much everyone more than once and was not really affected all too much. And after a few rounds with Voldemort, nothing the Hogwarts students can throw at him seems significant.

Sure, there's some good stuff there, statistically speaking there has to be, but as it's probably the most regularly/enthusiastically populated collection of HP FF, you gotta wade like ear deep in sludge to find literealy anything besides "Harry boned Draco/Voldemort/Tom Riddle/Snape/etc. because reasons". Trying to search for good HP FF means usually filtering out slash entierly.
