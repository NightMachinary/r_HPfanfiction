They end up falling in love and Draco looks for a way to cure Hermione's tumor. I can't find this fic anywhere.

** It's called A Secret Thought. It was on HPFF.com, and may be on ff.net. I don't know how to link things and am on mobile. The author was something like Elysa... definitely had an E for the first letter.
