** 1. We don't know that the Death Eaters were drunk. That was speculation from Arthur Weasley, most likely speculation that he thought was false to some degree in an attempt to comfort a group of children, comprised of his underage children and two of their friends of whom he is very fond.

2. The Death Eaters were/are a symbol of terror. Voldemort's war was most likely a series of terrorist attacks, which fostered such a feeling of fear in the populace that they can't say Voldemort's name, the Dark Mark and Death Eater's inspire great fear.

3. Outside of Draco Malfoy, there is no evidence that the Death Eaters are anything but highly capable, highly trained, highly skilled dark wizards and witches. There are two reasons the Department of Ministry battle didn't end in a complete Death Eater victory. First, they were under strict orders to get the Prophecy and not kill Harry. That makes killing the other students a very bad idea, limiting their deadly arsenal. Second, the Order of the Phoenix, another highly capable group shows up to counter them. Don't try arguing the Battle of Hogwarts ending in the good guys winning either. Before Harry's love sacrifice, Voldemort was winning the battle. After the sacrifice, the sacrifice protected Harry's allies, giving them an incredible advantage.

4. The average person is not prepared for a combat situation. Fight or Flight, and for the vast majority, Flight is the instinctual option. The average witch or wizard is not likely to know the spells most effective for such a situation, if they did know them they probably haven't used them since school and thus have lost effectiveness with it and most likely don't have the skill to handle it.

5. We don't know Magical Britain's laws on self-defense, beyond the caveat in the Reasonable Decree for Underage Magic. And from that, all we know is that an underage wizard or witch may use magic in a life threatening situation. Not that they can use lethal force, but that they can use magic.

However, that isn't all the 16/17 year old magicals in Wizarding Britain, or Voldemort wouldn't have needed to make a Hogwarts education mandatory for all non-muggleborns in DH.

** For starters, the whole First War would've gone differently as well as the prosecution of war criminals during and afterwards. There would've been research into the Dark Mark and people wearing it would have been questioned much harsher than they were. Harsher and more thorough prosecution would have also brought to light that Sirius Black's case doesn't add up. Corruption only goes so far. For example, high SS officers tried to buy out of the NÃ¼rnberg trials. None succeeded. It would be much more likely for a new elite to push for a seizing and distribution of the Death Eaters assets.

Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to the Dursleys without some sort of failsafe. He knows so much that it can be argued he knew of the animosity between Potters and Dursleys. I can agree that its smart to not process Harry's adoption in the appropriate channels (whatever those may be), but forgetting so completely about Harry is just "doing it for the plot".

Basically, if we'd just think through what competent people would have done before the first chapter of canon, the entire story would be so fundamentally different that further thought would be useless. Its a new story and following the old plotline wouldn't work without ignoring previous assessments.

To your example: Yes, the people at the tournament were more and all of them armed. However, never underestimate the instinct of man. When confronted with Fight or Flight, any non-trained individual would run. Policemen, or in our case Aurors, are trained to ignore this instinct. Add to this the terror Death Eaters would ignite in survivors of the First War, plus the mass panic situation, and its not so far out there that the Death Eaters had an undisturbed fun-time.

But, if one would rally the people, a counterattack would have been realistic. Doesn't take much more than some charismatic person to change the tides from fear to anger, from flight to fight. If the right conditions are met the civilians could score an easy victory against the DEs. In a story i'd say that maybe Harry, using his status and myth, motivates people to fight. If we want to stay with the "competent adults" thing, maybe someone prominent could lead the charge. Amelia Bones would be a prime example as Director of MLE. Or maybe someone known like Florean Fortescue.

** I found all that very realistic. In an ideal perfect world the ruling class would care about the citizens, people would only occupy positions in which they are competent in, there would be no cowardice, stupidity or greed.

But look around. In recent history it took most of the world and a few million deaths to stop one insane megalomaniac. Then we have the Vietnam and Middle East fiascoes, and I mention only these two because I'm sure you're familiar with them. Then there are more and more laws designed to support big corporations while disregarding the people, like the ridiculous NZ garden law. Then surveillance laws, the TPP and so on. These are all laws passed by a handful of people while the crowds did nothing.

Racism is still a thing in many parts of the world, as is classism. In certain parts of the world there are people killed for saying the wrong thing. In the US they'll elect Trump to be their president. How come so many struggle with poverty, even in western countries, if they are so comptenet? In every terrorist attack you hear of there is usually one person killing many. How do you justify this if you think mobs are realistically competent in stopping bad guys? Then you have more and more news reports of destructive behavior performed by parents towards their children or by cops towards the citizens they are suppose to protect. Parents choose to kill their children for honor or refuse them blood transfusions for religious reasons; governments wrongly imprisoning their citizens. In USSR, Stalin killed more people than Hitler ever did. How come the rest of the world didn't show some competence and bravery in order to do something to save all those people from the gulags? People are still being wrongfully imprisoned by their governments. Who's fighting to bring justice to them?

And so on.

What I want to say is that the world is not a pretty place. Bad things happen all around us. Very few people do anything to make thing better. The only difference between the books and the real world is that in reality the good guys don't always win.

** If you wrote that, you would immediately lose the original plot. And I would read the hell out of it!

The number of idiot balls being juggled in canon is stunning. She had a massive success writing what she wrote but it's not a Tom Clancy thriller. It's not even an Agatha Christie.

For Harry to win he either needs the grace of God (cannon) or a serious power-up. A regiment of SAS/ a goblin legion/Tony Stark/ a lightsaber/suppa magic/ his own counter-insurgency organization.. something.

I like the idea of muggleborn/squib/halfblood driven from the 'magical world' by bigotry and corruption forming a loose organization in the shadows between the 'magical world' and the normal world.

it would be trivial to make a very nice living with almost no effort as a magical living outside the 'magical world'. so why stay and be shit on?

there are eloquent defences of canon in this thread.

But you aren't writing canon. it's fanfiction.

write it how you like it. Guns and RAF Tornados if that tickles you. Iron Man and Luke Skywalker if you like. the ghost of Che the insurgent as tactics instructor, he's a good teacher if you can derail the party line rants.

Especially non main characters.

Now deciding not to pay close attention to those kinds of details is fine and can still get you an awesome entertaining story, but it brings it to the next level if you can get the story to play out how you want, while also sticking to those details.

If this was Napoleonic era, enemy armies marching upon each other in formation in an open field exchanging rounds of fire style of conflict, you'd be correct. However, Voldemort did not do this.

In the 'first war,' we do not know of any pitched battles at all. In the 'second war,' the only things that count would be the Department of Mysteries at end of OoTP, the whole death of Dumbledore thing at the end of HBP, and the Final Battle in DH. He waged a guerrilla warfare/terrorist strategy, and successfully pulled off a coup, something that does not require a large number of people, but a small number at high positions. Kill the Minister with an Imperiused Head of Magical Law Enforcement in some level of secrecy, the Department Head becomes Minister (which makes perfect sense considering it's the Head of Magical Law Enforcement) and announces that the previous Minister resigned for whatever plausible sounding reason. Probably a few more high placed Imperiused officials, some unknown Death Eaters and you have full control of the government. Hell, vastly outnumbered forces have overthrown governments before. Best example is honestly the Cuban Revolution.

I think if the Ministry was somewhat competent they wouldn't leave any magical orphans in the muggle word, would have some sort of magical foster system or orphanage in place. I'm not talking about how this affects Harry, but Tom Riddle. A Riddle raised in a loving home may not have been less of a sociopath, but sociopaths can still function in society without becoming over the top [[https://mic.com/articles/44423/10-professions-that-attract-the-most-sociopaths#.GeXIJzhf6][villians]].

If the Ministry would take in muggleborn orphans into the wizarding world early, they'd have to do the same with /all/ muggleborns, which would probably be a risk in regards to the Statute of Secrecy, unless they went full unethical a la Prince of the Dark Kingdom.

Not really. I'm saying they should have an orphanage for orphan magicals, or foster those children in the magical world. A competent Ministry would have the magical equivalent of CPS, which clearly isn't the case. Tom would have been picked up early if it was, after all a 1930s orphanage is not a good place to be, especially considering that we know Mrs Cole was a drunk who (whether justified or not) treated Tom terribly, and again, he stayed at the orphanage in London during the war, so he was definitely in danger over summer. Another example is Snape whose father was neglectful at best and violent at worst. Harry's early life would not be acceptable, so either the Ministry is incompetent and doesn't check up on the well being of its hero, or there is a conspiracy going on.

******* I thought I made this clear earlier with my remarks on Sirius' lack of trial, but I guess I will reiterate.

*Competent DOES NOT mean moral in any way, shape or form.* You are equating a good/moral/just Ministry with a competent Ministry, when the only way those concepts overlap is that they both are a Ministry.

Competence is

-having the necessary ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully

-efficient and capable (when applied to a person)

-acceptable and satisfactory, though not outstanding

As you pointed out, this was the 1930s. Blood purity as a political ideology would have been stronger. They would not have taken in muggleborns any earlier than absolutely necessary. Many of them probably wanted muggleborns to stay /out/ of the Wizarding World, or probably smothered in their sleep or fed to dragons. And the general assumption was that Tom was a /muggleborn/.

For Snape: All we know of his father is from The Prince's Tale in DH. Basically, he and Eileen Snape would argue a lot, and he seemed to be a generally angry man. The rest I will discuss momentarily.

Harry: There seems to be the assumption (which may be/probably is true) that magical children are very protected from serious physical harm by accidental magic. Of course, Harry was not in danger of actual serious physical harm from his relatives. Sure, they were emotionally neglectful. But there is no evidence of physical abuse from Petunia or Vernon, although Dudley was a bully. They may not have given him all the food he wanted, but they still fed him, clothed him (and yes, hand-me-downs from Dudley count. Hell, until my first year of college, the majority of my wardrobe was hand-me-downs from an older cousin), housed him, and let him get an education. Sure, they seemed to have given him some chores. Fetching the mail occasionally and watching the bacon (something I learned how to do at a young age as well). Nothing beyond his age range, and we see nothing in canon saying that his chores were any heavier. Nothing about gardening (very common in fanfiction) or cleaning (see CoS, where he is to stay out of Petunia's way while she cleans). Hell, my chore list by that age was far, far more extensive.

And why, exactly would the Ministry check up on Harry? The blood protection kept magical threats away (yes, I'm aware of the Dementor attack in OoTP. However, I would argue that two Dementors aren't a threat to Harry. Plus, we don't know how the blood protections actually do their thing. It is perfectly possible that they helped him get his wand after it was dropped in time to cast the Patronus and save himself and Dudley). Until the Dursleys refused to respond to the Hogwarts letter(s), no Ministry of Magic laws were being broken (we know that some families educate their children in magic at home instead of at Hogwarts. It seems that the Ministry only cares that the child receives the magical education).

Add on to that the Wizarding World has different criteria, social standards, moral judgements, viewpoints and ideas of what is safe for children [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4obmq9/is_hogwarts_really_the_best_magical_school_in_the/d4bd6sg][as pointed out by this post from the /Is Hogwarts really the best magical school in the world?/ thread from a few days ago]], and that is due to two factors. First is the official split with the muggle world in 1692 with the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, leading to even more divergent social/culturally evolution (and no, societies are not +teleological+ [EDIT: I don't think this is the word I was looking for. I meant that societies aren't going to follow the same evolutionary path. For example, Marx's theory of history is wrong.]). Second, is the fact that magic is a /literal/ game-changer on every. Damn. Level. They can regrow missing bones /overnight/. The most popular spot would probably be lethal to a muggle. At the age of eleven they can purchase a tool that will warp reality to their whims, and *is a deadly weapon*.

*tl;dr* Competent â  moral, and wizards aren't muggles with magic.

#+end_quote

Please, let us end /that/ one. The reason why Sirius got sent to Azkaban without a trial isn't incompetence, nor is it even corruption. It's the fact that the ministry had been operating under martial law at the time of his capture, which did allow sentencing people for whose guilt there was overwhelming evidence (fabricated by Wormtail and added to by Sirius's guilt, but evidence nonetheless), without going through a trial. The reason why Barty Crouch used this is not because of lack of competence or veracity or whatever else, but simply because he was overzealous.

Let us also note that the way this works means that though there was no trial which could have led to discovery of the true events of that night, as far as the law is concerned Sirius did already receive a âguiltyâ verdict in something equivalent to a trial (that being Crouch's decision, which he actually did have a right to make), so the fact that he is not tried again just because he escaped from Azkaban and Harry Potter thinks he is not guilty does not automatically mean they have to reopen the case (because, you know, there's lack of any new actually substantial evidence, the only possible such piece being a living Wormtail). Admittedly there are pensieves and stuff, but we have not actually seen this stuff being used for court proceedings, and the same with veritaserum, so it stands to reason that using those is not a normal court procedure or that they are not infallible (which could be a reason behind the former).

And finally, it has to be said that this does not speak about the current ministry in any way or shape as not only was not Fudge the minister back then, as that was Bagnold, but she also had no actual say in anything Sirius-related as that decision was entirely Crouch's.

But oh well.

***** I'm just taking a guess, but I think it might have had to do with his mental state at the time of his capture. I mean, even Bellatrix was lucid at the time of her capture, her fanaticism aside, whereas Sirius probably was hysterical. Considering that the trials were, in many cases, likely purely a publicity stunt (Bellatrix and her two boys could have been Azka-binned outright, but they were important for Tom so them being sentenced was also important; and Junior ... well, we know what Barty Crouch was trying to do here, and it was also a publicity thing), and that the public probably wasn't very interested in watching a trial of an insane and hysterical wreck of a man regardless of his alleged status as Tom's right hand or whatever, I can understand why Barty Crouch chose to just Azka-bin Sirius but have trials for the rest.
