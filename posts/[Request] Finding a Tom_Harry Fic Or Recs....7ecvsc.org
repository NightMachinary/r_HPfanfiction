Hey there, so I have tried re-finding this particular fic for a while, but it seems Google has failed me. This is a Tom/Harry fic where Harry relives his life from either birth or the first AK to Death, only to go back. Over and Over. He tied to get Dumbledore's help, but it was in vain. Desperate for something new, Harry restores Tom's Horcruxes and helps him out. I know there was a scene in a Party at Malfoy Manor. He mentions at some point killing himself as a child trying to stop it, but failing (obviously) I believe this fic is on FF.Net, but I can't be sure at this point. If you Can't find or don't know this fic, any Living the same Life over and over fic would be nice. Any ships! Thank you for reading this :)
