I've read a lot of fics with Peter as a character, and I'm wondering if there are any with a Peter that's just /different/ from Canon. It doesn't matter if he's still Voldemorts servant, or perhaps never betrayed the Potters, or whatever's out there. I got this idea while reading linkffn(11191235)


** Oh man, there's a good one that has this...I just don't remember the title. Just in case somebody else knows which one i'm talking about: Peter confesses to the rest of the marauders that he's a spy; he actually had a better reason for joining the Death Eaters too, so they forgive them and he leaves the Death Eaters. Arabella Figg is a witch not a squib and heads the Aurors. Bill Weasley volunteers to get captured and placed in Death Eater controlled Azkaban in order to lead an escape.

*** That sounds like the Promises Unbroken linkffn(1248431) series. I think there are 3. This has my favorite depiction of Pettigrew---it's the Marauders as they should have been.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I actually started reading Prince of Slytherin myself recently and found that it had everything I enjoyed about the Sacrifices series but slightly more succinct.

It's a Wrong Boy Who Lived fic and this version Peter agreed to basically be mind controlled but then everyone abandoned him for the greater good. He breaks out of the mind control to save Harry from the same fate
