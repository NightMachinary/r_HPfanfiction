Do you know any fanfics where Harry travels back into his 11 year old self, is sorted into slytherin and is funny and seems like he has everything under his control? He can try to stop voldemort sooner, but I'd like more emphasis on the school years and interactions with the other students / professors. Maybe other friendships as well. Please no Dumbledore bashing.


** You definitely need to read Ah Screw It by mjimeyg then. It eventually delves into a crossover later on, but it has pretty much everything else you mentioned and it's a blast.

** Prince of Slytherin kind of, it starts as year 4 and then Harry goes back to year 1.

Dodging prison and steeling witches is a basically that.

*** No on the first, that's just a flashforward; yes on the second. Additionally recommend travel secrets [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/2]] and if you can handle plot-relevant slash, again and again [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/0]]
