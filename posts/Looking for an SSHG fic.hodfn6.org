:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was written way back in the day (some time between GoF and OotP or HBP) - at the time I was reading it, it was still a WIP. Not sure if it ever got finished. I remember it was a Snape/Hermione fic about the marriage law - Hermione had to marry Snape and they lived at the school (I believe she was in her 7th year still). Hermione was technically considered an adult because of how much she had used her time turner previously.

There was this one scene where Hermione was in the Hospital Wing and Snape was asleep, draped over a chair, and the author had mentioned she was partially inspired by [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/9c/90/459c9071ff602621d6c93f934824e856.jpg][this picture]].

Anyone remember this one?


** Dang, I do remember reading a story like that back in the day. Can't remember the title or author now though.
