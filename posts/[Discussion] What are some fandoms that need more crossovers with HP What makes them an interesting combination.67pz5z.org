For reference, top 10 on FFN are:

1.  Twilight (3,861)

2.  Percy Jackson and the Olympians (2,789)

3.  Naruto (2,297)

4.  Avengers (1,296)

5.  Supernatural (1,179)

6.  Doctor Who (1,160)

7.  Lord of the Rings (920)

8.  Sherlock (879)

9.  Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (776)

10. Fullmetal Alchemist (696)


** Dresden Files. It's not that hard to do a fusion of the two fandoms, but for some reason authors like to have two separate magic systems even though it turns into a convoluted mess (like in the Denarian Trilogy).

*** In regards to the magic system, I believe that there are several reasons for that.

1. In the Dresden Files, magical exhaustion is inherent to magic. In Harry Potter fandom, magical exhaustion is often looked down upon (quite rightly) as a trope. Wizards in the canon universe never show any indication of magical exhaustion, other than that loss of mental focus which might be expected from extensive time in a combat scenario. It is used in fics to place a time limit upon a battle. This gives wizards from Potter a rather marked advantage over practitioners from the Dresden Files.

2. Furthermore, innate magical ability, while certainly extant in the Files, is generally associated with magical cores, another trope that is generally despised. Potter fans seem to prefer, and canon to imply, magical ability proportional to the amount of time spent studying, spells known, or rituals undergone. Raw magical power either does not exist, or is not commensurate with the power of a wizard.

3. Differences in the magical system/magic itself. In the Harry Potter universe, it is explicitly stated that magic operates outside of the laws of physics, and has the power to overwrite mundane nature. Contrast this with the magic of the Files, which obey the laws of physics (to a greater or lesser extent, depending upon the power), and is rather scientific in nature, and it would seem that the systems of magic differ in at least one fundamental way.

That said, it ought to be noted that both place a heavy emphasis on the role of faith, emotion, and will in magic.

***** I think that 'fixing' those parts of either magic system would remove a lot of what draws people to it in the first place. Making a homogeneous magical system would require either majorly changing one of the two systems, or creating a new magic system somewhere between the two.

***** It generally isn't recommended when people ask for crossovers, but is when people ask for something that gives feels. I would know, I've done the latter a few times.

If you aren't averse to possibly getting your free time completely ruined, then TV Tropes has fanfic recommendation pages and on HP's ones there are a few crossovers with Discworld. I cannot vouch for their quality as I never actually got to reading them and some people do recommend things that are really shoddy so I don't know if they are good at all, but if you don't mind the gamble it could end up paying off.

** The Order: 1886 would be my niche crossover choice - the whole semi-shadow-conflict between the Order and the Half-Breeds (which for people who don't know is a nondescript term for Lycans [Very similar to Werewolves], Vampires and the like) could be an interesting place to drop a wizard, not to mention the vague magical stuff in the game (for instance, the /Blackwater/, that once taken augments a human's blood, allowing them to live for hundreds of years and able to heal wounds when the blood is ingested).

Plus, the steampunk stuff in the world of The Order is totally wicked, and I feel like authors could have a lot of fun with that whole universe, particularly because so little of its lore and timeline are definite outside of the distinct timeline of the game (which is a few months at the end of 1886).

** It's a currently non-existent cross-over (unless I've overlooked something), but I'd like to see a crossover between HP and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_(Lukyanenko_novel)][Night Watch]] by Sergei Lukanyenko, mostly because I like the world building and magic system in Night Watch.

Ideally, it would take place in the HPverse, but with the magic from Night Watch, where wizards and witches are Others. I think Dumbledore could be a good leader of the Light with Grindelwald being the leader of the Dark. Each of them would try to bring about their vision of a better world, so they'd oppose each other, but they still have to cooperate to some degree to keep balance and to keep the wizarding world hidden.

Also would love a Walking Dead crossover, post DHs where Harry or Hermione left Britain after Voldemort's defeat and ended up around Atlanta when the outbreak hit. Somehow gets hooked up with Rick's group or even has a group of his/her own that stumbles upon Rick. It would be interesting to see magic in that element, especially a witch/wizard who refuses to kill after the war left them so traumatized.
