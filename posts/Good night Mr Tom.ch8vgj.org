But Tom is Voldemort.


** "Mr. Tom," said the glassy-eyed maid, tottering over to the dining room door, opening it, and ushering in the Riddles' fashionably late guest, "there's a young man to see you. Says he's your son."

Tom Riddle's eyes widened when the door swung open to reveal a man - a boy - lean and angular, pale of skin, with wavy black hair that curled over his temple in an eerily familiar way.

"Good evening, father," said the boy, smiling genially, his dark eyes taking on a malicious gleam.

"F-father," stammered Tom. "What's this?"

"It's a greeting. But I suppose that it's not quite accurate - my sincere apologies," the boy said, and he drew a white wooden stick out of his pocket.

"Wha-"

"Good night, Mr. Tom."

"You! You're one of those-"

/"Avada kedavra."/
