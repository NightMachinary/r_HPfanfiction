** From OotP Chapter 38:

#+begin_quote
  Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.

  ‘He won't come back.'

  ‘Who?'

  ‘Sirius Black,' said Nick.

  ‘But you did!' said Harry angrily. ‘You came back -- you're dead and you didn't disappear --'

  ‘Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,' said Nick miserably. ‘But very few wizards choose that path.'
#+end_quote

A ghost isn't the actual wizard, it is an "imprint" of them. So I don't think a ghost staying behind would necessarily be viewed as a sad thing.

"Choose that path" would imply to me that it's an either/or situation. There's a metaphorical fork in the road, and you can either choose the path where you go on to the next great adventure, or you cling to the living world and leave an imprint of yourself.

If you could have your cake and eat it too, why wouldn't everyone leave behind a ghost? There have to be negative repercussions that explain why the world isn't flooded with them.

**** Have you seen The Prestige? I think that situation applies here.

That is, from the imprint's perspective, if /feels/ like it is a continuation of the real wizard -- the ghost has continuity of consciousness with the actual soul. So the imprint feels like it has chosen a path which forever bars it from finding out what happens after death.

But that doesn't mean the /actual/ soul doesn't move on. The fact that the ghost is an imprint of a soul, and not the soul itself, leaves open the question of what happens to the soul.

The reason why everyone doesn't leave behind a ghost is because it's something you do if you're particularly afraid of dying:

#+begin_quote
  “What d'you mean, ‘gone on'?” said Harry quickly “Gone on where? Listen - what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn't everyone come back? Why isn't this place full of ghosts? Why-?”

  “I cannot answer,” said Nick.

  “You're dead, aren't you?” said Harry exasperatedly. “Who can answer better than you?”

  “I was afraid of death,” said Nick softly. “I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have... well, that is neither here nor there... in fact, I am neither here nor there...”

  He gave a small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries -”
