Most are Snape helping Harry out, and that trope is starting to get annoying and repetitive. with struggling I mean along the lines of, drinking, drug abuse, self-harm...etc in his Hogwarts years. Also, if possible no bashing or het, I just despise these two. Thank you in advance!

I linked it on the other hp fanfiction site, but put it here too because why not. I found it the other day and thought it not half bad.
