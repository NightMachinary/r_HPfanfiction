I was trying to think of ways to up my count since I don't have many user subs at all. My latest fic has a nice number of subs but my user subs??? Bigggg yikes. I know there's bound to be a big disparity between those numbers, but it seems like my user sub count never moves.

I'm not too comfortable with expanding my social media/fandom presence so that's an issue. Maybe I can do a minimal online presence? I'm proud of my work but I'm also embarrassed and shy at the same time, you know? Maybe I should respond to more comments?

Also I've written fics for more than one fandom and I wonder if that's bad for my sub count?

I was thinking about publishing more than one WIP at a time to gain more traction, but it's really difficult for me to put out content for even one fic and I'm definitely not on a consistent posting schedule. I want to post more WIPs but again it's very hard for me to come up with something I think is good enough to post. Part of that I think is my overwhelming fear of producing bad content and how hard it is to hammer out details.


** First, agree that subscribers don't matter except for your ego. But if you must obsess about it, the bottom line is that it's a numbers game: the more people who read your works, the more will like them. So the best way to get more subscribers is to get more eyeballs on your fics.

- Watch the various fanfic subs and rec your work whenever it matches the search criteria. In my humble experience, I've gotten the highest number of responses to the fic that I've recced here on Reddit. DON'T rec fics that don't fit the request, and make sure to say that it's self-promotion, or you'll get a bad reputation.
- Write more stories. The more variety you have, the more likely that people will be interested in seeing what you come up with next. (If you try out the various writing prompts that get posted, you can combine this with the above.)
- Update frequently. People don't want to follow an author when there's nothing to see.
- The obvious: write GOOD stories, WELL. This includes an engaging plot and an adherence to SPAG rules.
- And some conflicting advice: write a lot of stories (which usually means short stories), and write long stories. Long stories because some people prefer epics. Lots of short stories because those are the authors I tend to follow: the ones where the stories aren't necessarily linked but I want to know when there's a new one.

Overall, though, if you're writing for the accolades, I think you'll end up disappointed. You'll have to write "what the people want" and agonize over each negative review (and there will be many). You'll be happier overall writing for yourself.

Writing in multiple fandoms is only an issue for me if your only author account is on FFN. I hate scrolling through dozens of stories in fandoms (or worse, cross-overs) that I don't follow. On AO3, I have the option to click on the fandom I'm interested in and then scroll through only those stories.

** I don't see why it matters at all.

Kudos and bookmarks at least encourage more people to check out your work, but you're the only one who knows how many subscriptions you have. User subs are really flattering because it means they're following you instead of just the fic, but even if someone likes your writing, they're probably loyal to their preferred fandoms, so you're right that using the same account for multiple fandoms might deter people. I never subscribe to anyone because my account is linked to a weird email that I don't check ever, but if I were getting emails from a user for a fandom that I don't read, then I'd unsubscribe.

Unless you want user engagement on some kind of social media platform like tumblr or whatever, then I'm struggling to see why you should care other than just the ego boost, which you can also get from fic subscriptions.

** I post on ao3 solely to drive traffic to my FFN page, but [[/u/Vg65][u/Vg65]] is largely correct - readers on ao3 are vastly different than those on FFN.

Depending on the type of story you write and the pairings you choose, you may be better off jumping over to FFN.

**** Cross-posting never hurts, though it does make editing or rewriting a bit inconvenient, especially if you want to keep the stories identical.

Also, be careful of straight copy-and-pasting into FFNet's Doc Manager, or into AO3's text editor. There's often the risk of having the spacing between your paragraphs increase when you do this.

Always double-check everything before publishing, especially spacing and anything to do with italicised text.

****** I'm not sure about indenting (which I don't do, as it's apparently not really necessary online).

Basically, I type out my stories in a word document and save it as a docx. Then I upload it to FFNet as a story file in the Doc Manager.

As for cross-posting, I've found that copying from FFnet to AO3 usually doesn't give many problems. But always have a read through of your chapter prior to publishing it.

**** You might be surprised. My first fic (posted on FFN and AO3) had insanely different receptions on each site. Ao3: 40-ish comments, 150 (? Maybe less, i haven't looked in awhile) kudos, maybe 15 subs. FFN: 2k follows, 1600 favs, well over 1k reviews, half-million views.

It's nuts, right? The readership is just sooooo different on each one. I feel a little bad, because of the few comments i got on ao3, people were really nice, but posting there is generally a waste of my time. Like, why put in the effort to keep updating there when maybe 2-3 dozen people are reading, compared to thousands on FFN?

** I often forget that exists. For me to sub to you I must like 99% of your fics. Which rarely happens. The last person I did that to was FlamingoQueen.

I don't even subscribe to stories. I bookmark them.

Point is I wouldn't bother about it. If you write a great fic, chances are the reader will want to see more of your work. At least that's what I do.

** I might be wrong, but the HP fandom on AO3 seems to favour things like Dumbledore and Order of the Phoenix bashing + Drarry, Snarry, HarryMort, Tomarry, etc. shipping + James et al. and Gryffindor in general bashing + Dursley abuse turned up to eleven.

For example, you could have two stories of similar length posted on AO3, and chances are that the one with Dumbledore bashing and/or Drarry, Snarry, HarryMort, Tomarry, etc. and/or Gryffindor bashing will get high numbers of viewers fairly quickly.

Fics which are similar in structure to this ...

Relationships:

Draco Malfoy/ Harry Potter, Harry Potter/Tom Riddle|Voldemort, Harry Potter/Severus Snape, Harry Potter/Lucius Malfoy (might be more).

Characters:

Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Tom Riddle|Voldemort, Severus Snape, Narcissa Black Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Bellatrix Black Lestrange, Albus Dumbledore, Amelia Bones, Susan Bones, Antonin Dolohov, Fenrir Greyback, Tracey Davis, Blaise Zabini, Mrs Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode, Bartemius Crouch Jr, etc. etc (continues on and on and on).

Additional tags:

[Usual bunch of additional tags, and then loads of freeform] Dumbles is an idiot, Sev is trying, really, he is, Harry and Draco are so cute together, Order of Fried Chicken are losers, Voldemort is sane, Tom deserves better, Dumbles made Tom a monster, Dumbledick is the real Dark Lord, Dumbles faked the prophecy, Sev didn't deserve the werewolf incident, that was all Sirius's fault, I hate Dumbles, the old coot will get what's coming to him, Sev is healing, maybe not, but he's getting there, James was an asshole, no beta we die like men, fuck JKR, Nagini is mother hen, smol Draco (or smol Harry), REGULUS IS ALIVE, etc. etc. (continues on and on and on and on).

... seem to get loads of hits, kudos, bookmarks, etc.

Basically, don't worry too much about your number of subs. It's not always an indicator of the quality of your writing.

It's often hard to get loads of hits, kudos, bookmarks, and subs when you don't write in line with what tends to get high traffic.

*** That's really helpful, thanks! I just started writing for Tomarry after being away from the fandom for so many years and it really is interesting.

I noticed people can be really neurotic about precise tagging. I had to change my tags and summary multiple times. I felt like I was exposing most of my story/plot points just for the sake of commenters who didn't understand what a pwp is. "but where is xyz plot I want to see this" excuse me look at the tags this is a mcdonalds

The relationship dynamics are really interesting with Tomarry. When I first saw it on the ao3 sidebar I was soooooo confused why it was popular and had to check it out. I understand it now lol. Young Tom Riddle was a p interesting character. Looking back, I did have a crush on him in the Chamber of Secrets when I was a kid.
