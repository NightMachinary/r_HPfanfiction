Need help finding a story. It is a Harry/Harem story where Harry and his girls are living in a community inside a bunch of trunks. They find James and Lily alive there. I think it begins between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban.

*** Derived from the multiple-marriage traditions of central Asia, Harry/Harem fics are a subset of 'Harry gets with several different girls' fics, wherein he doesn't ever have to share a girl once he's had her. The logistics are usually justified as a requirement of Harry's being the last of several magical Houses, or because his 'awesome powers' make all the girls want him. To allow for the impractical management of so many girlfriends, Harry's conquests often find themselves bent towards bisexuality, so as to remain available but not frustrated while Harry conquers some other witches of notable attractiveness.

As you might guess, it's a geek wank-fantasy scenario, which is why the idea is prevalent enough to require a definition.
