Exactly what it says in the title. A Mr. Weasley who's a master of going incognito amongst muggles, knowing all the terminology, having a good idea of how electricity works, what different warning labels and road signs mean, knowing how to use 101 different appliances, keeping up with an area of popular culture...

Maybe he could teach Muggle Studies at Hogwarts instead of being in the MoM? Or act as a liason between the Muggle & Magical ministries?


** My belief is that Arthur knows a lot more about the muggle world than hever lets on, but he likes bwing underestimated.

*** Me, too. I think the "ekeltricity" bit is a dodge he uses to mislead the bigots he works with into thinking he 'really' doesn't understand muggles all that well. Arthur is a very shrewd man.

  BUT IMAGINE: An Arthur Weasley who knew more about Muggle living than most Muggles. Who took the Wizarding concept of a blanket “Reparo” and applied it to his attempts to understanding the Muggle world, learning how to fix all sorts of items and gadgets, from repairing broken pottery with some clay and a kiln, to acting as his own Muggle mechanic when the Ford broke down, to being able to understand and explain how to get a Linux system up and running, because it's all just fixing in his eyes.

  Imagine an Arthur Weasley who was so capable of blending into his surroundings in the Muggle world that he was called upon to host seminars for the forward-facing groups in the Ministry on how to dress appropriately when undercover. An Arthur Weasley with a MASTERY in Muggle Relations and Studies. An Arthur who understood so well the politics and history behind Muggle Britain that he found himself an occasional liaison to the Muggle Prime Minister, because he could easily compare the two cultures in a way that made sense to both sides.

  Now imagine this Arthur Weasley who, despite a profound, near-unprecedented depth of knowledge of the culture of Wizard-Muggle relations, is still mistreated and looked-down-upon at the Ministry of Magic. Imagine him being denied raises, ignored during Department Head meetings, scoffed at by Purebloods without a clue of the incredible culture that he has devoted his life to understanding. Imagine his young sons not understanding why he values that knowledge over improving his position in the Ministry. Imagine them not understanding why Muggles are so important to him, why he fights for their proper treatment, why he feels so strongly about protecting relations between the two cultures, why he joined the Order in the first place.

  Imagine the series if Arthur had not been yet another cliched, bumbling idiot of a father, a man who knew little-to-nothing about a group he was charged to protect, another punchline to the joke that is Muggle relations. Imagine instead the difference it would've made throughout the series if he championed Muggles as a REAL reason to fight against Voldemort and blood supremacists, instead of just a thought in the wind. Imagine him bringing Muggle military into the war, using their firearms, stealth technology and sheer numbers and combining them with enough magic to make the Order near indestructible. Imagine the Wizarding world and its bigots being shown the strength of the Muggleborns, Wizards who can straddle both sides of the line, who can just as easily wield a pistol as a wand, who use SAS gear to deflect the Killing Curse and who invent spells that can focus snipers to within a tenth of a centimeter from 2km away.

  Then imagine post-war Arthur as the head of a new division of the Ministry with charge of combining Muggle and Wizarding technologies in order to improve everything from weaponry and healing to book printing and record-keeping. Imagine the Wizarding world with cell phones and laptops, with databases and televisions and instant messaging...

  Imagine an Arthur Weasley, the very definition of a blood-traitor, and damn proud of it.

** Being a moron seems to be a quintessential part of Mr. Weasley's character. He could go and buy an encyclopedia where he could read why planes fly or what the purpose of a rubber duck is. Judging by the large Hogwarts library independent research is not a foreign concept in the magical world. But he chooses to stay ignorant. And let's not forget that he works in the area he chooses to be ignorant in. Imagine a judge or lawyer who has no idea of the law. Or a racecar driver who didn't even pass his driving exam.

Saying you want a competent Arthur is like saying you want Hermione to be stupid.

*** I agree with some of what you're saying, but seriously, this is fanfic. Just like how being 'good' is a quintessential part of Harry's character, 'loving' a part of Molly's, 'wisdom' a part of Dumbledore's, yet there are countless requests for dark!Harry fics, evil!Harry fics, Weasley!Dumbledore!bashing fics, etc. So competent!Arthur doesn't seem too out there.

**** Molly watched Harry get abused and did nothing but send some food. I don't know about Britain but in Germany, that would be a criminal offense. She should have called the authorities, not send care packages. I don't see how anyone can say that she is a positive influence in Harry's life. And let's not forget how she treated Sirius in his own house, was toxic towards Fleur, believed the articles about Hermione or threatened the twins with barred windows for rescuing Harry. If that is your definition of loving then I'm curious what you call abusive.

And I'm not even mentioning her casual attitude towards rape drugs (see PoA Leaky Cauldron)

***** I wouldn't call Molly's treatment of Harry abuse because I don't consider it to be so. I don't agree with how she handled the situation at all, but Molly trusted Dumbledore, and Dumbledore told her that Harry was safest at Privet Drive. She tried to help as best as she could, given what she thought about the circumstances. Every time Harry came to the Burrow, she showered him with affection and cared for him. She sent him care packages, because she thought Dumbledore was right and that Harry was safest at Privet Drive, and though she hated it, she wanted him to survive. To me, she's guilty of blindly trusting one man at most, not child abuse.

I won't deny Molly's treatment of the other characters. Most of it was done out of overprotectiveness and love towards her children. Except for threatening the twins with barred windows. The twins clearly don't feel there is much substance to the threat, however; they're mostly just scared of Molly yelling at them. So I think that threat is probably just exaggeration. Either way, Molly's brand of love, while occasionally suffocating and overprotective, was not toxic to her children. They grew up well-adjusted, if a bit spoilt (Ron), but otherwise they were allowed to branch out and do their own thing, even if Molly disapproved. She made that disapproval clear (the twins' dream of opening a joke shop), but she nonetheless did not stop them. She could have been a more supportive mother, a less judgmental woman, but in the end, she loved her family and her actions do not scream abuse to me at all.

****** I don't think that the twins gave the threat much thought. But imagine you are Harry. After being rescued from an abusive environment the adult does not believe you and jokes about what you went through.

******* Just rewatched the scene from CoS. I don't think she was 'joking' per se, she was more exaggerating a punishment because Ron (because it was Ron, not the twins, she said it to. Both our mistakes) spoke up while she was lecturing him. That being said, the scene doesn't really reflect well on her either, because she just ignored what Ron said about the Dursleys starving Harry. Another one of her mistakes when dealing with Harry's situation - outright ignoring it and never verbally acknowledging it - but again, I still don't consider that abuse. Highly questionable, definitely.
