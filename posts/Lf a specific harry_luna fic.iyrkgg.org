Can remember the name but I think harry ended up staying with luna the summer after 5th year. I remember he sorta embarrasses some girls who bullied luna at an ice cream shop in ottery st catchpole And the title had something to do with icecream. That's about all I can remember


** Pretty sure it's Ice Cream Delights. The scene you're talking about is in Chapter 2.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew that a person's life could be changed in a single day, but until a summer day with Luna Lovegood he never knew that his life could be made forever better. Fred and George add their own wicked magic. Harry fights back. For romantics.
