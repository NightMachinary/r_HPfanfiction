I've really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young with Me]] recently and I'm looking for more. It doesn't need to revolve around harry with kids, although that seems like a common outlet. Any suggestions, long or short, would be super appreciated.

** I don't have any but if anyone can find one which focuses on Dumbledore's Army,I would love that.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
