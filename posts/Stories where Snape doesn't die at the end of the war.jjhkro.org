Where he either has the foresight to have a potion at hand, or someone else saves him. Or he was never attacked.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)

Just would like to see, Snape interact with everyone, after the war. And what would (might change), if he had lived, instead.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

No! Weasley bashing, as in Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, no Ron abusing Hermione.
