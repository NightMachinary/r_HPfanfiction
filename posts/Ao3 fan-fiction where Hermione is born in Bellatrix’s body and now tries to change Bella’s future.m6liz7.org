I read this fic around late February but I forgot to save it. It involved Pureblood culture and the Black house rituals. Please if you know the name tell me

**** Haha, no problem! I even had trouble finding it in my bookmarks because the author doesn't have Bellatrix tagged as a character at all, which threw me a bit.

Definitely a great story and I can't wait for the next chapter ðŸ¤©
