yes i know its a shitty trope but i dont care, send me anything you have - the longer the better.

especially fics where lily(/and james) never died, whether in hiding while harry fought or WBWL i dont mind

any ships, inc slash, are fine and i dont really care about trashy tropes either so hmu


** None of these are finished stories.

- The Difference by elvirakitties. This is the bashiest one I know of. linkao3(11912106)
- Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarrsson. She's not as bad as James, but still blindly following Dumbledore, to Harry's detriment. linkffn(13182638)
- Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper. Lily doesn't survive but is not a good person (neither are James and Sirius). linkffn(13218646)

  This is like all the WBWL, abandoned Harry, but with a twist.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.

** If you're fine with the Hermione x Severus pairing, my absolute favourite fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5751039/corvusdraconis][writer]] has several that involve Hermione back in time - whether by time travel, or she just happens to live in that timeline.\\
Couple examples: ^{I don't know how to use the fanfiction linking bot thing, sorry}
