** A poster in one of the threads below mentions /Like Sands in the Hourglass/ linkffn(12188150), which I think is the best Tonks depiction that I've read (given the very unexpected things that happen and further shape her character). She does much what I think canon Tonks would have done had she been put in such a weird quasi-deaged/time traveling position.

Tonks ends up crafting a new identity for herself and infiltrates Hogwarts to fix the future. Pairing: Harry/Tonks.
