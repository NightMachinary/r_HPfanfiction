James tells Lily to 'take Harry and go' and turns to face his death. But, in this fic, James is the main character, so Voldemort is going down.

** So I haven't read either of these fics, but they came up under google searches and the like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023942/1/James-Potter-The-Sole-Survivor]] Alt-Fic: Instead of leaving his wand behind as he does in the books, James takes his wand to fend off the Dark Lord while his wife and son try to escape. However, unable to keep the Dark Lord at bay for long, Voldemort manages to take the lives of Lily and Harry. Believing that he is now invincible, Voldemort falls prey to James' killing curse, leaving James the sole survivor. Rated: Fiction T - English - Ron W., Hermione G., James P. - Chapters: 2 - Words: 2,717 - Reviews: 3 - Favs: 6 - Follows: 16 - Updated: Jan 16, 2014 - Published: Jan 15, 2014 - id: 10023942

and a little different: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8807215/1/James-Potter-vs-Voldemort]] Lord Voldemort needed a body, and he needed one fast. Not willing to hop into a mere baby, or take the life of a mud-blood, he now resides within the soul of a certain James Potter. And while James is forced to live the life of a Dark Lord, a secret spy, he must also save his son from his worst possible enemy: himself.

**** I was joking.

That said, if we go by canon, I'm not /wrong/. James did die, after all. There would be no realistic scenario where he would be able to stand up to the most powerful wizard in /existence/ for more than a few minutes.

Just because you are the strongest doesn't mean you will *always* win, just that you win more on average than you lose. An underdog being victorious, either by having an amazing day while his opponent doesn't or by getting a one-in-a-million lucky shot, does happen.

Here are a few scenarios that could turn the tide:

- Sirius and Remus happened to be visiting that day and surprised Voldemort by cursing him in the back. (sure, getting reinforcements is a bit cheating on the premise, but story wise it'd work)

- James, being an excellent quidditch player, dodges Voldemort's first curse and then punches him in the face. Voldemort loses his wand in the surprise and then gets beaten in a physical fight. Double points for running him through in his stag-form. (those antlers aren't for show)

- James was cooking and carried a pan full of boiling grease with him when he opened the door. He throws the boiling grease in Voldemort's face and beats his shrieking head in with a frying pan.

Sure they are unlikely. Just like it's unlikely that Molly Weasley would ever beat Bellatrix Lestrange.

- Voldemort gets a bit of dust in his eye, James gets a lucky hit in.
- Voldemort stops to be an arrogant wanker, James gets a lucky hit in.
- A loose beam drops on Voldemort's head
- Lily sneaks around and sticks a kitchen knife in Voldemort's back.
- James uses some unconventional attack that Voldemort isn't prepared for, like a gun.

Your imagination is as weak as your comedy.

Surely that would make Lily the woman-who-got-a-lucky-hit-in. Not James.

A pureblood in hiding using a Muggle weapon like a gun? In a house with a newborn child? This is Britain, not America. Plus it's highly unlikely he'd know how to handle a gun much less accurately fire it at Voldemort and kill him.

Pff. The greatest wizard of all time falling to this? He's no doubt undergone rituals to avoid this.

#+begin_quote

James is more likely to do this. That said, given the sheer level of skill Voldemort has, he could probably be an arrogant wanker the entire time without breaking a sweat.

Rituals. Situational awareness. Magic. All of these can stop that. And Voldemort would have to be well-versed in all of these to have reached the point he was at that night.

It's naive to assume that Voldemort isn't intelligent enough to protect against this. Your attempt to discredit his character fails, as he is likely the most intelligent individual in canon after Dumbledore.

******* Voldemort is magically powerful, no doubt. But in canon there's no evidence that his physical body is anything more than human, so he's still susceptible to the same mishaps as the rest of us.

Again, in canon, Voldemort is not perfect. It's his own mistakes, rather than any competence on Harry's part, that lead to his downfall. He also does have an arrogant streak and a tendency to monologue, I could totally see a 'pride goes before the fall' moment for his character.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nah, James is arrogant, no doubt. But you're talking about a father fighting to protect his wife and child against someone who is way more powerful than he is. He's not holding back.

#+begin_quote
  It's naive to assume that Voldemort isn't intelligent enough to protect against this.
#+end_quote

Why? Voldemort is arrogant and probably considers muggles beneath him. Why would he go out of his way to protect himself from their weapons?

All in all, I think you're tooting Voldemort's horn a little too much and relying on stuff that occurs in fanon. In canon, he is most definitely not infallible or immune to the occasional mishap.
