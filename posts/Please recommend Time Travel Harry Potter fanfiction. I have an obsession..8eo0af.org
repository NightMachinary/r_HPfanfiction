Okay, so I have a serious Time Travel fanfiction addiction. Seeing how things change and the characters reactions? Brilliant. So, if you have any, and I mean any at all, lay them on me. Also, burn me at the stake, I love slash, and that isn't a creepy fangirl obsession. As a homosexual, I enjoy and connect with LGBQ characters more. Thanks!

P.S it's Harry Potter if you didn't get that from the title.


** Are you good with TMR/HP? Because buckle up:

linkao3(Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up); The Love of a Good Wizard; Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat; A Sky Far Away; Words Fail; Reaching Through Time; Hem of Your Garment; Locus by Shivani; The Three Roses by partofforever; Gilgamesh by Morgan Steelgrave; The Alternatieve)

Don't Fuck With Florists is a short one centered around Harry's interactions with Tom post-Hogwarts. A classic tbh.

The Love of a Good Wizard turns into primarily smut, but it was fun while it lasted. Bonus femslash there too!

Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat is the slow burn. It's mainly focused on character reactions because there is no back to the present, but Tom and the Slytherin's characterizations are brilliant.

A Sky Far Away is the only TMR/HP fic to make me actively root against the pairing. It's delightfully horrible, but isn't quite the usual time travel? Harry falls through time as a kid, thus lacking the reactions, but if you're down for Tomarry interactions in an abusive relationship, go for it.

Words Fail is similar to Wear Me Like a Locket, but the pairing actually happens quickly. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but this is all about character reactions as everyone knows.

Reaching Through Time I adored and is both present and past, but takes place when Tom and Harry are children. It's less about reactions and more about dealing with Harry's situation.

Hem of Your Garment is another all about reactions fic, but does deal with consequences later in. The chapters aren't even amounts of words, but it's not abandoned so it's got that going for it.

Locus isn't in the regular ao3 font and is also indented. It's present and past, but once again, Harry is a child in the past. It's alright but fits the consequences requirement.

The Three Roses is a time traveller shows up sporadically fic for a bit. It's a bit short and deals with consequences. It follows Tom for most of the fic.

Gilgamesh and it's sequel are incredible. It deals heavily with consequences because of Harry's actions in the past. The sequel brings the pairing in, but Gilgamesh is just as good.

The Alternatieve is wild. It's more dimension hopping and time travel, but it is time travel? It's more about interactions with strange reactions that don't quite get dealt with? It's essentially crack but very enjoyable.

~~

Phew. Okay, now there's one more I'd rec, but it is mpreg at the end. I personally quit the moment I learned of that, but until that point, linkao3(Moments in Time by Watermelonsmellinfellon) was amazing imo. It's past and present and has a chapter that's almost all about consequence if I remember correctly.

Is that enough? If not, go read linkao3(face death in the hope) for Regulus/Harry while I go pull out the non-TMR/HP fics.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  Tom Riddle thought he was dreaming the first time, but when he repeatedly visits the same boy, he realizes that bigger things are at work. He watches the boy in the cupboard grow from a small child and into a young man. His brotherly affections begin to wane. What will he do when the boy isn't so little anymore? Could he even imagine? Those Avada eyes calling to him. A/N: Morons will be ignored.

** Don't have any time travel slash fics to rec sorry; but circular reasoning and delenda est are 2 amazing time travel fics. Circular is extremely dark/ depressing where as delenda is more fun/lighthearted. A great femslash story with character development and eventual smut (but no timetravel, has lots of character reactions/changes though) is those gilded chains we wear, which actually makes a believable hermione/bella post final battle

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same.

  If anyone was going to gouge out their own entire magical core and throw up the middle finger at the laws of time, it was Potter. That was his usual modus operandi; find the stupidest and most impossible option available, and take it with as much collateral damage as possible.First things first: Potter had just rescued the both of them, and had done it in such a way that left him once again at death's door. That put them into known territory; Severus, once again, making sure Potter didn't die.Or: Harry Potter tries to fix the world and Severus Snape tries to fix himself.

  A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe?

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah.

  The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular.Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days.
