So I've been interested lately in reading fanfic about what the Death Eaters are having to deal with while all of this is going on lately. Or even a Snape fic that deals more with his spying that it does with him angsting everywhere or his friendship with Lily. Just... something from a more adult point of view, I suppose, that doesn't really spend a lot of time hovering around Harry and the Trio.

A few caveats:

- It has to be at least 80,000 words, and over 150,000 is preferred.

- I will not and absolutely refuse to read anything with a teacher/student or adult/student pairing. No Snarry, not even if one party has been aged up.

- I don't have a problem with other relationships, and am fine with or without them.

- I would prefer to read fics that have been started 2007 or later, because it means the author was at least aware of Deathly Hallows, though I have no problems with AU fics.


** The obvious thought for me was linkffn(A Difference in the Family:the Snape Chronicles by Rannaro). As it is the saga of Severus Snape, it deals a bit with his viewpoint on things, with an understandable bias.
