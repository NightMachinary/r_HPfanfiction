A fic where Ron keeps Harry and Hermione from going off the deep end into Dark magic use? Focus on world building and a slightly altered magic system from canon, Horcruxes still in play, and no intentional bashing. Not sure where I'd put the canon plot divergence yet.

Would anyone be interested?


** Sounds interesting, except I don't see the story yet here. See [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][my comments on exposition v. story]] and it applies here as well. What you have is a premise of the story, not the plot line (unless you have it and you are just trying not to spoil it, which is understandable).

** I'm interested! I could see the plot diverge during second year - everyone's already calling Harry a dark wizard, so they go looking for what that means, precisely... Send me a message if you start publishing.

** I would be interested in that premise for a story.

A good place for canon divergence in my opinion would be GoF. They see really dark curses the first time in that book; Harry actually fantasises to put Snape under the cruciatus at one point of the book. For the third task Hermione and Ron are helping Harry to study new spells. I think it is the only time in canon where the three of them "train" secretly. Hermione also would find a way in the Restricted Section - she has already done that once before. If Hermione doesn't find a way you could also use fake!Moody to stir them in the right direction.
