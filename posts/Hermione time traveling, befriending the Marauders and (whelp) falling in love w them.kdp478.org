Yknow.. the one where Hermione is somewhere after DH -- or in the middle of DH -- and she is using super strong magic (or a time turner) to access some other past, and poses as Dumbledore's goddaughter or McGonagall's niece or something...

And the Marauders instantly are chummy w/ her - and they kinda love that she doesn't turn her nose up at their antics (Hermione being well acquainted with the same-brand disasters of Harry and Ron) and also Lily being initially hostile and jealous because aNoThEr WoMaN gEtTiNg tHeIr attention -- but she is won over/stops being petty eventually.

kinda into Sirius and Hermione (mostly because I only ship Remus with Sirius or with Tonks). Idk -- I'm thinking of a piece in particular on FF net but i have lost hope that it will ever be updated.

(i don't have a great grasp of the tags on AO3 or sifting through there, so links would be very much appreciated)


** I'm recommending this one, although I don't like it myself. I know it's popular among those who like that sort of thing.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  Begins at chapter 31 of Pride-of-Time. Hermione does not de-age herself- not everything can be fixed in time, and sometimes the only solution is to move forward with what you have...

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
