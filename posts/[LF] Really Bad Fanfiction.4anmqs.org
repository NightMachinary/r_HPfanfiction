Sometimes, when I'm bored I just like to browse FF.net, looking for a story. More often than not, I stumble upon the worst fanfiction ever. Now I was wondering, what's the worst HP-fic you have ever read?

I'm not necessarily looking for crack-fics, but mainly well meant, but just really bad stories. Thanks in advance!


** BEHOLD! For I have come with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man][Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man]], a story in which Dumbledore gives Harry to Lily's distant relative... [[/spoiler][The Rock]].

  If James Joyce, William S. Burroughs, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Thomas Pynchon, David Cronenberg, and every death metal lyricist ever were all locked in a room with 20 tins of instant coffee, a typewriter and no chance of escape, and given one sleepless weekend to rewrite My Immortal, the results might end up being something like this.

Read it if you want, but I highly recommend this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V4VxlsMuQ4][dramatic reading]] instead.

** I haven't really read much, I try to only read good ones. But the worst one I read was a post battle novel where harry is an auror with Ron and there's a new character introduced who works with them and it turns out she's Voldemorts daughter and a new "dark lord". Just seems kind of dumb. If that sounds familiar to anyone I'd actually like to reread it since it was years ago

**** It's not THAT bad. It's that level of cringe that surpasses cringe, like SnapexTeletubbies. Which I read in its entirety. Frankly, the writing here isn't worse than 50 Shades, and those made money.

Well- I got to the line likening Voldemort's skin colour to something else that's white, it's pretty terrible.

The grammar is the worst part of this. That, and the visual of Umbridge.

But the phrase to summon Dumbledore was the best part.

Also, Nagini.

[[/u/hydropons]], I read the entire thing. And my life is not ruined. But I also read terrible fan fiction for the amusement of reading shitty smut and read the entire 50 Shades trilogy for the same purpose.

** - H J Potter (ugh, so bad, living in a magical training house where time is slowed down)

- The Real Us (no, just.. no)

- Anything by robst. Why is that author popular?

- True Colours Show (don't remember any specifics, just badness)

- Delenda Est (maybe a controversial opinion, but I think this is extremely overrated. Belatrix + Harry are both Mary Sues, horrible character writing, standard fanfic cliches)

This list probably seems like I am biased against Harry/Hermione fics, but it's probably my favourite pairing. It just seems to attract some of the worst writers?

#+begin_quote
  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.
