** There was this fanfiction I read before OotP got released in my country. A friend sent it to me, said someone had written their own version of the book, and it was in spanish, so he thought I would love it (he didn't read it) It was SO LONG, it was called Order of the Phoenix too and it was kind of amazing, although the writing wasn't the best. There was the new DADA teacher I didn't like, I thought it was too over the top evil, and I didn't like that Harry had a brief thing with Cho Chang (I was a Harmony shipper) and that they killed Sirius. But overall, cool.

Months later, the book got released and I realized I had read a fan made translation ðŸ˜‚ If I knew that I would have been the coolest kid in school, knowing what happened before anyone else ðŸ˜…

** Following on from OOTP, these are some of my favourites. Kinda tropey, but also fun and doesn't get 'too' caught up in it.

6 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire]] 7 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2460564/1/The-Time-of-Destiny]]

Abraxan also wrote several one-shots and a post-7 follow-up.

** Refiners Fire definitely comes too mind. I started reading fanfiction in 2004, and unfortunately, it seemed from 2005-2009 everyone was just absolutely fixated on an angst Harry Potter. One who was emotionally abused and physically abused who needed a dad, usually snape, to come rescue him and nurse him back to health and show him how to live.

Those years some of the worst fics ever produced happened. Peak fanfiction definitely came post 2012-2015 where some of the best fics ever written started to come out.

But yeah, those early years, most of the cliches and tropes were just the absolute worst. Abused Harry is one of the most cringiest things to read, especially where he just stays a little bitch and never does anything noteworthy.

*** Why do people fixate over Snape and Draco so much? Especially before book 6 and 7 where their redemption arc wasnt revealed yet and they're both just a piece of shit

**** Idk. It was just disgusting back then. Snape was still an asshole even after his redemption arc was revealed. Fanfiction has done a better job with snape than the books ever did. Though as I said, not those early cringe years lol.

** I don't know how to do the fflink thing that some people use for fanfics.

But honestly the hands down best fanfic series I've ever read has got to be the Saving Connor arc. Its completely AU, has a rewritten version of every single book, eventually becomes a Drarry (book 5 it begins, books 6 and 7 it gets intense). The author is LightningOnTheWave (/s, cant remember if its wave or waves). I have read it multiple times and it always gets to me. I first read it when I was 14 and im now (almost) 27. Its simply wonderful. Even if Drarry isn't your thing, the writing alone is worth it.

Edit: The bot messed up and I realized I have no idea if it's on AO3 or FFN. Let's try linkffn(Saving Connor)

  Okay, so this is a Detroit Become Human fanfic so it obviously has spoilers! Don't read if you haven't played/watched the game yet because it is so good! Sara Knight is a Detective at the DPD and works closely with Hank Anderson. Things become interesting when Conner arrives and their mission to hunt deviants commences. A romance develops as most Conner/reader stories do, but this is also a slow burn so keep that in mind. This fic basically follows the game (mainly Conner's scenes) with my character inserted. I keep it close but not exact to the game. I will change things to make my story make more sense so be warned of this. Enjoy :)

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  A sixth-year adventure told from Ron's perspective. RonHermione; HarrySusan. The Trio must stop Voldemort from wiping out Muggles. THIS IS A RE-WRITE. Rated R for language, violence, and sexual situations.
