Looking for a fic I read a while back. Wormtail makes a potion that can send a persons memories back in time. He throws James' skull in, so James receives his memories in the past.

The Marauders all start training for the war. Nobody blamed Wormtail for leaking the secret, because they all assume that the Death Eaters made Sirius crack on who the Secret Keeper was, so Sirius can't blame Wormtail for not being able to handle it.
