I remember reading this a couple years back. Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, Snape still hates him, Harry suffers from serious social anxiety and abuse, Snape discovers this but still has to outwardly be a dick to him. Only specific details I remember is that Snape discovers the extent of the abuse because Harry sets off some kind of warding charm by being out of bed early to go shower, then he's forced to drink potions with every meal in order to get proper nutrition.


** Linkffn(3736151) , Better be Slytherin. Pretty sure that's it. Though you'd have to pay me to read that again. One of the most depressing fics I've seen.

  YEAR ONE COMPLETED! As a first year, Harry is sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, and no one is more surprised than his new Head of House. Snape mentors Harry fic.

*** That title definitely rings a bell. I recently stumbled upon some other depressing (and really fucked up) fanfics and it reminded me of this really cathartic one. I'll give it a quick read and let you know if it's the one I remember!

Edit: Yup, this is almost certainly it! Thanks
