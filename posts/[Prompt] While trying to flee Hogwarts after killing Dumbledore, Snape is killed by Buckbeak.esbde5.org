** On the one hand, Snape won't be able to give the information on the Privet Dr escape, or be able to talk Harry into committing suicide by Voldemort.

On the other hand, Snape won't be there to protect the students from the other death eaters, to send Harry the Sword of Gryffindor, or to inform Harry that his scar is a horocrux that he totally should get rid of.

I don't like Snape in any way, shape or form. That said, I respect that he was necessary for victory.

***** The heavens better be merciful, because she most definitely won't.

How long would it take her to get "bored"?

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.
