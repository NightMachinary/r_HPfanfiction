I'm somewhat new to HP fanfics, but I see that a lot of it is naturally based around the established characters, settings, and/or events in the books and movies. Generally, I love the creativity and reading characters and stories that are developed differently than they were in the canon. It's a fresh experience with an old material. But I also feel like the HP universe has so much story telling potential outside of that.

Is there a desire in the community to read stories that are completely or almost completely original, but happen to take place in the HP universe?

I mean, they might include figures who are appropriate to locations, like a minister for magic or other ministry official, for example, but the stories are based on new characters and events.

What do you think?


** In regard to your first question - yes and no. Some people want those, other people are just here to read 'The Adventures of Harry Potter and Friends part 3006'. You'll get some who are attached to the world, and some who are attached to the characters.

Personally, I don't mind. Any idea can be fun, if it's done right.

*** I get that. Everyone comes looking for something different. Sometimes I like diving into Harry and Friends adventure #1000000, but sometimes I also like to see what else the world has for me.

** Check out the Alexandra Quick series for a nearly completely original story set in the Harry Potter universe.
