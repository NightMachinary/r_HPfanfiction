An good fics where the oc is the main character or prevalent throughout the story.


** I wouldn't venture to describe my own work as good, but a decent number of folk have enjoyed it, and it's got an OC main character (not to mention, I updated it an hour ago!): linkffn(12327848)

*** I /would/ venture to describe your work as good, and it's a crying shame that it's getting less traction than my own effort despite being head and shoulders better and visibly the result of a lot more effort.

*** I read this after your recommended it, it is SO good! You're not giving yourself enough credit; everything about this story is so good from the characters to the world building to the plot. I highly recommend this.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** I'm co-writing a fic that features a fair few OCs, and one of them is a main character. You'd have to be the judge of whether or not it's good though.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Easy. 'Grow Young With Me' first and foremost, because it's an exquisite fic about sad, lonely people learning to be less sad and lonely together; second is the bleakest motherfucking fic I have ever had the delight to suffer through, 'Behind Blue Eyes' where Harry runs away with an Emo Muggle Girl and everything is really, really bleak throughout most of the fic.

** The Its TeaTime series has some great OC's, particularly the second and third story. The OC's are mostly students/friends of the Potter/Weasley next gen and the third story goes into life after Hogwarts. Love Caden, Nora and Iset and many more, esp LilY Luna's twins! Great writing, but the OC's are not the main focus of the story but prevalent

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Behind Blue Eyes and Grow Young with Me are no brainers. If you're looking for a non romance I recommend Realizations. Post GOF - it's one of my favorites.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
