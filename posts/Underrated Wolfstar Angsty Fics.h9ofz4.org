Doesn't even have to be that underrated, just chock full of angst and well written! Any suggestions?

  Remus lives a quiet life after the war. He works on his book, thinks of the past, and spends all his spare moments with Sirius. It all seems so perfect. Only when have things ever been perfect?A story of friendship, loss, second chances, and a complicated love that endures beyond reason.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/125988]]) - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/125988][Do Wizards Dream of Magical Sheep?]], wherein Sirius comes back from the dead. Sort of. Maybe. A much more serious story than the title would suggest, especially if you're not a Phillip K. Dick fan.

** Check out this series it is my absolutely favorite Wolfstar seriey bit smutty but angsty with a hoperul ending. I loved the characterizations. It's basically a story about what would happen if Sirius got spat out by the veil when Remus is already married to Tonks. Wolfstar is endgame of course. This is the first work Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini)

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
