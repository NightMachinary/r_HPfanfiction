I've been reading a few Mass Effect and Star Wars crossovers that have Harry as an /incredibly/ powerful character and they've been great guilty pleasure reads.

I'd like some more however!

I've just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]], which is a Mass Effect crossover and it was great!

Also finished (although the story is still in progress) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]], which is a Star Wars crossover that I'm greatly enjoying as well.

Can anyone recommend similar styles of stories? They don't need to be harems, regular old monogamous Harry is fine with me. Although I would like if he was at least moderately powerful in the context of the universe he's in. Star Wars and Mass Effect crossovers are first on my list, although I'm completely open to other fandoms!

Also, Brown coat, green eyes is on my list!

Thanks!


** Three WIP stories I think fit your criteria:

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  What happens when you give a man who can bend reality to his will the license to do so whenever he wants? Harry Potter, internationally renowned wizard, left Earth to fight for the Alliance under the codename Shepard during the First Contact War. Now, when Alliance leaders are looking for the best Spectre candidate possible, an old dossier comes to mind...HP/LL, not HP/MEgirl pairing

  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

**** The first one is fine. Also, for comments where linkffn() is already there, use !refresh instead of !parent (see sidebar guide).

** Sorry I don't have a recommendation, the only ME/HP x-over I know is lightening among the stars and I haven't read it. I just wanted to say that this is why I love this subreddit, I love Star Wars, ME, and HP, and fanfic toon for all three, but I didn't know I wanted these stories until I saw this, now I have five new fics to read. Anytime I need something to read I just look through here for a request that sounds interesting and I walk away with half a million words worth of reading. Great post, thank you.
