Hernan Perez is the rich influential patriarch (and villain) of the family and his trophy wife, Genoveva Perez had a secret affair with Diego Tomaso in the past which has come back to haunt her.

They also have three children:

- Jesus Saturnino Perez who has a troubled past and has just returned home after being caught stealing from a Colombian cartel of potions traffickers;

- Alberto Sanchez Perez who is the the heir apparent to the Perez empire and has been promised to his wife Rosalinda Garcia-Wellenos, but is in fact in love with the Perez housemaid Winky;

- Lucrecia Luna Perez who is a respectable Healer at the Hospital San Munjo but has a secret affair with a small-time crook called Santiago Monterey, son of Hernan's rival, Domingo Monterey.

I just wanted to get this out of my system after reading the word 'Hinny' today.

******* I agree but sometimes it's hard to come by. I'd like to read about Nobby Leach where he is actually a powerful man who fights for the rights of Muggleborns, but even in the few one-shots that he appears in, he is always presented as this weak man who is continuously manipulated by Abraxas Malfoy. Actually there was a one shot where he stood toe-to-toe with Voldemort (still for the wrong reasons :() but he was the main catalyst for Tom getting his followers so wrapped around his finger. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find something like it again.

********* I think it was called Best Enemies or something like that but I can't find it anymore. It's basically a meeting between the two in a pub and they both act as moderate parties in the events that follow the Pureblood riots against the Squib marches, but they both throw veiled threats at each other. Nobby is very sick of an unknown disease though and knows he is going to die so doesn't really care when Voldemort resorts to death threats.

Edit: found it and remembered why Nobby was on the wrong side but I won't spoil it for you anymore. linkao3(15449145)

** JK.

*** To be fair, Harry Potter was not intended to be a romance novel and one thing I really like about JK is the fact that she can write the main characters according to their age, while most of the fanfic writers who focus on pairings are clearly more romantically/sexually experienced than 11-17 year old teenagers and they often forget that. For example a girl of 14-17 years won't know how to act like a seductress the same way a 20+ girl would know (unless she had the really horrible misfortune of ending up a sex trafficking victim). Nor will a guy of similar age act like a suave Casanova when it comes to sex.

******* Herbert from Family Guy is also not real and he's supposed to be a parody of an old man pedophile. I'm not going to argue in Casanova's name since I read his biography and he did some really shady stuff. Also he is long since dead so he doesn't give a shit. But his name became synonymous with the ultimate suave seducer so it's pointless for us to argue on the matter and I'm pretty sure you got my point before provoking me in this fruitless debate.

Pointless debate but here goes anyways

​

1. People use fictional characters as an allegory all the time, so what I did made perfect sense, and him being fictional has absolutely no bearing in that realm.
2. Makes no difference whether or not he cares; one can judge a historical figure whose been dead for 3000 years. So I'm confused what you mean by that.
3. Never linked you to defending Casanova lol. Was more like "haha, you're grossly understating it". Not everyone is reddit tries to prove the other person is dumber than they are, so chill (only half of reddit does that! XD)

********* Well I won't lie to you but it kind of pisses me off when someone comes and comments on something that isn't related to the main argument because I feel it ruins its value. I used the term Casanova in a certain context that explained how I thought teenage boys in some fanfics behave. I didn't care to talk about Casanova's life and personality.

Another thing that aggravates me is that you cannot respond in a single comment. Just edit your original one if you feel like you forgot something... otherwise you're just spamming me.
