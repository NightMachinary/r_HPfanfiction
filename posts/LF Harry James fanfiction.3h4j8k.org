Okay, here's what I remember. Harry is "Harry James" and owns a restaurant/nightclub in Paris. He's using a glamour charm or similar to disguise himself to appear bald(ing). Ginny meets him when the Harpies (I think) go there for a party. Any ideas?


** harrypotterfanfiction.com the story is called As Time Goes By written by harrysmyhero There is a sequel called The Locket but it hasn't been updated since 2014

I like a lot of the fics on that site but they very rarely get mentioned here. I loved that story btw. Just wish the sequal would be finished.
