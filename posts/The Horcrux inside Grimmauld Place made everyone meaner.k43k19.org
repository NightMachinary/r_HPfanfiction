From what we saw with the Horcruxes, they seem to change people. the ring, Dumbledore put on, (maybe a compulsive spell?), even though he knew it was dangerous. With the diary it changed Ginny's personality, making her do Riddle's bidding.

Maybe with the locket there, it also made other people act out more then they would have? Would esplain Molly acting out in a way that was really cruel to Sirius.


** Eh, this is a slippery slope and a common excuse for the Dursleys behavior in Dumbledore bashing fics.

The ring appears to be the Hallow Dumbledore wanted above all else and Voldemort wanted whoever found it to put it on. The curse on it would've killed anyone else within a few minutes.

The locket is different in that it was never supposed to be put on and neither the ring nor locket were meant to instantly kill anyone (besides being bait), so their presence didn't negatively affect anyone until they were put on/used.

  The mother in Molly reaches out to a grieving child. Harry starts worrying about Dumbledore once he sees the hand, and decides that they need a contingency plan. Over a bowl of too hot onion soup, the course of the war is changed. Voldemort is faced with an actual adversary in the form of the Order of the Phoenix. Mentors Bill, Moody, and Fleur.
