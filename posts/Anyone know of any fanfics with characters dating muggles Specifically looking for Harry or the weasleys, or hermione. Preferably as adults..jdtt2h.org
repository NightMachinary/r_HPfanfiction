I've read Love and Old Black Shoes, Behind Blue Eyes, and that one where Harry falls in love with a muggle barista after Ginny dies and he's a widows father of 3.


** You would be thinking of Grow Young With Me.

Honestly, I'm not sure what others exist. It would be tricky to get past the power imbalance inherent in a relationship where one person can bend reality and the other can't. I started one where Harry got hold of the waitress' number from the start of movie six, but I wasn't enjoying it much and didn't continue.

*** “Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19” linkao3(16405130) is certainly the most famous of them, but I like also:

- “Escape by SingularOddities” linkffn(11916243) and its better pre-/sequel “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities” linkffn(12373273)

- “Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89” linkffn(9566537)

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

*** You have a sad life if you care about the power balance in your relationship. My wife plays musical instruments, I don't. I am really not that much broken about it. Whole concept of half-bloods is dependent on wizards/witches marrying Muggles.

**** I do realise that the concept of half-bloods is dependent on marrying Muggles, but canon never actually shows us an example of it working out.

Harry is defined as half-blood, but only because his mother was muggle-born, not from a wizard marrying a muggle. Likewise the Tonks family, except in reverse, with the father being muggle-born. Dean Thomas might actually be half-blood, but his father left because the divide between their worlds put Dean's mother in danger. Seamus recounts (possibly just in the movies) that his father /didn't know/ he'd married a witch until after the fact, and that it was a shock. Tom Riddle is a half-blood, and we all know how well that worked.

If there are any canonical cases of successful marriages between wizards/witches and Muggles, then they are entirely off-screen.

**** There is a fundamental difference between "one spouse plays an instrument and the other does not," which is simply a hobby, or at most a career, and which the other could participate in and learn to do if they're sufficiently interested, vs "one spouse can perform magic and the other can't." Not that it couldn't possibly work, but that the gap is a very real obstacle.

Consider a relationship where one spouse is able-bodied, even athletic, but the other was born entirely crippled from the neck down, and also blind and with a shortened life expectancy. If they are sufficiently dedicated and selfless, then they might be happy together, but it would be challenging for them. There would be many things that they can't share, from artwork to any kind of physical activity (including intimacy). The disabled spouse could very easily feel like a burden, and that's in the best-case scenario where they actually appreciate what it's like to be able-bodied (which, having been born as they are, they might not). And even if they are such outstanding people that they can work through all of that, their life together would be inevitably shortened.

Yes, a power imbalance on the level of magic vs mundane is significant.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her.
