It's been a loooooooong time since I read this one, but it keeps popping back into my head at the most random times.

I'm a little afraid that I might be combining multiple fics in my head, but I /think/ it went something like this:

Hermione is a Ministry employee who gets sent to Malfoy Manor to help with a creature/beast problem.

In reality, Draco has come into some kind of non-Veela creature inheritance and needs his mate. I'm pretty sure he switches between human and creature, and doesn't tell Hermione that the mysterious beast is actually him.

Hermione discovers that they're a unique kind of magical creature, realizes she's his mate, and frees his father from Azkaban on the grounds that the Ministry has regulations about separating mates, and they obviously can't imprison his mother for nothing.
