**** The premise also sounds similar to [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=315&chapter=1][The Unexpected Result Of...]]. The writing is not as good as Emerald Coven, but it is one of very very few (the only?) HP/GD fics that takes place while Harry is in Hogwarts and doesn't use any age retcons or Veela Super-Puberty Hoodoo.
