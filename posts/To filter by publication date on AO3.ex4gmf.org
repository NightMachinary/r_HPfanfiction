I've recently tried to branch out to AO3 to get my fiction needs sated, but i have been unable to find some way of only looking at, say, fics published within a week or month - exactly as in FF.net.

AO3 is definitely more refined in terms of searching/filtering (i've found varias tips/hacks), but this one feature is cruical - does anyone know how?


** Sort by - Date Posted

More Options - Date Updated - Add in whatever dates you like. You can find fics published between Third of March 2016 and Fourth of January 2017, if you like.

*** And is there a way of sorting by, say, kudos, but filtering for fics pulbished within a week?

So getting the "best" fics posted this week, in a sense?

**** Same thing, only Sort by Kudos instead of Date Posted. Sort by gives you the order, Date Updated gives you the dates you want fics within. Just put today's date and a week previously's date.

***** But wont that also include fics that were updated in that time period? Perhaps i was not clear, i am looking to have a list of published fics only - not updated.

****** Ah, right. Then no, sorry. Only if you order by date posted and write in your current dates.
