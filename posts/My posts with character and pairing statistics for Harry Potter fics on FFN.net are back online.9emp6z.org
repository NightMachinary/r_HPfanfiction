I've submitted a few times to this sub with some data analysis of HP fics from Fanfiction.net. I'm also the guy that put together [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit?usp=sharing][this list of most popular fics on this sub]]. I took down my site about a year ago (stopped paying for hosting) but decided to put the info back online using a free account. I've had a few people ask about it, so without further ado, here are the new links!

** Thanks!

Do you have a new list for this year? That would be great.

*** I found [[https://pushshift.io][pushshift.io]] as an alternative way for searching reddit and holy crap is it amazing.

I have a script running now that's downloading the data from 2018. I should be able to make a new list soon.

*** Sadly, no. Reddit no longer allows you to search by timestamp, which is how I collected the data from every post in order to count links. The best I can do is get the 1000 top posts from the last year (sorting by "Top") and count URLS from those posts. My dataset from 2017 had ~7000 posts, though, so 1000 posts probably won't be accurate.

I've heard there are 3rd party search tools available, but I haven't looked into them yet.
