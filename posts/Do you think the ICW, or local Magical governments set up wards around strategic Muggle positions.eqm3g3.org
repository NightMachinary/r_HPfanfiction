Like, parliaments/senates/etc, presidential residences, and other such places? I really cant wrap my mind around the fact that no Muggleborn or Halfblood until now hasn't just Apparated inside Fort Knox and take off with the entire gold reserves. Just an example, but you know what I mean.

I saw fics where Wizards mug/beat/rape Muggles by just exploiting the Imperius and Obliviate spells, but I never really saw any big time heists like that. Nor their possible effects. There have to be some kind of defenses, right?

â€‹

Edit: If you know fics that touch on topics like that, or magical robberies in general, feel free to post them. And yes, I have read a Black Comedy.


** I always imagined that Wizards wouldn't really care. Between conjuration, alchemy, and transfiguration you can probably get everything you need, so why go to all the effort of robbing those primitive Muggles? Apart from the few who are emotionally motivated, it seems very few Magicals are willing to put in actual effort towards any goal. Makes sense, to my mind - having magic means most things are instantaneous and you don't really have to work towards much once you know the spell for it (and we've all had the conversation about how shit Magicals are at learning Magic), so why would you do difficult things when you have an easy solution to hand?

Even if someone did go to the effort of robbing Fort Knox, why would the magicals care about it? If memory serves, their coinage is enchanted somehow, so they'd be able to tell the difference if that gold (to continue your example) was used in their world. If a Muggleborn robbed Fort Knox and took over the Muggle World - equally, why would they care? Unless they revealed magic, it's not their problem.

*** First of all, Muggle money can be exchanged into Galleons at reasonably favorable rate.

Second, Muggle money can be used to buy real physical gold (and other precious metals). Goblins and Wizards both take real gold.

Third, this money can be invested in other real assets such as real estate. You can cast Anti-Muggle charms on Muggle real estate, and it becomes a magical property! Hey, even Dursley's home can be connected to the Floo network!

Some people say that this is all illegal. Well, Ministry only cares if you throw around flashy spells in the public. They don't care what magic you do behind closed doors, and they don't care about memory charms at all. You see Wizards obliviating those poor Muggles at will in Book 4. You see Ron boasting about confunding a Muggle driving instructor in the Epilogue. Harry Potter, then the head of Magical Britain's elite police, actually finds it funny. The Trio was hunted by both Ministry and Death Eaters during Year 7 and cast all kinds of magic in Muggle areas, they were never caught. The Ministry's ability to monitor magic use in Muggle areas seems to be quite limited.

**** Exactly. Clearly, they don't care. Which actually fits old British ruling policy of Laissez-faire government. I think it's rather like the Unseen University in Terry Pratchett's Discworld and their position on taxes. The University promises to pay taxes, provided the city doesn't ask them to. The Ministry promise not to care, so long as the public promises not to play merry-buggery with their already-shite economy. In an economy like we see in Rowling-Magical Britain, having all that gold wouldn't make you rich, it'd just devalue gold.

****** Yeah, every muggleborn with a master in potions and charms has the potential to become filthy rich. Heck, they can smuggle drugs and make millions in a month... the possibilities are endless.\\
However, I think that its realistic to think that there is an actual organization that keeps an eye on such things so that people who use their brain once in their life don't exploit the situation.\\
It's just too unrealistic to believe that the Harry Potter world would work like it does if there isn't some type of controlling organ that keeps the 'normal' and the magical world split apart.

*** Alchemie is too expensive to be of use for the larger masses. Its most likely extremely hard to find someone who can teach it, and you have to be quite powerful to make the stuff last. Transfiguration wears off after some time so its really only making life more comfortable, but you will still need a real bed if u don't want to make on on a daily basis. And stealing gold from muggles does pay off... galleons are enchanted, but the gold has to come from somewhere\\
.You can't just run around steal stuff... really. It's actually pretty dumb to believe that the muggles don't know of the magical world. There is most likely some muggle organization that keeps an eye on what is happening in the magical world so that they can prepare/adjust everything. There is a whole lot of reasons why magical can abuse their powers too much. And I think that everyone can come up with some reasons after 1-2min of brainstorming. And I also believe that there is a 'peace' between magical and muggles because magicals are useful for the environment. They can literally heal nature and so on. Muggles, on the other hand, deliver stuff like raw resources, food, wine, etc. No self-respecting wizard/witch will work in a mine, and only the oldest and richest houses can afford a house elf.\\
Well, my point is that both parties are dependent on each other in some way or another. The books didn't make it clear of course since it doesn't really matter to the main plot, but to believe that wizards don't profit from muggles and vice versa is silly. And I also bet that at least 10% of the muggle population knows of the magical world to some degree. My belief is that the leaders of the muggles 'educate' the normal folk into thinking that magic isn't real and that everything can be explained in a logical way - like... I'm actually insane and need to visit a psychiatrist.\\
Not all muggle-borns end u working in the magical world, and their parents know about magic. Nobody can really think that they don't talk. Sure, the ministry will punish everyone who breaks their laws of secrecy, but we all know how incompetent they are since most purebloods still think that muggles live in dirty wooden cottages - and these are the people who are somewhat leading the magical world.

**** Impermanent Transfiguration is pure fanon, for a first point. And I don't know where you got the idea that Alchemy is expensive. I couldn't find anything on that. It's also offered as an elective at Hogwarts, implying it's possible on a student budget. And there isn't enough Gold in any one place to make a gold theft worthwhile. There's about a 30x30m cube of gold worldwide. A tenth of that is in phones and other technology circuit boards and such.

But the main point about stealing is that unless you directly steal money, you need someone to buy what you're stealing. A fence, usually. If you don't have someone willing to buy your stolen shit, then stealing doesn't get you anything beyond the shit you've stolen. Like great, you have a truckload of apple watches, or iron bars or whatever else a magical person might need. That doesn't mean you automatically get rich. You have to find either a hundred people who want an apple watch or the random required thing and sell the goods to them in a way that can't easily be tracked or find a fence who'll buy the stuff off you and sell it on themselves. Just stealing gold, assuming you can hypothetically find enough to be worthwhile, is pointless without someone to buy the gold or to print it into coinage and enchant it for validity (like faking the magical watermark on paper money). That was my point. Stealing is easy, making money off the things you've stolen is hard. There's a reason most people don't do it beyond the social contract. You need an infrastructure to move your stolen goods on, and there aren't really enough Wizards to have that. And if you were to steal and then sell it in your shop (eg. if Fortescue stole a bunch of foodstuff units and sold them in his shop) then the Ministry would presumably notice and either get you for stealing or get you for not paying proper taxation on your imports or whatever. Selling stuff legally needs paperwork. Selling stuff illegally needs legwork.

I mean, all of that is possible, I suppose, but it's all speculation based on speculative foundations. Some people know because they probably should know isn't really a sound argument. If anything, it's more likely that the Wizard's simply exert their strength whenever they want something and the Muggle governments let them do it in order to avoid being obliviated or whatever magical consequences have been stated/implied to exist in punishment for them not doing what they want. A threat is actually more effective if you don't demonstrate than if you do - the wizards just need to appear like they can punish a Muggle for talking and the threat will be effective for the majority of people.

Plus, like we see in the books themselves, Kingsley is apparently so adequately understanding of Muggles that he can fake being one without the PM noticing. The 'they're all ignorant Purebloods' thing is mostly fanon based on a few big examples like Arthur and Fudge that could just as easily be personal ignorance rather than institutional examples. Malfoy knows what a Helicopter is and its general function, for example. They're ignorant, yes, but not as ignorant as fanon insists. It's why I don't think there'd be an Organisation of Muggles keeping the secret - Organisations have paperwork and the paperless office is a total myth, so any paperwork is something a Wizard could track.

I agree that they probably import the basics into the Wizarding world from the Muggles though. But there are other nations and other species who could take the mining load and similar jobs. They could probably purchase base metals from the Goblins, for instance.

I have no idea what you mean by 'useful for the environment' or 'they can heal nature'.

***** Ok, I admit that I'm heavily influenced by fanfictions XD sry, I think I need to re-read the original books if I want to argument with pure canon stuff.

My argument with alchemy was that it should be rathe rhard to learn since it requires knowledge in multiple subjects (potions, transfiguration... etc) I think so. So I guess that nobody really would want to learn it only to make more money.

'useful for the environment' or 'they can heal nature' I thought about druids or so. But Im not sure if they are just a product of fanon :o

****** No biggie. Headcanon whatever you wanna headcanon, but canon is what canon is. Personally, I prefer mostly fanon stuff myself anyway - Rowling was great at making a world seem magic, but she wasn't good at making her world seem like a world. Flimsy AF worldbuilding, as the kids might say these days. :)

You have a point there. It is probably hard to learn, but in the same way that mechanical engineering and chemistry is. If you wanna learn to make money, you'd probably be willing to put the effort in, just like you'd probably be willing to learn chemistry if you wanted to make meth. People get into medicine for the money, and that's a nightmare of a thing to get qualified to do.

I mean, druids are a real thing. We have a whole bunch of them gather at Stonehenge here every year. No actual magic, obviously, but they're a real group with things they believe in. Modern Druidry does the whole healing the world thing, but there's a lot of evidence that older Druids from before the big decrease in the group's popularity didn't. I don't remember them ever being mentioned in canon, but I'm not overly familiar with canon either. :)

** also, there is nothing to stop a wizard duplicating muggle bills and spending them. Goblims could recognise fake cash but if you had a hundred dollar note and duplicated it one hundred times you can make ten thousand dollars easy as anything.

** One of the reasons I dislike the fanon idea of "wards" is that canonically, wizards place very little faith in fixed magical protections. With one notable exception (the Bond of Blood Charm), even with the very best protective enchantments, the best they seem to be able to achieve against a determined, resourceful wizard is delay. In the magical arms race, the state of play is somewhat like the state of castles after the introduction of the cannon: fixed defences may still have some use, but there is no such thing as an impregnable defence.

Rather, wizards place much more store in active defence, such as:

- Having a wizard at hand to actively combat enemies e.g. Kingsley protecting the PM, or Order members guarding the Department of Mysteries;

- A powerful magical creature to protect a place e.g. Fluffy (the obstacle which presented Quirrell with the greatest difficulty in PS), Voldemort's inferi in the Cave, and more generally acromantula and sphinxes;

- Curses which seek to harm intruders after entry (rather than Charms to prevent entry in the first place) e.g. the cursed Peverell ring; the potion in the Cave.

The most protected places have a combination of these: the Lestrange vault was guarded by a dragon and had the Gemino curse inside; Egyptian tombs have curses, magical traps, and magical creatures defending them.

Personally I like this piece of worldbuilding. It reflects the general principle of "the problem is, the other side has magic too" - that is, whatever magic you may set up, while it may be OP against non-magical forces, there will always be another piece of magic to get around it. When you set human creativity against static defences, human creativity will always come out on top.

So ultimately, if you want to protect something, there is no replacement for being there in person. So to return to the OP question, I doubt there are "wards" in place to protect senior Muggle figures. However, there may well be wizards assigned to their protection. Unlikely to be an Auror in normal times, as they are a valuable resource that you can't just have sitting around protecting a Muggle all day, but maybe a mid-level DMLE official.

** They could and they should but they won't. Wizards are...well, selfish is the best word I can think of. Most of them ignore Muggles but they'd still want carte blanche.

Remember, the SoS wasn't created for non-magical protection; it's for wizard convenience. Since the protections won't be helping wizards (and in fact would be hindering them!) they won't do it.
