I am writing a fic about Black's beautiful inked body.. Sirius Black runs to ink himself a tattoo whenever he's tortured by his family or whenever something good happens in his life..

I have some ideas like... -He has it inked - 'All Blood is Red' when his mother tells him to be friends with pure blood only.

-He has the phases of moon cycle on his back

- When he got to know about Reg joining Voldy , He got a tattoo of a dark mark and stroke it off mutiple times..

-He has it a tattoo GODFATHER written in bold with a bolting scar sign -He has a lily flower on his wrist with initial- L

-He has dog paws impression on back of his hands.

-It's inked over his chest-I 'M A REBEL...

Can you guys help me with some more...


** Give him a biker tattoo! The whole flying bike thing is an important component in canon
