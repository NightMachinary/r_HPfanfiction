Harry watched as dumbledore met voldemort in the ministry his scar burning. With a twinkle in his eye dumbledore stepped up to do battle. "Do you think the elder wand is enough to defeat me" voldemort spoke, his voice arrogant. "I may be old but I have seen much in my time, there are ways to defeat men such as you" dumbledore said calmly the twinkle in his eye shining brighter.

"Avada kadavra!" Voldemorts cast, with vitriol in his voice. The twinkle in dumbledores eyes now a shining white light as if he had taken all the light in the room and reflected it off of his eyes, the green light of voldemorts spell engulfed and overcome by a torrent of pure light magic. Voldemorts flesh burned as the concentrated supernova of light flooded forth from dumbledore eyes, his dark soul burnt from the purity of the twinkles in dumbledore eyes. Unseen by both harrys scar emitted a dark smoke and began to fade slightly.

I'm a bad writer so if this comes across as stilted I'm sorry.

** Same universe:\\
- When someone breaks the rules, *Hermione* turns berserk (looks very similar to Super Sayan transformation) and becoming OP until the rules are restored, while muttering 'Honestly...' under her breath\\
- When *Nevile* feels insecure, he gains a fighting style similar to 'drunken brawler' only his is 'awkward', he is constantly moving in weird patterns while smallest move of his wrist casts the most awkward spell in the worst possible direction, looks like a disco ball from a distance\\
- When *Ron* eats like a pig, anyone who looks at him turns into stone, anyone who hears him talk with a full mouth, become deaf, madame Pompfrey is not amused, since students have nightmares after recovery..\\
Cant think of anything good for Harry
