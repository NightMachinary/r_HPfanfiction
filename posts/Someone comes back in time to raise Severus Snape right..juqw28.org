1937.

The year Voldemort turned 11. The easiest point to kill him.

Even though killing a child was abhorrent to him, it was fucking /Voldemort/.

He could get over this bit of child murder. Believing this, he activated the time travel ritual.

1971.

Unfortunately, this was the year he found himself in.

It was completely unexpected. Voldemort was at his absolute peak, both mentally and magically and was actively waging a shadowy war against the British Magical World. Meanwhile, his ability to fight using magic had actually stagnated due to the time spent on creating the time travel ritual.

Well, it was a relief that /fighting/ Voldemort wasn't what he had to do.

/Killing/ Voldemort would be simple enough, though - he possessed an ancient ritual that when cast upon a horcrux, destroyed it, any other horcruxes forged by the caster and finally the caster of the forsaken magic. After the rediscovery of the ancient ritual in the era he hailed from, it had been widely publicized to deter any copycat Voldemorts.

He knew the location of one Horcrux that lied in the depths of Hogwarts. Accessing it wouldn't be easy since he wasn't a student anymore, though. Being a timetraveler who wasn't even born in this era compounded the problem.

That's why...

+++

"Dear, you were lost in your thoughts again." The chiding voice seemed somewhat amused.

He turned around to spot a grin on Eileen Snape - no, Eileen Prince's face. It seemed genuine - she didn't have a reason to fake cheerfulness, nor did she have reason to call him 'dear'. Her son was away at Hogwarts, after all.

Thinking of the haggard face that greeted him in the beginning, the woman before his eyes seemed completely alien.

"...It's been a week since my last job. This Mastery in Magical Architecture doesn't keep me as busy as I expected..." Getting the Mastery had cost a pretty penny - fortunately the foreknowledge of decades of stock trading that he had memorized had come handy.

"It does pay handsomely well, though. You could buy a new house for yourself..." Eileen sounded worried.

"Oh Ms. Prince, I like this place too much to leave."

"This place? Spinner's End?" The undercurrent of bitterness in her tone, the sarcasm - so reminiscent of Snape.

But she was right. Spinner's End was one of several streets lined with deserted brick houses and broken streetlamps, near a dirty river and an abandoned mill. Not a place to which one could grow a liking to.

"I meant, I... I like the company." Eileen Prince blushed beet red at his awkward reply. This wasn't something Snape would be capable of.

"Thank you for that compliment, Reinhard." Eileen said, the blush still not receding.

"...Your son doesn't quite like me, though. Severus seemed to have a bone to pick with me when he left on the Hogwarts Express." I hastily changed the topic. That greasy git was less nastier than he remembered, without the influence of his father. He was damn suspicious of the man who popped up from nowhere to take his father's place, though.

"Severus does understand. He is somewhat shy, though. I think the time in Hogwarts will do him good." Eileen didn't sound worried at all. If she had faith in anything, it seemed to be her son.

+++

Before he knew it, almost half a year had gone past. After his arrival in this world, in this year. If he could go to the Room of Requirement and destroy that Horcrux, he could have ended Voldemort and the war early. But Dumbledore was the Headmaster, and a shifty character like him would find it impossible to enter the Room of Requirement and set up the Reaper's Beckoning Ritual.

(Of course, there was no Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burkes yet. He'd checked.)

And so, he decided to come here to Spinner's End. After watching Eileen Snape get beaten by her husband, he came to her with a deal. He would drive Tobias Snape away, and she would let him stay in this house.

Chasing out Tobias Snape without breaking Muggle-baiting Laws wasn't difficult at all. Ensuring he stayed away was easier. Taking on the persona of a German wizard who migrated to Britain was the hardest. (He stopped faking the German accent the day Eileen couldn't hold her laughter.)

After that, he began the process of integrating into the current Wizarding World. Creating identification for his new persona in both magical and non magical worlds. Applying to be examined for the Mastery in Magical Architecture - and passing, with flying colors.

The only reason Dumbledore would let him in Hogwarts would be for a job. Becoming a Professor would be too much of a stretch so it was time for the next best thing. The magic that held up Hogwarts wasn't self repairing and magical architecture repair was a vocation that Dumbledore hadn't mastered himself.

He had jacked up the prices for building magical architecture and lowered the pricing of magical architecture repairing to make it more enticing. Unfortunately, literally every work that he had been employed for was a building job...

"I wonder too, why your skills in construction are more prized than your repairing skills." Hearing Eileen say that with her biting sarcasm, he realized he had spoken out his thoughts aloud.

He wondered if she had taken offense to the remodelling done to the house. The kitchens, bathrooms and beds were fixed up. Space Expanding Charms so that the small room wouldn't stifle. He built a Potions Dungeon for Eileen's enjoyment, a small garden for growing Potions ingredients and replicated the Great Hall's enchantment of the Starry Night in the hall to help with ritual magic.

"...I enjoy repair work, you know. Getting to visit the marvel that is Hogwarts would be amazing as well." Well, the Marauders had joined the school. There would be mayhem, and there would be stuff to repair. Until then, though...

He had this place.

"You didn't get it, did you?" Eileen seemed exasperated. He shrugged.

"Mr. Reinhard... after your business at Hogwarts is done... will you be going?" Eileen said, her voice fading into a whisper at the end. He was careless - didn't know how she found out about his goal.

"..." I didn't know how to reply. While I intended to go back, while I had things dear to me in the old world... The changes in the timeline... perhaps it would be good for me to remain here.

"Mr. Reinhardt, could... I persuade you to stay?" Before I knew it, Eileen was in my face. By Merlin was she beautiful. I understood what she meant by persuading me to stay...

"...Please, call me Ron." I said this to Severus' mother.

Maybe I'd have the greasy git calling me daddy when he returned home...


** This reminds me of a couple of raising Tom Riddle fics.

One is where Luna was sent back to raise Tom after everyone died in the war. He ended up becoming a war leader again, but this time against the ministry and purebloods for the muggleborns. (Side note: she always refers to Harry as his father and says that he would be proud and it makes me cry every time). I like to think Severus would end up like that, still powerful and an excellent wizard, but not so angry.

Another, Harry goes back and marries Merope and raises Tom. He's still a psycho/sociopath and it's sad to see him struggle with not feeling human emotions. I can also see Snape going this way. It would still be easy for him to be hateful and delve into the darker side of things, but he's also got a loving support system.

Also, I absolutely loved that ending

*** Thanks. I'll just post a outline of how the story would go if I went further.

Since this has Ron as the time traveller, there are some clear differences from other stories of the type. Ron is somewhat careless as is evident in my oneshot - Eileen finds out that he is faking being German and has a mission that requires him to enter Hogwarts pretty quick.

But Ron is also extremely scrupulous about certain things - mostly warding against recurrence. Ron never drinks and turns wine into water whenever he is invited to drink socially. Ron is also extremely laissez-faire with Severus, fearing he'll become abusive.

Eileen is the one who is strict with Severus for the most, and Severus grows up well. He tries to understand his new father, but mostly fails. Severus does find out about the 'turning wine into water' thing and realizes that Ron is trying his best at the very least.

Eileen tells Snape about Ron's desire to fix Hogwart's architecture, and Snape cooperates with the Marauders to blow up a part of the castle. Ron uses the ritual and Voldemort is destroyed. Ron decides to stay back so that some parts of the future he came from won't get butterflied away in the new timeline.

Eileen reconciles with the Prince family - they are relieved that she isn't together with a muggle at least. Severus actually invites Lily home during the vacation after 1st year ends to practice magic. Ron realizes to his horror that Harry might get butterflied away if Snily comes true. The story ends with Ron vowing to fuck over Snape's love life for the Greater Good.

** Linkffn(doubting Thomas)

And

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6715591/1/Boy-Who-Lived]]

(I'm afraid the bot will link the wrong one on the second because of the title.)

IMO, Doubting Thomas is better written, but the second has such a unique premis that it's worth the read.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.
