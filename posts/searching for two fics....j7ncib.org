:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey,

so the first fic i'm searching for starts in the chamber of secrets where harry is poisoned by the basilisk and everyone thinks he is dead (fawkes never appears if i remember correctly and ginny walks away i think, not sure). Then his body changes he becomes bigger etc. and he is in some kinda sleep and awakes a year later, after that he takes a lift from the chamber and appers in the great hall and everybody is suprised he is still alive.

The second fic i'm searching for is a short harry/daphne it starts during the battle of hogwarts, daphne fights bellatrix and then harry fights voldemort, they win and they want to be left alone, they secretly dated and trained since their fourth (?) year.

Thank You

  The writing on the wall said she'd been taken, that her skeleton would lie in the Chamber, that no one could find, forever. Everyone believed it because they still had no idea where it was. Ginny/Harry. Slow Burn.
