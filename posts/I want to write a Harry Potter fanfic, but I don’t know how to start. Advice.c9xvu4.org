(Sort if I used the wrong flair, I wasn't quite sure what this post would be considered).

I want to write a Harry Potter fanfic, but I have zero idea of any specifics. I don't know who I want to be the main character, and I don't know what “trope” I want to work with. I also don't know how to figure these things out. There's just so many thoughts buzzing around my head that I can't focus on one long enough to really consider it. Can anyone help me?


** I mean... the world is your oyster. Think of what you want to read, and write it.

If you want to ease yourself in and see which characters you enjoy writing the most, start with some one shots - little missing moments or behind the scenes, perhaps, or what if type things.

** What are some of the things you want to see in a fic, what common things do you like to read, and how can you make those tropes better or different?

For instance, I like rich Harry, dark Harry, and arrogant Harry. I'm also a rabid Hermione, Remus, and Snape hater, lover of Bella, Sirius, James, and Dumbledore, and pretty neutral on Draco, Ron, and Lily. I can read just about any pairing, but I'd love to see more Harry + Cho/Astoria/Padma and better written Harry + Daphne/Fleur. I'd love to see more Ravenclaw Harry (that doesn't turn him into male Hermione), Beauxbatons Harry, and mentored Harry.

So what can be done with this?

HP goes to Beauxbatons and befriends Fleur. Finds a mentor in Nicolas Flamel, who reaches out to him bc of Dumbledore, who Harry is no fan of. Now bc he's at Beauxbatons, Ginny can die and Riddle can come back. Riddle befriends Harry. Harry gets darker and Nicolas doesn't really mind it bc he encourages Harry to all of magic. Harry discovers who Riddle is and kills him. Sirius' Azkaban stay is prolonged. Triwizard tourney in Harry's 6th year at Hogwarts (Dumbledore lowers the age) as BCJ looks for/finds his master. His friendship with Fleur blossoms.

There's a lot more that done with what I like and want to see, but yeah.

Eliminate bashing from your story and it's 80% better than the majority of stories on ffn. Give consequences for character actions and it's 90% better. Have your character work towards a goal and it's closer to 95% better.

** There's two big schools of thought when it comes to writing, and it comes down to simulation or climax.

George RR Martin is a simulation author. He plots out the characters and the world and then 'simulate' it. Every plot point flows from the actions and reactions of the characters as they try to navigate the world.they have found themselves in.

By contrast, Steven King is a climax author. He has the highs and lows of the story in mind and the characters are vehicles to get the plot from inciting incident to climax.

I deliberately chose two very successful authors as exemplars to show that neither is wrong. They just result in very different kinds of stories. (And this is also one of the reasons why the last season of GoT is shit on - the sudden transition from character to climax is jarring!).

** Imagine one interesting scenario that you haven't seen anywhere so far, think about how it might play out, and write a short (<10k) oneshot. Don't try to write a million word series as your first work. With a short story you don't have to plan out too much and you can just write your idea down. Example: linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Power of the Atom), my story about "what if Hermione knew Alchemy and Physics".

  Alchemy is the art of permanently turning one element into another. That's something muggles can do, too. One-shot where Hermione kills Voldemort by nuking Malfoy Manor.

** The others are right; start with a one-shot, a shorter story, and don't reach for more until you're reasonable sure you can handle it. I had the great plan to start writing a fanfiction one day, and it's still incomplete with the last chapter update having been almost a year ago. Start slow, build up.

** One thing I like to do is think about a sentence to end the story with, especially if it is a one-shot, which is a great way to start. Then I work backwards, explore why a character would say that sentence, or think it or experience it. A random example I am improvising: The end sentence: Hermione cursed Harry, blaiming him for her headache.

Now, why would she curse Harry and what would that have to do with a headache. From what we know of both characters, Harry often gets into trouble and Hermione is always by her side as they navigate their way. So, perhaps he is in the middle of another trouble. But Hermione curses, which is out of character. So, it's either something extreme by their standards, or it is something needlessly complicated to the point of being amusing from the outside.

What would those options entail? Perhaps Harry's brand of luck struck, but this time without any dangerous stuff. Maybe it's a social situation? What trouble could Harry find himself in socially? Well, we know Harry is not the most social boy and his love life is nearly always awkward. So romance?

But why would Harry's love life give Hermione a headache? Perhaps because he made things outrageously awkward? Perhaps, in his desire to impress a girl, he overdid it? Fell into the trap of trying to flirt with the wrong girl? Who could be a wrong girl? Why not the daughter of a suspected death eater? Perhaps Pansy Parkinson?

But why would Harry flirt with Pansy when he describes her as pug faced and obnoxious? Perhaps they had a moment where suddenly Harry's opinion of her changed?

Why would that happen and how? Maybe Snape, in a fit of unexpectedness, paired them together and Harry and Pansy's potion somehow blew up in their faces. So Harry, feeling bad because Pansy was injured due to his mistake, wanted to make things okay so he, in his awkward bumbling manner, apologised to her and asked if there was anything he could do to make it up to her.

Now, we know little about Pansy personally so this allows us some creativeness. Perhaps Pansy is an astronomy enthusiast and asked for Harry's help in sneaking to the astronomy tower some night when there is a special astronomic event, somehow knowing he has a way of sneaking around. Harry, being the good boy he is, helps Pansy. During their star gazing, Harry can't help be affected by Pansy's enthusiasm and the romantic night they share looking up at the stars as Pansy shares some cute anectode about how she and her father used to watch the stars together before his untimely death. This shows Harry a new side of Pansy and makes her sympathetic.

So now, here Harry is, asking for Hermione's help in asking Pansy out, a month and many verbal duels, during one of which Harry made the mistake of using Pansy's dead death eater father out of anger. Hermione is exasperated at his friends choices and in pain due to laughing way too hard at both Harry's predicament and the expression on his face.

Not a particularly groundbreaking story but it is a story that came made itself known in just a few minutes. All it needs is an hour or so of polishing the idea before writing it. As you polish the idea, scenes will come to you. Don't waste them. Write it down. Write everything down. Every description, no matter how out of place. Every dialogue. Every setting. Every idea.

Then piece it all together.

It mat not work for long fics with multiple plotlines but I think this method is a good start.

** I would start by writing a 3000-4000 word one shot about an encounter between your two or three favorite characters and then go from there. I started by writing a Hermione/Harry one shot and now I love Daphne and Harry fics and can't get enough of them. I am also 100k words deep into my own story
