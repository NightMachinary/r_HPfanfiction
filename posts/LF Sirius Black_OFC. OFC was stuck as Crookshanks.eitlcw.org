Okay so the only thing I remember about this story was that the OFC was friends with them at Hogwarts. Harry saw her in the scrapbook of his parents and asked Sirius about her and Sirius talked to the trio (+ Weasleys maybe, I remember this happened in OotP in Grimmauld Place) about her and how she went missing and how he still loves her or something. It lead to the realization that Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, was actually her and she was cursed to stay in that form and they had to find a counter for it. Or something like that.

I've been trying to think of the name of this story for years and can't find it anywhere. Any help is appreciated!!


** Idk, but following!

Do you have any other Sirius fics you'd recommend?
