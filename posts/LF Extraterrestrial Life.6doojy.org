Looking for stories that deal with aliens. Can be a crossover, can be good or bad aliens. Just something where magical world (and Harry) gets pitted against something other worldly.

Please no Hurt/Comfort/Harem/Gender-Bender/Pedophilia/Creature-fic. Other than that anything goes.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** Harry Potter & Stargate Xover: linkffn(The Stars Alone by Darth Marrs)

 

It's actually a sequel to another story where Veil of Death dumps Harry into the Star Wars universe and then he is tortured/broken to become a Sith lord and can use the Force. Then he somehow comes back but he is not the old Harry anymore. He is darker. Then stuff happens and he starts building an empire with the ultimate goal of merging the whole muggle/magical world. He is also not aging and powerful. For that story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains by Darth Marrs]]

 

In this story -[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/42/The-Stars-Alone][Stars Alone]]-, Harry Hermione and Luna are betrayed and then dumped into a different planet via a Stargate. Then they find out they are not just in another planet, also another universe where aliens wiped out magicals years ago on Earth. (Basically Stargate universe with a little magical history thrown in). Then they start building a galactic-scale thocratic empire with the intent on destroying Goa'uld and freeing their slaves etc. (Because Harry, Hermione and Luna are the only magicals, they are revered as gods by some people) Nice worldbuilding with godlike badass Harry with lightsabers and Force (Force and magic are different things and Luna is strong with the Force).

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

*** Thank you for your suggestions. In theory it looks interesting, but I am no way interested in a three way / Harem stories. It also seems one of the stories that throughly discards canon and realistic characters and everything way over the top.

**** Well, don't discard a story that looks interesting to you just because it has a bad trope in it. I myself don't read harem/multi stories and the reason I didn't want to read it at the first glance was similar to you. But the story isn't really centered around Harry's sex/romance life. It's not really a harem story. And writing is very good. It's a personal taste ofc. I enjoy it. It's still work in progress and the writer is still updating regularly. I also enjoyed the SG-1 show so it's a familiar territory for me.

** linkffn(7156582)

It's a doctor who crossover with an alien from the show in it. It most certainly fills the criteria of 'the magical world pitted against something otherwordly', except it's just Hogwarts. It's an excellent story however.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
