(Edit) no crossovers


** It's not caused by his godfather's death... but linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) has that

** Recently there have been at least three dark fem!Harry stories, and I like all of them:

*Cult Potter*, linkffn(11827316): this fem!Harry is actually not very dark, but very ambitious, charismatic, and intelligent. By the end of first year, she already had gathered hardcore followers across all houses.

*Heart and Soul*, linkffn(11761312): she is not evil, but fights back ruthlessly and violently. Dead bodies are already piling up by the summer after year 4.

*Call Me Moriarty*, linkffn(11602420): she basically created a Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious situation for herself. She was light side's 'The Girl Who Lived' on one hand, and the Dark Lord Moriarty on the other. This fem!Harry felt overpowered, but the story is very fun to read.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  Edith Potter's life with her abusive family taught her two things. First - the only language some people understood was violence. Second - fear only lasts a generation; kindness lasts forever. The Girl Who Lived returns to magical Britain a cynical visionary; drawing in allies from all four houses for an end game neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort anticipated. Dark!Fem!Harry

  There is a reason why everyone wants a piece of Harry Potter; the twelve-year-old is considered a prodigy by the Wizarding World, after all. But Harry has chosen his side. The Headmaster and Minister of Magic can try as they might - Harry is a dark wizard. Now...if only he could get in touch with the elusive, recently resurrected Voldemort.
