After many complaints regarding the lack of magic usage in her DADA class, Umbridge decides to have her O.W.L students review boggarts for their upcoming exams. She certainly /did not/ pick the subject in question because she enjoys watching people be tormented or the potential for incriminating information to arise from the exercise.

As Harry steps forward to face his boggart again, he prepares to perform the Patronus charm against the dementor he is sure will appear. He is therefore surprised when his boggart isn't a dementor. It's Cedric Diggory.

"It's entirely your fault that I'm dead. You just had to be the noble Gryffindor and insist I take the cup with you. You are supposed to be the hero, but you just stood there as I was killed. You're death to everyone around you. Your parents would still be alive if it wasn't for you too. Whose next? Someone really should warn Weasley and Granger...."

I was reading some boggart fics the other day and thought this premise might be interesting. Most fics about boggarts focus on when they actually appeared in canon, and if they change the boggart or it's different then canon it usually is one of the Dursleys, Harry himself, or Voldemort. After a summer filled with nightmares of trying to save Cedric and feeling guilty over his role in his death, it would be interesting to see his boggart become Cedric blaming Harry for his death and failure, as well as pointing out that he wasn't the first and likely won't be the last person whose death can be tied to Harry in a way. It would also be interesting to see the fallout from such a thing. Most of the staff just seem to ignore the potential trauma that Harry suffered seeing a classmate die, and most of the students seem to have moved on other than Cho.


** I halfway wonder if Harry's greatest fear is his past/memories and the Dementor is just a physical representation of that fear rather than being the actual fear.

Like maybe Harry is subconsciously afraid that he'd have to relive all of the torment he has gone through in chronological order and is afraid someone will find out about his abusive home life.

*** I don't think so. Harry witnesses so much death that I think he becomes immune to it. The most heartbreaking chapters in the whole series are the mourning chapters after Sirius and Dumbledore die. But then it's jut like Harry is unaffected. He spends like two paragraphs mourning Hedwig, he gets over Mad Eye after a glass of firewhiskey, he digs a grave for Dobby and then never thinks of him again, he spends another paragraph mourning Fred and he briefly mentions Collin, Remus and Tonks.

** And maybe that would convince the Ministry that Cedric was killed

*** ...and that Harry killed him. At least if it was during the 5th year and under Umridges watch.

** One of the students greatest fear is Umbridge in a skimpy outfit.
