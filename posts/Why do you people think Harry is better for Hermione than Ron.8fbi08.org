** You are just mad that I and others have exposed you for the pathetic troll that you are. If you were actually interested in having genuine discussions, instead of deliberately trying to start flame wars and controversies, you would not be sending PMs like [[https://imgur.com/WK0tlOK][this]] and [[https://imgur.com/a/XDqf0vY][this]] to me (and others?).

By the way, did you send [[https://imgur.com/a/Lkh1vXA][this one]] too a few months ago? Something tells me you did.

Also, [[https://imgur.com/a/laFwYXY][well done for confirming my point]]. The irony of you, a pathetic troll with nothing else to do on your hands, telling me to get a life, is bullshit. Also, if anything, you are the stalker, as this is the fourth "confrontational" PM you have sent me.

*** You have made accusations of trolling, but have provided no examples of actual trolling or misbehavior from the sub you Mod. If the person is a troll, you are in the process of feeding them. Stop.

At the moment you do appear to be stalking the person, having followed them here just to make vague accusations on a thread in a subreddit that you do not Mod.

You are also accusing them of sending a threat of violence against you. If you feel this is an actual threat, I would recommend contacting the authorities, but at the minimum I would contact Reddit and have the person banned.

** From what I've seen, most people think Ron and Hermione are so different they couldn't find a middle ground strong enough to support a relationship.

Also, in the movies Hermione got a lot of the good parts that were originally Ron's and it Harry/Hermione in that light for some people (to me it just showed a wonderful and strong friendship).
