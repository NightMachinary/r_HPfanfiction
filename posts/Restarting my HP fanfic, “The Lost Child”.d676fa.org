Hey there,

So I've started rewriting all of my past chapters and decided to completely overhaul my story to improve it. I'm always looking for advice so feel free to drop some if you have any as I'm kind of having a writer's block period at the moment. It's a WBWL story but I'm aiming to avoid most of the typical story tropes and angling for something completely different.

First chapter is up. If you read it, please let me know what you think. Thanks!

** Grammar and spelling advice:

- Always put a space after a colon =:=. So, for example, ‚ÄúDisclaimer:I‚Äù should be ‚ÄúDisclaimer: I‚Äù
- Chapter titles should use title case, the same as story titles. So it should be ‚ÄúChapter 1: The Beginning‚Äù.
- Put a space after an ellipsis =‚Ä¶=. So ‚ÄúAnd yet...not a soul‚Äù should be ‚ÄúAnd yet... not a soul‚Äù.
- You mention a ‚Äújuvial charm‚Äù that blows bubbles. The word you're looking for is ‚Äújuvenile‚Äù. ‚ÄúJuvial‚Äù is not a word.

It's important to get your grammar right, because from my experience, stories with multiple grammatical errors near the beginning are usually not worth reading in the end. Therefore, if you hadn't asked for feedback, I wouldn't have read your story past the third paragraph. There may be other readers with a similar time-saving rule who you will lose unless you have the basics right.

As for the content of this chapter, it didn't get me hooked, because most of it seemed pretty similar to canon. Most of the extra detail felt like padding that I wanted to skip past -- specifically, how Voldemort found the door, scorned the Potters, and felt pain while dying. That is because those details are pretty similar to canon, and don't add much to the story I couldn't have guessed. But the changes of there being two babies, the babies having different personalities, and the parents both being wounded but living are more interesting because they are different from canon (and from most other stories on FanFiction.Net). I would find the chapter more interesting if you cut down those long descriptions I mentioned so that the parts you changed from canon would stand out more. Of course, I don't know which of your details will become important plot points later, so if there are any sections like those, you can't remove them.

Good luck with your rewrite.

*** Thanks for the advice. The extra detail is mostly there to flesh out the chapter more, otherwise it'd be very short. There are some important parts of it though.

**** A short first chapter wouldn't be too unusual if you called it a prologue instead of the first chapter.

In general, longer texts are not always better. To demonstrate that I am not the only person who believes this, see the [[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/][family of quotations]] ‚ÄúI have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter‚Äù, and Strunk & White's rule 17, ‚ÄúOmit needless words‚Äù, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style][/The Elements of Style/]] ([[http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf][downloadable PDF]]).

*** As for putting a space after the ellipsis, I'm pretty sure that's based on preference of the actual writer. Some people put a space after it, and others don't. When I write, I never put a space after the ellipsis because I don't feel like it needs one.

**** Yeah, the space makes it look and feel disjointed.

**** I know an author who consistently uses double dot, with no space afterward and followed by a lowercase letter, for a shorter pause, and three dots then space then capital letter (ie new sentence) for a longer pause. But I don't think that's any official rule.

**** I stand corrected. After doing my own searches, it does seem that different styles guides recommend different amounts of spacing around an ellipsis. I didn't find a guide that specifically recommends no spaces around an ellipsis that represents a pause, but there may be such a guide out there.

I also forgot to say that depending on the style, an ellipsis should have different spacing when it represents omitted text than when it represents a pause. In my own style, I would put spaces both before and after an ellipsis if it represented omitted text with no punctuation at its boundaries.

**** Oh, I'm sure your story is a great read. I just saw the similarity and had to have my daily dig at that play xD. Hope your restarted fic does well, I hope to get the energy to do the same with some of my fics! :D
