I'm looking for fics released before or shortly after Goblet of Fire.


** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][The Paradigm of Uncertainty]] (which was pre-GoF) holds up pretty well. It has some plot points that sound rather ridiculous now (Super Mage Harry ftw), but it is still well worth a read IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]] is the other big story from this period. Post-war, published soon after GoF's release. Excellent technical writing and characterization (better than PoU), but the story is much more slower paced than PoU's more action-y plot.

*** Is there any action in After the End? I have read a few chapters but the story seemed pretty dull. I readto the point where Harry and Ron got drunk for the first time

**** There is, it's just slow paced because of the length and style. I thought it was a good read though.

** This will only be sort of helpful but based off of the publication date of July 8, 2000. I did a search of fanfiction.net based on publication date using all ratings in English.

This link will fall more and more out of date as it goes on but it'll put you in the ball park of stories made around that date.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=2&lan=1&r=10&p=22162]]

As a note I'd avoid searching for older stories marked as complete or incomplete since most old stories were never updated when fanfiction.net started tracking that.

EDIT:

For a sort by update date which would say nothing new was added since July 8, 2000. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&p=22174]]

Now this is only about a 312 story difference which it a lot smaller than I was expecting.

** The only good one I can remember right now is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/48785/1/It-s-Totally-Cool-To-Howl][It's Totally Cool (To Howl.)]], a Marauders one-shot.

** Why only 2001? You should extend it a bit to June 21, 2003, AKA the end of the Three Year Summer.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1][After The End]] by two of the Sugar Quill mods/admins and their friends is supposed to be the single best story from that time. I've only gotten through about 6 chapters of it so far and it is pretty good.

Or you could go for anything prior to GoF, which was released on July 8 2000. Though I guess you might want to stop at the first movie (Nov 15 2001) but it was in production over a year before that so it's not much difference.

** linkffn(Existence After Life by Cygnus Crux) and sequels hail from the "shortly after Goblet of Fire" time period. Additionally, linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by Ruskbyte) (serendipitous title) is also from then.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

These were some of the first stories I read. Some of it might be some what cliche by today's standards but they weren't at the time. 6 long stories. 5th, 6th, 7th years plus 3 more at different years post Hogwarts.\\
P.s I didn't even know about the 6th in the series so thanks for making me think to look it up.
