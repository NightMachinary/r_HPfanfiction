Harry travels back to first year, going into Slytherin. Severus has the first years have a meeting to get to know one another, Harry begins to realize that he has misjudged them and begins to open up. His abusive and neglected background come to light. Sirius is freed, but Azkaban has left it's mark, he can't distinguish his past and present, frightening Harry (though I think this might be part of the sequel).

Edit: this story is old. Also more I remember about is that Harry (and the other Slytherin firsties) has to tell a hidden truth about themselves, Harry's truth is that he killed a man. The man was a former teacher who committed suicide (I believe), but Harry feels responsible for it because it happened after he told the teacher about his home life. Draco is frightened of his mother. Theo is suicidal (I think). Harry is friends with Hermione but not Ron. Severus is a temporary guardian of Harry, until Sirius is free. Harry returns to Severus after Sirius attacks Harry during a delusion, which scares Harry. That's all I can remember.

It was well written and for the life of me, I can't remember the name, nor the author. Help is appreciated.

Edit 2: I found it! The Other End of Time by SamanthaKathy. Perseverance pays off in the end!!!


** This is not Harry traveling back, but Snape, but I think everything else sounds about correct.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I remember that story! From memory the story (not this installment, but over all) is incomplete. I think I started to loose interest when the cutting subplot became a major thing... I didn't enjoy the heavy teenage angst slant of it all (not that a cutting issue isn't serious, just how the author dealt with it stunk of a teenagers romanticized view of the issue).
