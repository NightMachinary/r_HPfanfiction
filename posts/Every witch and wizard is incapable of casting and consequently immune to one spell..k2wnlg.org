Not everybody has a useful or righteous spell immunity. Neville can't cast the bubble head charm. Luna can't cast the tickling jinx. Draco, hilariously, failed his first practical charms lesson. But the golden trio is special---each is immune to one of the unforgivables.

*** The reasonable choice would probably be something like the patronus or the cheering charm.

The amusingly ironic choice would be an obscure spell he discovered that grants immortality with absolutely no drawbacks. (And of course, he destroyed all records of it after he found it.)

The amusingly mundane option would be something something like a hair growth spell.

**** I'd think it would certainly make sense for Voldemort to be immune to the Tickling Charm, though after his return, I doubt he has much in the way of a sense of touch to begin with.

(On the other hand--or foot--Luna being immune to the Tickling Charm is either absolutely perfect for her, or the absolute opposite of what I'd expect for her).

Also, if Harry is immune to one of the Unforgivable Curses, does Voldemort also become immune to it after taking his blood? That could be trouble.

Edit: Though the thought occurs to me, Luna being immune to the Tickling Charm does not mean she'd be immune to tickling itself.

**** Sort of on this topic: one of my most favorite fanfiction scenes is in Robst - No Hurry at All.... Where Harry having been portkeyed to the Head Master's office after the Dept of Mysteries, decides to escape, but first pees in Dumbledore's pensive. Both Dumbledore and Snape use the pensive, the next day the whole school witness both men with washed & cut hair. Sometime later the whole school finds out what happened and even more hilarity ensues.

****** I like Robst. When I first started reading FanFic; Robst was one of the first writers I found. It's well written, light-hearted, fun and yes sometimes a bit "fluffy". Sometimes after reading a gritty, harder version of HP in Fanfiction, I just want to smile a bit, laugh and just enjoy a good read. Robst provides that for me. I usually re-read his " A Different Halloween" once a year, because it makes me feel good; and sometimes I need/want that. No writer ( professional or amateur ) can appeal or appease all their readers, but considering how many Follow & Favorites Robst has, many many ppl enjoy his work. I for one am grateful for his hard work and his willingness to share.

**** The reason Moody is such a feared Auror is because he keeps thinking he was "just a little too slow to get the shield up in time" and so he keeps working himself to the bone getting faster and faster without realising he's immune to the shield charm. Eventually he's so fast nobody can dodge the sheer quantity of spells he puts out and it's only when he was fast enough he didn't need the shield.

If someone is immune to a certain spell, does that mean they're immune to an equivalent potion?

** what would harry's unforgivable be? AK or imperio? he has bene under both and broken out of both, probably ak and just a natural at throwing of the imperio but not immune. I think hermione should be the one with the imperio since it fits best with her character with her advocating freedom. I can see her use a torture curse faster than ron though, so ron would get the torture curse immunity. harry not killing, ron not torturing, hermione not controlling? idk
