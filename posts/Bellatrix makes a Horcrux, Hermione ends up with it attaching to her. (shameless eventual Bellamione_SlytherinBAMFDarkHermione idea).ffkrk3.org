After Voldy gives her the cup and Malfoy the Diary, a (somewhat) sane and disillusioned Bellatrix decides to make her own as a backup for when everything inevitably goes tits up, but only one, because she's smart enough to notice the effect it's had on Voldy, and a book/diary is a pretty good idea actually and decides the best place to hide it is clearly out of the way in a muggle library.

(So she's still loyal to him, but recognizes Voldy has gone round the bend and is just trying to keep the cause on track i.e. the interpretation of Tom and horcruxes where Tom was once smart, sane, and charismatic but ruthless (and that's why Bella became so loyal to him) and the both of them are much less muggle and muggle born hating then they pretend to be -they DID try to recruit Lily after all- but making so many soul pieces made him batshit insane - one is mostly fine, but every one after that has an every greater effect on one's sanity)

(i.e. their original cause was lots of personal power, much less regulation on magic and 'dark' creatures, tightening up on contact with muggles and muggle influence, having muggleborns raised in the magical world etc which was also want Slytherin wanted- hated muggles but not muggleborns)

After all who the fuck would ever suspect that Bellatrix fucking Black would ever hide a piece of her soul in a muggle library? What's one (muggle-repelling) book among thousands?

So one rainy night (ambiance eh) at the height of the war she places a book with the unassuming title of "Chalk Upon England's Mountains Green: A In-depth Analysis at the Production of and Effect on British Blackboards During the Victoria Era: Unabridged Edition" in the back of muggle library in (insert whatever the hell Hermione grew up here, seriously, secondary protagonist and we know fuck all about her childhood/parents).

Then one bright morning (*C O N T R A S T*) little (like 6-8 yrs old ish? idunno what age would a precocious child start devouring complex books?) muggle born Hermione Granger visits her local library - as Bellatrix Lestrange screams in hell on earth (seriously, fuck dementors) and Bellatrix Black is bored as fuck stuck in a book (headcanon - Bella did NOT want to marry fuckhead Lestrange) - and finds a very special book.

'Cuz she's Hermione fucking Granger - she *WILL* +devour+ read *ALL* of the *B O O K S*

(Shameless plot device for why she doesn't just chow down on 'Mione's life force; there's not enough juice in a kid's life force to power it, Ginny was *just* enough for Diary Tomo)

So Diary!Bella charms this little muggle born with all kinds of juicy magic knowledge - it takes her about 5 seconds for her to realize kid!Hermione is the nerdiest little nerd who nerd-ed - to get her to trust her so she can nom on her when she's old enough.....to power the resurrection (get yo head outta tha gutter hehe).

A little while passes and Bella is shocked to find.....she actually likes the little bastard! And realises Little Hermione has *potential*, very smart and a lot of natural power - just like herself when she was that age. So Bella makes /plans/ mawahahaha, her and Voldy failed in their revolution to remake Wizarding Britain, she's determined to make sure she and Hermione don't fail in theirs.

Little Hermione spends all the time she can writing to her (only) friend in the magic book and it turns out pouring your everything into a Horcrux in such away and the horcrux purposely *not* devouring it has....side effects. Namely the horcrux moves - afterall a soul fragment *wants* to be in a living body, not dead pulped wood. Que Bella ending up in Hermione's head.

Hermione's parents are vaguely worried that their little princess doesn't seem to have any friends but an 'imaginary' one called Bella but, she's happy, she's steamrolling through her education, and they're *everso busy with the Dental Practice (headcanon - Hermione's parents love her but are distant working professionals hence why they didn't seem to mind that Hermione spent a lot of winters at Hogwarts and most of her summers away) so heyho.

It also turns out that spending everyday talking to Bellatrix Black from mid childhood to the age of 11 has some....influence....on one's personality, so as soon as the hat touches her head it packs her off to the Snake pit. Slytherin muggleborns are /rare/ but not impossible after all (I refuse to believe there's never been a muggleborn in Slytherin).

And so Hermione is /determined/ to do her best friend proud (Bella and Hermione both displayed a fanatical level of loyalty to those they gave it to in canon, think about what Hermione actually did for Harry, it's not obvious like Bella's was for Voldy, but in a lot of ways it was similar though obviously not as extreme) and find a way to get her her own body, seeing as Bella's older/main self has surely gone mad in Azkaban by now, and hey, if they're making her a new body it might as well look the same age as Hermione when it's made: que maybe getting Narcissa involved to use the Malfoy money and influence to create a fake persona for Bella as some unknown Black- Bellatrix's or Sirius' or Regulus' daughter etc.
