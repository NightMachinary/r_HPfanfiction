honest discussion, why does almost everyone hate the ship?


** I'm not opposed to Harry/Hermione in theory, but I tend to avoid those stories because most people who write Harry/Hermione don't bother to change the canon relationship enough to make it believable. Bottom line: it wasn't in the books, so the shipper has to add it in.

In canon, Hermione was a friend who frequently acted like a bossy older sister. She and Harry did not share a single romantic moment. The story is told from Harry's viewpoint, and he never thinks of her in that way, not even in a passing thought. To take that canon relationship and have them suddenly revealing feelings for each other is crappy storytelling.

If you want to make a non-canon relationship work, you have to backtrack and sow the seeds. There are myriad jumping-off points, most notable being after seeing her dressed up for the Yule Ball, but instead they tend to jump to Harry suddenly deciding to ask her out or kiss her. A relationship does not spring out of nowhere.

*** I think there's a reasonable case for something arising out of seventh year. They spent a lot of time together one on one, and if Ron hadn't come back when he did, then maybe something could have arisen from their shared struggle.

Also, with canon being Harry's point of view, I find it more plausible when an author asserts that Hermione felt something she didn't act on, than Harry. As you say, canon doesn't make their relationship romantic - but Hermione thinks of everything, it would be surprising if she hadn't at least considered the possibility years ago.

Totally agree that I'm ok with Harmony in principle, but picky about it in practice.

** Before reading fanfictions, I was rather . . . undifferent toward Hermione and this ship. Even if I think that Harry/ Ginny was not really built up (total lack of interest from Harry and then a "monster in the chest in HBP), I could not see anything in canon that would even hint toward Harmony. Though to be fair, exploring differents ways from canon is the goal of fanfictions.

Then I started to read fanfics, and my opinion from Hermione plummeted. I hate the Godess! Hermione that we see in fanfictions, that is not just a very hard working girl but the most talented witches since Morgana herself, the most loyal friend ever, not to mention a bombshell that has all the boys (and some girls) fall for.\\
I dislike Harmony because I got sick of all these fics that make them the "perfect" couple, that are sooooo smart and powerfull, and that never have any fight. I also hate how a lot of Harmony shipper feel forced to remove Ron (one of my favourite characters) from the equation by bashing him to death.

I'm sure there are some excellent Harmony fics (I loved "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" and its Sequel, "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis"), but I'm at a point where all the "Harry Potter discover he loved Hermione and together they fix everything wrong with the Magical World while Ron tries to steal his inheritance" fics made me hate the ship to a point where Harmony became a deal breaker for me.

***** Well they are called, 'Fan fictions' for a reason now aren't they?

Besides the point here is everyone judging h/hr shippers, just because a bunch of bashes doesn't implies that all of us do. That's a bit ironic, what you claim to be 'reducing the role in fic' many other ships fics are never behind in bashing Ron, Hermione or Harry. But we don't judge all the authors.

Look into it a bit practically, If you dislike a person for some reasons but other people don't share the same idea as you about the person, They can't force you to love them and have no right to criticize you.

Harmony ship is famous for bashing people but if the same people bother to visit harmony reddit page, our banner is not , 'Welcome to weasely/dumbledore hate club' .

We don't demand you to love the ship but to at least not leave toxic hate comments to h/hr fanfics the authors worked hard on their fics as much as all of you did on yours.

I myself got a comment on my written fic-

"ROMIONE RULES! HARRMIONE SUCKS!

THIS IS WHY GIRLS SHOULDN'T WRITE FANFICTIONS"

as much as toxic and sexist the comment was we don't go 'round screaming, '/Injustice/'. /If you have got issues then deal with it/.

Ron is portrayed to be dumb and stupid. The guy got 7 owls, same grades as Harry. From where does the writer pull out the dumb and stupid card.

** Harmony shippers tend to be let's say... fervent about their love for the pairing. This can often results in fics that idolize both characters to a degree that makes them and their relationship seem flawless and unrealistic. And worse, it can result in lazy writing/Ron bashing. Anyway, this extreme devotion to the ship can cause an equally strong counter-reaction against it. As for me, I personally have never included the pairing in a fic, but I have absolutely no ill feelings for it. I just prefer Harry and Hermione as serving the perfect example of how two people can love each other so deeply without there being any romance involved.

  "You're joking," she protested.

  "Ours is a love story years in the making if Demelza is to be believed," he answered casually.

  "Well she's not wrong," Hermione mused.

  We've even got a name."

  "A name?" Hermione asked.

  "Yes, a couple's name. They're calling us /Harmony/."

  "What?!"

  "It's a play on words, you see. They combined our names and we are apparently perfect for one another. So...you know...we're harmonious. Pretty clever if you ask me."

Yeah, this is one of the so-called "non-bashing" Harmony fics and I just about rolled my eyes out of my skull. Throughout the fic Hermione kept throwing /massive/ shade at Ron and Lavender, took 3+ months to apologize to Ron after the bird attack after he was poisoned, in the hospital wing, and he already knew about her and Harry together, had the nerve to be upset he wasn't happy for them ("He was trying to be as cruel as possible to make her angry.

Ron acting out because he's attracted to Hermione but feels frustrated is also canon, and Hermione feeling spiteful toward him as a result is canon - but the fic doesn't just discard him. He's still a true friend, he works through his issues and sticks by Harry and Hermione.

And usually it's the person who's more in love with the other who it changes for (Tonks' changed for Lupin, Snape matches Lily's). If it had to change, then /Hermione's/ should have changed to match /Harry's/. The problem with Harry's changing is that it gives off the same vibe a lot of other Harmony fics do: OP!Harry and OP!Hermione together forever, and Harry dominates everyone but he's Hermione's bitch all the time (casual female-on-male "light" punches and slaps when he does something stupid/without consulting Hermione, but the opposite either never happens, is glossed over or makes Hermione out to be the victim, usually with a lot of tears so that Harry will forgive her.) Equality at it's finest.

Yet Hermione barely works through /her/ issues. By chapter sixteen Hermione's mindset is "I'm better than everyone but they have their uses sometimes." With is canon, true, but it's even more blatant than JK's because of the Hermione-centric POV.

I sort of wish the fic did discard Ron. He's acting more mature than Hermione objectively, but Hermione's "better than thou" POV taints it like shit in a perfect sandwich. After the hospital scene and Hermione's "woe is me, the boy who has a crush on me that's been poisoned isn't thrilled that I'm dating his best friend! How could he be so cruel??!1?!" rambling the author should have just let Ron do his own thing and worked on making the Harmony ship less sibling-like. The half-hearted attempt at not bashing Ron was really underwhelming. Like I commented earlier, it's a /Mary Sue Lite/ ^{TM} fic for people who want a canon-esque, Hermione-centric fic that /technically/ doesn't bash anyone. There's no stakes, no tension despite what the writer or readers might say (you know the outcome; they end up together, and the catalyst is right in the description). Is it terrible? No. Is it good? If you like HHr and want something that makes Hermione seem better than Ron without /technically/ bashing him, this is for you. If not...🤷🏼‍♀️

#+begin_quote
  (And when did canon Hermione ever apologise for the birds at all? Never that we hear about.)
#+end_quote

She was throwing Ron a bone to assuage her guilt ("I've got Harry on a leash and Ron almost died, so I guess it's okay to tell him that he was never my first choice and Harry and I have been making out behind his back, even though he probably knows by now! Oh and I should probably apologize for attacking him with birds after that fit of fake jealous rage..."). It might not have been a "victory lap", but it was definitely an afterthought on her part ("Maybe if I apologize about the birds maybe he won't get too angry about Harry and I.") Like Harry said, she should have apologized (sooner).

You do realize that bit was a purposely ridiculous passage I put at the end of a chapter (after chapter's end) as a joke? It isn't part of the story and I'm gobsmacked anybody could be offended by it when it was essentially making fun of shipping in general, including Harmony.

Feel free to criticize the story...that's fine. But inferring the "Hinny" passage you quoted was an actual part of the story is disingenuous.

You can't just pick a point in canon and say, "okay, now Harry wants to date Hermione"; you have to show a build-up from starting to find her attractive, maybe thinking he's going to stand aside for Ron before changing his mind because Ron doesn't deserve her, insecurities and false starts for hinting that he likes her, and THEN progress to (awkwardly because they're young) asking her out.

** I love the pairing but hate the fanfiction that includes it. Does it make sense? Probably not.

I feel like Harry and Hermione fit together. I think that any relationship they would have would be much more mature and meaningful than whatever they have with Ginny and Ron respectively. But I get why people dislike the pairing since most of the authors change the characters into something they are not, writes them in a really immature way, starts their relationship when they're 13, and often feels it's necessary to bash Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore/Molly. Fics tagged Harry/Hermione are, more often than not, really predictable, as if there were only a few ways to make this pairing happen.

** There are many problems that beset the Harry/Hermione pairing.

*Fics skip the good part*

The vast majority of Harry/Hermione fanfics have them get together extremely quickly after the fic begins. The way they do this is by starting the fic in an AU where Harry and Hermione's canonical relationship is replaced with a dynamic where they /each already have feelings for each other, they just haven't expressed them yet/.

All it takes, therefore, for them to get together is for them to communicate these pre-existing feelings. And once they're together, they are immediately head-over-heels for each other, because they've each been harbouring these intense, hidden feelings of deep love and devotion for so long.

Basically, the authors completely skip the actually interesting part of Harry/Hermione fics: how to build them up from their canonical dynamic to a romantic dynamic.

That is the part I am most interested in, as a reader. As someone who once crushed pretty hard on a very close female friend, I am a sucker for "best friends to lovers" storylines done well. But "oh, we both actually are really into each other, let's completely displace our previous dynamic with an entirely different one overnight" is not that storyline. It's a dismal state of affairs that Harry/Hermione smut fics can actually do this a lot better than serious romance fics - perhaps because suddenly seeing a friend in a sexual light is a fairly realistic way to shift perception out of an established dynamic.

Ultimately, I think this problem is driven by the way that so many people view the pairing as so much more than just a pairing ("shippers", "Harmonians", etc.). These people are obsessed with the idea that Harry/Hermione should have been canon; as such, they use fanfic as a way to right this wrong by attributing to the characters, from the very start of the fic, the feelings which they consider Harry and Hermione should have felt in canon.

No good ever comes from writing fanfic as an argument to justify something, however. You just end up with a bad fic and a bad argument.

*Super!Hermione*

Another major problem with the genre is the way authors go overboard with Hermione's character. It's not enough for them for Hermione to be a very intelligent, hard working, well-read girl with an excellent memory. They have to make her as gifted as Voldemort; as knowledgeable as Dumbledore; as powerful as Harry - and often with a side serving of an additional prophecy to redistribute some of Harry's role as the hero to her.

The end result is a Mary Sue who feels like she is subverting Harry's place as the rightful hero of the story.

In general, authors are so confused about what it means to write a strong female character. It doesn't mean they have to be uber powerful. It doesn't mean they have to have some great fate or influence important events. /It means they have to have an identifiable personality, a distinct voice, and individual agency/.

There are so many fics where Hermione is the second coming of Merlin, but ultimately she and Harry operate as basically a single entity. This is not a strong female character. She's powerful, but she still has no agency.

A Hermione who retains her canonical magical ability (that is, maybe around the same level as Remus Lupin) but who has her own interests, goals, opinions etc. and who disagrees with Harry about things where their opinions differ, and they have to learn, as a couple, /how to disagree and remain together/, is an infinitely stronger character than Hermione the goddess of magic who is perfectly in tune with Harry.

*Bashing*

Not much needs to be said here, really. So many Harry/Hermione stories engage in all the tiresome tropes we're all well aware of.

*Mugglewank*

Among the tiresome tropes, king among them has to be Mugglewank, which is particularly egregious in Harry/Hermione fics. Just no.

*Fluff*

This kinda ties into point #1, but far too many Harry/Hermione fics are just sickly sweet to the point of repulsiveness. This is a universal problem across all romance except perhaps the "enemies to lovers" genre (though even in that, it often devolves to fluff eventually). It's a particularly bad problem in Harry/Hermione fics though, because neither Harry nor Hermione strike me as the type to engage in this type of sickly sweet behaviour. They're both pretty down-to-earth, reserved people.

Basically: no emotions please, I'm English.

So yeah. If anyone can think of a Harry/Hermione fic which meets the above criteria I would welcome your recommendations. I'm not going to hold my breath, however.

**** I don't really understand the question. It seems to be framed as if you're looking for a single "correct" answer, which suggests you're asking what canon is, to which the obvious answer is Ginny.

But if you're asking about fan fiction, then obviously there is no "correct" romantic partner for Harry. It's down to the talent of an individual author to sell a relationship (or better, series of relationships, because someone rarely ends up with their first girlfriend).

In terms of my reading preferences, I'm open to reading Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Susan, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Romilda, Harry/Parvati, Harry/Pansy, etc... but always subject to the fact that the fic has to be well-written, including the relationship.

I can't see Harry putting up with that especially since she seems like she'd want to argue about even the smallest thing.

What would they even talk about on dates they don't really have much in common.

Ron and Hermione don't seem like they'd work long term. They seem like they'd be hyped up and passionate just after the war but when things settle down they would quickly find it just didn't work. You can't have a relationship on just arguing after all and the only other thing they have in common is being friends with Harry.

But I can at least see Ron and Hermione getting together for a bit. I don't see Harry and Hermione together at all.

** I don't hate the ship, but I personally dislike it because I don't like Hermione that much as a character. I just find her a little boring. I don't mind her being there as a friend, but if it's a ship fic then it tends to revolve around the two shipped characters which is often a little too much Hermione for my taste.

The main reason I think a lot of people don't ship them is because it lacks obvious drama. I'm not sure if this makes a lot of sense, but it seems like most popular ships (and most romances in general media) focus a lot on the opposites attract idea. It adds tension and drama. I'm pretty sure that's why Dramione and Drarry are so popular. With Ron and Hermione there's lots of arguing while Harry and Hermione don't really argue much. When Harry disagrees with her he more or less puts off the topic or ignores the issue to avoid confrontation with her. In the canon dynamics he's very much the mediator stuck in the awkward middle between Ron and Hermione. That dynamic makes it difficult to picture a relationship between Harry and Hermione (for me at least). I've heard a lot of fic's deal with this by removing Ron from the dynamic via Ron bashing which a lot of people dislike.

The twins are almost always exempt from the bash fast, Harry has a big magical core/bank account/trunk, Hermione's a magical genius who can do no wrong, Harry meets her parents, Dan and Emma...I mean, read ten different Harmony/Harmione fics, and you've read 85% of what the fandom has to offer.

*** That's kind of interesting as I have never seen Ron and Hermione as compatible. So as I read the first 4 books I was looking forward to seeing a Harry/Hermione romance. Imagine my surprise when the later books took a hard left turn and had a Ron/Hermione romance.

So in my opinion I don't believe that Ron and Hermione would last let alone date as they were just so different. And I don't believe that Harry or Hermione would need to change at all in order for their pairing to work. I also don't believe that Ron and Dumbledore need to be bashed to make Harry/Hermione work. Though I agree with you that many fics bash the characters that they believe could interfere with their preferred pairing.

I will say that no matter what your shipping preferences are whether you support the canon pairings or totally prefer other pairings that often those that disagree can spew quite a lot of vitriol. Sure I prefer Harmony but my main focus is on finding decent fics to read. As long as the author does a decent job of building the characters such that any ship makes sense then I'm happy.

** I don't hate the ship, although I generally prefer Hinny, I could admit that [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][Ginny is extremely poorly written by JKR]], and fanfiction has to add a lot of her personality to make her livable (which fortunately Northumbrian and other great Hinny writers did). I can even agree that when we limit ourselves just to what's in the books, Harmony is even more likely. I also fully support the notion that foundation of every long-lasting romantic relationship must be deep friendship (yes, my wife is also my best friend, and I am very glad for it). It is one of the greatest things I have against JKR that her romance is just about physical relationship. What all pairs in HP universe do? They snog, or perhaps when appropriate they ended up in the bed, not much else. The only romantic scene in whole heptalogy is the disastrous date between Harry and Cho at the Madam Pudifoot's, and that is not exactly the best example of romance. There is even less collaboration between lovers on something else: ignoring Trace (which is just a hapless plot-crutch created in the last second) I don't see any reason why Hermione and Ron could be with Harry on the Horcrux action, and Ginny couldn't. Perhaps she couldn't physically go with them (she was underage, so she couldn't leave Hogwarts without consent of her parents), but she would be certainly in know and she could organize some action at Hogwarts in coordination with the Trio. All those lovely communication coins stopped work? Kreacher couldn't transport messages? Etc. No, the true problem is that in the JKR mind romance is just about snogging (and that's getting too close to discuss her personal life, so I stop it right here).

Having said that, my biggest problem with most Harmony stories is that they are just poorly written. Ron/Weasley/Dumbledore bashing is not just a cute feature of those stories, but a sign of insufficient plot and missing story. Strenuous effort to persuade us how Harry and Hermione fit together is just boring, because the only thing we ever learn about the development of their relationship is that there is none. They just so well work together, and they so love each other, and there is no conflict between them, and did I tell you how well they click together? Their chemistry is just awesome ... [reader snores]. The only relational conflict in linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof) (which is IMHO one of the best Harmony stories, don't let me be misunderstood), where Harry almost breaks their engagement, is when almost(?) naked Cho literally jumps him, and Harry doesn't run away from her kiss fast enough. Really, that's it. And there is (comparing to most other Harmony stories) at least that conflict.

Let us compare it with some random Hinny stories. In linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), Junior Auror Harry Potter arrests his beloved completely drunk Ginny when she shouts at him how she hates him while firing curses at him (it turns later she was under the influence of some potion given to her by Death Eaters). Harry is after couple of weeks he spent on the Auror mission in complete isolation when he was struggling with doubts whether their relationship will really grow as he would like, confronted with this. In linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50), Ginny struggles with PTSD to the level she makes him leave England (and subsequently attempts suicide, when she recognizes what she did). Harry then spends two years on the overseas mission (while the tabloid press lies about his sexual achievements with strange beauties of the Eastern Europe). When Harry finally returns to England, Ginny continues to struggle with her fear and flashbacks whenever she considers how dangerous profession Harry has. In [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire by Sovran]] (it is a soul-bond story) eleven years old Harry and ten years Ginny get around their soul-bond conflicts with her parents (no, the story is not paedophile, I don't think get to the true sex at all ... the story has been abandoned after CoS) to the level they completely explode faces of both Molly Weasley and the Headmaster Dumbledore.

Would you agree with me that these examples look more realistic and more interesting than your average Harmony story? Did I forget to tell you how perfectly Hermione and Harry fit together?

** Harmony/Harmione was, and still is, my favorite pairing in HP. If I had written the books, it would have been canon.

Having said that, I prefer Dramione fanfics to Harmione ones, for a very simple reason. When you compare the good Dramione fics to the good Harmione fics---and by good I am being very liberal here, good grammar and some characterization will do---the good Dramione fanfics don't go out of their way to bash Ron, and Harry, and any other potential rival, and don't engage in any Dumbledore bashing. Instead, they focus on the pairing and, in the really good ones, there is some character development that doesn't completely destroy the original characters.

Harmione fanfics on the other hand, generally, are guilty of all of the above and they, usually, turn Hermione into a supreme witch goddess who does no wrong.

In other words, we need better Harmione fanfics.

****** And what interests do Ron and Hermione have in common, again?

When they write letters to each other, they talk about Harry:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Harry,

  Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you're all right.
#+end_quote

When they meet each other at Diagon before Year 3, they're searching for Harry:

#+begin_quote
  They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor --- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.

  “Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and ---”
#+end_quote

The only time we see them talking with each other without Harry, as he is in under his Invisibility Cloak and they don't know he's there, they're talking about what to get Harry:

#+begin_quote
  Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.

  “Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I expect,” Hermione was saying.

  “How about these?” said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione's nose.
#+end_quote

Even when Harry isn't near them to hear it, we know that they still talk about him:

#+begin_quote
  She sat down on the edge of his bed again.

  “We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn't want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh, Harry . . .”
#+end_quote

When they fight, Harry is the one trying to mediate between them:

#+begin_quote
  “I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway...” She glanced over at Ron too. “He doesn't want me to join in.”

  There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them ---”

  Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.

  “Can't you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly.
#+end_quote

Harry is literally the only thing Ron and Hermione have in common.

****** One phase of their youth when they're literally 14? lol I don't think that's really enough evidence to suggest anything to the effect of not knowing what to say to each other. Hermione was studious and in the library all the time which obviously isn't fun for him. That doesn't mean they have nothing to connect/talk to each other about.

****** u/KonoCrowleyDa:
#+begin_quote
  “Miss him?” said Harry. “I don't miss him...”

  But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend.
#+end_quote

Harry doesn't think that he doesn't like hanging with Hermione, he doesn't think that she's boring. There's even "Harry liked Hermione very much" in the quote. What Harry *does think* is that he misses Ron and that Ron is more fun than Hermione. There's a difference. People should stop misinterpreting this quote.

Harry and Hermione CAN have fun with each other, as evidenced by this passage in Half-Blood Prince:

#+begin_quote
  “It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something going on between them. . . .”

  “Oh, ha ha . . .”

  Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.
