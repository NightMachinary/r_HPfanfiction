Draco buys a blank book and starts filling it with "wizarding customs" and rules on interacting with other species like the goblins. Draco shares his plan with the other Slytherins and they help him fill the book. Of course all the rules are meant to make Harry look stupid and rediculous. Draco apologizes to Harry and gives him the book. Harry starts following the rules in the book religiously because he doesn't want to look stupid. The Slytherins get a good laugh until they realize that most of the student body not in on the joke are copying Harry because he's the boy-who-lived. Imagine Harry saying something like "May your gold flow and your enemies die" to a goblin. All the other wizards just look at him strange but the goblin rolls with it as a joke. Next thing you know all the wizards are doing it and the goblins think it's hilarious. I can just see the horror on Draco's face when he accompanies his father to the bank over summer break and he hears his father say it.

** It was supposed to be a joke.

"Good morning to you, Lord Potter."

A stupid joke.

"What? A Concubine? What the fuck is a concubine?"

A stupid fucking joke meant to end the day it had started.

"Can Harry Potter control the school?" "Of course he can, he is the Heir of the Founders."

But destiny had a way to bite me in my delicious arse.

"Heir Malfoy, how goes the proceedings in Wizengamot?"

"I'm thirteen, okay?" I shout, naively, "Thirteen! For Merlin's sake. I'm not even old enough to have Butterbeer!"

Daphne laughs. "Oh don't play me like that, as if we don't know how you are seen going in and out of the Ministry with your father, my, you may as well be a lord yourself!"

And I just smirk, and incline my head, because everyone else is doing so, and it would be stupid to not do what everyone else was doing, even though I am fuming inside.

A strongly worded letter to father is certainly in order.

"Harry Potter found to be Heir of Merlin himself!" reads the Daily Prophet, "In a ritual that has been hidden from us ever since its conception, the Goblins have declared the esteemed Lord Hufflepuff-Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw, to also be an heir of Merlin!

"When asked, the young Lord had this to say, 'I spilt my blood and a golden quill wrote Merlin's name! How could it not be true?'"

It was at this point that I stop reading the Frog's eyelids they pass as newspapers these days, and contemplate the idiocy of this world.

Even a second year knows enough animation charms to make a quill write on its own. How could anyone be so--- oh yes, of course. I see it now. Poor potter. Such a terrible joke on my part, I must apologize to him deeply.

How could I forget that he has a mudblood companion.

Stupid breeds stupid, my mother used to say when she knew my father was away.

I get it now.

It was meant to happen.

So when I go into Gringotts with my father, and I hear him say "May gold flow into your vaults and blood drain from your enemies" in his slow, teaching voice, I just nod my head.

It was my mistake, and I must bear its burden.

Merlin is this world stupid, though.

"Is this how Professor Dumbledore, felt?"

-

"Griphook, that was an animation charm!"

"Was it, Mr. Potter?"

The two of them exchanged a glance and a smile.

"Yeah, I think I do look a bit like Merlin, do you think you could find if I am related to anyone else from Camelot?"

Griphook looked at him and smiled.

"I remember the Lady Morgana is said to have had green eyes and black hair." he twirled the Quill. "Maybe with some...adjustments we will be able to clarify that.

Harry would be sure to do a special Wizard Greeting when next he saw Draco, maybe three "Well met." would be in order.
