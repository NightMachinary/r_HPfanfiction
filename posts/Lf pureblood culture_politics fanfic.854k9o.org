Any fanfics where Harry supports pureblood culture/politics? Or any at all that involve pureblood customs, politics etc??


** my favorite for this kind of thing is linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) lots of good ideas in there, even though the execution is lacking at times.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc is a very long fic that features pureblood customs. Unfortunately, they tend to be overly specific and to crop up mainly when the plot requires it. Also unfortunately, the fic is really quite long; the lengths of the books grow exponentially, so books 6 and 7 are more than half the series.

** If you don't mind an AU, my story "Patron" heavily features pureblood customs, culture and politics. Although due to their special situation, Harry and Hermione learn pureblood culture from books instead of their parents/patron, and the books available were rather old, so they end up acting little more old-fashioned/conservative than their peers at Hogwarts. That's in a world where the purebloods aren't "Victorian, with some magic", though, but more progressive in parts and more archaic in others - they consider the muggles prudes, for example.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I've got some good ones for this, though a lot of them are more Hermione-centric than you might want.

A Marauder's Plan has a pretty significant amount of story devoted to the political interworkings betweent the old families, as the premise rests on Sirius making extensive use of the Black name. Harry himself is also involved and proactive about these machinations. This story is very, very long, which is nice if you want a long read but it does drag here and there.

I'm having problems getting ffnet up right now, but I'll add the rest later.

** In my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight), Harry isn't exactly politicking yet since he's about 12, but he will eventually, and there's lots of politics, etc. going on in the background since it has multiple points of view.

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...
