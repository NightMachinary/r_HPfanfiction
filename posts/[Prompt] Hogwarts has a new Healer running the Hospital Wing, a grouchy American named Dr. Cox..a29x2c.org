*Requirements*

- As usual, I'm not fussy about length. As long as is necessary
- Dr. Cox coming up with various nicknames for the other Hogwarts professors

*Bonus*

- JD trying to come to Hogwarts


** lol its nice to see that there is a fellow scrubs and HP fan. Although I have to say that I'm not sure Cox would be able to last running the hospital wing at Hogwarts, lol the magical teenagers might cause him to have an aneurism....he might kill one of em...

*** Aw, c'mon Newbie, you don't think that years of babysitting JD and Turk gave him an immunity to stupid, annoying, stunts?

And imagine if similar scenes play out--suppose Cox encounters Professor Snape berating a student (for example, Luna) to the point of tears and he stalks over and breaks Snape's nose?

Or what if JD and Turk met Fred and George?

And imagine if Cox met Filch and realized that he actually misses Janitor?

*** JD is the protagonist of the "dramedy" /Scrubs,/ which focused on the lives of the medical staff of Sacred Heart Hospital.

JD was one of the interns, with a */very/* active imagination and Cox was his not-particularly-willing mentor.

Within the realm of the Potter-verse...I guess it'd be a little like if Auror Mad-Eye Moody was required to keep an eye on Auror Trainee Colin Creevey.
