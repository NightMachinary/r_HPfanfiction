:END:
I need help finding a fic I read ages ago. As far as I remember: • Harry is the son of lord Voldemort and Lucius Malfoys sister • Harry was kidnapped by the potters/Dumbledore/the order • the killing curse didn't work due to Harry and LV having the same blood (something to do with a spell on the Slytherin bloodline I think) • I'm pretty sure Neville was actually a Lestrange and was kidnapped by the longbottoms

If anyone could help that would be great
