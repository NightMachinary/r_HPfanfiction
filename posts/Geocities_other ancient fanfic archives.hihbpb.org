Hello, friends!

I just discovered [[https://geocities.restorativland.org]] - it's an archive of many of the websites that were hoste by Geocities. I was wondering if any of them were dedicated to Harry Potter fandom? Or if there are any other 15-20 year old archives that you know of. Fanatical Fics and Where to Find Them Podcast has got me hooked on those pre-OOTP fics - it's interesting to see what we used to think would happen before the series ended, and going back like that also helps avoid current cliches - there are plenty of old ones, of course, but they are really funny.

Thank you!

The [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/special-collections-gallery/][Special Collections Gallery]] has 70 archives, including a number of Harry Potter collections.

Fanlore also has a bunch of pages on [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Category:Harry_Potter_Archives][Harry Potter fanfic archives]], including both extant and extinct archives, the latter of which may have been preserved through Open Doors or at least on the Internet Archive.
