Sorry for the rather vague title, but I'm not after any particular character, pairing, setting, plot point or something, but a certain quality of writing.

I've just read linkffn(Ephemeral Time by Mystical Magician), even though I was sceptical of the pairing. I ended up really enjoying it, particularly the characterisations of Harry and Dumbledore and how both of them react to situations. So I'd like to read more of characters reacting realistically to the situations they're in.

- I don't care which characters there are
- I don't care about pairings
- I'd prefer the main character(s) to be (at least mentally) older than fifteen or so, this is a must if any kind of sexual relations are involved
- I'd prefer all characters to be either in character or to have a reason for why they're acting differently


** linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love) Snape and Luna friendship story that takes place during Hogwarts years, canon compliant.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) I love Harry's and Toms characterization in this fic.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkffn(Lesser Evils) by [[/u/ScottPress]] probably has the greatest characterization for two virtually throw away characters from canon (Mulciber and Podmore).

I greatly look forward to the sequel (which I mentally refer to as /Moderate Evils/).

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

*** Moderate Evils? Sounds like a great comedic title. Maybe I should abandon the grimdark. And here I already found a sequel title. Can't give a concrete premiere date, but the first pages have been written. Don't quote me on it, but I hope to post the first chapter by the end of April. And hopefully write at a livelier pace. I don't want the sequel to take 2,5 years.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  AU - Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor. T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.
