In honor of an old custodian at my old middle school being expected to pass away from cancer soon, are there any stories where Filch is just fun?

For reference, this custodian would have dance offs in the middle of the school and throw out bags of candy. I was what some would call a "problem child", so I would arrive to the school at 5 am to do physical exercise in a water downed form of boot camp. One of those things was running up and down the halls. This sixty year old man would run with us cackling the whole time.

Any stories where all the kids, especially the seventh years, absolutely loved Filch?


** Imagine Filch as a hidden badass. A troll is rampaging through the corridors, everyone's panicking, and he just grabs his best broomstick and goes...

"I'll take care of it. After all..."

** I wanted a story where Harry, Ron, Hermione and Fang capture Voldemort and say 'Let's see who you REALLY are!' and pull off his mask and it's Argus Filch!

"No one suspects the SQUIB!' He'd say, "My plan was to scare everyone off Hogwarts and get RICH selling it to condominium developers!

And it would have worked - except for you rotten kids!"

** While awesome might be pushing, there was one fic... I think Magical Relations. Harry went to Hogwarts without Hagrid and didn't realize he was rich. Harry got a part time job as Filch's assistant so he could pay Uncle Vernon back for school supplies. After Harry found out about the Potter vaults he cut his hours back, but remained friendly with Filch. Filch would claim Harry's detentions for easy punishments.

** Hey, was it ever established as canon that his cat is really his daughter that was involved in a ritual to sacrifice her anamagus form, that failed and took her human form instead? I read that in some fic somewhere, and it's in my headcanon, but idk if canon ever said anything about it one way or the other.
