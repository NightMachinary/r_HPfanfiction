It would be pretty funny if Harry started a star wars cult called the Jedi knights or something as a joke but the purebloods don't know what Star Wars is so there just like damn i believe that


** Truth be told, I want to write something like this at some point, but on a broader scope with an Otaku Harry Potter.

Basically, high octane Achievements in Ignorance rules of magic for Harry. Because no one told him he couldn't do something (even if it's normally impossible), he did it. Expertly even.

  Harry Potter gets interested in Star Wars and after a small piece of accidental magic starts to believe he is force sensitive and his magic powers develop accordingly. Deviates from canon quickly and without apology. Multi-year story. First year is posted. Second year, and Luna's first appearance, will follow when it's finished. Currently only Star Wars fiction influenced.
