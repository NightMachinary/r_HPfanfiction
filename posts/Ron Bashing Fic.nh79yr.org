Looking for a fic on AO3 that takes place in the 4th book where after Ron leaves Harry when Harry's name comes out Harry realizes that Ron was a bad friend. So after the 1st task when Ron tries to become Harry's friend again Harry denies him.

You'll have to be more specific, because you just described every Ron bashing fourth year fic.

*** I really don't care but I would prefer if there weren't any ships (but I'll be fine with Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna) and for it to either be completed or updated regularly.

** Why don't you take a look at the wiki to learn what meanings the various flairs have? Recommendations are to recommend some fic, not to ask for one. If you use the wrong flair, you can hardly expect the right people to look at your post.

**** No need to apologize. It's just that using a wrong flair is more likely to lead the wrong people to your post - in this case people looking for recommendations. When they then don't find what they were expecting, they are more likely to downvote your post than provide a useful response.

BTW, this isn't on AO3, but otherwise it fits your requirements: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood]])

** I'm just curious as to why people are downvoting this user's post and comments based on nothing but them wanting to read Ron!bashing. Why does that not count as trope shaming? Better yourselves.
