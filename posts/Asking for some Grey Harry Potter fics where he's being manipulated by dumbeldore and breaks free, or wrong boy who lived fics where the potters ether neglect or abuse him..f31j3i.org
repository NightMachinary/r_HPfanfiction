-Fics should be completed or are being updated.

-no senseless bashing.

- I'm not the biggest fan of harry/female character fics so I'm sorry if that makes things difficult. So ether a non romantic fanfic or a gay ship for harry

Thx for answering a fellow fanfic reader's request and hopefully you can help me out


** Just to clarify, you prefer M/m fics or you don't?

**** You might like linkao3(Common Sense by grohiik). It has a very likeable independent Harry who isn't a smug twatwaffle. And there's zero bashing.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
