Hello Redditors, i am once again in need of your help

I am searching for a fanfic i read (only the first two chapters) the other day, that I found interesting... Same problem as before i don't remember the title, thats were i need your help

So the story starts with Bellatrix and other Knights of Walpurgis trying to destroy a muggle pub... Harry (who somehow traveled back in time) kills them all in under half a minute (or so the story tells) He lets Bella survive to transfer a message to Tom, but she leaves the Knights of Walpurgis the same evening

I don't really have more but I hope that's enough


** Pretty sure that'd be this one. Don't know how to use the bots though, sorry. Wind Shear [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/68]]

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
