I don't care if he's "manipulative" (though if he, he better be competent and actually succeed) or not although I prefer him as Rowling intended, a good character. I would like to see fics where Dumbledore truly is one of the few wizards that gave Voldemort pause, defeated a dark lord that briefly took over Europe, and is as good as it gets magically. I'm looking for some obscurer ones, I've read a lot of the commonly suggested ones. I've read Starfox's, world trip, arcane, mysteries of magic, the last straw, and phoenix insurgent. All suggestions are wonderful and thanks in advance!


** Magiks of the arcane Warlocks apprentice Wind shear he isn't a prominent character but we do see him as portrayed as powerful
