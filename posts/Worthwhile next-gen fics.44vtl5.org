I'd very much like it to be Teddy centric, but even if it's not, it's still good. Thanks in advance!


** There was a thread about this a few days back:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43m3gw/looking_for_nextgen_fics/]]

I would also recommend linkffn(A little More Time by Jess Pallas). Premise is that Teddy goes back to the final battle to save his parents by pulling them to his own time. He succeeds, but the ministry find out, and they want Lupin and Tonks dead because you aren't supposed to change the past. Lots of legal drama.

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** Have you tried Hogwarts Houses Divided, a very popular teddy centric fic!

Linkffn(3979062)

Another next gen that I like, is We Belong, its an oc next gen with George raising Fred's son. It's a really interesting take on the wizarding world post Voldemort!

  It's been ten years since Harry Potter defeated Voldemort. But for a ten year old orphan, and a surviving Weasley twin, the story is just beginning.

  Teddy Lupin is about to start his first year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Little does he know that the next seven years are going to be a roller-coaster of emotions, experiences and events that will challenge everything he has ever known and believed in. [Winner of three 2014 Hallows Awards]

is Teddy centric and pretty good. The first year is complete and the author is working on the second year.

The Asp at Hogwarts by Inkwolf. Albus Potter is haunted by Severus Snape at Hogwarts. Extremely funny fic and the best nextgen I've read.

  Gabrielle Delacour was never able to fully satisfy her greatest dream, but Harry's metamorphmagus godson was the next best thing. After all, Lupin men were said to have a thing for ladies far from their own age. Teddy/Gabby One-Shot. Mature content.

** From what I hear, linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) is the best-quality Teddy-centric fic out there. If Inverarity's other work (i.e. /Alexandra Quick/) is anything to go by, it's gotta be amazing.
