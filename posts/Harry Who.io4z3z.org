Does anyone know of a fic, where Harry is a bit like The Doctor? A man who tries his best to do good and save everyone he can, yet is still haunted by his past mistakes and failures.


** The lone traveller series AU Harry won the war but lost everything/one tries to travel back, I think, but ends up travelling the multiverse solving problems sometimes before they become a problem. Starts in alternates of the HPverse but branches out later

*** It's a very interesting premise, but I found it didn't deliver. The writing was dry as a desert and characterization was iffy -- Harry didn't even read as Harry, but as some sort of lawful!good mini Dumbledore (and not in a good way).

** That is usually Dumbledore, I believe. I don't recall a Harry with that characterisation, but it would have to be time travel or crossover stories.

*** Yeah I know what you mean. Its a shame cause there is so much room for imagination in it. It could be a time-travel or crossover as you said, or an older grown up Harry that's having to step into Dumblerdores shoes, or even some MOD/immortal Harry that has lived for thousands of years.
