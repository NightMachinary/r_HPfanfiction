you know the riddles, I found a loophole, and i was thinking, Luna probably found it too, considering she's Luna.

it asks you a riddle, you give it a logical answer, but what of you gave it a nonsensical answer? one that wouldn't make sense without magic.

as the famous sphinx asks "What creature walks with four legs it the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?

a sane person would reply "a man, as he walks through the stages of life"

and Luna? would she make up an answer to fulfill the riddle, would the door open?

would she reply with "a rather fashionable Inferi that attaches and detaches limbs at will."


** I've read a story, the name of which I can't recall, where the point wasn't to get the 'correct' answer to the riddle.

Instead the point was to discuss possible solutions, think about the question, challenge your initial assumptions, etc. It would open once the door knocker was satisfied with your thinking.

I really liked the idea that to get in to the dorm you had to prove you were a real Ravenclaw. I think it would have been cool if they were all like that; e.g. to get in to Gryffindor tower required a demonstration of bravery. Maybe sometimes it would be a dark corridor where no light can penetrate, or a wall of flame you have to run through, etc.

*** what's the other houses then? Hufflepuff a test of loyalty and friendship ? someone is gossiping what do you do? ( half couldn't get in unless sneaking in with a truly loyal Hufflepuff during Harry's year 4. and what's more loyal then helping a housemate in need). Slytherin a test if pride or ambition? answer the question where do you see yourself in 5 years? (lol sorry I'm not that creative)

**** You can see my other reply for the Hufflepuff answer. I'd probably avoid questions since that's Ravenclaw's thing.

For Slytherin I think I'd go with another guardian, a snake obviously, that you have to /persuade/ to let you in. You can use subtlety to trick it, you can convince it of how your ambitions will bring glory to the house, etc. Or you can use bribes or threats or whatever else you want.

Over your time in the house you'll need to adapt to the guardian as it becomes immune to your threats, questions the realism of your ambitions, demands more exorbitant bribes, etc.

***** I read an older post a while ago which talked about the portraits in the dungeons having complex clans and social hierarchy this just reminded me of it. What if to get into their dorms the slytherins had to navigate the politics of the dungeon portraits, and convince the portraits hiding the door that week of letting them in. They would have to gain the support of the portraits whilst also not making any enemies, which would be a great skill for ambitious young students.

****** I like this idea- but you don't have to convince them every single time, just maintain relationships with all of them over the course of your time at Hogwarts and navigate the politics all time. Essentially, if you've done a good job then the portrait will just let you in immediately but if you've done a bad job you'll have to spend time persuading them to let you in instead

**** My thoughts for Hufflepuff would be an incredibly difficult challenge that becomes trivial if you have multiple people working together.

Things like spinning multiple plates or levitating a bunch of different objects at the same time. Hard work can always get it done but working together is easier and more fun :)

*** I think having a boggart at the entrance of the gryffindor dorm room would be perfect and to get in u have to overcome ur fear and ridiculous the boggart. And the more u face it the less u fear ur fear so u not only overcome ur deepest fear the boggart will also change shape once u develop a new fear. It's a great tool to strengthen your mind.

*** I think it would have some sentience to it, Ravenclaw would probably like to challenge her students, but if it repeated riddles, at least some ravenclaw students would have written the answers down and once it went through all of its riddles, it wouldn't be a challenge but a mere inconvenience. Given how language changed throughout the centries and how the the knocker would speak modern English, I'd say it would be sentient, unless Ravenclaws have a tradition of adding new riddles to the knocker's repertoire when they graduate.

** There is a lovely Czech fanfiction linkao3(17248490), which is 365 one-shots published during one year, and it has three chapters on the Ravenclaw knocker:

1. chapter 8 ... small pictures of four students who drunk as lords. The Ravenclaw student is in a deep trouble. How in the world he should answer the question, when he is not even certain he heard what it was?

2. chapter 158 ... about a female Ravenclaw student who fought the knocker since her first year. She just wants to be special (one reason for being Ravenclaw) and so she never answers as it is expected, but she is always correct:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄûLeze, leze po ≈æeleze, ned√° pokoj, a≈æ tam vleze,‚Äú (Crawling, crawling on iron, it is not satisfied until it is there) (while translating I have discovered how incredibly dirty innuendo it could be ;)), which is a simple kids riddle, with the answer being ‚Äúa key‚Äù. Of course she answered ‚Äúdrunk tank crew member‚Äù.

  ‚ÄúWhere would you go to find a bezoar?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo the Snape's office, of course.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put Humpty together again. What is Humpty Dumpty?‚Äù ‚ÄúOld nursery rhyme. And by the way, nothing in the poem suggests it is an egg. Even human can get killed by falling from height.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIn the morning I walk on four legs, in the noon on two legs, and in the evening I use three ones. What I am?‚Äù ‚ÄúA riddle. Or some pok√©mon, I don't remember all of them.‚Äù
#+end_quote

After that the knocker just gave up and he never asked her again, and it just opened whenever it saw her.

1. chapter 292 ... just a sweet introduction to the Firsties Ravenclaws by their Prefect.

** There's a fanfiction out there where Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw, but it turns out he's absolutely horrible at riddles. When asked the question above, he answers something about a fast-healing mutant giant. The door knocker actually starts to feel badly for him.

+Can't think of the title off the top of my head, but maybe somebody else will remember it.+

Found it! [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057502][The Quiet Ones]] series by LonelyHarvest:

/‚ÄòWhat goes on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon and three legs in the evening?'/\\
/‚Äò... an accident prone, mutant troll with really fast regeneration?'/\\
/‚Äò... What.'/

Don't let that little snippet fool you; this is not crackfic. It's actually quite angsty.
