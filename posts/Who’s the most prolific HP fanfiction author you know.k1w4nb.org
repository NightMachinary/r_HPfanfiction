*** I feel like Lomonaaren bests out Megamatt in quantity of writing, with almost 600 fics, most of them above 10k in length.

**** You underestimate Megamatt's power. Dude has around 100 fics, most of them over 100k, and multiple fics over 1 million words.

A quick scroll through his FF.Net profile puts his wordcount as over 17 million words, and on top of that he has a fair amount of material hosted elsewhere.

It's a pretty impressive achievement to write and re-write a single sex scene repeatedly to the point that you have 17 million words of it.

*** Doesn't he constantly abandon and delete stories though? That makes it really hard to get a good idea of how much he's actually written.

** Robst perhaps? Almost all his fics are mostly cliche driven yet earn a lot of favourites and follows.

Sinyk can also be in this category, tropey stories thst get popular easily.

**** Ahh shit. Mistook the question.

Alright, the most prolific writer is probably, Lomonaaren imo. He has almost 600 stories, most of them complete. Though only a small, very small amount of them is Gen, the others are all slash
