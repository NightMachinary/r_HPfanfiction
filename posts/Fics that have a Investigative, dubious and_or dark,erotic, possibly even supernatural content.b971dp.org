i took these ideas from the Videogames Still Life (point & Click adventure) and Lust for Darkness. The Latter one i dont know about, but the Description text sounds promising. Now i would like if something as that does exist in the HP universe:

1: Harry gets to investigate at a dubious place/Organization, like a Brothel, because a Murder happened there. This place would be like the Gathering of the Noble Society that that can "release" their fantasies, but all with the one rule of following Hedonism, so nobody is getting hurt and all is happening for the sake of Pleasure. The Members would either Wear Clothings and Masks to hide their Identity (like in said games) or a Spell is hiding this Information (i know for example that "Harry Potter and the Pleasure Palace" has this method).

​

More details: im open, if there are Creatures, that traveling through Portals into this Building, but that could be classified as "super fucked up". But i simply do follow the path of the Desciption as in Lust for Darkness, the whole purpose of the Brothel seems to be to feel pleasure and no brutal stuff and rapes. If Harry gets to investigate undercover, he might get "sucked" into this Pool of ecstasy.

​

2: A Murder happened, but in this Case just a Woman is the suspect. There might be more around here that there seems to be. Said Woman can be included in the Point above.

​

More details: that Woman wouldnt be a Human being, but has just taken a Human Shape to avoid catching someones eye. From time to time she needs to have Sex with a Partner, to "Feed" on his sexual Energy. Similar like a Succubus, but without the "draining the life force" thing. Harry might suspect her as the Criminal and she might get imprisoned, but through this she would be cut of her "Nourishment". The Murder would happened because of an accident. However, Harry might fall for her as time goes by, whether because of her physical attraction or because her Body spreads and empowers an Aura that increases the state of arousing in the Beings around her.

In some other way, this Woman doesnt have to be involved in a Murder/crime case at all, but still get Harrys attention because of her attraction and Sex appeal. It doesnt matter if he has an affair with her (whether considering him being Married or her being the suspect in a Crime) or not (he is single or divorced).

​

I honestly doubt that something as this exists: meaning, an investigative Fic that leads to an exclusive Club that features "Pleasures" for its members and Harry, although being rejecting, possibly constantly fall for the atmosphere or the "magical" in the Air. But i give it a try with this Request. It doesnt have to be Harry that is the character though
