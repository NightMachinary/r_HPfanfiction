*Spoilers ahead* So, I'm just into the second book and in their plan to polyjuice into a form that would have them looking much more like each other permanently so they could introduce their friends to their families, why would they not assume that their families would find it strange they look that similar?


** Without spoilers, it's easiest to say that they actually /don't/ think that far ahead and their families come up with an explanation that they go along with.

*** That's a nice touch, not making their thinking as infallible. Thanks.

** Remember that they had always looked at least a bit similar - in the first chapter they're described as having "a remarkable similarity". The altered polyjuice makes them even more similar, although still not 100%. Without spoiling too much, something else happens (close to the start of book 3, iirc) that helps out too.

*** Yeah I reached the point you were talking about (and beyond) and wow this is really well done. I love this series.

** One of the non spoiler explanations is that “all Pureblood families are related” so it's not out of the ordinary for them to look alike. People definitely question it in the second/third book

** Honestly they could have thought that one through more (though it worked out for them). I think they believed it was just the smaller of two evils. Without being spoilery, iirc Rigel is terrified of Sirius coming up to Hogwarts to check on her. They can pass off looking exactly alike as outside of their control and coincidentual, but there's nothing Rigel can say if Sirius meets her at Hogwarts looking exactly like Harry.
