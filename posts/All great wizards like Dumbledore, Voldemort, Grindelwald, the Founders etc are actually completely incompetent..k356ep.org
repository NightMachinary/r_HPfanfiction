All of them faked their way through school and instead of learning magic they obliviated and rewrote their teacher's memories and they hate Lockheart because he's doing it very poorly. Harry in the process of preparing to fight Voldemort actually gets as strong as they're pretending to be. And they have a common goal for that when they duel they swear to help the other with obliviating.


** May I direct you to the Omake "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27701308/chapters/67828319][The Sword Of Gryffindor And Other Mistakes]]" in which we find out that the greatest feats of the Founders happened when they were feverish, drunk or high.

And yes, Gryffindor's Sword was the result of Godric and Salazar getting drunk. They had no idea afterwards how they managed to enchant the magic-resistant Goblin Silver...

*** There's something similar in one of those "Slytherin is reincarnated as Harry" fics Ouroboros or the other one.

The Founders got drunk and enchanted the staircases. And couldn't reverse it the next day. And that's why the staircases move about randomly and have stairs missing.
