Hi guys, I was hoping you could point me to some good romance/fluff/friendship fics featuring H/Hr. Mostly I'm looking for fics that are reasonably close to canon, but with the focus on the characters themselves rather than a bigger plot. For comparison, I've read most of Stanrick's H/Hr work, if you want to get an idea of what it is I'm looking for.

Any help is appreciated :)


** I personally hate this fic, but it does match your description. Covers 5th and 6th year and the war, sticking so close to canon it's almost unfortunate. Among the many downsides, it's abandoned and Harry and Hermione never actually end up getting together. But it does focus a lot on the characters and their relationships. Basically it's canon from Hermione's pov with the added HHr element.

Also, no bashing which is always a plus.

***** Well, as a general rule, I don't read incomplete fanfics. Especially not abandoned ones. This is mostly to avoid disappointment when I reach the end, especially if it never gets finished. I might look at the first few chapters, though.

However, I've read "Grow Young with Me" and I rather like it. Do you know if you'll update soon and how far it is from completion?

****** Yeah, I'm like 90% sure "A Memoir" will never be completed because like I said, I'm just not into the pairing anymore. But if you do read it, I hope you enjoy what's there :)

As for GYWM, I'm glad you like it! That one I definitely intend to complete. The new chapter should be done within the next two weeks. And there's probably a third of the story left at this point. I'm planning to update much more frequently in the summer.

******* That's good to hear, thanks! I've had so many fics on my following or favorites list end up abandoned :( so I started only reading a few chapters of a WIP and following it. Usually. Unless I get sucked in. I think I did with yours, but I'm not entirely sure because I don't want to spoil myself and jump to the last chapter to check. I typically read some fanfic everyday and I'm a really quick reader so it's hard to keep track.

Edit: I did it anyway and checked. Yup. Sounds familiar so I'm pretty sure I read all of it. The kids are really cute, especially Lily.

**** Well, it was started before HBP was published and intended as a continuation of canon, so of course the events of sixth year are vastly different. However, I think the characters act pretty believably from their fifth year selves.
