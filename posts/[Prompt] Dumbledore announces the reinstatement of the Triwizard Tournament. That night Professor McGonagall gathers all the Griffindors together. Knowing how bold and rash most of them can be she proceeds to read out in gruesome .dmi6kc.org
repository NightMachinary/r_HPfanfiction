** "Why do you care?" Harry asked belligerently.

"Excuse me Mr. Potter." McGonagall sputtered, enraged.

"Why do you care? You never bothered with our well-being before."

** The professor stared at the gathered Gryfindors. Their faces reflected confusion, fear, and solemnity. She sighed. She didn't like exposing these... Children to the real world. Yet times like these, sometimes is necessary. "House of Gryfindor. You might be wondering why I gathered all you here. As you might know already, Dumbledore announced the return of the Triwizard Tournament." Instantly, a clamber of voices rose up as the children muttered among each other. Their faces now showing excitement. "Quiet!" The voices died down as they stared at their professor. McGonagall sighed before reaching into her back pocket and pulling out a piece of parchment. She cleared her throat. "Since so many of you want to participate, I think it would be highly educational to inform you of the deaths you might experience should you participate. Jeff Robertson. Muggle born. Eaten by a pack of hell hounds." The third years looked horrified, some even beginning to look quesy. The upper years, ones who had fought in the war didn't seem bothered. "Caruis Romanov. Pureblood. Failed a shpinx riddle and was torn apart beofre being burnt to a crisp. Drake Malfoy. Pureblood. Called a Hypogriff an 'ugly and pathetic magical species.' Martix Peverell. Mysteriously died in bed due to an illness after second task. Tho-" McGonagall was cut off by a loud piercing voice, several students looking very uneasy, others nervous. A far cry from the excitement from earlier. "Professor! I think you got your point across!" Hermione said indignantly. Professor McGonagall nodded, turning on her heel and walking out of the common room door. "Bloody hell."

*** So... a common Harry Potter year at Hogwarts? At least it was only the champions involved and not the whole school.

*** I'm pretty sure none of the upper years have fought in the war. The war ended when Harry was 1, so the upper years during Harry's fourth year would have been at most 5.

And I'm not sure what that was at the end?

** "1294, Godfrey Gildoil, disemboweled by pixies..." McGonagall began.

"Pixies? That doesn't sound so bad."

"Disemboweled?"

"They were called /Highlander/ pixies, not the southern kind, which were known to wield miniature greatswords. Considering this was happening at the end of the 13th century..."

"Maybe he's Lockhart's great ancestor?"
