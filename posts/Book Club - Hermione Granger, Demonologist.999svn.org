What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]]* by /BrilliantLady/? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]]* by /PuzzleSB/. Set in Grindelwald's time, the fic follows a young Tom Riddle, who attracts the attention of the three most powerful wizards---Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and a new player---when he is attacked at Hogwarts.

Hope you enjoy! Sorry for the delay, guys. Personal life has been busy and hectic, I hope you understand.

** Quite adorable. I love Hermione just blundering about as a child wanting a friend and ending up in control of a demon king.

Wish their was more to the story instead of the epilogue containing everything from 2nd year and up.

*** For sure. I forgot how nice the first year of the story was and then the rest all gets rushed into the epilogue. It would have been nice to see an expanded version--the story really contained some great world building and some different sides to the whole dark/light distinction that gives concrete examples of exactly why they are split.

The epilogue definitely would be a great complete story on its own.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

** Absolutely loved it, it was a brilliantly written and fun story which used the basis of canon to create a new and interesting take on the world.

The demons were a delightful mixture of amusing and actually pretty evil. I personally would thoroughly recommend it to others.

I'm also glad that it didn't drag too much, leaving it short and sweet at the end of first year was the right choice to my mind.

** Ahh, this was a treat.

As someone eminently familiar with the Ars Goetia, as well as the other lesser keys and a few other grimoires, it was quite an amusing thing. I have to wonder how much the author was influenced by [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi:_The_Labyrinth_of_Magic][Magi]] ending recently though.

A fun take on Dark magic. One one thing that struck me as off was it seemed like the story was leading toward Hermione realizing the demons views were biased and she should form her own conclusions...and then that never happened. Maybe I was expecting more introspection than was merited.

Am I the only one who saw the Grangers as off? There was something intangible that I can't really name, but am I the only one who felt this way.

It's weird, but I feel that the fic was better when Hermione wasn't at Hogwarts. It feels like that dragged down the plot (except when Hermione summoned them to deal with Pansy and co.).

The only downside is I don't really feel like there was a story line for the most part. It's whacky and entertaining, and I'm glad I read it, but by the end I'm not really sure what the story was beyond ‘what if Hermione could summon demons?'

Interesting stories fall into several categories for me: fics that do unique ideas, fics that are enjoyable reads for various reasons, and there are fics that pass the time but never really push the envelope. Hermione Granger, Demonologist falls into all three categories for me. The main weakness is the lack of an overall story direction beyond summoning demons.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** It was okay.

The premise was pretty interesting, but the story itself kind of fizzled out a third of the way through. Had to force myself through the last two chapters.

It has some of the annoying tropes that come with Slytherin!Hermione fics: wise beyond her years (which is, frankly, in a lot of Hermione fics), friends with Harry, no real lasting obstacles as a Muggle-born in her particular house, doing evil stuff without any heavy consequences or true sense of danger, no consequences for the Dark Arts (which have lasting negative effects in canon), and then it's topped off by a summary-style epilogue.

The demons don't ever really feel dangerous, either, which is a sticking point for me.

The style of writing does mitigate the stuff above for me somewhat, but not enough. It's decently written, but as it is, it reads like a relatively weightless outline for a much larger story.

** I was interested enough to take a look at the linkffn(Perfectly Normal by BrilliantLady) series, and that seems pretty decent for what it is: an exploration of a different side of the HP world. The plot is basically canon-plus, with smart!Harry doing everything better than the original, but the world building around the traditional magical culture is neat. Note that it's in progress, early fourth year.

*** I'm usually not a huge fan of the fanon "pureblood culture" stuff, as I find it difficult to believe that 11 year olds would be able to understand and use so many levels of subtext and formality in every single conversation they have. Even in real life and when adults are involved subtext like that is probably only used occasionally during actual negotiations on things, not random casual conversations. I still enjoyed the fic though, as the plot is interesting enough for me to look past that, just read through the whole series.

***** It would depend on your age. Remember, people used to believe epileptics were possessed by Satan, and thus impure.

Frankly, the anglicized word demon is derived from the Greek word for character. It can figuratively be interpreted as an imaginary friend, and I've known kids who had imaginary friends that sound like the Old Ones from Lovecraftian lore.

Anyway, the grangers do send her to a psychologist, but like most kids she lied to get them to stop sending her there and stopped mentioning her demons as she aged.
