Not once in all my time being an obsessed HP fanfic reader have I ever read a WBWL story; It's just never been a premise that I found intriguing enough to catch my interest.

So, with that in mind, I'd love to know what WBWL stories you would recommend to someone like me. If I'm going to induct myself into this club, which fic(s) should be my introduction? I have no specific requirements, I don't mind fics of any shape: slash, specific pairings, time travel, bashing, I'm not picky! I just don't know where to start, and since I'm already not entirely convinced by the theme yet I want to make sure my introduction to it has some good recs behind it!

*** Wrong boy who lived. Typically either Harry is actually the boy who lived and everyone thinks otherwise because reasons or he really isn't the boy who lived. Of those two flavours, the Harry who is but isn't recognised as such usually has a sibling who everyone thinks is the boy who lived, or thinks Neville is. For a quick test of readability, check the end. If Harry ends up as a 4000iq superwealthy wizard who everyone sucks up to when they realise they made a mistake, drop it. Antithesis is not perfect but probably the best example. A subgenre is Slytherin Harry, almost always with a sibling, but most of these read like each other.

Some, like Malachite's Gift or Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, actually have the MC as really not being the boy who lived. These are often pretty funky, but better than the other kind.

** Oh god your in for a ride...

The absolute gold standard of these fics linkffn(Harry Potterr and the boy who lived by thesanti) .

Another old but good one is linkffn(savingconnor)

The one I first read that is terrible, but I love all the same is linkffn(Too young to Die)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Neither is strictly WBWL, as linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) and linkffn(Negligentia) are both "brother of the BWL" stories, but I don't think I've ever read an actual WBWL fic that I can sincerely recommend. With that said, the first fic is abandoned, and doesn't end at a natural stopping point, though it also doesn't really end on a cliffhanger. The second has a wildly OoC James, Lily, Harry, Sirius, and Malfoy, but as it's mostly about the long term impact of emotional neglect on children, I don't think it's that big a deal. It has two sequels, but they're honestly not great.

Prince of Slytherin is widely recommended, but it's honestly skipable, so bogged down in explaining every aspect of its world in exacting detail (to the point where the story often comes to a dead halt to have characters blatantly exposit at one another, often about things with no immediate story relevance) that it has very little time for its characters, which it for some reason divides between well over a dozen minor characters, most of whom could be removed entirely without changing the core plot /at all./ It's currently over a million words, and it would be generous to say that /half/ of them advance the narrative.

It is in my opinion the best of the WBWL stories alongside "The Prince of Slytherin" and "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived". The first year of S&S and POS are kinda similar, but after that they become very different.
