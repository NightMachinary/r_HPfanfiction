I'm talking about things from the beginning, like the first time in the diagon alley. I'm writing a fic and just briefly mentioned that moment, like ''Harry came home after buying this and that''. Essential things like the wand core can be detailed later, right? I recently saw a fic author that I really like, talking about the lazy writing that most authors have, using the excuse that readers already know the story, but I found that weird. How many times have we read and reread the same things... repeating everything is really important? Do I really need 20,000 words to get the character to Hogwarts?

Sorry if it's an unfounded discussion


** I started my first year fic on the train to Hogwarts simply because I was tired of reading the opening at the Dursleys and the trip to Diagon Alley over and over. Unless something is changed in those parts, really changed, then I don't really feel the need to read it or write it. Same with most canon scenes for me - either I change something or I find another way to present the information.

** I mean, in essence, writing is all about building a mental image in someone else's head. At the end of the day, everything in every book is in service to creating that image, in one way or another. If rehashing the canon basics helps build that image you want, then add it in, if not, then don't. There are still plenty of ways to reword, rework, and otherwise redo canon events in more novel and interesting fashions, so with sufficient thought put into it, repetition isn't too much of a bother to fix.

Twelve people can write the same 'going to Ollivanders to pick up the wand' scene, but each of those twelve could write a completely different conversation around picking up the wand while the scene is happening - perhaps different people are involved, or perhaps a change in the setting history, or whatever else that would lead to different commentary on the standard Holly wand.

It's not what you do, it's what you do with it that counts. Also how you do it, but that had less of a rhythm to it. Even lazy writing is in the hows rather than the whats.

** By all means, skip large swathes of canon if you like. I made a comment on this a while back but my belief is that there is no reason to rehash canon if you don't want to and it isn't absolutely necessary to advance the plot.

For example, if you think nothing important happens during the trip to Diagonal Alley then by all means skip it. Hell, if something important /does/ happen but you'll address it later or it wouldn't register as important to Harry at the time, feel free to skip it! I think a lot of fics would be improved by this thought process. So many fics that went nowhere because the author wanted to rehash canon for the sake of it and never got to the meat of the story.

It is perfectly okay to cut things out. You wouldn't detail Harry's breakfast every day of the year, so why would you detail an otherwise uneventful shopping trip? A single paragraph ought to do.

** Depends. Of you are writing it differently or you can, go for it. If it will be pretty much the same events and same perspective and similar internal dialogue, skip it.

** One of my biggest peeves when reading fanfiction is authors lifting dialogue or chunks of text straight out of a canon scene just to rush through it. If it's not important enough to the story to rewrite in your own words, just mention it in a transition or something.

The other thing I super hate is when there is an OC or crossover character in a canon scene, and the Same. Exact. Dialogue. is lifted from the original text with a few original lines written for the OC. Or worse, a few lines of the lifted text is reassigned to the OC.

Like if your character is not interesting enough to influence the original dialogue in a canon scene, why am I spending time reading a fic about them?

** I would prefer you include a commentary like retelling of the events...

#+begin_quote
  The shopping trip to the strangely magical back alley of a surprisingly dingy and dirty pub was quite magical.\\
  Harry got swarmed by adults, he really didn't expect to be a celebrity, met /Goblins/ who were bankers, learned that he had a fortune in gold, bought all that was on the list provided with his Hogwarts acceptance letter but the highlight he decided was getting his wand... it felt like he found a missing part of himself.

  Coming home to Privet Drive in contrast was as normal as always, Vernon threatened him Dursley got in a hit with his Smeltings stick Petunia even had some dishes for him to do... really he was glad he had the trip back to himself so he could prepare himself mentally.
#+end_quote

this way the reader can assume stuff is like canon, while you can also highlight stuff that you'll use to tell the story. (you could always just start the fic after the trip)

** I suppose if Harry is going to have any particular differences in behaviour, then expressing them asap in privet drive and diagon alley is welcome, otherwise I'm happy for authors to skip the unneeded events, though I'd like it filled with exposition later, to explain why Harry has XYZ from diagon alley, without us seeing he bought it

** I think it's pointless to re-write a scene from the books unless the perspective is shifted to another character who thinks very differently from Harry or the events turn out significantly different from the original series. That's why I lately started avoiding fics in which the action occurs during the series unless they are written from the perspective of a character who doesn't frequently appear in the story.

** Yes and no. Yes, you should skip anything that is not NECESSARY for your story, including (and especially) anything which was important in the books. Whenever (and it is painfully often) I read Professor McGonagall's speech about four houses at Hogwarts I have the strongest urge to close the story and run away. And no, repeating is not only unimportant, it is altogether harmful.

** depends. Did you change something? Still meeting Draco in the robe shop? Or someone else? Or maybe his parents are with him? Same wand? Hagrid still pic out Hedwig or was there something else?\\
If you changed something, then yeah write that out a bit. If not, a glossover's fine.\\
And 'fer cryin out loud most of us can repeat the First Year Sorting Song backwards, so maybe skip that too (unless, of course, you rewrote it).

** I kinda feel like authors dont need to write about any shopping experiences unless it's vitally important to the plot. I don't need to know that Harry has 15 pairs of gray jeans and one pair of greeen pants etc, I just need to know that when he went to (insert store) he met such and such character and that character advanced to plot somehow. I don't even really need to know that Harry went to all the other stores in Diagon alley besides a line that says. After that conversation Harry finished his shopping and went home. On the same thread, I don't care for gringotts bank rides and the whole you are the heir of all the lordships either. I think gringotts has its time and place but it becomes repetitive over a multitude of fanfics. The most needed should be Harry went to gringotts and withdrew some money.

** i dont enjoy just copypasted content from the book, but the first diagon alley trip is significant because its the first time harry enters the magical world. Most events like that is deliberate, with a spesific intention in mind. 2nd year, harry used the floo for the first time, met the new teacher, such. 3rd and fourth was kind of glossed over, harry stayed at the leaky in the 3rd and 4th harry went to the quidditch championship. 5 was glossed over as well if i recall, and 6th was checking out WWW and malfoy being sketchy

** I mean it's only lazy writing if it's lazy writing. If you're not going to diverge from canon in any scene I think skipping is far superior to either quoting large swathes of the book or writing the whole thing out in your own voice.

There also seems to be a lot of people on here talking about how annoying it is when fics just visit the stations of canon with slight differences. In my book, only include what is pertinent to the story/strengthens the whole story, much like a goblin made weapon.

** My view on this comes in two parts:

1. Stories should be able to stand on their own feet. Firstly because it's good writing and practice for original fiction, where you don't have the luxury of readers already knowing things. Secondly because it avoids the ambiguity of readers not knowing whether or not something from canon has occurred.

2. If a scene is so similar to canon that you're worried about readers being bored by the story covering the same events as canon, then your story isn't original enough.

Stories absolutely should not be rehashing canon. But the way to achieve this is by telling an original story, not by just skipping chunks of the narrative.

** Depends on context. If Harry ditches the creepy old man to follow booty shorts & fishnets over /Jimmy Kiddel's Wonderful Wands/ for his wand, by all means tell us about what happens there. Or any of the other points of departure into the story.

If nothing much changes prior to Hogwarts you can probably just start with him on the way to his house table and fill us in on minor details later.
