I'm in the mood for some good romance driven stories as i haven't really read one in a while and most of the goods ones, i've already read(at least the ones i have a preference for). So i'm looking for any good romance fics that have been either published or updated(but doesn't have a wide gap between update date and publish date) in recent memory.

Most preferably anyone paired up with Harry. although i'm into H/Hr, H/DG, H/FD ships, ever other character, even OCs, paired up with harry is fine within reason(no slashes). smut is welcomed and to some extent, encouraged but not a must.


** Linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty) my all time favorite Harry/Luna and romance story in general. I still hold a torch in the hope it will be updated.

  A/U after DH, EWE. Luna Lovegood is the Ministry's newest Unspeakable, and Harry's work as an Auror brings them into close quarters. What will happen when The Boy Who Lived Twice can't stop thinking about The Girl Who Lives In Her Own Universe? HP/LL

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
