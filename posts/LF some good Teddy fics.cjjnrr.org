  Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** Try fics by fernwithy on ffn. Though they don't fit with later information about Bill and Fleur's kids that was revealled after DH was published. The first one is Teddy Lupin and the forest guard, I think. But it includes characters from her previous story, and I ended up reading that one as well because I was annoyed by the fact I had no idea who some of those people were.
