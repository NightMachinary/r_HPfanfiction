:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this fic from fanfiction.net harry turned into a lamia and I specifically remrmber one significant part of his creature status was that he could unhinge his jaw like a snake and he had different eye lenses so he didn't turn someone into stone. Also he was living in a hostel in a different alley adjacent to diagon alley


** Sounds like Serpens Armarum by Evandar, and its sequel Serpens Arcanum. The author took them down from all the places that they originally posted it, but you may still be able to find a copy floating around on one of the fanfiction archiving sites (e.g., fictionhunt).

#+begin_quote
  Harry survives the Basilisk in this fanfiction without Fawkes' healing powers, but it does not leave him untouched. Over the summer, Harry begins to change in ways he can barely hide, and even worse, in ways that endanger those around him. One dead body later and Harry becomes another runaway taken under the wing of the warm-hearted couple that runs the Last Hope Hostel in Knockturn Alley. As Harry learns firsthand what it means to be on the outskirts of Wizarding Society, he begins to grow and change on the inside as well.

*** Omg that's it. I loved the fic and I have been wanting to reread it, but forgot where to find it. Thank you so much. Could you explain what fictionhunt is and what are some other archive sites? I really only read on FFN and A03 so I am not sure.
