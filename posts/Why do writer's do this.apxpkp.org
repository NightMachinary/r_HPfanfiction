OK this is probably going to sound really stupid, but why do some author's decide to go so over the top it's not even remotely feasible?\\
This is based off of the first actual chapter(AKA the actual introductory chapter) of linkffn(12868202) Wherein James And Lily have Septuplets (7 Children), Quadruplets, Twins, Another pair of twins, Triplets, another pair of twins, and 7 non-multiple birthed kids. So that's a total of 30 kids grand total.

And that doesn't stop them from gaining all the Masteries ever conceived.

James: Transfiguration, Charms, DADA, Potions, Battle Magic, duelling, Elven, Care of magical Creatures, French, German, ancient Celtic, maths, Enchanting, and arithmancy 13Masteries.

Lily: Potions, Charms, DADA, Care of Magical Creatures, Duelling, Transfiguration, herbology, arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Greek, Gaelic, Astronomy, Mundane Studies, Algebra, English, Enchanting, Greek, Dutch, and Danish. 19Masteries

And Harry's wand is made up of 14 types of woods, it's core is made up of 17 different things, and it has 10 gems in it.

But that's not all, he also has 10 animagus forms, of which 6 are magical. You thought that was all? He also has +six pets+ The guy obviously can't count. Including two wolves, two dogs, 2 lions, a basilisk, a snow +owl,+ I mean phoenix, for some reason and 3 other phoenix elementals as well as a wyvern.

The entire family are parseltounges for some reason.

I wish I could truly complain about the dual house bullshit but the word of god made that an actual thing now.

​

Over the top is one thing. But this seems like wish-fulfilment type of over the top. I know I'm pointing out one specific fic here, but it's hardly the only one that's done it. It's just the one that, to me, took it those extra few steps too far.

*** Was an owl too normal of a pet for Harry? Why is Hedwig suddenly a phoenix? Also...none of these pets would be allowed in Hogwarts. Or most other schools, I'd assume. Especially not lions. Owls are a normal pet for witch and wizard students because they have more than one use. Being pets and also being able to carry letters from their owner to whoever. The other pets allowed are rather normal. The only normal pet on there is literally a husky and a shepherd.

That or they're just dumping ideas out of their head and posting the rough draft without actually caring about it.

I doubt the best writer in the world could actually make their lists make any kind of sense if the plot was the most important thing in the story. It doesn't seem to be, what seems to be the most important is lists.

Although at the very least in the story you linked James and Lily's fifteen thousand children aren't exceptionally awfully named. Some of their other stories lack that.

But hey, they seem to like it and my god do they produce it in volume so just let them do their thing.

** Oh, I thought you meant the incorrect grammar in your title.

In a serious answer... I /really/ don't know. I generally do not like nor even try to read fics where James and Lily have a hundred more kids, or even ones where Harry turns out to be a twin. There was one where the twin was the actual child who lived, and the character was pretentious as hell (and of course named something like Hadrian or something). Harry being super powerful gets really old really fast. Same with him being a genuis.

That being said, I guess they just... want to write it. These are probably the people who write only for themselves, so they write whatever pops up in their mind. That or they're, you know, 12.

The whole story runs off clichéd fanfiction tropes: overly detailed clothing description, special magical pets, special magical markings, boys falling in love for no reason, bashing a canon love interest to get him out of the way, MC related to powerful or important canon characters.

It sounds more like writing for the purpose of teenage self-expression than trying to be a good story, so I am not as hard on it as I could be. But I hope one day the author looks back at their work with self-awareness, knowing that they wrote a classic self-insert Mary Sue protagonist.

It truly does. She even has multiple animagus forms. I feel like the writer must've watched Merlin because I feel like Hermione's eyes become golden during a scene(much like Merlin and Morgana's). The bashing of Ron is so wild to me. Especially since Lucius was turned into basically a good guy.

Oh, that's definitely what it seems like. The fact that the fic is NC17 throws me off a bit, but that doesn't mean anything since there are teens who do try their hand at smut. The fact that she wrote so many chapters(almost sixty) shows that they must enjoy writing so hopefully they grow up and their writing gets better.

It are the type of fics that have an entire chapter filled with listing all the shit Harry inherited form Hogwarts which for 99% of the money/houses/items will have no actual impact on the story. The authors mistake things like inheritances, magical powers, political power and attributes for actual character building and storyline. It's wishfulfilment and power wank stuff and not remotely interesting to read.

  James, Lily & Harry survived the Halloween Night & Lily & James ran to America. No one from Britain knew they survived but the Goblins & Ted & Andromeda Tonks. Lily gave birth to more kids in America followed by more. Harry and his family went to Ilvermorny. Now the Triwizard Tournament is here and America is joining the competition. Harry, James & Lily will shock. Harem. Bashing.

** I can think of two things, never having read the story myself. A) A very young and/or very inexperienced writer who's just throwing out everything they can think of because it's fun and they think it's cool.

B) They're trying to parody that type of over the top writing and it fell a bit flat.

** To be fair, parseltongue in inherited, so if James/Lily were one, it's completely fair for all their children to be too.

As for everything else, well, there are fics where you should just back out and remove everything from your mind, not wasting any further time on why people would write/read or even want whatever it is you read.

** Haven't read that, but what you describe seems like a parody to me. Is it at least funny?
