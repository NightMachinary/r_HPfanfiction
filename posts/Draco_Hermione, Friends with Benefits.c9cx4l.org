Canon or not. But i would like Draco to have a Gentleman behaviour, especially towards her. Both are in a way attracted to each other. Malfoy has the stunning good looking and she might not be the prettiest (although Beauty lies in the Eye of the Beholder, and she can be made pretty in the Fics), but have an amazing Body. Well, thats just examples and i leave the Describtions and Reasons to the Fics. Whether they have something in Hogwarts or after it doesnt matter. They would occassionally sleeping with each other, but no bonding or serious feelings.

On AO3 there is a fic called "caught Red-handed" which has Hermione catching Draco masturbating in a Shower room (i think it was Quidditch, but not sure anymore) and she got turned on by this. She and Ron have broke up at this Point. Draco catches her voyerism and both getting heat up, but nothing between them really happened. However, i could imagine, that one of their Encounter, if not the first one at all would be like this, so she might catch him in the Prefects Bathroom having happy times and it leads to more.
