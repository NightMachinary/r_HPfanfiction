Where they are 'exceptionally bright' and 'quite the double act'. Can be an AU, any time period and I don't mind romance and preferably no crossovers.


** i mean if you haven't read haggis for algernon then you must introduce yourself to the strange world of cgner, ghostofbambi and also beedaily

failing that, there is always the life and times, which is the piece of fanfiction that could most easily pass for an eighth canon book. it is sort of unfinished.

none of this is exactly what you asked for.

*** I would flag if you start reading beedaily, that commentarius is incomplete. It is incredible, I have read it on several occasions, but it is incomplete and ends on a cliffhanger. It really kills me that it is not finished and likely never will be
