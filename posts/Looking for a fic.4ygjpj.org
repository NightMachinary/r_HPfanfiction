Hello all new guy here looking for a fic a saw a while ago but forgot to save. The main thing i remember is that Harry somehow own Hogwarts and the land surrounding it. But he was really cool about it and had some ideas of further developing the land. I remember the fic overall being pretty good. Thanks for any help.
