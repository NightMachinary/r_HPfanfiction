** for future reference. Rule 8 in the sidebar, Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.

You'll probably have more luck in future if you flair this sort of thread as a request thread. Normally that flair is used when someone wants to share a fic they have enjoyed.
