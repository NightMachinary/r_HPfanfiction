Give me your stories where Harry /just doesn't care/ (edit: about people dying in the war due to his indirect actions) - rather than the stereotypical "it's all my fault" that you find in most fanfiction.


** On the extreme end of the spectrum is the Harry the Hufflepuff series.

** linkffn(Harry Potter's Life Lessons by DisobedienceWriter;Logical Consequences by Laume)?

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia), he's rather more concerned about saving his skin than feeling guilty.

linkffn(In Cold Blood by Rorschach's Blot) is a crackish version of Mercenary.

The subset of independent!Harry with Azkaban imprisonment might possibly fit your criteria too...

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
