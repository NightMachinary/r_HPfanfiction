** The premise of this initially enticed me, but when I read the story it was decent. Most of the dialogue was done well, nothing JKR esque, but for a Fan Fic it's brilliant. Use of characters is done well. If you have time, bomb through this. You won't regret it, it's more of a character story rather than big action things happening.

No, it wasn't. The author didn't even punctuate the dialogue properly. That should be writing 101.

The story is pretty bland regardless, just like all of the author's other stories.

**** I haven't read through the story yet, so I can't judge for myself if the dialogue is actually good or not, but I think it's worth pointing out that there's a difference between proper grammar usage in dialogue, and good dialogue.

Edited because the way I worded that last part made me feel ill.

***** Yeah exactly, I'm basing it on what sentences/lines they managed to use. For such a small story, in my eyes, it did a good job. I'm sure others will enjoy it also, it's story that I picked up at 00:00, and had finished at 02:15 (roughly). In other words, I binged it as it was decent.

For me, it was something new. Seeing this perspective of life post hogwarts

*** He's a rapist even though she planned and executed a seduction of him? A romantic night-time stroll through Paris. She put the naked lady show on TV, she gave him a naked lady show heading to the bathroom. He said no. He wanted to stop. She didn't listen. Only later did she decide to stop.
