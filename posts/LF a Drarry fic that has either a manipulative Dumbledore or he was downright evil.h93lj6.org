:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Drarry fic where Draco and Harry have 4? guards as they are part of another race of beings. At one point the guards are not supposed to interfere but the end up growing close the them. One of their names starts with an O and he is the most deadly of them all but is thought to be a "scholar"

I'm sorry I keep remembering it in pieces!

Both H and D have wings whose patterns and colors are important to their mate

Dudley happens upon Dean, Luna and Neville escaping from Mad Eye and Luna kills people by humming

Tom is friendly with Harry and Draco I believe

Harry vists Dudley and Petunias apartment after he'd helped Luna and Neville to safety

Harry and Draco are hiding from Dumbledore during some sort of ritual? Something to do with either their virginities or magical majorities I'm not certain

Please help me remember this fic!!


** I have no idea what it is, but I'm very interested on reading it
