As in, he's an unrepentant bully, favours his own house, enjoys humiliating and abusing people he doesn't like, but also sincerely feels guilt for his past DE affiliation and actively tries to redeem himself by opposing muggleborn discrimination, Voldemort and trying to save others.


** Isn't canon like this

*** that's my read on it, yeah. some people disagree that he feels remorse for his past affiliation and tries to make up for it, some that do tend to flatten out his viciousness. you rarely get contrasts like:

#+begin_quote
  Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood ---”

  “Do not use that word!”
#+end_quote

from what i've seen.

what i'm looking for is the most obvious interpretation of this statement:

#+begin_quote
  Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world
#+end_quote

*** Hm. I'm not sure Snape was devoted to the Order in canon, rather just to Dumbledore personally.

**** I understand your point view even though I kinda read Snape as 'disobeying' Dumbledore's orders during the Battle of the 7 Potter. Dumbledore told Snape to play "his part convincingly" and Snape still went on risking his role trying to save Remus.

I interpret that scene as Snape being devoted to more than just Dumbledore though I can understand other interpretations.

***** That is not untrue.

But, my train of thought towards Snape's loyalties goes like this: his ultimate goal is Voldemort's death. Would he sacrifice anything and everything in pursuit of that goal? I think the answer is a resounding yes, even if the sacrifice had to be the death of an order member. So it can be argued that he has some loyalty to them, but if it interfered with "the plan" he would chuck them into the fire.

**** I don't think Snape was even devoted to Dumbledore. Owed something to him perhaps, but not devoted to him. In the end I think Snape was only ever truly devoted to himself. There's a reason he was able to play the part of spy and double agent so well. Even under torture or veritaserum he'd never be able to say he was devoted to one master over the other if he were only ever truly devoted to himself.
