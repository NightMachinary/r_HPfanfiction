**** The romance is not too strong in this fic imo, there's a little more Harry/Tonks friendship than H/G romance for example.

#+begin_quote
  After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.
