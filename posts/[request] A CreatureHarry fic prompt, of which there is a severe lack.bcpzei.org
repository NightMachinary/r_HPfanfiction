[PROMPT] AU/AR: Long, long ago, long before wands ever existed or some such, four great wizards (not necessarily all male) came together to practice their magiks... that's right, with a k! So they do old magik (obnoxious, but consistent) and transform themselves into human animal hybrid things, hear me out, it's better then it sounds. (But I am biased)

One gets enhanced looks, a propensity for fire magik, the ability to morph into a semi bird person, a natural control over emotional magik, and the ability to, at the end of their life become a bird of pure fire and emotion, a phoenix, which does not age but is not immortal. So Veela, only it's a big secret, and not all Veela can become phoenix...es.

Another gets enhanced cunning/wisdom, a propensity for water magik, the ability to morph into a semi snake person, a natural ability for mind magik (interesting mind magiks, not just bog standard legilmency and oclumency, something like the stuff in the prince of Slytherin), and the ability to, and the end of their life become a snake of awesome power. A basilisk. Again, lives a long time, but not immortal, not everyone becomes a basilisk. Maybe only the most powerful, or those who achieve something like an animagus transformation.

And the other two. Air and earth. Yeah, I'm stuck, so if someone likes this idea I am willing to help for ideas, but currently I can't think of a suitably humanish creature related to air or earth. Although I'm thinking vampires, and thestrals could be for air.

A side point; Parseltongue isn't some random wizardey power, and Harry definitely didn't get it from Dark Lord V, instead, some how Harry is descended from another parseltongue on his mothers side, be it some OC, or retconned character, or Slytherin himself. Obviously parseltongue is simply a side affect of being this Water-Snake-Mind Magik-Person-Basalisk. (It only sounds OP, because of all the hyphens)

I think a good divergence point is either 2nd year, with Salazar being the basalisk in the chamber and still semi capable of higher thought, or 4th, with Harry coming into his inheritance like a Veela at age 14 and waking up with a snake tail instead of legs, and reading everyone's surface thoughts a la Queenie from fbawtft. Can we get a better acronym for that?

*** In a strange coincidence, I started reading that only a few minutes after posting the prompt. If it has similar concepts then I guess that will be interesting, but I doubt it's as specific on the whole elemental Demi-Human creatures as all of... that /\

** Due to the Chamber and the Triwizard, Harry ends up turning into a Draculae (note- that's Dragon Knight, not Vampire). The Chamber results in a fragment of Basilisk fang being sealed into one of his bones where it remains encased until a dragon spike pierces it. The actual transformation is slow and has Harry being very confused as to what the heck is going on.

The story in question is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]] by DerLaCroix.
