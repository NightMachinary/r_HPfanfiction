I've noticed in several slytherin!harry fics and older!harry fics that an older brother to Draco his included quite often. Almost always he is named, Elan Malfoy, I was wondering if anyone know where this trend started or if JKR mentioned the name ever. If it is a fanon creation, does anyone know where it started?


** Well, I've not read a fic with that, But Elan would be a good name for a Malfoy with their fandom French connections ( I've always seen the Malfoys as a Norman family rather than old-OLD English pure-blood like the Blacks)

Elan is roughly the French word for Rush, or Blitzkrieg. A mainly Military term, which makes for a good name for a powerful Wizard.

Well, as good as naming someone Dragon or after Greek gods and Roman Emperors.

*** Thanks for the info! If you're interested, two stories are mentioned in the other comment that have Elan and they are both very good.

**** This is the fix I was thinking of, thank you, I was trying to remember it. I love this story, but I haven't read it in a long time and I wanted to re-read it.

*** It is in that one, which is a fic I've just caught up on recently. I was just surprised by how often it comes up. Both of these stories are very good though so I can see why many people use the name from those.
