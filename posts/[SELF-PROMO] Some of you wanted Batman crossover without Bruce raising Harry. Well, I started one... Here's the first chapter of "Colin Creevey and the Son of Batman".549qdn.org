Criticism is more than welcome, and a beta would be nice... Also, I need your help. I am crap at poetry (and other fine arts), so, does anyone have a decent Sorting Hat song? I can cheat here, of course, but I don't want to.

Finally, to address the Stations of Canon. While the fic is written from entirely different PoV, most of the events of CoS will still happen and influence the plot. Expect major divergences late in the year, and PoA will be different from the very beginning.


** Awesome! I've wanted a good Batman crossover.

I was actually thinking about trying a fic idea I had that put Bruce Wayne, Bruce Lee, and Bruce Springsteen in the other houses of Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Year of Bruces lol

** Do you know... according to Batman vs. Superman, Bruce Wayne's parents were killed the same year as Harry Potter's? 1981 was a bad year, apparently. That would make Bruce only a few years older than Harry, I thought he looked about 7 or 8 in the movie.

*** I'm not going by BvS, and in comics they never specify the year, only that he was eight. Bruce is 40-ish in my story, so I'd say his parents died in 1959. He adopted 11-year old Dick when he was 26, 14-year old Jason when he was 33 and accepted 13-year old Tim as an apprentice when he was 34, after Jay died. Jay came back as the Red Hood roughly four years before this story, Under the Red Hood happened, but like in New 52, he and Bruce are OK now.

If you need timeline on Batgirls - I'll make one.

Also, Damian is 11, which means that he met Bruce in 1988, died in 1989, Robin Rises happened in spring of 1990 and his Gotham Academy happened in autumn of the same year. Then we have three months with Maria, atoning for the Year of Blood, then Robin War, and then around a year of basically routine, until an Ilvermorny letter arrived. As to why he is in Hogwarts - it will be explained later.

**** Oh, yeah, no, sorry if that came across wrong, it was just an idle observation that I thought was cool. I didn't mean to imply your story should abide by it or anything. The dates pretty much have to change occasionally for Batman stories or he'd be like 80 in the movies by now.

***** It's OK, I might have misread your comment myself. Still, now I have a timeline :)

** Looks good, and like I posted in the FF.net review, you've got at least a stray 'aby' instead of an 'any'.
