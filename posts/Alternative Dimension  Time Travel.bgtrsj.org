You've all probably read some fics like this. From 'Im still here' to some that have barely 100 follows. I know it's clich√© and stuff, but I read 'Time and Time again' which is a fic with that typical plot and got back into it again. I'll probably know most of the fics you're going to (hopefully) recommend, but I thought I'd try anyway.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.
