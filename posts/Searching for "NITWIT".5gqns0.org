I recall some fic in which there was a saying or motto between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. It formed the acronym "NITWIT". I remember almost nothing else about it. Jog any memories for anyone?


** linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess) contains what you are talking about. I think it is first mentioned in chapter 11 if you want to be sure.

**** Quick mini review: this fic has a LOT of kid sex. I get that Harry's a troubled child with emotional issues, but the overall feeling is too much. Dumbledore teaches her some way of shutting out nightmares, and she gets heavily aroused as a side effect, and he just smirks and goes, oh yes, that's part of it too. Sex is blatant and everywhere, and not just with her. Luna is outright creepy. Molly lets Ginny and Harry sleep together despite knowing Harry becomes very aroused at night, and possibly knowing it's influenced by her daughter, who's so innocent, she thinks it means Harry's in pain. I don't see a mum letting that happen, especially since Ginny is very upset when she clicks. The Dursley's do something extremely unforgivable, without any spoilers, that /should/ have seen them jailed, or at least Dudley and Harry taken off them. Instead, Dumbledore just legilimatised them, giving Dudley the exact same punishment as the adults, which was so ineffective, Vernon feels able to threaten and intimidate Harry just one year later. I'm giving up half way through
