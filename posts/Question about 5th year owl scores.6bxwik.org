Did the D.A actually improve those owl scores for that group of students? Is that just in fanfiction?


** I don't think it's shown. Did they even complete the test? I know Fred/George interrupted the test(iirc?), and then there was the whole Sirius Black/DoM thing.

*** Harry's vision of Sirius interrupted his History of Magic OWL, and the Aurors trying to take in Hagrid and over-Stupefying McGonagall interfered with their Astronomy OWL. While Snape does allude to surprise at how many (mostly from the DA) were in his NEWT DADA class, there wasn't an actual statement of 'everyone in DA earned a grade bump'.

The twins made their grand exit to give Harry a chance at a Floo call to ask Sirius and Remus about Snape's worst memory... in the book. In the movie it was staged to interrupt their OWLs.

** I believe it improved at least some of the students' scores. /cough/ Marietta Edgecombe. After all Harry got to be a better teacher than Umbridge. Also, all or most of the DA students learned the patronus charm, which is highly advanced magic.

*** Just because you can do one piece of highly advanced magic does not mean that you get good grades.

**** We don't really have any indication of what the exam, particularly the written part, actually entails. If there is a certain set of spells that a student must perform for a practical portion, the DA could only have helped there, as Umbridge didn't seem to have them doing any practical work.

If, however, the ministry has control over the exam material, and Umbridge was teaching the bare minimum for the exams, then it might not have made much of a difference.

I prefer to think it did have a positive impact, but exams aren't really the concern anyways, it was more about students defending themselves.
