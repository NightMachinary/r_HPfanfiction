  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** *The Birth of Evil*, linkffn(4133028): no romance in this one at all

*Rise of the Wizards*, linkffn(6254783): little romance here, but he took a few wives to have heirs.

*Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942): He was making good progress until he was betrayed by someone close to him in the sequel *The Stars Alone*, linkffn(12040341). But then he and his girls went on to conquer the Galaxy.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
