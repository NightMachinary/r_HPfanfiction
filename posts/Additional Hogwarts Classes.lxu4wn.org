What kind of classes do you like to see added in fics? Or do you not like it when people add classes? What classes do you not like when people add them?

For the fic I'm writing, I've added Latin as a mandatory class bc JKR uses Latin for a lot of the spells.

And I'm debating adding a math class for 1st and 2nd years since Arithmancy is an optional class starting in 3rd year


** I've added in a 'Beings Studies' class that's basically anthropology but for merpeople, centaurs, goblins, etc.

I also toyed around with an ancient languages class, but I think I decided to go with Magical Theory/Spellcraft instead. My hc is that Latin being the majority language of spells is a class thing, and that any language can (and should!) be used. Although I do quite like that JKR mostly went with Greek for the healing spells

** One I haven't seen is a Physical Health type class taught by Hooch to second years. It would be the basics of keeping healthy and fit but add in some spells or potions to keep it magical. In a similar vein I think Pomfrey could teach some puberty/sex ed.

My favourite is “Advanced Enchantments”, I know that the first years get a pineapple to dance so later years can probably do more complex creations in Charms, but I think it would be cool if there was an elective that really focuses on layering spells and crafting magical objects. Like not much is explained about how the Twins make all their stuff. Maybe the class would focus on experimentation.

I like “magical” languages, especially foreign ones. Like if you have Indian/Desi!Harry he would want to learn about his dads language and culture.

*** Thing is many of them would consider it a useless class. Why be able to run 5km in under 20 minutes when you can just teleport? Why be able to lift heavy things when you can just use magic? Also take into consideration that the only major sport they play in Britain and hogwarts is quidditch which doesn't require lots of fitness

** I'd love to read about classes where they do not only learn foreign languages but also about how magic in other countries work and maybe learn some exemplaric stuff. Also I'd love a voluntary class where music theory is combined with magic and can be used for example in sung incantations as some form of more uncommon magic. And also, I'd enjoy extracurricular art classes where interested students could learn to draw magical paintings or learn instruments and stuff. And some other sports than quidditch would be nice, maybe broom aerobatics or something like that.

** Classes for muggle raised students on how the magical world works, places of interest and a guide to the MOM and its workings within the departments, i would also put in tours for them also so they can see where places are and how the system works.

*** Muggle studies should be mandatory for wizard raised to simply maintain the statute of secrecy. I mean, Arthur doesn't know how money works. Others are wandering around in nightshirts.

And muggle raised need a wizard studies class for integration.

**** I know that Arthur's (and a lot of other wizards too) ignorance of the Muggle world is played as a jock, but to be fair, it's not like he "/needed/" to really know about them.

Before being promoted during the war, Arthur worked for the "Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office", and despite his ignorance, he was perfectly able to do his job.\\
To do his job, Arthur never needed to understand how a computers works, or what electricity is, or even to learn Muggle economy. He just needed to identify what Muggle Item were jinxed, to deal with them and then to find the culprit. You don't need to be able to build a telephone by yourself to understand that it is not supposed to get sentiance.

In the same way, Arthur probably never had to use something like the subway, because he mastered the freaking teleportation. And I'm not even mad about the clothes some wizards wear, because if looking like a weirdo was the proof that someone was a wizard, you can easily cross tens of them daily while living in a big city.

I'm fairly certain that Muggles know of the Wizarding World, but they like to let them believe that they don't

** First year Mandatory Writing and Composition Class. Teaches you how to write essays properly, write with a Quill (as Muggleborn would be used to pens) and teaches you to follow the instructions on essay length, and basically having the teachers stop marking after the assigned length. (Totally imagining a scene with Hermione in horror after she gets a P on a bit of Homework because she wordvomits)

** If I were adding classes I would. make arithmancy and runes closer to what they are in canon then add new classes which would be the fanon arithmancy and runes, called something like "Advanced magical theory" and "Enchanting and wardcrafting". I'd also probably include a dueling class.

** I really liked NoahPhantom's idea of introducing innovative magical practices in the curriculum. I also like it when fics explore the nooks and crannies of Alchemy... it's a subject so obscure and hard to define because it's actually based on real practices but it involves some of the three core topics in magic, namely charms, transfigurations and potions. I am honestly not a big fan of Arithmancy because a lot of people just treat like a programming language for spell creation (probably due to the Arithmancer) but in fact it's just based on what we know as numerology. However I like it when it's actually used to predict or understand magical impact of the natural phenomena using numbers.

Edit: I would also like to see more wandlore. Not exploring obscure topics such as the sentience of wands but I would like to see people gain some knowledge of how the wood interacts with the core and how some of the aspects influence the wandmaking process.

** While I like the idea of additional classes, I can't really recall any fic adding ones where they would be interesting (basically anyone does anything interesting with fanoned-runes or arithmancy already). Taure baited us recently with some potentially interesting ones, but then had Victoria only choose Latin from the new stuff.\\
Still, for my own (fairly AU) fic, I'm doing some alterations to the Hogwarts school program.

- I'm adding metaphysics - this is basically a magical theory class (interesting note, the list of books for the first year has a generic Magical Theory textbook), but with more focus on how the world works from the wizarding perspective. It's also the only obligatory class if you decide to continue your studies into NEWTs.
- Flying is made into a class for the first two years. But you can be excused from it if you show sufficient proficiency (like we saw with Harry no longer attending it after the whole rememberball situation).
- And similarly to you, I'm adding Latin for the first two years. However, just like with Latin you can be excused, based on the test that's given at the beginning of each year. That's because children in magical families are usually taught it already.
- There is a magiozoology class again for the two years that's a prelude of sorts to CoMC, and the part of Defense that's dealing with handling dangerous creatures but this is almost purely theoretical.
- Runes get changed into glyphology and are a practical class instead of language one. Arithmancy is expanded into the full numerology.
- There is a musical class somewhere, I may make it NEWT-only and tie it to numerology, not sure yet. I'm torn between calling it harmonautics and something referencing Orpheus.
- Also NEWT only is the alchemy class that JKR mentioned on Pottermore.
- The last but not least, and kinda a key part of my AU, is yet unnamed class that's xianxia inspired, but using primarily various western esoteric techniques as an inspiration instead of Daoism like xianxia does. For those unfamiliar with xianxia, consider it a set of methods of attaining higher spiritual levels. It also touches on so beloved in fanfiction mental arts, but not occlumency per se.

** I like when wizards are learning maths, and maybe even some science, in Astronomy. It seems daft to me that wizards are completely ignorant of everything that muggles have learnt unless they do Muggle Studies.

Why not have "here is what we know about Venus thanks to divination and the tales that Merlin brought back from his tour of the solar system, here are some pretty pictures that the muggles took when they sent cameras into space, and this is the chemical composition of the atmosphere, and here are our charts of its motion through the sky and its effect on the Earth"?

When everything useful is in the electives, it stretches my disbelief. In fanfiction, too often, /not/ taking Runes and Arithmancy is basically choosing to not learn magic properly, which is silly. Didn't /Percy/ take Muggle Studies and Divination (and another one, can't remember)? He wasn't going to have sabotaged his learning by choosing duff options!

** Art, music, theater, choir (though there is a choir, there is no explanation of how it works at all LOL). Quidditch itself would be an extracurricular, but maybe some other sports or physical activities. Languages would be very interesting as well, and I feel like it could be grouped together with Ancient Runes as well, as that in itself is a whole type of language.

To me, Muggle Studies should be mandatory for at least a year. It doesn't matter how much the student insists they won't go out into the Muggle world, there's many changes in technology and innovation over the years and to not at least be aware of simple things like how money works or the common fashion can be a huge issue, especially if there could be a need for people to flee into the muggle world for some reason or another. If you go running into the public wearing a witch's hat, someone shows up and asks if anyone saw someone wearing a witch's hat, that's very noticeable.
