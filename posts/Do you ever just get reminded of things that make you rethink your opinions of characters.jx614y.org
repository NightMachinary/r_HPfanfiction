This usually happens with Snape for me. The 7th book is a blur to me. So I for example completely forgot that he tore a picture of Lilly with her family to keep the half with her smiling and her signature from her letter to Sirius. I think its supposed to show how much he liked her.

But it's just kind of creepy to me because its taking the things she never meant for him to have. Taking the affection not meant for him ( the smile was for her family and whoever took that picture. Not Snape. That signature was for Sirius. Not Snape.)

She did not want to give it to him. But he tore away the context to make it for him. And I completely forgot it happened. It really changes both how I view his character and relationship with Lilly.

What are moments like that for you guys?


** Re-reading Chamber of Secrets and the fact that Lucius Malfoy tried to get so many Muggleborn children killed, as well as Arthur Weasley's 11 year old daughter, hits differently as an adult. Don't get me wrong, I find the Malfoys to be interesting characters, but they're SO far from good it's a little mind-boggling.

And then he just... gets off scot free? Harry testifies on his behalf after the war because Narcissa saved his life? The man thought it entirely acceptable to murder children to dispose of and as retaliation for his home being searched for Dark Artifacts.

*** I mean Lucius knew it was a dark artifact that Voldemort gave to him, but did he know what it would do specifically, or was he just taking advantage of the situation. I always thought he was clueless on what it did, but hoped to get Arthur in trouble some way due to Arthur's hand in the raiding of dark artifacts. I'm not even sure if he knew that what was happening at school was his own doing, or just him taking advantage of said situation. I mean he was taking advantage whether he knew, or not, but I always felt that maybe he knew he caused the problem, but only after he'd already given the diary away.

**** Given his attitude of using the situation to get Dumbledore sacked but not even attempting to pull Draco out of school suggests he had a pretty good idea of what was going on. I think if some unknown entity was ravaging the school, even if claiming to only kill Muggleborn students, he wouldn't have wanted Draco around in case it changed its mind.

However a force that the Dark Lord personally assured him would cleanse the school of all those of non-magical parentage? I think he'd feel a lot more confident in leaving Draco in school for that. Whether he knew it was a Basilisk or not I couldn't say... I'd guess not, because it seems like that's a creature with a lot of room for error/accidental murder.

*** Oh ya I agree. I just usually headcanoned that he changed to be maybe less stalkerish overtime. Like say during his death. But this is from memories he gave Harry to show what happened but also to show how he felt and feels for her. And knowing that he tore the picture and letter and is showing those memories as a expression of his feelings in his last moments makes me think he didn't change as much as I generally assume.

Like I know Snape is supposed to be ambiguous as a character. But alot of that ambiguity came from these memories he had. These are the memories that led to Harry naming a kid after him. But honestly these kinda make him look worse. Because it was a blur to me I just assumed these memories made him look good because of the epilogue. But the more I remember or get reminded the more I rethink that assumption.

The prophecy was relayed before Harry and Neville were born. Snape didn't know that it concerned Lily or the Longbottoms. That's why he went to Dumbledore to ask him to protect them.

And if you wanna talk about murder, don't forget that Sirius and James almost got him killed. James only prevented it to save his skin and safe Remus from being sent to Askaban.

********* Ok, so, I agree with you for the most part- but the prophecy doesn't state how old the person its talking about is?\\
'Approaches' (Prophecy, first sentence)= Yeah, could be talking about birth, but could easily mean someone not nearby /approaching/ the area.\\
'Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies'= Everybody is born. Age isn't a factor here.\\
'Will be born' (Prophecy, last line)= Now, this is the point where I sat back and thought 'huh, /does/ it make it clear it's talking about someone not born yet?' But the answer is no! Looking at the context, /the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord/ is what precedes that. This means this line could be referring to someone who is already born, and even possibly old, but only develops the power to defeat Voldemort now. However, even with all that, Snape only heard and delivered the first half of the prophecy to Voldemort, so h wouldn't of even heard the 'will be born' line.

He knew Voldemort. He knew Voldemort would want to kill that baby, whoever he was. He could have shut his mouth. No one knew that he had overheard the prophecy. He had no obligtion, not even coercion to share it with Voldemort.

He only changed his mind because Lily became a target. That's it. That why he went to Dumbledore. He asked for Lily to be protected. He didn't ask for Harry and James to be protected. They were afterthgouths, at best bones for Harry protection.

We can argue that Snape was only 19, and things weren't real for him. And it's when someone he knew was targeted that he realised how bad it actually was. Like a "oh fuck, that's not a video game" kind of thing.

This, I can happily debate, and consider, and discuss.

****** Ok to start with, when people say that snape really protected Harry what exactly do they mean?

Unless I'm forgetting about something important I think the only thing sniape did that was worthy of Harry was protecting him during a Quidditch match where they wanted to kill him and give him the gryffindor sword in the seventh book

although it is true that both things are important some people act as if they had been decisive in the future of events I think that if Harry had been in danger and snape was not there dumbledore could still protect him and the gryffindor sword could have been given to Harry in other ways

Furthermore, people seem to be deliberately ignoring the fact that Harry nearly died many times throughout his entire school life and that most of those times he had to save himself or was saved by other people than snape so I think these people should receive the same recognition if not even more than snape for keeping Harry alive

And about bullying it is true that snape was abused by the marauders in his school years that I will not deny but honestly, I would not rush to call him a victim, why? because of this

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.

"...thought we were supposed to be friends?" Snape was saying, "Best friends?"

*"We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"*

*Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.*

*"That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's all--"*

*"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny--"*

Apparently, even though Snape received harassment and intimidation from the marauders, he still had a good view of his friends abusing other students even using dark magic and he categorized those actions as "just a laugh", so I honestly don't think he was exactly what people would call "innocent" other than the fact that he called all Muggleborns besides Lily Mudblood.

/Lots of love, Lily/

/Snape took the page bearing Lily's signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers/

Thats the passage he was for sure emotional and not sure if he had pictures of her definitely possible he didn't. But to me it reads as removing her and "her love" from the context she wanted it in. Which feels a bit wrong to me personally.

*********** I never said that the Marauders were saints, also jealous teenagers won't think logically, also first impression gone haywire with them between James/Sirius/Snape so there it goes. But canonically it was never explored what went down with them, yes we know the Marauders bullied him but Snape wanted to get Lupin expelled for being a werewolf (which Dumbledore knew already tho). Yes Sirius almost murdered him or turned him into a werewolf but as I said, we never heard what Snape did and how he behaved, also it is possible that he would make friends with Slytherins I mean he was part of that house and spent majority of his time with them.

***** That still seems very disturbing to me even if his intention was not to monopolize her for himself because for me the simple fact of wanting to keep her alive without considering her personal wishes tells me that snape did not have the slightest understanding of Lily's personality.

Just think about it for a moment, what if Voldemort took his promise to Snape more seriously and the moment Lily decides not to pull away he faints or paralyzes her or something and proceeds to kill Harry? Can you imagine the massive emotional and mental damage that Lily would suffer? As readers, we can feel more or less pleased by James or Harry, but Lily's position was very clear about it, for her they were her husband and son for whom she had a great love and she demonstrated it effusively in several scenes , so there are two options

snape is aware of all this and still doesn't care and his greatest wish is to keep Lily alive as a trophy or snape is unaware of this which would show how emotionally disconnected they are from each other to the point where they are probably Lily already considered snape a stranger at this time so his desire to keep her alive would be devoid of any meaning since at this point their relationship would have become completely one-sided

****** Oh I agree he was very emotionally disconnected. If he really understood what she valued, he would have never joined Voldemort or called her that nasty word. She was absolutely right to enforce her boundaries and cut ties with him when she did, because he was heading down a very bad path.

I just never read his pleas with Voldemort as wanting to save her as a trophy or anything. Just that he did still genuinely care for his childhood friend and didn't want her to die. He didn't care about the guy who bullied him, and either didn't care about Harry or didn't think he could convince Voldemort to not kill who Volds believed was the literal child of prophesy destined to kill him, so Snape tried to settle for convincing Voldemort to spare the mother who was just a bystander from Voldemort's point of view.

I also don't think someone whose feelings were simply possessive/obsessive would have experienced the change in patronus that Snape did. To me that's evidence that regardless of how well he understood her, he did care as much as he had capacity for at that point in his life.

Even if Lily had survived and stayed cut off from Snape/hated his guts forever/whatever I don't agree that keeping her alive would have no meaning for him. To him it would mean that she hadn't been murdered. I don't know if you have ever lost a friend to murder. It's the kind of awful I can't really articulate in words. And maybe having experienced that, allows me to sympathize with Snape just wanting her to not be dead.

And actually, that may have been what allowed Lily's ancient love protection stuff to save Harry. Voldemort did tell her to stand aside several times. Lily could have made the choice to live through the attack. She refused and /chose/ to die to protect Harry. If Voldemort had just come in with intent to kill all the Potters and took her out immediately, I don't think her death would have given Harry any magical protection.

Also, I find the idea that potential emotional pain makes someone's life not worth saving highly disturbing. I've lived through some pretty horrifying things. There have been moments I wish I hadn't, but most days I'm glad to be alive. I'm glad that someone intervened after a really traumatic assault and saved my life. They didn't look at my broken person and say, "welp, this one's too broken and is going to suffer too much after this. Might as well let her die." Lots of people in the world have lost children, spouses, other close family members, endured genocides, terrible abuse, and that doesn't make their lives worth less, or less worth living. Yes Lily would have certainly suffered, but she was written as a strong willed and resilient woman who would gone on to live her best life somehow. People who survive have the chance to heal from their trauma too.

******* I really think it's a matter of opinion and perspective

I have also seen people lose family friends, spouses, etc. and the truth is that in the cases that I have seen many times, the situation has ended in depressions at extreme levels and with psychological and even physical emotional exhaustion (I have seriously seen people go through from being young brimming with life to aging 10 years or more in a few months and believe me I'm not exaggerating)

I have also of course seen people recover from these situations but a pattern that I have noticed in people who manage to overcome depression is that they had something to lean on, for example a person who had lost his spouse who had small children and although it was noticeable who had not gotten over his loss was recovered thanks to his sense of responsibility and love for his children and knowing what they needed from their father when they had already lost their mother or people who rely on their parents or their brothers and things like that

But in Lily's case I don't think she would have that motivational lever that would give her the strength to get out of depression (at least not a positive one) What we know about her is that her parents are dead before that night in which she and James They were attacked by Voldemort we also know that her sister hated her to the point of pretending she had no sister and from the letter she sent to Sirius and Alastor Moody's stories about the Order of the Phoenix we know that the Death Eaters were massacring the companions and / or friends of Lily not to mention that in this hypothetical scenario the war would continue as cruel as ever since Voldemort has not been defeated

So I think Lily's motivation to get ahead would probably become personal revenge against Voldemort and most likely against snape if she ever finds out about his involvement in all this

I also agree with you that snape's feelings for Lily were more than just an obsession for her and that since we have both agreed, his biggest problem was not understanding Lily's personality or emotions, but still again I think which is something of perspective because I do not think it is a bad thing to try to keep someone you love alive but as I have already told you before, I have met people in depressive situations due to having lost a loved one and it is really sad and exhausting to see them die slowly because that's what they're doing

I think that in the end, snape would regret his wish because I think that the course that Lily would take from this traumatic event would be something very sad and heartbreaking for all those who love her. whether she is filled with hatred or gradually wears out. (like winky and trelawney who got drunk)

I could see her and Sirius finding solace/comfort in each other either as platonic friends or maybe it becoming something more. Sirius would feel terribly guilty for convincing James to use Peter as secret keeper, and he definitely wouldn't abandon Lily to wallow in loneliness and grief after the fact. At that point they'd actually have a lot in common, with both of their families either estranged or dead. Maybe they'd team up to kill Peter and try to take down Voldemort. Or maybe Lily would talk Sirius down from doing something rash.

**** I can't I don't think James is so fucking vague in the books.

Like you know he bullied Snape in that memory but you don't know if it was one-sided or a back and forth like what Sirius and Lupin say. Was this just exceptionally one sided? Was it ever the other way around with one Marauder vs Snape + friends? You got no idea.

You know he disliked dark magic, people biased against muggleborns and was not fond of Slytherin tho not how intense any of it was.

You know Lilly didn't like him for a while but then did but you don't know what changed.

You know he saved Snape from like Lupin but you don't know why ( was it he didn't want Snape to be killed? Was it he didn't want Lupin to get in trouble?)

You he was pretty rich and well off and was smart and had good grades and was innovative.

And you know his last moments.

But that leaves like alot of ambiguity and alot of different ways to interpret and characterize him from mostly awful to mostly great and still be cannonically accurate.

I guess I the most that could happen is for there to be a super good or super evil depiction of James and I'd say that can't be canon and then realize shit it could be from what little you know.

In all fairness Lilly is in the same boat. Limited moments and all like speaking lines she gets are from memories of someone who is pretty biased towards her. If she had major character flaws you won't be seeing them in the memories Snape gives to Harry. But like...well at least you get more memories.

But to be clear we don't know

if they did this alot,

or If it was always this one sided on either end.

If this scene came after scenes where Snape + friends teamed up and did something similar to say Sirius then this scene would read very differently.

And there's no way to really say for sure either way . Lupin says it was more a back and forth but maybe he was trying to save face or maybe it was the truth.

Levicorpus is way less dangerous than sectumsempra which Snape does attack James with I assumed since he got that cut when Snape attacked. Or at the very least he used something that drew blood. But it would now be unfair to say Snape was more murderous based on that one scene.

It out of context and we know so little bout James that we can't really make a good judgement either way.

it pretty down to how you feel about James based on nothing but intuition.

My personal headcanon was that it was more of a back and forth. The Marauders had been ganged up on Snape and his friends just as much. Both saw the other as monsters. Marauders I do think hated him and felt justified hating them for being wannabe wizard Nazis because you find out that Snape + friends being considered that wasn't really a secret.

*********** You last paragraph make me things that James was Draco with Gryffindor values.

They're two side of the same coins. Both are only child adored by their parents, coming from a rich pureblood family.

Both are arrogant, brillant, and popular among their house, and supported by their friends.

Both are good at Quidditch and like to show it. (Draco does buy his place on Slytherins Quidditch team, but Harry notices that Draco know how to fly).

Both are pretty prejudiced and enjoy tourmating who they are prejudiced again and think are lesser than them.

And both took a level in maturity in their last two years in Hogwarts. And both seems to stop harrassing other students and fooling around, and started to focuse on their choosen missions.

Likely because they both discovered that the real world is harsh. Draco throught Voldemort's punishment, and seeing first hand the reality of being a Death Eaters.

I believe James was when Sirius ran from home, and likely explained more about his parents and his family. Or it was because he was at the age when you notice a bit more the outside world and what is going on there. Or something else happened, maybe someone close to his family got killed by Death Eaters. We don't know what happened, but something happened.

Key differences are that Draco is on the Dark side, so he is prejudiced against not pure-bloods, and would merely attack them. James is prejudiced against Slytherins, and would attack them.

There's also the fact that Draco hate people for what they are, and James for what they believe in.

Which make a big differences in how one would view James, since as you said it feels more justified to attack people who are nazis than people from a minority.

But in the end, My headcanon is that Draco and James were the same kind of kids and early teenagers, with opposite values and views.

But they relate so strongly to that aspect that they want to dismiss the flaws Snape has. The bigotry the support of genocide the creepy stalker thing he has of Lilly.

And if you haven't been on the receiving ends of that sort of thing but you have been on the receiving end of person who acts a bit like James then its easier I think to emphasize how bad what James did was but dismiss what Snape did more. It I think more a universal feeling. You know the people who are kinda douchey the James was in that scene. And you probably don't know many who did similar things to Snape.

But Snape joined a hategroup to start a genocide. He did so as a adult the bullying did not make him join that group. He was supportive of that group despite the fact that his friend who he claimed to love was a muggleborn who would be a target for that hate group's ideology. And he continued to be actively supportive of that hategroup as a adult. He didn't even switch sides because he stopped believing what they did.

So James was flawed but from what little you know of him he didn't do anything near as bad as Snape. You also know he was 15 then there was time to change. Most adults are way different than when they were 15 and you only get one memory so its hard to really say what he was like. Snape you have several memories and actually get to know him during his time at hogwarts so there much less ambiguity here.

Though to be fair Snape was a cruel teacher/authority figure in a way that is maybe more universal. You might have had teachers who feel a bit like that. So its not as if his brand of awfulness is always one that you aren't as used to. Which is more true for say Bellatrix or Voldemort. Which is why you might end up hating Umbridge way more than say Voldemort even though Voldemort has done worse things.

But for Snape though I think its overshadowed by how awful Umbridge was in book 5. In book 6 you are preoccupied by other things way more so Snapes behavior may not stand out as much. Plus after Umbridge it might not feel as bad. Finally in book 7 you aren't in school. So alot of the awful aspects of Snape that feel more grounded in experiences you've personally had ( the asshole teacher) Is less a part of the story in the last 3 books. I think that had a impact too.

***** What squicks me out about James is how in Snape's worst memory, he was literally holding the physical wellbeing of Lily's male friend hostage to try and coerce her into a date with him.

When Lily refused, James threatened her physical safety. Like he threatened to hex her for not agreeing to go on a date.

Then when Snape said that gross slur and she left, it's heavily implied James took off his underwear in front of the school, which however you want to spin it is a sexual assault.

What Harry saw in that memory affected him so deeply he worried that his dad had coerced Lily in marrying him. That's pretty freaking terrible. I wish we saw more of how James had grown and changed as a person because it would have had to be pretty freakin' dramatic to come back from that and become a decent adult.

/'I will if you go out with me, Evans,' said James quickly. 'Go on ... go out with me and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.'/

Which she of course refuses .

/'I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,' said Lily./

I would say it wasn't that serious a deal given Sirius's reaction but thats kinda up to interpretation. Suggesting it at all is pretty fucked up though.

'/Bad luck, Prongs,' said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape./

But that's not why James threatens to hex her.

The spell on Snape wears off so he attacks Janes with a spell (which I always assumed was sectumsempra).

/But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood./

So then James puts back up with Levicorpus. Lilly demands Snape be put down. James does then Sirius puts him under another spell.

/James whirled about: a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants./

/Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter./

/Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, 'Let him down!'/

/'Certainly,' said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, 'Petrificus Totalus!' and Snape keeled over again, rigid as a board./

Lilly who has had enough probably at this point pulls out her own wand. Its at that point James threatens to her her completely unrelated to the date which at this point is off the table completely forgotten.

/'LEAVE HIM ALONE!' Lily shouted. She had her own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily./

/'Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,' said James earnestly./

/'Take the curse off him, then!'/

/James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse./

At which point Snape uses the slur and ruins their friendship forever.

/'I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!'/

/Lily blinked./

/'Fine,' she said coolly. 'I won't bother in future. And I'd wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.'/

And as Lilly is leaving you hear James threatening to take his pants off.

So yes to trying to leverage Snape against her for a date. No for trying to hex her to make her date him.

Now I'm not suggesting here that James's actions are ok. But I really need context for them. Is this the norm for him? Was this the worst thing he ever did? Was it always like this one sided? Or did Snape and friends harass the Marauders in the same way or similar ways? Did James get better?

Lupin suggested he and Snape never stopped really throwing spells at each other but was it all like this or did it tone down to more minor?

I need a bit more to get what he was like.

Very honestly James could have done alot of things and depending on what he did, why he did it, and what changed about him I'd have different opinions about him. Theres alot of directions he could go within the constraints of what little you know. People change alot teens change alot. The people I know now who I knew in high-school are nothing like what they were in high-school. They might as well be a different person. I'd need more info more context to figure out James.

But you don't really get that context. You don't even get a general idea or trend like with Snapes memories which can get you a better idea of both Snape and Lilly.

This one is just one memory. And everything else? What you would need more of to get an actual idea of who James Potter was when he died? Or even who he was in school after that point? Its just whatever you would prefer because you have no real context. So even as bad as this memory is id say not it not really enough to figure him out he's too vague a character in canon. I wish I saw more of him in book canon too.

But we do see from Snape's memories that James Potter was a bully though.

And memories are far better since they are actual proof, they showed what occured.

James Potter might have treated people he knew and who were "gryffindor" much better than he treated others. That's why we hear such good things about him from Hagrid.

But that doesn't excuse the fact that he was a bully. And the whomping willow incident, he just did that to save his skin and to protect his friends.

No idea its all very up to interpretation. And how you interpret will drastically change the characterization but still works in canon because of how little you know about James

The he just did it to protect his friends is certainly a interpretation and def the one Snape believes but you lack the info to know how right or wrong he is.

***** Nah fam this isn't it. There is literally no proof of that in the books. The only piece of James we actively see is from his school rival (who, by the way, wasn't some cowering flower. Canon explicitly says he gave back as good as he got), which shows him in the worst light possible. Contrast this to the vast amount of beloved characters who talk about all his good qualities.

The whole thing about Lily being “the one thing his lineage or parents couldn't give him” is just nonsense. There's nothing in the books or canon to support that. What canon DOES show is that James grew up and matured enough to become Head Boy and form a genuine relationship with Lily built of mutual respect.

Him going to Dumbledore to save her but not caring about her family

Him being sorry for calling her a mudblood cuz it a bad word but not sorry for being supportive of a group/movement/people that wanna slaughter muggleborns.

It just repeatedly is a demonstration of him not giving a shit for her beyond his feelings towards her. What matters is his feelings not her. His interest, his pain, his desires, not hers.

Him liking her matters she doesn't matter. Not to Snape. If it did the death eaters being a threat to muggleborns would matter. Trying to keep the family she cared about safe would matter. Her being happy with people who weren't him and seeing that would matter and be tolerated. But it didn't because in his eyes she didn't matter. His feelings did.

Maybe James was the same you don't really know you didn't get to see enough of him. But there is more room for doubt for James. Snape? these moments you get exist to demonstrate that he loved her. And you just repeatedly see him prioritizing his feelings not her.

That's now changed to Hermione has her moments, but is overall an average, if intelligent character. Ron is a child, and is allowed some leeway, but reminds me a little too much of Peter Pettergrew. Leeway is fine, abandoning your friends while trying to save the bloody world is straight betrayal. Some argue that the Horcrux lead to that, but it seems Hermione was doing well enough(I never include Harry in will power comparisons. If he can take a mind control on the level of an unforgivable from a wizard who's considered the most powerful dark lord ever(at least of the last 100, or so years), and win, yeah, he's an outlier.)

Harry still deserves all the power, and love he wants. The kid had it rough, and shit didn't get easier for him as a Wizard. All that pressure, near death (and even an actual death) situations, Rita, and the press in general. After 17 years of the crap. Give him everything he wants in stories.

***** Hey, hey, hey! Let's not forget Pettegrew. Pettergrew, and Umbridge share 1st place as my most hated HP characters. Voldemort in Second, Fudge, and Dumbledore in third. Before anyone starts, I don't believe even the saviour of the world should be treated the way he was as a child just so he was moldable enough to be suicidal. Dumbledore had a hand in that, and from his wording, knew what he was doing. I don't give a rats ass to all you Dumbledore supporters, but putting a child through that has zero justification in my book. Especially when prophecy is involved.

Prophecy in stories is one of three things for me. Unavoidable, it will happen no matter what.

It's avoidable, meaning you can go against it, and change it.

Lastly, the meaning is not clear. Using HP as an example, the wording could mean that the prophecy already happened at Godric's Hollow. Voldemort marked him as his equal, and in doing so "died," or at least didn't survive technically speaking. He could not eat, breathe, or drink. He was dead. It could also mean that live meant enjoying life in general. Until the Battle Of Hogwarts, they were both only surviving, but not living.

No matter which version of prophecy is the correct in HP, a child does not deserve to go through that at the whims of an old man believing he know best. Yes everything worked out in the end, but there is no justification in my mind that says what Dumbledore did was right.

And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!" which is a valid argument. They are, after all, Muggles. It also implies that Dudley is spoilt, not that the family is abusive. I can understand her concern about not wanting the hero of the wizarding world to grow up like that.

I think it's important to remember that, for all their similarities, "Magical Britain" is different from "Muggle UK" and follow different rules. According from what we saw in Canon, the Ministry of Magic, when it is not in the middle of a war, or run by a paranoid Minister, seems to follow a pretty "hand-off" approach with anything not putting the Statute of Secrecy at risk. We don't know what kind of protocoles they follow when putting a child in Foster care, and I'm not even sure they have any (they seem to just let a family member take care of a child without needing any kind of previous approval, like Neville).

Concerning Harry situation, I think it is also important to consider the following points:

- The Ministry always knew where Harry lived, and approved the situation (as said by Fudge when he met Harry at the start of PoA).
- While Harry knew that Harry would have a "difficult" childhood, and explained at the end of OotP that Harry confort was the least of his concern. His objective was to have Harry "safe" until he is old enough to go to Hogwarts. We can argue all we want about his choices, but at least Harry reached the school alive, and pretty well adjusted (which was far from ensured with other options). Harry could have grow up to be extremely arrogant (like his brother in most WBWL stories), paranoid (Moody Jr) and just suffer in "accident" during his childhood.
- While the Dursleys treatment of Harry was "morally" wrong, it was "legally" pretty acceptable. Judging how child service usually work, and the standards of the 1980's, I think only the "sleep in the cupboard while there are bedrooms available" would pose problem. And even there, I doubt it would be enough to "move" Harry from the House (they usually try to not move the child unless his "safety" is truly at risk) for several reasons). It's not like Harry was daily beaten up (at least by the adults), or treated as a slave (his "chores" seen in Canon are either an exceptionnal occurence of a punishment). If anything, the Dursley seemed quite happy to ignore Harry (unless he made something "freaky", where he was punished). *

​

Dumbledore made a lot of discutable decisions (though I'm convinced his heart was always in the right place), but I think this one was one of the most easily justifiable ones.

***** I agree, people take that comment about "I knew you were going to suffer a dark and difficult 10 years" too far imo, especially when he followed it up with "I saw you weren't as happy or healthy as I would have liked, but you were alive" I think shows that Dumbledore wanted him to be happy and healthy, but honestly was just content with him being alive. I mean, let's be real, the Longbottoms were attacked shortly after by Death Eaters looking for their master. If Harry was placed with a wizarding family you know that would have been publicized all over the place, making him a lot easier to find. Additionally, while the actual transfer was handled a bit shadily (that's not how orphan placement really works) blood relations have priority in terms of claim(in reality there should have suitability checks done to make sure the place was appropriate and all that) but in the end they were his family, he was safely hidden away from the wizarding world, and while his childhood was abysmal, he was still able to come out of it alive and whole in the end. NOT JUSTIFYING HIS TREATMENT AT ALL, but making the best of a horrible situation isn't evil or manipulative

*** My belief of Dumbledore since I first read the books has been that he's an old man with too many memories, too much knowledge, and too many responsibilities. Think of all of the titles he holds! That's got to give him some kind of job outside of being headmaster, right? He is placed into the position of dead eating Voldemort (and I can't really remember if we were even ever given a reason as to why it was him and not some kind of legal team? Just because he was a strong wizard I guess?) and that means that of all people he has the most knowledge on the big murder man.

Dumbledore knowing Harry is the prophesy child is a whole deal, though, and can be pulled so many ways.

‘He should have told Harry!' As an 11 year old would you be emotionally mature enough to hear you'd have to fight the MURDERER OF YOUR DEAD PARENTS to the death - not being able to be 10000% sure as to who would win - and that that is your soul destiny? And that that man would continue to live until you do? I don't think any child would! And even if you the try to argue ‘well he could wait until Harry was older'... that's exactly what Dumbledore did. Dumbledore waited until the last possible moment he could tell Harry, but is that better? What time do you tell a child that their destiny is to murder a man or be murdered by him?

‘Harry proved he was strong in the first year, so Dumbledore can't be blamed for relying on him!' Isn't that suspicious as it is? An 11 year old boy (with two other 11 year olds) managed to get through what is basically an obstacle course based off of their personal knowledge and ‘luck'. What does that say about those defences? They were meant to protect the object that could RESURRECT THE DARK LORD and a group of children got through them. I mean, first year level knowledge was enough to make their way through in enough time to get to the end before Quirrell even unwrapped his turban so Voldemort could see. That's either Dumbledore being obnoxiously naïve or some kind of manipulative. Who's to say they weren't all things that Harry & co. had just learnt that year or could figure out easily on purpose? Like some kind of warped training where your prize is murder and a house cup? Who's to say it wasn't a total misunderstanding and Dumbledore was thinking about a wraith, not a corporeal person, and thus couldn't properly prepare? The brooms. Multiple brooms were left in the key room. Preparing for multiple people meant Dumbledore was EXPECTING there to be more than just one person going through the course. Couple this with the fact the potions only had enough for one to turn back and one to go forward? It's almost as though he knew Harry was investigating and didn't stop him...

OH WAIT

HE DID

Hagrid knew that the kids knew about the Cerberus. He knew the kids knew what was in the chamber. He knew that the kids knew why it was there. Most importantly, he knew they wanted to do something about it. You think he wouldn't have told Dumbledore that? That's crucial information!

Besides, getting through a crash course at age 11 is NOT reason to then trust that child to recover dark magical artefacts and destroy them for you. I get that Dumbledore died, but he easily could have passed that information onto a trusted adult and not Harry. It's wrong that he used that point as a pivot.

Except he didn't do that, really. He took five years of Harry getting into shit and getting himself out of it into thought. Now, that doesn't excuse reckless child endanger whatsoever, but it does help us to see that as an old man with little time and even fewer options Harry may seem as a good opportunity. Besides... it's his destiny to defeat Voldemort, right? Couldn't that mean he had to deal with the horcruxes too?

I don't know I have so many opinions on this and could talk about it all day. Sorry for the HELLA LONG rant haha

** Notice: major speculation and interpretation/extrapolation/opinion ahead.

I adore Snape the character but not necessarily the person. That move to rip and steal the picture did feel wrong. However, I looked at the circumstances of the time. He was deep undercover as a spy, had to watch his every thought around Voldemort, and was hired into a position (Headmaster) where he had no allies and would be universally despised. He had to act the part.

The picture gave him a small token to hold on to when everything was crumbling around him. It reminded him of who he was fighting for and why. Yeah, it sucked that he ripped the picture and took it from Sirius and Harry. Yeah, it was creepy. But under the circumstances, I can get it.

I do think that Snape was rather obsessed/infatuated with Lily. She was one of the few people who were genuinely kind to him. I think he could have outgrown it if given the chance to move on with his life, but his oath to Dumbledore kept him chained to Lily's memory and his mistakes.

I had hoped that the book 7 ‘love interest' for Snape would lead to major character growth. The interest in Lily was a fascinating plot twist, but I was let down that Snape didn't get to experience real love and grow from it. He died without knowing true love.

The guy really rolled a 0 on life happiness. By signing up to do Dumbledore's bidding, he really gave away all autonomy and never got to pursue anything for himself, or anyone. Shit, he didn't even get to see Voldemort die and know it was all worth it.

Nor did Dumbledore explain to Snape that, after being killed, Harry would/might return back to life because of the horcrux. I wish Dumbledore had told Snape that, because it seemed that Snape thought Harry would die *and* Voldemort, not that Harry would die but then return.

*** Honestly though, I'm kinda in the Dumbledore camp when he says this "It is our actions that define us", yeah Snape had a shitty life, and yeah Lily was the kindness he latched onto, but he chose to do the things he did, fully and willingly. That picture being a small token to hold onto I read as more of a moment of spite, if he can't have her then he doesn't want her family to have her. As for the spy thing...Voldemort was using Snape as a spy same as Dumbledore, so having to play the part of the vicious evil bastard doesn't really make sense...if I send a spy into enemy territory, I don't want them acting like they never reformed as a death eater...I want them to act like they are on the side they're spying on. It never made sense to me when people said that his abuse was playing a part to trick Voldemort when, if I was Voldemort, I'd be incredibly pissed that my spy was apparently blowing their cover. Not only that but Dumbledore was pretty much the only person who trusted Snape, and while that would get him a lot of information, imagine how much more information would be available to him if other people saw him as someone to confide in. In the end, yeah Snape was on the right side of the conflict, but even in his last moments he was an obsessive stalker, I mean his last words were to tell Harry to look at him and then make a comment about her eyes. Even in his last moments all he cared about was Lily, which can be romantic, but in the context of all his other actions is just kinda creepy

How he doesn't see a problem joining a group that wants to wipe out muggleborns despite the fact she is one.

His focus is always is always his connection to her not her.

4) There's nothing that indicates that they thought he was trapped between cabinets and not just lost wherever the other cabinet happened to be.

** Less a specific person but re-reading the books.. Hogwarts is such a shitty school... Even if we ignore all the Voldemort stuff

Shitty and/or abusive teachers: - Snape - abusive, hates children ect - Hagrid - incompetent, unqualified - Binns - just no - Trelawney - bad with children, fraud? - Lupin - confronting 13 year olds with the worst fears is not ok. - Lockhart.. just why - Unbridge - abusive, hates children - Moody - traumatizing - Quirrel - incompetent

Teacher to student ratio.. According to JKR there a 1000, but if you do math with the students we know in the book there are 280. According to hp.lexicon there are fourteen teachers at Hogwarts with possibly 4 non academic staff members so 18 adults total. 18/1000 is a ridiculous ratio so I won't even talk about it 280/18 is a bit better.

There is a document called the boarding school national minimum standards for the UK. Hogwarts breaks most of the requirements.. - no dedicated student support staff: all boarding schools have some sort of house master or matron whos entire job is to take care of students. The heads of houses don't count because they already have full time jobs teaching - disability accomodations.. don't even get me started - going home for only the summer and Christmas holidays is not realistic.. usually there would at least be half terms and Easter break. - of the 18 adults.. many can't be relied upon to support children eg defense professor, filch, trelawney, Hagrid, Snape. - professors are not qualified to teach children. In the UK you don't just need to know about a subject you also need to learn loads about how to teach children.. there is no way Hagrid, Snape, Trelawney, Lockhart, Unbridge are qualified. - headmaster and deputy head are full time jobs. But Dumbledore is chief warlock of the wizengamot, supreme mugwump AND runs a vigilante organization on the size. McGonagall teaches and is also deputy head and head of house. Those are 3 full time jobs.

I haven't even talked about how Hogwarts runs on Slavery and all the crap that happens there to Harry.

TL:DR ofstead would have shut down Hogwarts pretty much as soon as they arrived.

I mean it can really unearth something you really don't want to experience but let's be real, that's the extreme. Most children that age has minor fears and the class teaches them a defense against one of the worst possible monster they can encounter early on.

** Some people think that because in the last movie Snape confess the truth that he's good. Now people can have their opinion, but I personally think that scene just shows how selfish and obsessive Snape was. Snape never has any affection towards harry. He only care about himself, not Lily like he says, if he cared about Lily he wouldn't give voldy the prophecy, if voldy brought Snape the brain dead body of Lily, he probably would be fine. Snape till his last breath was filled with anger, anger for James and his bullying, anger that he let Lily go, anger that Lily loved his enemy, James, and anger towards himself that he's the reason Lily died. Harry was just the eye of his love in the face of his nemesis, constantly taunting him on his biggest loss.

** It's been so long since I've read the book that I couldn't tell you, but I just wanted to react to what you said about Snape.

I found the whole Snape loved Lily to be really creepy, not because the guy loved his best friend (I've been in this situation when I was a teenager) but because of his attitude overall.

When he discovered that the prophecy might have referred to Lily, he asked Voldemort to spare her and Dumbledore to save only her (at least at first). He couldn't ask Voldemort to spare James and Harry, but he could have asked Dumbledore to protect them all. He didn't care if her husband and son died, and what it would do to her. The only reason he eventually caved and asked for James and Harry's protection is because Dumbledore mentioned them (if I remember correctly).

And then even though he swore to protect Harry, the guy decided to bully the eleven YO son of the woman he loved just because he looked like James the second he stepped in to the castle. I mean, I can understand why it would be painful to look at Harry, but how petty do you have to be to treat a defenceless kid like that? Even more so when you are indirectly responsible for the kid's parents death and you owed his father a life debt (which are a real thing since Wormtail died by betraying one [at least in the movie]).

Tbh, Snape seemed more obsessed with Lily than in love with her. And it's even more pathetic when you know that Lily stopped being friend with him at least 5 years before her death. So it's not as if he couldn't have moved on long before her death.

*** I agree completely.

The passage in question by the way

/The prophecy did not refer to a woman," said Dumbledore. "It spoke of a boy born at the end of July--"/

/"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down-- kill them all--"/

/"If she means so much to you," said Dumbledore, "surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?"/

/"I have-- I have asked him--"/

/"You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, "You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?"/

/Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore./

/"Hide them all, then," he croaked. "Keep her-- them-- safe. Please."/

So ya he really doesn't care as long as Lilly lives. He doesn't deny anything Dumbledore says. It just seems to be the easier way for Dumbledore to hide Lilly if Dumbledore hid the family. But he didn't care about the family and how much she cared for them. If he did he'd realize than no Voldemort was going to target the kid no matter what and go to Dumbledore right then. Instead he goes to Voldemort to spare the mother and didn't even bother trying to save the family she cared about.

So I'm convinced he only cared that he had feelings for her. He didn't care about her beyond that.

****** It could very well have been so. I remember way back in middle school when there was a black girl in class and the others would collectively make fun of her braids and call them worms, alongside more harmful stuff such as commenting on her skin colour being the colour of soot and street tar. This was the least of what they said but likening hair to worms was almost always accompanied by bashing her for her skin colour. Contrast that to when the other girls (I don't live in white countries so the general populace isn't white) did braids and everybody fawned over them.

That was some of the more messed up stuff happening in my class. I used to live in a country where princesses from tribes and whatnot still exist so many, many people were paranoid over offending the royalty girl in class, who was a full blown racist.

Molly was a mother-hen for sure but consider that she has a big family that wants to fight and she lost her brothers the same day that leaves a big wound in your soul. Ginny was a bit stalkerish but when she grew out of it she was great. Ron is one of my favorite because he was a flawed human being.

** With regards to that, as awful as Snape was, he didn't want Harry to die, yet he had to be the one to give the boy the news. Also he was about to enter in a place where most people hated him despite having been his colleagues (and maybe friends?) for years. So I think it's fair he had with him a reminder of why he was doing all that.

As for my opinion regarding characters... I know I brought this up quite a lot recently but I had just re-read the series and I remembered how nasty Harry was towards Hermione, even if he didn't always show it. In GoF, when he fights with Ron, he actually thinks that he much more prefers Ron's company than hers. In OotP she is always the target of his outbursts. In HBP he is extremely annoyed with her nagging and is really grateful when Ginny calls her out. In DH he is annoyed with her for being a shitty cook, for crying over Ron, for destroying his wand (even though it was an accident while she was trying to save him), for not talking to Ron and for not believing in the Hallows. While I had forgotten this, now I can no longer help myself but wonder how can most fanfic writers make her best friends with Harry without Ron there. He might have been bickering with her a lot but he always stood up for her, while Harry always chose Ron over her and other than some significant points, he was pretty shitty to her.

*** Yes! I think Harry learned to appreciate Hermione but I hate it when in fics people make them BFFs without Ron because that isn't their dynamic. There's a reason they're a trio, and the point of all of their fights is to show that without one of them it wouldn't work. Ron is the emotional heart of the trio- the argument that Harry holds Ron and Hermione together isn't true, because a) Ron and Hermione spend a /ton/ of time together without Harry, and b) Without Ron, who actually is the glue, Harry and Hermione can be awkward. This isn't to say that they don't love each other, they do, their love is like sibling love, and it's great, but without Ron, Harry can be very mean to Hermione.

*** I mean in fairness it pretty accurate to generally how teens behave i don't think Harry is uniquely a dick but your average teenager is dickish.

That being said the reason I think people ship them more in fic is because they remember the movies more.

The movies don't have Harry's inner monologue. And less than nice thing he has to say about Hermione he generally doesn't keeps it to himself so in the movies you hear nothing and so it seems their relationship is less chaotic. Ron and Hermione actually seem to get along better Ron is like the glue he gets along great with Harry too. Harry and Hermione like each other but they not used to hanging out with Ron. But Ron has the most dramatic fights with both friends. And its I think that dramatic because they usually get along decently enough so its very disruptive. Especially the Harry Ron one which feels even more intense because Harry your pov character.

*** I personally liked Harry a lot in both OotP and DH not because he treats his friends badly but because in my opinion for the first time in the series Harry behaves in a "normal" way

I mean Harry has been someone who has had a shitty childhood where he has been neglected and mistreated all his life by his tutors And when it seems that things are going to improve since he can go to a school where he can stay most of the year without having to go home turns out that there is a crazy psychopath who wants to kill him and tries several times throughout his school life in addition to discovering the truth about what happened to his parents who, in addition to being killed by the crazy psychopath who now wants to killing him were also betrayed by 1 of their best friends who blamed another of their friends who was supposed to have been Harry's real tutor

And yet despite all this accumulation of events and chaotic emotions in Harry's mind he turned out to be someone very adapted with few consequences from his childhood for example 1 could attribute Harry's lack of confidence in adults and sometimes in himself and in his own abilities as a result of the dursleys' mistreatment of him

but in general Harry is someone that the first books seemed too unreal to me that he was so emotionally and mentally stable that is why I like the change that we started to see in OotP where he finally broke down emotionally and lets out all the frustration, anger and sadness that It has been accumulating in him for a long time, Harry in this book begins to behave like someone with post-traumatic stress which makes all the sense in the world because he has literally just gone through a horrible trauma just last summer he has seen his schoolmate die that although he was not his friend, he was a person who liked him so that later the government refuses to listen to his statements and on top of that they use the press to manipulate public opinion against him and make him look like a liar and a madman to top it off, he has to go home that he hates so much but this time also with the paranoia of not knowing what Voldemort is doing and even fears that they will attack him (remember how quickly he reacted when I hear the magician who was looking after him disappear) he maintains correspondence with his friends who reveal absolutely nothing to him and keep him in ignorance like everyone else and to put the cherry on the cake a couple of dementors attack him and almost make him They kiss him and his cousin and when he uses magic in self-defense the useless Government tries to expel him from the school by subjecting him to a trial and they try to remove the only tool that provides him with some security (his wand) So it does not surprise me that Harry for the first time once in his life he breaks up and behaves in a mean way with the most even if they are his friends

And what happens in DH is the same, I understand Hermione is sad because ron left but I agree with Harry that this was not the best time to collapse, especially because there is a group of crazy people who are trying to hunt them down and what if they got to catch it, they would most likely die
