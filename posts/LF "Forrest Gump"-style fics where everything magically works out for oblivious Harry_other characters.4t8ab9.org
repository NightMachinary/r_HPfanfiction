  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** Not as strong as the others, but this is basically the premise of Harry Potter: Coming Out On Top. linkffn(10086764)

I note that it had already been mentioned that Make A Wish has sequels - note that many of the sequels are by other authors (some, but apparently not all, of the sequels are listed in the Black INK community).

  Harry Potter gets the short end of the stick, I think we can all agree. But what if, in a strange twist of fate, every time Harry James Potter met adverse circumstance he always ended out on top? Bad things always happen to the hero, but in this case the hero rides these events to the top. Very WIP, not a serious fic.

**** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Black-INK/71873/][Black INK community]] has a few, though not all (they notably do not seem to have Terminal Justice).

IMHO Terminal Justice is one of the best, so let's check if the bot can find it? linkffn(Terminal Justice)

EDIT: the bot found it, and apparently the reason it is not in the community is because it was deleted and reuploaded recently.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.
