I'm looking for stories where and older Harry is in a romantic relationship with a younger woman.


** How much older do you want Harry? Harry/Ginny and Harry/Luna are both Older Harry/Younger Girl. Maybe a reverse Harry/Tonks where he's 6-7 years older? Maybe "old enough to be her dad"? Older?

******* I looked at the Potter wiki and it lists Babrielle's birthdate at 1986 (Harry's is 1980) so if we're looking at the Hogwarts years, it gets squicky to have him be in a relationship with her without aging her up.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

***** I would put Harry at 28-30 years old since James is around 8 years old. It's true that Harry seems much older though, possibly due to the hardship he's gone through.

  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
