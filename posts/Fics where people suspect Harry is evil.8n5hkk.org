** I'm still here linkffn(9704180): Time travel fic where post canon bitter and ruthless Harry travels to alternate GOF world with femHarry! With some unexpected help, Harry enters Hogwarts under a famous pseudonym. Due to certain events Dumbledore thinks Harry could be Voldemort's son and is following in his father's footsteps. Full of typical HP fic tropes, but there is a good spin on the "Harry is a Lord" and "Harry has a special power" tropes. I find the side characters are the strongest part of the story. Story also needs an editor as it often repeats expository information, but the author notes mention that the story is cowritten and there was a co-author change.

The author mentioned that they weren't sure which way they were going for the romantic subplot so the multiple developing plots are very one-sided. There is some one-sided Daphne/Harry in the story so far, and I don't know how stringent you are about the mentioned pairing condition.

*** In defense of the public in canon, I ask the following questions.

What is more believable: Harry, a known parselmouth with a history involving the only other parselmouth, is the heir of slytherin, or that a diary containing a hunk of dark wizard soul was possessing a little girl to unleash a tree-sized snake?

What is more believable: that Harry cheated to enter the Triwizard Tournament, or that a death eater impersonated a former auror as the DADA teacher in order to put his name into the goblet?

What is more believable: Harry is crazy and made up a story about how Cedric died for some reason, or he was part of a year long ridiculous plan to kidnap him as part of the Voldemort rebirth soup?

We know Harry is telling the truth, but from the outside? There are literally dozens of simpler and often better explanations for these things than what actually happens. Someone once said extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

If I'm a student at Hogwarts, and someone comes up and says "the defense teacher had a snake man sticking out of the back of his head and was trying to pull a magic rock from a mirror, but its okay because I burned him to death," I will be more than a little skeptical. And possibly laughing my head off.
