So, here's how I work out Squibs and Muggleborns: some genes can take up to four generations to show up in a child. Thus Marius Black, despite being a Squib, could possibly have a magical descendent by his great-grandchild. This descendant would be classified as a Muggleborn. Conversely, a Muggleborn could have a Squib descendant by their great-grandchild. Judging by Phineas Nigellus Black's view on Muggles, I'm inclined to think that the Muggle heritage came through Marius' mother, Violetta Bulstrode. However, since she was allowed to marry into the family, she's probably at least a second-generation half-blood, making Marius the fourth generation (as in, if he were not a Squib, he would be a pureblood wizard).

Does this history work out? I want to fact-check it before I use it for one of my stories where a Muggleborn traces back their heritage to a great-grandparent.

According to Rowling it can be much more than that. The magical trait could resurface in a family line /centuries/ after the original Squib married a Muggle.

*** I think I'll just include a caveat where in /very rare/ circumstances, a mutation can happen that causes a Muggleborn to have magic because JKR's genetic inheritance method doesn't make sense.

***** If it's after /centuries/, then it's not genetic inheritance at that point, but a mutation. Especially if it's monogenic as JKR implies.

****** It's /magic/. Just assume magic makes it work differently --- perhaps there's no literal gene there that a Muggle scientist could find in the wizard's DNA, maybe the "magic marker" is a purely magical trait that just happens to be passed down in a way superficially similar to Muggle genetics. Or perhaps it's something in-between. All we know is that according to Rowling there's a direct causal relation between a distant wizardkind ancestor and the birth of a Muggle-born wizard or witch.

******* According to JKR are a /lot/ of things that don't make sense, and as a /fanfiction/ writer, I have the right to ignore that and apply actual logic instead of waving a hand and saying, "It's magic!"

My method is simplified but works out. Anyone else can feel free to use it.

** JKR has said there is a magic gene, but I doubt it follows any rules of genetics known to science. Certainly it resists any kind of "is it recessive? Is it dominant?" type analysis, though it could be a trait triggered by a combination of multiple genes.

TL,DR do what you like.

*** From the way Rowling described it, I don't think it's a polygenic trait, but alas, there is not much in the magical world that's logical... So I'll keep my method just so that my head doesn't hurt :)
