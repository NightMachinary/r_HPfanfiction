Well first of all it's understatement there aren't many Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts crossover since the number I saw is 43 currently. I really like to know the reason after all Time Turner is pretty canon in Hp series. and it's not unreasonable for Harry to take Newt's place or go with him to visit ancient New York and all. I don't know how popular my opinion is going to be but I feel Queenie could have done better than that fat muggle she's stuck with. The same way I feel Mr. Redmayne's Newt Scamander could have done better than the Tina we got. I was actually shipping Newt/Queenie.


** First and foremost there is nothing wrong with falling in love with someone, whether they be a fat muggle or skinny wizard. Love is not about who others view you as, but how you view each other.

I can't speak for everyone but honestly I wasn't a huge fan of the FB movie, especially considering what we have heard about the most recent one. I have no desire to acknowledge them as canon, much less write about them. Harry Potter canon to me has always been the books and books alone.

*** Well I weren't kidding when I said my comment won't be popular and I thought JKR wrote FB. Yeah I am pretty sure that's the case so I don't know what you are on about FB not being canon after all he was mentioned in Hp series. I know for a fact to attend Care of Magical Creatures class one of the text book you require is [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them][/Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/]] by Newt Scamander.

**** I did not say it wasn't canon, it is canon. I did say however that I have no desire to acknowledge FB as canon, nor do I have any desire to acknowledge Cursed Child as canon.

JKR did not write FB, she oversaw the script writing. I'm sure she made some contributions, but overall the script was not written exclusively by her. Something similar happened with the Eragon movie, which all of [[/r/eragon/]] refuses to even acknowledge.

***** Sorry you are wrong again she may have oversaw the script of the movie and may or may not have made any contribution but FB actually is a book which wrote by JKR (under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_name][pen name]] of the fictitious author [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Scamander][Newt Scamander]]) the movie is inspired by the book and obviously it has a script that won't be written by her. It's not that hard, search google "Fantastic Beasts and where to find them book" or this is the Wikipedia link: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them]]

** I never found Queenie particularly interesting, and definitely not enough to be paired with Harry. I imagine others feel the same.

I also couldn't see Newt and her together either. Are you sure you're not just trying to pair up the two most attractive people? Because I don't think they really work together.

*** Yeah I guess that's what I am doing in a way. If we're REALLY talking about people working together then I have seen several Hermione/Draco pairing and if we go by canon they should never work together but people still pair them because we ll they are attractive people.

***** I hope someone finds an "Aha!" moment soon and in fanfiction anything can work as long as you make it seem believable. I mean if Harry/Draco slash pairing can work when both of those characters are canonically despise one another and a proven heterosexual but still people pair them like they don't care, then what's wrong with Queenie/Harry or Queenie/Newt.

** You take that back, I love Queenie and Jacob's dynamic :)

Honestly, I feel like a lot of people just aren't invested in FB or are waiting for more movies to come out. Personally, I've been hoping for a decent fic starring Queenie and Snape, either romantically or just as bros.

*** I've been put off the new one and it hasn't even came out yet.

Why is Dumbledore the DADA professor? He teaches transfiguration in canon. This leads.me to believe that the writers either don't know canon or don't respect it, either are worrisome.

And secondly Grindelwald being a blood purist. I could go on a long rant saying how ridiculous that is but I'll save us time and just say its lazy and stupid.

**** Have they actually gone into his ideology yet? I don't remember them saying anything besides "he's a dark wizard" in the first one, and his speech in the trailer is pretty vague.

I'm kind of holding out hope for the next ones to at least be interesting, although on the Grindelwald front I'm gonna be disappointed. I had this huge headcanon that tied his belief that wizards are superior to Muggles to the idea that the wizarding world is, according to JKR, more enlightened on multiple fronts, including, importantly, LGBT rights.

This could easily tie into the tragic ex-boyfriend Dumbledore part of the story and into the idea of wizards taking over "for the Muggles' own good." It would also make it so that Dumbledore would have to confront the idea of defending the same people who would oppress him in multiple ways from the evil dude.

***** Synopsis for next FB movie: /Magizoologist Newt Scamander joins forces with young Albus Dumbledore to prevent the devious Gellert Grindelwald from raising pure-blood wizards to rule over all non-magical beings./

I completely agree. His ideology was based on "for the greater good" not "the purer blood."

**** "Why is Dumbledore the DADA professor? He teaches transfiguration in canon. This leads.me to believe that the writers either don't know canon or don't respect it, either are worrisome. " -- [[https://www.reddit.com/user/moomoogoat][moomoogoat]]

That's a very wrong way of looking at it. Is he a canon Transfiguration teacher absolutely. He taught the subject since 1950s I believe but then he became headmaster and head of the said department and let McGonagall handle the teaching. So now him being DADA teacher contradicts canon you feel along with many fans.

But my out look is there are not a contradiction. The fact that Dumbledore taught Transfiguration does not mean he couldn't have taught something else at another time. It is probably that he taught Transfiguration more than DADA, but he would not be the first professor to change subjects. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Quirrell is a known professor of Muggle Studies at the beginning of the book, but then he changed subjects to DADA in Harry's first year. Yeah obviously we know why but it says you can teach other subject and most fans are okay with this hell even Snape changed his subject from potion to DADA for one year, but they can not accept the contradiction with Merrythought teaching for nearly 50 years DADA. The problem is, the books do not say that either.

“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years” are the words spoken by Dumbledore in the sixth book, and this doesn't mean that Merrythought taught DADA for fifty years. He said she had been at Hogwarts for fifty years, which could mean she switched positions during that half a century. This would be a good explanation that does not contradict canon again. But even if she was teaching DADA for nearly fifty years, as a lot of people suppose from that Half-Blood Prince dialogue, there are still exceptions for Dumbledore to be the professor in that specific class.

Dumbledore could be easily the substitute for DADA in case of absence of Galatea Merrythought, due to illness, a trip, or anything. It would not be the first case, as Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank filled in as Care of Magical Creatures teacher during the fourth and fifth book while Hagrid was unable to do it.

*** Sorry but I don't really like them together she can do better than him in my opinion. As I wrote earlier same can be said for Newt as well in movie. Does that make me shallow or narrow minded I guess, kind of . But I cringed every time I saw them together last night in FB.

Ouch.

Maybe it's just me but you say 'ancient' and I assume you're talking about something prior to the fall of the Roman Empire (1500 years ago) or perhaps before the advent of Christianity (2000 years ago), rather than anything before the advent of broadcast television (90 years ago).
