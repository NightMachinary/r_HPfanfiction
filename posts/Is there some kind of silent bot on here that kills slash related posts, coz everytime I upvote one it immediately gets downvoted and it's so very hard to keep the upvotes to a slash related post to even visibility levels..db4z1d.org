** There are a lot of people who don't like slash. Like me. I don't like slash. However there exists a subset of these people who don't like slash called "cunts" who think that just because they don't like it that it shouldn't be on this sub so they downvote any mention of it. I personally don't downvote slash posts, I ignore them, because they're relevant to the sub but not my jam. Too often the downvote button is treated like a dislike button. It's a problem all over reddit. Nothing we can do about it really. C'est la vie.

Slash should just be treated as another pairing, like Harmony. I hate Hermione with the burning of a thousand suns, but I never, ever, downvote a H/Hr request post, simply because I couldn't care less about it. I just don't read it.

******* Um, most fanfiction readers and writers are women and/or queer. The LGBT people and slash shippers are the ones who gave rise to the fanfiction movement for the sole reason that mainstream media has almost nothing to offer us where we can see reflections of ourselves. If you're saying that we benefit, somehow, from the fact that mainstream media is so heteronormative, and should therefore be more understanding of straight men's wish to shut us out of a space we created, well, I don't even know what to say.

******** I think they're saying that, /because/ mainstream media is so heteronormative, LGBTQ people are accustomed, at an early age, to relating to characters that do not share their sexual orientation, eg. straight couples. Whereas cis straight people are not generally forced to relate to queer characters, and therefore their kneejerk reaction to slash fic is ew, instead of just enjoying the rest of the story. I don't think they meant to say that LGBTQ people somehow benefit from this, only that they have more practice relating to straight couples in media. I'm not sure I agree, but that was how I interpreted the comment.

I also definitely don't agree that "most people dislike slash fics". As later commenters pointed out, slash is very popular on the two main fic sites, and it's far more likely that the demographic of this sub is not at all representative of the fanfiction community in general.

******** To be honest, that's a very vulgarized way to describe that fic.

The focus is not at all on the harm part. The harem and romance is basically just all the 'girls' having a crush on Harry and the vision of the future where they'll all live together as a big happy familiy. The story really shouldn't be labeled as a Romance...because it isn't.

The 'girls' are his followers first and foremost. He doesn't go out of his way to romanticize them in /any/ way, and there isn't /anything/ happening between them.

Even so, I don't think it's the best story. It's already over 600k words and it's still in second year... It's /pretty slow/ and involves a lot if not too much worldbuilding that I doubt the author has any real plans for except just to worldbuild. If I could now tell my past self to not read it, I would. Still, I'll probably read the chapters that're coming out every few months until the story is completed...in like 10 years or so, lol. (I'm assuming it'll span the whole 7 Years of Hogwarts. Because, really, why would you end it after the second or third year if you could have just spread the plot over all seven years...)

  One issue comparing the Fem!Harry/Male!Voldy to Male!Harry/Fem!Voldy is that the movies show voldemort to be pretty ugly, and that sticks with us. You can at least imagine a Fem!Voldy as being attractive much easier without that image.
#+end_quote

That explanation doesn't work because in the majority of the HP/male!LV fics Voldemort is changed to look like his younger pre-horcrux self, either before or during the course of the plot. Tom Riddle was depicted as handsome both in the books and the movies, so there's no reason why he would be pictured as ugly any more than a fem!Voldemort would be.

** People downvote recs and requests they dislike.

Much as Reddit claims that the downvote button isn't a dislike one, most people use it as such due to conditioning from sites like FB. This happens for all kinds of fics, from prompts that are overly specific to people requesting mugglewank, to recommendations of certain controversial fics like HPMOR or Princess of the Blacks.

And since a relatively large segment of the audience dislikes Slash compared to the segment that dislikes certain other genres, this trend is more noticeable with Slash fics.

I myself am a fan of certain pairings between two males(as long as they're the same age, i'll never be a fan of Severus/any bloody child for example).

I honestly want to see a pairing between Harry, and Neville. I've never seen an honest to god good attempt at such beyond smut, and i'm Asexual, so as you can imagine, I don't have interests in the more physical side of such things.

In general, a lot of people don't mind slash, some ignore any post that has such, and if they're not a fan, no skin off their, or my back. I mean I don't like sexual encounters period, and I can't hate on someone who doesn't want to read such stories. It's not homophobic, it's just they're not comfortable with same sex relationships, and that's their choice. Sadly, the majority are homophobic, as in seeing it as disgusting(which in itself is fine), unnatural, and they just want to spread the hate.

** I think it's worth mentioning that every point commonly brought up to defend a blanket dislike of slash that doesn't outright say "I dislike M/M pairings" (usually phrased less delicately) is equally applicable to het fics. I've seen so goddamn many posts and comments on this sub saying something along the lines of "I don't dislike slash itself, but . . ." "the specific pairings in the fandom are unrealistic," "the story exists just to get the two characters together," or "the romance goes from zero to thirty in the span of a single conversation," that I'm not sure I even fully register them anymore.

And to be clear, all of those are legitimate criticisms (well, the first and third are; the second is really a matter of preference), but, like, have any of you ever read a shipping fic in this fandom? Or in /any/ fandom? Those aren't problems endemic to slash fics by any stretch of any imagination.

**** I think that it is valid to say, however, that a lot of fics tend to ignore the ways that being gay instead of straight would change a character. Sometimes, in a shorter fic, that doesn't really matter. But in a longer fic it's important to acknowledge that being gay /is/ a major change in a character's identity. For instance, it's likely that the Dursley's, with their insistence on 'being normal' would be highly homophobic (in canon, Dudley teases Harry about saying Cedric's name in his sleep, by asking if Cedric is his boyfriend) and this would definitely color Harry's own thoughts. Even if he continues his trend of basically not caring about what the Dursleys think and essentially ignoring their attitude and opinions, it's likely that he would be somewhat afraid to act upon his feelings.

I guess what I'm saying is that although I like slash, I dislike when authors decide that a character is gay 'because I say so' and ignore the ways that such an identity change would also change their behavior and thoughts

It's fairly common for people to respond to requests by recommending fics which partially match the requested theme. So I don't think people should have any qualms recommending fics which do not match, for example, the pairing preferences of the OP if those fics are a good match for other aspects of the request.

Ultimately, request threads are here for the /community/, as a way for people to find recommendations by theme. It would be a bit weird if those threads existed solely for the benefit of the person making the request.

Lots of other slash posts are controversial sitting at like 60% to 80% upvoted or so, but Death Eater slash generally sits at 40% or less. That said, it is obvious that people are a lot more forgiving of messed up pairings when it's a category they like (and this cuts both ways). Lots more Harry/fem!DE or Harry/fem!Voldemort that is upvoted. But the well-known fem!Voldemort or fem!DE tends to be stuff that doesn't whitewash (at least too heavily). I don't know why slash Death Eater stuff sucks so much though and why recs with those pairings almost always suck. I got into an argument a while back with someone who had like 10 fics of Tomarry that they said was good, and they were average at best, and very liberal with the whitewashing.

Or people just don't like slash? I'm a bi guy but I just don't enjoy slash for the most part. It's mostly due to the pairings and that most of what I've seen is Death Eater apologist smut. I'm fine with some, like Sirius/Remus, and there was an interesting Tom/Harry one that had them be soul mates who were constantly reincarnated. If it has a good story and relationship I'll try it out, but typically that's not what I see when it comes to slashfics. So I can totally understand people not wanting to read them.

On the other hand I'm also not the type to just downvote things I don't want to see or don't agree with (well, to an extent). Maybe the people who downvote posts requesting slash do just think it's for when you don't like something, or maybe they just want the top posts on the subreddit to not be slash requests. I feel like the rest of your post pretty much sums up what most people think of slash or see it as, so I don't see why you're just dropping the homophobia line at the start.

**** The reason I dislike most (sexual) pairings is because usually, it's one of these:

- badly written (oh so much)

- doesn't fit (For love of Magic does this a lot, with scenes just randomly thrown in)

- impossible pairing (would never happen, usually takes some pretty extreme mental gymnastics on the authors part and just sounds incredibly dumb overall, like Harry and LV or Neville and Bellatrix, vomit)

- just stops the story's more interesting theme for a while (annoying)

- pedophilia (yep, fuck you.)

Which is a damn shame, as there have been some pretty intereresting plot hooks over the years, but attached to badly written or disturbing smut - If the author has a god-like ability to write interesting and vivid magic, but wastes their talent on having the story grind to a halt once per chapter so a child can have sex with an adult, I'm gonna give it a hard pass, write a strongly worded review and then weep for humanity.

3. Depending on the fandom, I'll also sort out some popular AUs under Exclude → Additional tags that I don't like
4. Depending on the fandom, I'll sort out crossovers either under More Options → Crossovers or by Exclude → Fandoms (Whether I do one or the other depends on fandom sorting. This isn't really relevant to HP, I think, but it is to Good Omens.)
5. Under More Options → Word Count, I fill in 10000 under "From" because I like longer fics.
6. Under Language, select "English"
7. Press "Sort and Filter"

(Note: for the pairings, after you press Sort and Filter, you may want to go in again and exclude more, since those only list the most popular tags in your current search term.)

I then just keep it open and scroll through, opening new fics in a new tab. I have three different tabs open like this.

You can also Exclude other things, like Categories (M/F or M/M or F/F), Warnings (Major Character Death, Rape/Non-Con, etc.) or WIPs (under Completion Status).

Nope, slash is usually used to refer to fics with male/male romantic and/or sexual relationships and femslash to fics with female/female. Sometimes slash gets used to refer to fics with homosexual relationships of any orientation, kind of like gay can be used to mean either gay men or homosexual people in general.

Het is short for heterosexual, and refers to fics with male/female romantic and/or sexual relationships.

The term for fics with little or no reference to romance and sex is gen.

If you want to talk about fics with ships of any orientation (het, slash, or femslash), the most common general term I've seen is shipfic.

Riddle was a sadist by eleven, and being raised by an inbred rapist as a mother would, most likely, not be much of an improvement. Nor would his inbred, violent uncle or grandfather.

The thing is, it's not completely OOC. Voldemort has many interesting qualities, some really admirable ones (for example his thirst for knowledge). In ffs these qualities get different framework and create very interesting character. He remains a killer in these usually, I admit, but it's not all he is. I think it's stupid people would judge him only for it, when they admire others for the exact same reason (people admiring Alexander The Great for example, where you have to be fully aware that there were battles, and he killed. ) Murderer is a murderer, doesn't matter what else they did. But judging them based only on that is quite shallow.

You can't reach the same effect writing Harry with Padma or Terry.

Alexander the Great caused a lot of positive effects with his conquests though, for example, the period of Hellenism in and even beyond the successor states of his empire. Voldemort was just a man scared of death whose quest for immortality and power descended into madness. He lacks the arc of a hero->tragic villain like Episode 3 Darth Vader, he shows no remorse or regret and his motivations are purely selfish. If he just made a Horcrux to survive and then was a psychopath instead of leading a genocidal campaing, there might be something interesting to him, but as it is he is just "magical knock-off Hitler".

Also, Alexander the Great is admired for his abilities as a general. Voldemort used a frontal assault on a fortified hilltop, which is the kind of strategy which got many thousand French killed during the opening days of WW1 when they charged into certain death, thinking that Elan is worth more than machine guns and artillery. A 9-year-old starcraft player is better at strategy than Voldemort.

Postwar revolutionary Harry is perfectly set-up by how little changed in the epilogue (eg Malfoy not in prison). Or anyone else going "wait, the people who deported the muggleborns are back to cauldron bottom thickness"?

*** Most slash fanfic is not about changing the sexual orientation of people. The sexual orientation of a person is rarely so integral to a person that it changes the entirety of their character. Most quality slash is the same adventures and plots and characterisations, just involving queer romance. Also, there's a difference between moving on because you don't like something and disallowing discussions on it because you don't like something.

**** I mean, if you even want to be "canon", a childhood with the Dursleys probably leads to suppressed sexuality. Some slight differences can be enough for Harry to realize he does, in fact, like dudes. And I don't think we follow other characters enough to be able to say for sure that they aren't simply bi.

I dislike how JK retcons stuff, adding information into her story that wasn't present before, because representation that's just smashed on top of something doesn't really work for me. But that's the beauty of fanfic, you can present an alternate reality where a character being gay or bi or trans (btw trans characters in HP fanfic is something I've never seen) or whatever is just part of the story.

**** I know a shit ton of gay people in real life that would argue vehemently that you are wrong in the "sexual orientation of a person is rarely so integral to a person that it changes the entirety of their character".

There are humongous differences between how gay males, and straight males act, think, perceive the world, and rationalize things. Same with women. Just as Men and Women are completely different, it is the same for homosexuals/Straight. So those differences would have a profound impact on a person's character in a story.

The fact that the magical world is extremely extremely small, children appear to be extremely rare, I'd imagine homosexuality is highly frowned upon in the magical world considering they need children to survive, and only M+F make children. There's no evidence of magical spells or rituals in canon stating that you can have M+M to procreate.

People wanna make slash fics that's their business, but I imagine a lot of people can't stand slash because they see it as just another Rowling type event where she just ups and says a character is gay and that's that.

Also i see a lot of people using the word heteronormative on this site. As if it's something to bash and be frowned upon. Which is just hilarious to me, because for all of Human History, heterosexuals were, and are, still the norm. Less than 3% of the population in the world are Homosexual. I'm sure a lot of people, myself included, sneer at how prevalent LGBT and SJW values are being pushed on the world despite how absurdly low of a population they actually are. That includes Fanfiction.

**** But you're literally saying that it is just changing the sexual orientation of canon characters.

If people were writing Dumbledore slash that would be fine, but usually people aren't. They're writing slash involving Harry, and Draco and all sorts of characters, who they for no reason have decided will now be homosexual. That is a boring premise showing no creativity.

A premise that can just be copy-pasted for a character after character, premises like, 'Snape is female', 'Dumbledore is female', 'Harry is gay', 'Draco is gay' are shit premises. They're inherently trivial.

***** It's rarely ever about just the sexual orientation though. It's more about the kind of dynamic that Remus/Sirius or Harry/Draco or Luna/Ginny would bring to a drama or an adventure or a romance.

But, since you're obviously not interested in being convinced, I'm not asking for everyone to like this sort of thing.

I only wish that these discussions wouldn't be downvoted to the point that they become invisible on the sub so that the many, many people, who, like me, seem to inexplicably be interested in "shit premises" that are "inherently trivial", unlike the rest of fandom where nothing trite or repetitive ever happens (/s), can participate in them.

There's nothing clever or interesting about something which can be copy-pasted for any character. Therefore a request for example, for 'Harry/Draco' or 'HarryxFemale Voldemort' or whatnot is not something which I feel contributes to discussion.

There's simply no cleverness or contribution to fanfiction discussion in such requests. Downvotes and upvotes are a filtering mechanism intended to make interesting things rise to the top. If something is not interesting it deserves downvotes. I downvote smut for the same reason. It's simply not interesting literature. Trite. One can talk about better things.
