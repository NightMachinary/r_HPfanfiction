*** "Know-it-all bookworm" doesnt have to be accompanied by "letter of the law, stick in the mud, rule worshipper".

This Ron could be an avid reader that knows a bunch already and thinks he's an expert on everything his brothers have talked about (/obviously/ he knows about dragons, and curse breaking, he learned it all from Bill and Charlie and the books they sent him.)
