Daphne is often portrayed in fics as the noble Slytherin who embodies her House's positive values while rejecting the idea of blood purity - although she's not someone whose fics I've dug extensively deep into. So I'm curious to see if any such scene like the one above has ever been written: preferably in the Slytherin common room I think would be a nice location, but anywhere else would be nice as well. Draco being flabbergasted at someone in his own House mouthing off to him and telling him how disgusting she finds him would just be an absolutely priceless moment. Thanks in advance for what you can recommend or write.


** Linkffn(How a Slytherin Gets What They Want) has such a less elaborate elaborate version of such a scene.

  Harry frowned. "Why are you trying to help me?" he asked. "Not that I don't appreciate it ... but I think most of Slytherin would enjoy seeing me end up as dragon food." One-Shot, First Task
