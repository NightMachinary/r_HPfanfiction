*** Gabrielle is the youngest daughter of the head of the french DMLE, and there is a feud going between the Veela and Merfolk. Putting Gabrielle in that lake is tantamount to murder.

I don't remember if that's all canon or not, but it's certainly stated as a possibility in enough fic's, I wanted to see if it was implemented anywhere.

***** All it takes is a spark to start a forest fire. Maybe Gabrielle's unfortunate demise would not be the sole cause of a Magical Britain/Magical France war, but any number of wars have started over much less. Perhaps the French Ministry demands reparations for the family, only to be firmly (and arrogantly, this being Cornelius Fudge's Ministry) rebuffed. In response, France levies a tariff on British products or cracks down on travelers from Britain, citing security concerns. It wouldn't take long before both sides are bubbling mad, and the initial cause is either forgotten or turned into a martyr figure.

******* And you are completely ignoring the fact that, historically speaking, wars have been started over far less, perhaps the French might not be thinking rationally while they rally behind a martyr figure, and that Dumbledore may not necessarily support the Ministry, either politically or in battle.

***** Huh, the more you know.

I'd still like to see a fic where it happens. Who cares if it makes sense? There are plenty of oneshots that make no sense at all.

** I mean I've never come across one but I am currently writing a story where the French object vehemently to Harry competing and the try was in tournament so instead of declaring war the Prime Minister of France is having the ICU investigate the British ministry system for corruption and league games have been moved to magical Geneva....

On a side note The story is called amateur cartography in the French Alps if you have any interest sorry I couldn't be of more help if I find any stories Closer to what you're requesting I will update sorry

*** Interesting idea, but all the random capitalizations and extra spaces make my eye twitch. You also apparently don't know how to spell Fleur.

Good grief, chapter one was painful to read.
