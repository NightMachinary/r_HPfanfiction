:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this short fic about how James Potter survived the night of Voldie's attack but Lily died. He blames Harry essentially and left him with the Dursley but he came to visit periodically. James says really shitty things to Harry and when he is being sorted the Hat is saying that really bad parenting and calls Severus to talk to him.

I'm highly positive it is on AO3 but I can't freaking find it. Any help would be great!
