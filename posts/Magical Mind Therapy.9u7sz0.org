Are there any stories out there that explore mind therapy? Mental illness? Psychiatrists or mind healers? Occlumency or legilimency gone wrong? Institutions set in place for those recovering from mental trauma in the magical world? If anyone has seen this done, or has any idea about it, let me know please!


** It's a common trope for Sirius to get a mind healer in fics where he is publicly proven innocent. But those fics usually gloss over the specifics of how it's done. I've only seen a few cases where mind healing via legilimency is touched on more in depth.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] - Harry heals his own mind to the best of his ability. Later on he tries experimental healing on another person.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - Harry's mind is nearly broken under the malevolent influence of a master legilimens. He attempts to heal himself and later gets help from an unexpected ally.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

**** Depends on how you look at it. Vivisection via legilimency is a poorly understood art.
