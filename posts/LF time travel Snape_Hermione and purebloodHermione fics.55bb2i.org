Somewhat pureblood!hermione that's also pretty good is linkffn(11402812).

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

** Do fics where Hermione discovers that she's a half-blood (with a wizard father) count? In particular, linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky) has that, and an affair with Draco, though that's not the ultimate 'ship.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

**** How often do we actually see that, though? How many fanfics maintain any sort of continuity of character between pre-reveal and post-reveal Hermione? More concretely, how many fics are there where she finds out that she's a pureblood and...

- is still best friends with Harry and Ron, because there's no reason for them to stop being friends just because of that;
- is still romantically attracted to Ron, because there's no reason why finding something about her biological parents shouldn't affect her tastes;
- still thinks that Draco is despicable and pathetic, because there is no reason it should change her values and their past history;
- still has a keen sense of justice and drive to fight injustice where she finds it, including things like house-elf rights, because there is no reason it should change her values; and
- is no more interested in fashion, makeup, etc.^{1} than before, because there is no reason for it to change her interests and priorities.

And, for the record, I'd be interested in reading fanfic that actually did that, rather than press a big reset button on her values, tastes, interests, loyalties, and priorities, like all the pureblood!Hermione fanfics I've seen do.

^{1} Not that there is anything wrong with that; it's just that judging from what we know of her character, they aren't a high priority for her.

**** Thing is a pureblood female always will act like a 'pureblood', not like a pureblood on muggleborn cloth. By no means, a pureblood would ever be an upright for muggleborns. Asking for 'pureblood' Hermione means literary asking for an OC. The dynamics of her characterization comes because she had experience on both world. As soon as you make her pureblood, the dynamics is also gone untess you are looking for an OC.

***** What is the big deal, really?

I mean there are plenty of fics where Harry is something he's not, whether it's a being a female, vampire, veela (or any of the dozens of creatures/beings an author can make up), muggle (non-magic AUs), etc. Reading a story where Hermione is a pureblood isn't really all that much of a stretch.

****** If you say so, no big deal.

But from where I stand, it makes no senses. Because being 'pureblood' & advocating for muggles literally two different routes. Not even light pureblood families are an open advocate for muggles. Being pureblood Hermione means her open views of the world never explore. For example, Hermione's SPEW project solely due to her being muggle. If she were pureblood, she'd never thought of it. Because purebloods are brought up that way.
