Voldemort was confident in his win, having already killed James Potter. What kind of fool doesn't have his wand on him at all times. What he wasn't expecting when he burst through the door of the upstairs bedroom however, was to hear the words "AVADA KEDAVRA" and a Green Light to slam into him, signalling the end of his life. Luckily, he had Horcruxes, but he was defeated by a Mudblood of all things!

Lily however, was relieved. She was able to cast the Killing Curse and mean it, knowing Voldemort would underestimate her due to her blood status. He'd already killed her husband, and wanted to murder her precious child. Mustering up the hate, the lack of remorse, and the will to murder was EASY, as it should be for any mother.


** One of my one-shots sort of takes this angle, but with a bit more of a Muggle solution:

And excerpt:

"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"

So, Potter thought he could defy the greatest Dark Lord in history yet again? This time without even a wand in his hand? ... Voldemort laughed before casting the curse ...

"Avada Kedavra!"

The green light pulsed, flooding the cramped hallway, the flash freezing everything around it, like a strobe. The pram pushed against the wall reflected the green light, the banisters glowed like the neon lights he recalled from his childhood in London before the war, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut...

Voldemort could hear the woman screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear... He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ...

She had no wand with her either ... How stupid these two were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for a moment...

Voldemort forced the door open, moving the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the cot behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ...

"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!"

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now."

"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead..." she pleaded

"This is my last warning..."

A smile stretched across Voldemort's face when he saw the woman's resolve break, like so many before her, he watched as her shoulders slumped and her proud head lowered in submission. Severus would so enjoy his reward. "Please?" she whispered while moving aside.

The child had not cried all this time. He stood, clutching the bars of his cot, and he looked up into the stranger's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would at any moment resume her laughing teasing...

The Dark Lord pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The boy began to cry. He had realized that this stranger was not James. Voldemort did not like the crying, he had never been able to bear the small ones whining back at the orphanage... It was time to stop the crying, to end this absurd threat. Voldemort raised his wand "Ava..."

Voldemort's last sensation was the feeling of a bee sting behind his left ear, as Lily Potter emptied her father's Browning Hi-Power pistol's 13 round magazine into his head and chest, just as Anthony Evans had taught both his daughters all those years before. In a smooth motion, she ejected the spent magazine and inserted one of the two reserve magazines she had been carrying in her robes since the Potters had fled under the Fidelius. She dropped the slide and scooped up the Dark Lord's wand.

The loud cracks of the pistol firing had startled young Harry out of his tears, but the sounds did not frighten him. No child who had successfully survived fifteen months in the company of James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew would be frightened by a mere explosion. No, loud noises like that meant that fun things were about to happen!

Lily waved her captured wand a few times and got nothing from it. */Of course not/*, she thought. Her own wand was in the kitchen, but no force on Earth could make her leave this room until help arrived. Lily tossed the wand aside, not seeing or caring where it landed. She settled herself onto the floor facing the door, her father's pistol still in her hand with the hammer back and the safety off.

The thrown wand bounce off the wall and arced into the boy's cot. Harry's green eyes grew wide in excitement. A lightstick! Harry picked up the wand using both of his chubby hands. This wasn't Mum's light stick. It wasn't Da's either. It was different than Pafoo's and Mooey's and Wormies'. It looked like the light stick the scary man had held. Had he come to bring Harry his own lightstick?

Unnoticed by his near-hysterical mother, Harry waved the wand over a small arc and was rewarded by a shower of silent golden sparks. That was funny!

Lily twitched slightly at the sound of her son's giggles. */Sirius, please come. James said you might come over tonight, please come help me!/* She screamed inside her mind.

*** Really nice!

I once thought of the possibility of Lily, knowing that she can't possibly out-duel Voldy, acquiring a sawn-off shotgun as an emergency backup weapon and ambushing Voldy with it when he came to visit. Thing is, British gun control laws in the early eighties were such that she couldn't obtain one legally, nor get trained for it. Thus she failed to score a kill shot on the first try and Voldy, pissed beyond belief that the cheeky little mudblood */dared/* to use a muggle weapon against him, denied her a quick and clean death via AK.

All that needs to be said is that Lily was in no condition afterwards to have an open casket funeral... but she made Voldy pay for it with gunshot wound scars that persist past his resurrection and react to Harry the same way Harry's scar reacts to him.
