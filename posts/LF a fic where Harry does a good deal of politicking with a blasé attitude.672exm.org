So I want something where Harry has some political power and wields it however he likes. Pretty much the opposite of how Harry acts in canon, where he's completely reactionary and with the whole trial in OoTP.

The best example of what I'm looking for is in a short scene in A Black Comedy [[/s][Where Harry and Sirius get a seat on the Wizengamot. Their whole attitude to everything is pretty lackadaisical, not caring much about anything other than fucking around with people. But they do have some strong opinions that they fought for, like protecting the rights of muggles and muggleborns.]]


** Does it have to be politicking in the Wizengamot or is Slytherin-Common-Room-Politics fine too ?

*** Either would be good, but I definitely lean more towards grander scale politics.

I've read one or two where Harry manipulates Slytherins and others in Hogwarts and for me at least, it's not as satisfying seeing Harry meddling in the politics of schoolchildren as it is to see him meddle with the fucked up society that is Wizarding Britain as a whole and the Wizengamot. The stakes seem higher and that makes it a bit more interesting.

*** The way I seen it slitherin is a bunch of inbred bigots who are the last or second to last of once noble lines. Are you sure they can politick? Like really even in canon they can't politick for shit I mean look at their "leader" Draco Malfoy who decides to piss if the second or third most political lay powerful person in Britain and most important child for being near what is in his opinion "negro filth" or whatever inbred white morons call less inbred people.

Even if you go past Draco they are still lazy generally unstudious inbred malnourished privaleged pampered 11 year olds politicking with them is like politicking with rabid racist monkeys in a fascist oligarchy. Speaking of Britain is a fascist oligarchy run by rabid racist simians who's number one goal is to remove the 99% and driving themselves to extinction.

British politicking in the magical world should not be compatible with subtle or blasé. British politics should consist of yelling and showing power but not to much power because they will lock you up if you are more than a vague threat.

*** Haven't found another example yet, but I did just come across a story that seems like it will likely get to what I'm asking here. Only two, rather large, chapters out so far but if it's not abandoned then I think it will be a great one.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

**** It's probably not abandoned. The authors just like to drop massive chapters, often where not a lot happens. He other stories are the same - good ideas that haven't been finished.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
