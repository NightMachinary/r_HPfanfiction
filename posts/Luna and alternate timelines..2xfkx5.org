I've read not one, but TWO fics so far where Luna Lovegood is aware of alternate timelines in a Peggy Sue fic - they're "Jamie Evans and the Lonely Queen" (dormant) and "From the Flame to the Spark" (complete?)

Is this a thing in other fics too?


** Got popularized by Nonjon in A Black Comedy I believe.

** I've always thought that canon-Luna had some sort of magic sight that resulted from the spell failure that killed her mother. She sees fantastic creatures that nobody else can, who's presence is indicative of people's mindset/thought-patterns. Nargles were creatures that followed around the bullies in school, and Wrackspurts caused confusion or thought-train derailment. If she can see such creatures where normal folks can only see their effects on the world, whats to say that Luna wouldn't see something indicating that any dimension/time traveler was different than anyone else. Plus, while she seems to be a very fragile victim in most situations, she was also both present and very effective in the Department of Mysteries fighting. She gives little thought to the opinions of others, is magically skilled, and her house is the perfect stereotypical Mage's Tower. Luna's just too awesome to not be able to break the 4th wall, even if she doesn't know it or let you know that she does.
