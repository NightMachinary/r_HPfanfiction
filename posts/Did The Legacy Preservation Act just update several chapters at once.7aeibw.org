I normally only read the last chapter or two when a fic updates but none of this rings a bell. I wonder if they've updated like 5 chapters at once or if I'm just losing it.

The fic's completed by the way, for all you weirdos who only read finished works. :p

*Edit: Yeah, my bad. It is just one chapter. A quick finale.*


** Nope I remember reading chapter 29 prior to this update. There a major jump in time and the author seems to have let someone else finish the story.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

** No, just one new chapter.

** This story really ran out of steam. I thought it started well, and had a slightly different take on a very old trope, but it quickly became an obvious and rather dull story. The last chapter had me skipping through to get to the end as fast as possible.

What did others think?

*** Pretty much the same. The [[/spoiler][pregnancy]] was about the most predictable move ever. And the ending with the power of friendship was one of the cringiest bits of ff I've ever read. Don't know why people go for Romeo/Juliet style romances with Harry/Daphne but then have no inter-house or inter-family conflict because of it (other than Malfoy occasionally mouthing off).
