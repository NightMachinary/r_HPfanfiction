Please help me find fics where Harry sometimes interacts with other characters via legilimency or a mind-link. If its frequent and not a small throw-away power that is never used anyway, even better. Please, no harems or soulmates (unless they are only in the background and not connected to the plot).


** Here's a fic I just finished reading for the umpteenth time. I won't spoil it much, but this fic has an interesting take on the mind arts, and the fic is a great fic outside of that.

** linkffn(The mind Arts) has a Harry with strong mind arts, he often interacts with other characters using legilimency. This is a strong theme in the fic

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** I think you may struggle with the soulmates restriction, those two go together quite often... I know that knocks out my recommendations.

But I hope you get some good stories... I'm always up for some more mind-link/telepathy (it's one of my guilty pleasures)
