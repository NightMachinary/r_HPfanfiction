Adult fanfiction that isn't blocked by most proxies. This a long shot but as such, at work, I cannot access [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], [[https://adultfanfiction.net][adultfanfiction.net]] [[https://thepotionmaster.net][thepotionmaster.net]], [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]]. I'm not sure of any other sites to try at this point. Any links you find, you can comment, and I will try them out and let you know of their success. Thanks in advance.


** Look for FanFiction.Net apps for your phone and download the stories for offline reading or use data

****** Then you really shouldn't be trying to circumvent the IT filters. It will be flagged on a report somewhere and you will lose your job.

Print the damn things, if you have to. Popping the IT filters is just a bad idea.

******* Can't stress this enough. Particularly if any of the filters between you and the sites in question are on government servers (common where clearances are involved, for example), you'll eventually be caught out. Maybe not soon, but sometime. And then yeah, you lose the gig.

There's some excellent fanfiction out there. None of it is worth losing your job.

******* Thanks. Those filters block other sites that just seem trivial.. like imbd, imgur, Pinterest, and game sites for puzzles and such. But it doesn't block Reddit. And some people have access whereas others are blocked but they have the same clearance. That's why I'm trying to find what isn't blocked to steer clear of what is.

** You can download fanfic on the FFN app, and there are fic download websites if you want to do computer. If on AO3, what I do is I load up the fanfic and view entire work, ane download the page on chrome
