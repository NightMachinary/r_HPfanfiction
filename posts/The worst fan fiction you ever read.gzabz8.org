I'm looking for fics that are REALLY bad.


** This isn't really what you're asking for, but the worst fic I've read is Harry Crow. I'm normally very quick to bail on stories that I don't like, so the only ones I can claim to have read are at least decent enough to be worth trying the first few chapters.

Harry Crow is popular enough that I convinced myself to keep reading, figuring that it must just have a rocky start and it would get better later.

It didn't.

*** I never understood why HPMOR had so many vocal detractors, but some of the same people would then immediately recommend Harry Crow instead.

**** Oh god, I would spontaneously combust if I ran into that. HPMOR has its flaws and all, but next to Harry Crow it's goddamn high literature.

***** I'll admit, I laughed when I first saw them do it. Then further down the thread, I realized they were being serious, so I laughed harder.

***** I got fatigued with /HPMOR/ myself, and actually enjoy /Harry Crow/, for the most part.

Neither of them are even close to being the worst fanfic I've ever read.

** I have spent thousand of USD on psychotherapy just to forget them, and now I should dig them up from my memory? (seriously, there was one horrible smut story between Hermione and her mum, where I would not mind being /Obliviated/).

  What if Harry had managed to get onto the Hogwarts express in chamber of secrets, and Harry met Luna Lovegood on the train? What if Harry and Luna slowly discovered the mysteries of the wizarding world and horcruxes, secrets that certain people wanted hidden. Contains Dumbledore bashing, and also certain Weasleys, but no Hermione bashing I will probably update weekly

** I'm not sure if this is the worst fic in existence, a brilliant work of absurdism, or circling /so/ far into the absurd that it loses any of its actual impact and becomes bad as in word-salad.

With that pre-amble out of the way, enjoy Thirty H's. linkffn(2554200)

EDIT: Also, obligatory reference to Cursed Child as the worst fanfic.
