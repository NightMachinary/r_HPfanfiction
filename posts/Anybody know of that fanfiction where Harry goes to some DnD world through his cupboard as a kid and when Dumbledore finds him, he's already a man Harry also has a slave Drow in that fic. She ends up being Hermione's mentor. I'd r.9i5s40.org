#+TITLE: Anybody know of that fanfiction where Harry goes to some DnD world through his cupboard as a kid and when Dumbledore finds him, he's already a man? Harry also has a slave Drow in that fic. She ends up being Hermione's mentor. I'd really like to reread that fanfic, but now I can't find it.

*** Woah thanks! In exchange, I share with you names of three of my favourite fanfictions : Bungle in the Jungle (and its sequel), Princess of the Blacks (and its sequels) and The Denarian Renegade (trilogy). All three have excellent writing and have a LOT of original content.
