** Initial thoughts on how the idea might be handled:

First of all we need to establish how the characters change to make this happen.

In Ron's case, perhaps he's been bullied by the twins a bit more, or listened to Percy a bit more and saw the aggrandizing part over how obnoxious he is. He's burning to prove himself more than in canon, to show he's not just the latest kid in an over-populous family. He's initially mortified to be slotted in Slytherin, but slowly he starts thinking that maybe this isn't so bad; it gives him a chance to do something no one else in his family has. This will likely be the end for his relationship with the twins; they were already kind of jerk to him at that age, and they're very much the kind to declare him a traitor over it. To not even talk about how the rest of his family would react!

This likely pushes him into Malfoy's circles, thinking of it. He'd be seen by the other purebloods as the first Weasley to have some potential, and with his family pushing him away he'd probably welcome any kind of emotional support - even the terrible one they offer.

Hermione... is harder to fit into the house. Maybe she read something in a book that made her want to change the wizarding world, making her ambition stand out more?

How things go for her early on depends on if the books she's read gave her some information on the houses. If she's learnt about how prejudiced most Slytherins are, she might think to pretend to be a half-blood. From what is hinted with Snape, talented half-bloods don't seem to suffer much discrimination in that house, and no Slytherin would want to believe they share a house with a muggleborn so they probably wouldn't doubt her claims. That could be a tie-in to have her get acquainted with Ron; they're both outsiders in a way, and he can fill her in on what she needs to know to not make it obvious that she comes from a Muggle family.

I find it unlikely they'd be good friends with Harry in such a scenario. Harry was very impressionable in the first book, everyone told him Slytherin was the bad guys' House, and he only knew Ron for a few hours. He'd probably think that Ron was buttering him up, and with most Gryffindors being fame-struck by him he wouldn't have any trouble getting other friends. That and the class they share is Snape's, who wouldn't let students chat enough to become friends outside of the houses, especially in that year.

Siblings being obnoxious towards each other =/= ostracizing one because of a house. The twins would take the piss much like they did with Harry when everyone thought he was the Heir. They'd mockingly call him Dark Lord Weasley or something. Percy would try to help him, Ginny would probably follow him, and Molly and Arthur loved Percy despite him being an ass.

This is how most stories have Ron react to a Harry in Slytherin and neither way is believable lol. One person, who he only knew for a few more hours, told Harry Slytherins were terrible. He was typically nice and kind and accepting of people who were nice and kind to him. Ron's house isn't going to change that.

That would be fitting given the subreddit! But no, I just have a very poor opinion of the twins given their behavior for much of the series.

I actually agree on Percy wanting to help him (particularly if what made his ambition more prominent was his speeches to begin with), disagree on Ginny following him (she has a crush on Harry which was much more prominent at the time), and while I doubt his parents would disown him or anything so extreme I wouldn't be surprised if he received a letter that tries to be supportive of him but is laden with discrimination toward his new house. At any rate, his family beyond Percy and the twins have little opportunity to influence much until the year is over.

Absolutely. I never claimed it would be an /healthy/ relationship, merely one where Ron has no alternatives. People put into bad situations try to reach out for whatever they can even if it's not good for them.

And, well, this /is/ a Ron who was shifted enough from canon to be sorted in Slytherin in the first place.

This isn't actually a statement that there /are/; it's the same way one would indirectly say that there are none. Particularly since Scabior's earlier statement ("none of them can tell use where the common room is") indicates that he knows no muggleborn who could identify the Slytherin common room, so odds are good that he at least doesn't know of any but can't completely rule out the possibility.

Which is about how long he had to get to know Ron, and see again the part where they have basically nonexistent opportunities to meet until far later. The notion that they would become good friends while in different houses is entirely based on people's intuitive desire to maintain canon relationships.

Because the Ron who barged into Harry's compartment and asked to see his scar would avoid speaking to Harry in the corridors or in the other class they shared.

As opposed to believing Ron would help out Hermione because they're both possibly ostracized?

Yeah, actually. Ron being the knowledgeable one giving help is wildly different from their canon relationship.

Nah, I mean in the idea that Ron didn't like Hermione in canon until the troll incident. If there's no saving from a troll going on there's nothing to make him like her in Slytherin. Keeping in line with his canon characterization, he only goes out of his way to stop people from calling her a mudblood.

******** That's a possibility too; I assumed the OP wanted them to stick together since they had them both sorted into Slytherin so I went with the idea that she'd be less know-it-all in that environment.

** Ron and Harry stay best friends, but are more competitive with each, especially for the quidditch cup. Ron influences Harry to be more ambitious/selfish. Harry influences Ron to be more cunning/sneaky. Ron and Harry work together to get Snape out of there and subsequently bring Umbridge to Hogwarts sooner.

Harry tolerates Hermione that one year she and Ron date, but ultimately Ron ends up with Lavender and Harry with Fleur.
