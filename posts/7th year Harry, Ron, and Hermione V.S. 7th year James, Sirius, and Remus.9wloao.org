Of course, we have don't have as much information on James and Co. as we do with Harry and Co. However, I'm sure you have your own personal headcanons on the matter.

​

Round 1: Overall Wizard-ism...(Witch-ism I'm Hermione's case)

Which group do you think were better at magic as a whole?

I'd go James and Co. here.

​

Round 2: Fight

Which group do you think would win in a fight?

I think Harry and Co. win in a convincing fashion here.


** I think James Sirius and Remus would win the fight. I get the impression that they were more like foot soldiers in the war, and did more actual physical battling.\\
The golden trio were more strategically important, most of their success was in like.. puzzles, sneaking around, thinking fast or finding loop holes.\\
If it was a race to solve a mystery the golden trio would win, but the marauders would win an outright fight.

*** I love the Marauders but it's always seemed fairly clear to me that until /after/ Hogwarts they were particularly immature and untested. Hermione wasn't as interested in obscure spells and stuff like they were, yeah. However, when Marauders stayed late at the library or snuck into the restricted section, they were doing it to learn how to be animagi or prank the slytherins. When Hermione did she was learning how to make an unbreakable jar to hide a reporter in or researching spells she knew she would need in the inevitable battles she would have with Voldemort and his death eaters.

​

We're not comparing /peak/ Marauders vs /peak/ Harry and Co. We're comparing 7th year Marauders to 7th year Harry and Co. Marauders were gifted wizards, there is no denying it, and they /were/ a remarkable thorn in Voldemort's side but that was /after/ Hogwarts. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had faced Voldemort repeatedly by 7th year, their 6th years at Hogwarts were put together with constant reminders of the war to come and constant battles that grew increasingly difficult.

​

In sum, Harry and Co would beat Marauders in a 7th year vs 7th year fight.

**** See, my view is that the Marauders were fucking about until the end of their seventh year, much like you said, but even in their fucking around they were remarkably powerful and arguably did more brilliant things than the trio (the map/becoming animagi is more impressive than anything Hermione comes up with imo).

That was always one of my small issues, though. I feel like JK should have shown the trio doing something more advanced because it ended up seeming like most of their escapes from LV was sheer luck and some skill.

***** Oh yeah, I've always thought they were brilliant. Becoming animagi, the map, both of these are concrete proof of minds that were allowed to wander and because of that did wonderful things. That said, I don't know if creative brilliance would transfer into a fight and I've always imagined that Harry and Co had more fight experience in Hogwarts.

I (obviously) thoroughly enjoyed the books. That said, their skill level is something left to the imagination. Are they particularly gifted witches and wizards or just lucky? (Or unlucky, depending on how you look at it.) Harry is shown as exceptional for his age, but not so much exceptional for wizards in general. Why is he able to defeat Voldemort then? "Because prophecy". -_-

I think that luck is something you can only take advantage of if you have the skill, ability, etc. So to me it is a mix of both. Harry and Co. got lucky a lot. There's no denying it but that luck would have meant nothing without a certain level of skill and 'saving people' attitude.

**** I mean, it's hard to make a hard judgement either way because we just don't know enough about the Marauders. But I was under the impression that Hogwarts was a pretty tense place when they were at school. We know for a fact that Snape was throwing some pretty heavy dark magic at them, at least two other death eaters were in their year, James was outspoken against Voldemort and dated a muggleborn, and Sirius was openly rebelling against any kind of pure blood rhetoric.\\
So I don't imagine them as just having a laugh and doing silly pranks. I imagine some fairly heavy dueling and high stakes skirmishes.

Also, I don't want to downplay Hermione's brilliance - because she was brilliant. But she wasn't really good in a fight. She was good at being prepared before hand, and knowing a lot of things. But Harry was really the only one who could reliably act under pressure. IMO the Marauders would win because they have 2-3 'Harrys' (I'm on the fence with Remus ), while the trio only has one good fighter, one good researcher, and Ron - who was good, but not great, and a bit inconsistent.

***** You've got a point, it really boils down to what the Marauders were experiencing in Hogwarts. If it was more carefree, like I have always imagined, then absolutely I think the Marauders would be toast. That said, if it was tense and dangerous then they stand a much higher chance.

Hermione was brilliant but not a fighter, you're right there, that's why she doesn't become an Auror. That said, I think she could confidently work as defense and allow Harry and Ron to attack. She was on the run with them too, and she fared well, and anyone who was anything but a decent fighter wouldn't have survived. You're also right that Ron is inconsistent but I've always believed that when it comes down to it he can be counted on.

Unrelated but I love that the Marauders are technically 4 and Harry and Co is 3 but no one is even counting Peter, xD.

Hermione is very smart, and Ron is cunning even if he's not book smart, but none of the characters (with the exception of Hermione in some cases) really show anything approaching what you would expect from the trio that helps take down Voldemort.

They go toe to toe with Voldemort in duels multiple times and survive, the Marauder's Map is even more genius than Hermione's coins, they become animangus when they were really young, even Peter, whom Sirius is bitter about and calls the weakest, manages to brew a potion to bring Voldemort back to life and such a potion is likely complex and dark. Bellatrix is probably the fiercest fighter after Dumbledore and Voldemort, and Sirius manages to hold his own even though his health has probably been damaged by being in Azkaban for so long---he only loses because he gets distracted, not because he's outpowered.

They'd show they could match Death Eaters by that point, and it was clear the Order were mostly getting slaughtered by the Death Eaters before Lily saved everyone.

For what it's worth, on Pottermore, James is listed as exceptional in transfiguration and Sirius in charms. Peter is unfortunately given a fairly uncomplimentary write up so it's hard to say how much he did or did not contribute. But if we take that info at face value, James might have worked with the map and Sirius, the tracking.

****** I mean, he did charm his motorbike to fly. Charms on Muggle technology are really advanced and difficult (see: the Weasleys flying car, and how that was an exceptional magical object). The Pottermore article is probably meant to imply he was the main "architect" of the map, to an extent, given that it's charm based. That area would also cover minor hexes, jinxes -- tools for causing trouble at school, which we know he did. Also, even if you don't personally take Pottermore as canon, there's certainly nothing to /disprove/ this particular point of skill.

Sirius was also an animagus at 15 and, as you mentioned, praised by McGonagall, so he probably kicked ass at transfiguration too. Given that SB/JP were "top of their class" it's sort of like talking about Hermione's - well-rounded, good at everything, but some disciplines are a little more natural than others.

Third year, a known murderer is after Harry. Hermione is screwing with time. Ron is...doing Ron stuff.

Fourth year, Twizard Tournment. Harry and Hermione trying to get him to survive that lil problem. Told he's gonna die this year cuz of the Grim, usual problems of boy wonder. After Ron get's his head outta his ass, time is spent helping that.

Fifth year, Umbitch is there and Harry is busy running an underground defense class. Voldemort's resurrected, no one believes him and his mentors are kinda being weird, no one's really telling him anything, Cedric's dead.

Six year, Harry is trying his Occlumency shields. Mentor is lowkey dying, Snape is DADA professor, watching Malfoy because suspicious behavior and young Death Eaters. Oh and he saw his Godfather die right in front of him by Bellatrix, like the previous year.

But Harry hasn't seen anyone die in front of him besides Lily, but he only saw the Thresals after Cedric's death. So agruably, no, he hasn't seen death. And it doesn't really matter if he's only talked to him like 3 or 4 times, the idea of war hasn't really hit him yet. It has with Cedric's death.

I think the Triwizard Tournament is more time consuming than one would think. In addition, it takes a great mental strength that Harry can't handle after 4/5 year. Not until the threat of Voldemort is gone, plus you got snake man rummaging in his head. Plus running the DA must have been nerve wracking with everything and the political shift, Harry's mental strength is kinda pushing it at this point.

James & Co supposedly begin their training in 3rd year but only completed it in their 5th year. I just think there just isn't any time for anyone to successfully complete animagus. Not only that but with the strain of everything happening, I don't think the Trio could do it.

Likely only Harry would be able to. Although Harry was dumbed down to be pathetically average after the third book, he is the only one of the three I can see succeeding. Hermione is too much of book-orientated person. It'd be hard for her to advance as fast(I don't know if it makes sense, if It doesn't let me know) and while I think Ron is certainly magically able to accomplish it, he lacks motivation.

****** Do you need to be super powerful to become one? Wouldn't knowledge of the process and the desire to try it be enough? (Sure: Fanfiction makes it about brewing complicated potions and/or knowing occlumency and meditation and/or having a form in the first place, but I think everybody kind of does - only dead things don't have a "spirit-animal" (so Voldemort might be unable to after making his horcruxes, but I doubt that - if he wanted to he'd be an animagus and he would probably be a snake of some kind...or maybe one of those thingst they make invisibility cloaks from, because he kind of is an afraid little boy!)) Sure it would take a while, but if the trio wanted, they could IMHO have done it (frankly: I think it is quite the plothole that Rowling didn't give Harry the desire to try it, as it would be something that connnects him to both Sirius and James - and to Remus, too!)

*** I think you're really underestimating the importance of experience in combat and how quick reflexes would effect wizard fights. In the training the Trio got from Dumbledore's Army, they practiced dueling and defence spells a lot by an apparent DADA prodigy, whereas the Marauders seem to be transfiguration and charms prodigies, not to mention both Harry and Ron being quidditch stars means they must have quick reflexes. The Marauders may have been talented and powerful, but they had been essentially firing cheap shots at Snape and the other mini-DE's at school whenever they can get away with it, and even the closest we see to them dueling in Snape's memory show how bad James is at it, since he is so cocky he takes his eyes off his opponent and let's Snape get a hit in. As much as Harry gets shit for always using Expelliarmus, it ends the duel immediately, and the Trio's reflexes and battle instincts would be way higher than the Marauders after fifth year; they wouldn't hesitate, they wouldn't need to think about what spells they use, they'd take their opponents down without pausing.

I find it weird that you use this argument against the marauders when James's exceptional reflexes were actually emphasized contrary to Ron's (or Hermione).

The thing is, except for Harry, most of them were average. His training allowed some to be good enough to be able to defend themselve however none of them got O (at least not Ron or Hermione) while James, Sirius were confident they would get an O and and showed to know the spells Harry had taught to the DA (bar the patronus maybe).

Ron wasn't a Quidditch star. James was, he was the Quidditch hero whose great reflexes had been emphasized.

I don't know what are your sources but defintely not the books. Before even drawing his wand James warned Snape by calling him allowing the Slytherin to draw his wand. James just happened to be quicker than him.

The rest about him cheap shotting mini DE isn't canon.

***** Harry was definitely a Defence prodigy, multiple characters point out how amazing he is at DADA including Lupin himself. Even Harry's OWLs examiners are impressed with him, and he was canonically better at it than Hermione "Brightest Witch of Her Age" Granger. And even though James was a star Quidditch player himself, the canonical evidence we see of his dueling with Snape in OOTP is really poor. He is easily distracted by Lily, he uses flashy spells rather than ones that would end a duel like hoisting someone upside down or the cleaning spell, something an opponent could easily retaliate to, and he is very quick to anger and provoked easily.

Could 7th Year Marauders beat the Trio in an ambush? Absolutely. Could they beat them in a one-on-one fight? If it's for some reason drawn out then probably, but again, the Trio would know to finish them as quickly as possible.

****** James was trying to humiliate Snape and impress Lily and the only reason OWL examiners were impressed with Harry was because he performed a Patronus Charm, which is not a combative spell. Also silent casting is said to be taught in sixth year and Harry and Co never properly learned so 7th year James and Co would be using silent spells. Harry and Co would get destroyed in 1 v 1 's.

Seriously, Hermione's cursed parchment and DA-Coin has nothing on the Marauder's Map and the communications mirrors (note: We don't know if they made them, but there's a good chance that they did!)

As for the fights? Harry is slacker who doesn't use his talents well (Unforgiveables don't realy compensate for lack of knowledge and training), while James was a prodigy in transfiguration, Ron isn't all that great (Sirius can take him easily) and Remus out Hermiones even Hermione herself :)

** The marauders were stronger I think. I mean they created something as complex as the Marauders' Map and they were animagi, that shows that they were very talented, probably geniuses.

Ron and Harry were good but pretty average in talent overall and Hermione was a genius, but she relied mostly on book knowledge while the marauders were more experimental. Also, don't forget that the marauders were able to fight Snape who was kind of a genius in his own right. I think the marauders would win in a fair fight against the trio.

*** Being book smart at abstract bullshit like "making a map" does not translate to combat skills. And neither does "turning into a deer" mean you can out-duel a prodigy at defence.

Fred and George do stuff like that all the time but when it came to defence Harry was the one teaching them despite being two years younger.

Harry is both extremely knowledgeable at defence and a true prodigy at it. He also has all the real world experience and attitude to back it up. (compared to the student Marauders, not the version that actually experienced the war themselves later in life)

In this simulated fight-scene, James & Sirius would start goofing off and using "joke-spells" like they did with Snape. Whereas harry would open with real combat spells to the face. That attitude alone would wipe the floor with the marauders immediately.

17-year-old James was still a kid playing pranks in school. 17-year-old Harry was leading a successful guerrilla campaign against a tyrannical government lead by the worst dark lord in history!

But yeah sure, in between fighting off dementors, killing a basilisk and winning the triwizard tournament he didn't have the time to make a map of his school or turn into a dog, those are clearly superior skills...

** Let's look at some of the highlights of what the Trio accomplished, and think about whether the Marauders could have accomplished the same things.

- Investigate the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone and make it to the final room with the mirror. Doubtful whether the Marauders could do it. The key here isn't magical skill or investigative ability (though I have no doubt the Trio certainly outclass the Marauders in the latter), but Harry's ability to befriend someone like Hagrid, who ended up provided almost every key piece of information. The Marauders would try to do too much on their own, draw too much attention to themselves, and fail.
- Brew Polyjuice Potion as second years. No question the Marauders could have done this.
- Find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. We'll disqualify this one, since it's not the Marauders' fault that none of them is a Parselmouth.
- Learn to cast a patronus as a third year. The Marauders were probably up to this one, too.
- Be willing to die for their friends as third years. I honestly don't know here. It's possible.
- Be chosen as School Champion as a fourth year. No way any of the Marauders could have done it. Meanwhile, if there wasn't an age restriction in place, I easily imagine the Goblet choosing Harry as the legitimate Hogwarts Champion.
- Survive the Triwizard Tournament. Not a fair comparison, since Harry had Crouch Jr. guiding him along.
- Find dates to the Yule Ball. Here's the first one where the Marauders totally outclass the Trio. Though Hermione did go with an internationally famous Quidditch player, so we'll call this one a draw.
- Effectively subvert the likes of Dolores Umbridge. This is where the Trio really shines. The Marauders would have Fred-and-George'd it. Bold and elaborate gestures against the regime, which ends with them expelled from Hogwarts.
- Fight it out with a bunch of Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries and survive the encounter. Should I say it? OK, I'll say it. Even /adult/ Sirius was incapable of this one.
- Become Dumbledore's favorite and be trusted with the secrets of Voldemort's past. This is another one that's unfair, but the Marauders were admitted to the Order of the Phoenix at a very young age, so it's not a clear win for the Trio.
- Win a Quidditch Cup. I'm not sure if we ever learn if James' squad won the Cup, but I'd be shocked if they didn't. Tie.
- Defeat the greatest dark wizard of all time. Again, there are a dozen reasons this one is unfair, but the Trio takes it.

Meanwhile, what did the Marauders do, and were those things achievable for the Trio?

- Become Animagi. If the Trio had learned Neville was a werewolf, is it completely crazy to think they could have learned how to become Animagi to keep him company? It's a little far-fetched to think they'd /want/ to, but if they decided they /had/ to? Yeah, I think they could.
- Create the Marauder's Map. Yeah, no, even Hermione wasn't up to this task. Clear win for Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.

I'm giving the overall edge to the Trio, mainly on the strength of what they were able to do against Dolores Umbridge. Their ability to skillfully use subterfuge and build a network of allies was a skill the Marauders never developed. It's a (dare I say it) Snape-like ability. The Marauders may have had a little more oomph and panache, but they were never as well-rounded as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. In any given encounter the Marauders might come out on top, but over the long run the trends favor the Trio. It's no coincidence that all of the Marauders ended up dying prematurely whereas the Trio all settled down to raise happy families.

** No contest, the trio wins. Unlike the Marauders, they had actual focused training and experience against powerful dark entities and wizards throughout their schooling, Harry especially. There's just no reason to suppose the Marauders would win at that point, talent at magic is not the same as talent in fighting with magic. Harry and Hermione were incapacitating Death Eaters by fourth and fifth year, while the Order was said to have been in bad shape in the war against them. Pretty convincing trio win indeed.

** R1: Harry+friends. Harry is a Defense prodigy, Hermione has exceptional book knowledge. Ron gets shafted here -- he is a fine and stubborn dueller (moreso than Hermione I'd say), but he isn't as magically knowledgeable. When it comes to James+friends, the one I'd say with the best magical knowledge is Remus. The other 2 are good duellers, but doesn't have the same magical knowledge, besides exceptional Transfiguration skills (they did become Animagi). Pretty similar to Ron. Also, the cases we see in the books of the young Marauders (mostly from Severus' POV), they tend to use Severus' spells against him. Whether this is just another bullying tactic, or the fact that they simply don't know better spells themselves I don't know, but I'd say it's a bit of both, and using your enemy's spells against him/her doesn't really seem like a good idea from a strategical PoV -- thus I'd judge lack of magical knowledge.

R2: James+friends. The way I interpret the canon, they already play well with each other team-wise from early school years, and it's only natural to see this develop further into their 7th year. I don't think Harry and Ron are worse duellers on their own (I do think Hermione is), but they don't have the teamwork experience in a simple duel that the Marauders have.
