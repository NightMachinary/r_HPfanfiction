Powerful, early 20's Harry gets sent to a parallel universe where his parents are alive and his (female) alternate dimension counterpart is in her fourth year. Harry becomes the DADA teacher at Hogwarts for the year. I like this one a lot.

** 'I still haven't found what I'm looking for' and 'Browncoat, Green Eyes' are two personal favourites. Essentially, shit goes wrong on Earth and Harry ends up in a sci-fi universe (Star Wars for I Still Haven't and Firefly for Browncoat) and is very powerful and generally baffles the locals with his prodigious magical ability and advanced age.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]]

There's also Black Comedy, which is a fratbro-esque Sirius and Harry fic where they wander around cracking jokes and having sex with any female with a pulse. The AU is just a Harry Potter AU though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]]

I would sort of count Faery Heroes, though Harry becomes more powerful after travelling than before. It's a Harry-Hermione-Luna fic where they steal things.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]]

I can probably come up with more for Harry-Potter-specific AUs (C'est la vie-esque) if needs be, but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head.

** There's linkffn(A Discordant Note) which is crossed with a song of ice and fire, note that it is a sequal to a non crossover and some people find it controversial.

linkffn(Madness at the Gate) crossover with Stargate, also a sequel to a non crossover but has another sequel which is a crossover with Mass Affect.

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal) crossover with a song of ice and fire again, if I remember correctly it is not from his perspective.

linkffn(The Unforseen Variable) is a cross with the Elder Scrolls, dead unfortunately.

linkffn(Darkness in the Void) very interesting crossover with Startrek: The next Generation. Finished, but I wish it had gone on longer.

linkffn(The Telvanni Wizard) crossover with the elder scrolls, but a far distant past version. Dead and unfinished.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

** There are a good few fanfics based off I'm Still Here and From Ruin, and they can be found by just searching "I'm Still Here." If you want something a tad different, I'd recommend [[https://ficrecs.elusiveguy.com/Story/Similar?storyId=9704180][Ficrecs]].
