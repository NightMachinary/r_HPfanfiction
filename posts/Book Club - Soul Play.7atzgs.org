** Glacial pace and I couldn't empathise with any of the characters, so I bailed at about 2/5. Borderline invested enough to keep reading, but not quite.

So what happened ?

** I'm sorry but I couldn't get into this story at all.

The first paragraph sums it up, really: a mass of adjectives and adverbs that means it takes 37 words to say "Snape appeared in London. It was raining".

I'm reminded of the episode of M/A/S/H where Radar subscribes to a writing course and comes out with phrases such as *'The friendly old sun showed his friendly hot face over the mountains of purple majesty as though he was salutating, "Good morning to all."'/ in an attempt to sound clever.

The story is 361,400 words long. It could be 1/3 that length and still not leave out any plot.

** This fic has definitely grown on me more than I expected it to. It's a Snape that I actually enjoy reading that's close to his canon counterpart, which is definitely a shock for me. Interesting dynamics between Narcissa and Snape, even if it's not the healthiest of relationships.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** The best Snape in the fandom, hands down. He's mean, he's cruel, he's sadistic, he's self-interested, he's a schemer and ugly to boot, but he's also highly talented and his loyalties are difficult to discern.

*** I only read part of this fic a while ago, but is this the fic where he thinks at some point about making his own horcrux? I never did see him as the type of person to care about immorality or one that was super power hungry at the point of his life after he killed Dumbledore. I just have viewed him as not caring too much whether he lives or dies other than fulfilling his obligations to see Dumbledore's plan through.

Why spend so much effort helping the light side, attempting to protect students and what not when he could just not. His promise to Lily to protect Harry is kind of moot since he is actively helping Dumbledore's plan which as far as he knows will result in Harry dying. Or maybe he just wants revenge on Voldemort so I guess that makes sense.

The fic reads like it was written before the Deathly Hallows so thats likely why, I just thought some of the characterization was kind of off. Other parts are great though.
