I've always been interested in what the Unspeakables do, it doesn't have to be Harry, but it has to be someone we follow, and get to see what the Unspeakables do.

Can be het/slash/femslash.


** Unspeakable Things is an CoS au where Lockhart wasn't actually a fraud (in that his 'ditz' personality was all an act), but is actually an undercover unspeakable (along with the deceased Lily, James, Frank, Alice, Pandora, and the still-alive Xenophilius) there to recruit Harry and Ginny as unspeakables in training, alongside Luna, who had been trainer as 'mission control' most of her life. The story revolves primarily around Harry and Ginny's training, and later on involves actual missions.

Second Chances by redneks is a back in time story involving unspeakables!Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Susan getting thrown all the way back to the Hogwarts Express the very first time, and fixing the past. For obvious reasons they don't function as unspeakables in the past, but they do retain all their knowledge and experience, and still use their unspeakable code names.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** linkffn(11233445)

Every unspeakable Harry fic I've read portrays him as special forces Harry from the field operations division of the DoM. Never seen a real magical researcher Harry (not working for the DoM anyway; plenty of shit genius baby Harry revolutionizes magic fics going around).

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
