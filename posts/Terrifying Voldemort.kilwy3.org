I've been mulling over a fic idea, and was wondering what could be altered to make Voldemort the most terrifying wizard ever to live. Ideas I've had so far have been more and better hidden horcruxes, playing up mistrust by having people be imperioused everywhere (think ‘mum went to go get some eggs, came back home and AKed her children'), and maybe a Achilles heel style ritual. Any ideas are appreciated!


** IMO the smart, sane Voldemorts are always way more terrifying. Probably because I listen to too many true crime podcasts, but there are some super scary people out in the world and adding too much magic makes it a bit too fantastical. If you really want to scare someone, I think it would be better to focus on the little things instead of horcruxes or a specific weakness. You can always destroy horcruxes or perform some obscure ritual, but you can't really fight against someone who is imperiusing mothers to murder their families.

Things that have made me creeped out/horrified in other fics:

- eating a victim's heart as part of the step to create a horcrux
- forcing someone to kill a newborn. (Or maybe just forcing someone to do something morally reprehensible. It's one thing to read about Death Eaters who enjoy violence and chaos doing these things. It's another to read about someone being coerced into it.)
- holding his own against a bonafide demon. He lost in the end, but it really showed how powerful he was.
- spying through Harry's eyes and taking control and saying things like “you always were a scholar, Severus” in the middle of a potions lesson
- the ones where he makes you like him. He's always a funny, super smart asshole and then BAM there's a terrorist attack the next day and you didn't even realize he manipulated you.
- there was another where Dumbledore thought that giving him with a love potion would get Harry off his back and Voldemort kept sending a lot of creepy courting gifts. Like pieces of the Dursley's in boxes.

** I think a human Voldemort trumps inhuman Voldemort every time when it comes to terror. That is to say, Voldemort before/during the first war would have been much worse than Harry's generation.

He was suave, charming, and likeable. He was a picture-perfect gentleman with genial smiles convincing to everybody who wasn't named Albus Dumbledore. Furthermore, he was highly intelligent - and if you really want to make him scary, you'd really emphasize this.

He'd know every move his opponent would make, constantly ten steps ahead. Maybe he creates traps that complete itself when his opponent blunders into it; a box with no escape, no good options, and he'd watch with a smile as the situation dawns on his unfortunate victim and forces them to choose between a rock and a hard place. Of course, once they choose, his entertainment for the night is finished and he takes them out with an AK.

Another way is to make him a persistence hunter. He makes all of Britain his arena and makes his victims think they might have a hope of escaping his notice. Of course, he knows exactly where they are at all times, and sends his soldiers hunting for them, forcing them to move from safe-house to safe-house, until they run out of sanctuaries and are constantly on the run. Forced to flee with barely any time for sleeping or eating, the noose slowly tightening around them until they go mad with stress, starvation, and sleep deprivation, until he finally gives the order to have them killed, or the victims kill themselves to escape the terror.

Well this did happen in canon...it was mentioned in a passing newspaper article though! But it was happening in the background. :( Too bad it wasn't foreground, so it could make it more real and scary. Like make it happen to a Weasley or something.

** We know that [[https://monster.fandom.com/wiki][Wraith]]!Voldemort wasn't powerful in canon but it could be interesting to change that. Turn him into an indescribable, unspeakable horror, perhaps something [[http://cthulhucommune.blogspot.com/2014/03/describing-indescribable-depicting.html?m=1][Lovecraftian]], whose power grows as the years go by because of his grudge against those who have wronged him. Make him forget about regaining a body. Maybe have him come into contact with some greater, ancient horror and be further corrupted and turned into its slave ala Sauron and the Lord of the [[https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar][Nazgul]] from Lord of the Rings.

** Have the main body go to prison/get-'executed' publicly to lower every one of his enemies guards while his dairy self goes about murdering all of them in secret. No one can pin it on him, given he's in jail/already-dead, nor would they see it coming because he clearly can't be behind it, giving Dairy Riddle free reign to do whatever he wants.

Alternative. Have Dairy riddle become the face of the Death Eater organization on day one, openly admit to every conceivable crime to gather the largest number of people to his trial while main Voldie, in secret, uses every single one of them in a mass-horcrux creating ritual that ends in him anchoring his soul to the entire country.

Result?

He either takes over, or Dumbledore goes off the wall and decides to forcibly undo it, effectively turning himself into the next dark lord out of the sheer dark magic required to manage the feat.

** I mention this fic all the time here but incomplete/abandoned fic Mirror of Maybe has an incredibly ruthless and calculating voldemort for a few scenes --- the thing that stuck with me for years was a returned Voldemort calmly slicing pieces of cooked meat to feed by hand to a muggle he was holding captive.

Psychological torture is definitely a terror inspiring element in a new version of Voldemort.

** I like the idea of a Voldemort with more body horror --- a Voldemort who's bones crack and reshape, warped limbs swiveling with his magic. A Voldemort who swaths himself in silken fabrics and clasped cloaks to hide the bleeding, torn heart that beats outside of his chest, it's raw fragility the cost of his many horcruxes. A Voldemort who brings with him such a thick, suffocating atmosphere of dark magic that the very air around him is too thick to breathe. I really dislike the portrayal of Voldemort in the films, especially aesthetically --- he just looks like some frostbit old guy.

I also like the idea of a Voldemort who has his followers feed in the flesh of muggleborns, to ‘reclaim their stolen magic.' I had a friend who talked about that idea, of a cannibalistic Voldemort. A Voldemort who tears the magic from people's bodies was cool to me as well --- especially if he was to steal the magic or memories of a key character.

** Let Voldemort break the rules of engagement for magical conflict. He targets Muggles and their installations for the sole purpose of sowing as much panic, confusion, and to stretch the resources of the Ministry. Also, causing a bridge to collapse is simple. Hit Muggles with something that will truly cause mass panic, will hit them hard, and kill as many as possible. For example:

- release a modified by magic Ebola virus into drinkable water source for the entire London;

- sabotage a nuclear power plant and make it repeat Charnobyl;

- start murdering high profile Muggle VIPs - preferably in front of mass media.

Hit the magical side with as many underhanded tactics as possible:

- a Muggleborn family on their trip to Diagon Alley? Hold them all under Imperious Curse, equip them with suicide vests, and make them detonate them at key locations of the Alley;

- kill every head of the Magical Law Enforcement - if a new one is appointed, kill them as well, and repeat that process until no one wants that job;

- cut off medical services by razing St Mungoes to the ground and killing the professional staff.
