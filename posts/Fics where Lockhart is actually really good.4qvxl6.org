****** Dude, this isn't print. This is a completely different media, so you can do different things with it. You don't have to read it in one sitting (though I do have to say that I read Atlas Shrugged in one sitting, and NO ONE outside of Russian literature drags things on as long as Rand did). There are multiple ways you could keep track of where you are. You could download it as an epub or pdf and use a reader that can keep track, bookmark whichever chapter you're on, leave the tab open, a word document or notebook note, and so on.

Also, for something like ASOIAF, they'd probably do multiple omnibus collections for the series, like two or three books each. See the omnibus collections for The Belgariad and The Mallorean.

******* They can't omnibus ASOIAF, because like I said it already begins to push the limit of what can be printed. Heck, quite a few countries have had to /divide/ books like ASoS for publication in other countries.

Knowing when and how to split up a story is also part of being a good writer. It may be a different class from original works, but this is one place where fanfiction shows its lack of editing. At the least this writer seems to have delineated their story.

************ Oh, definitely. In some ways it reminds me the most of pulp fiction magazines from the 20s-40s, where stories would be printed chapter by chapter in sequential (or at least chronological) order by issue.

A particular example is actually older than that, with Dickens' Great Expectations (which I hate). That was published serially, and Dickens would alter the plot based on how the readers reacted or wrote in, leading to an incredibly twisted and meandering tale. This is very similar to those crappy fanfictions where the author puts up polls for what should happen to the story.

Though I don't agree with the idea that reader input will lead to crappy fanfiction - sometimes, a review will raise a point or question that fits in very well, and in the electronic age, editing and rewriting past chapters is far easier than in the 19th century.

And I didn't actually know that about the 19th century stories. Makes sense though, now that I think of it. I only knew of Great Expectations because that fact came up when we read it back freshman year of HS.

************* I think I've actually figured out what exactly unsettles me with single fics that are that long. They tend to run into structural problems, with everything building to one far-off climax and the author neglecting to keep up the regular, normal book length payoffs. It was an issue with ASOIAF too; the last two books were actually planned out as one and they kind of suffered for it (plus we haven't actually gotten a payoff yet).

Plus I don't trust the author's ability to keep pumping out to the 1.5 or even 2 million mark, so I usually don't pick this sort of fic up until it's complete. I'm not saying it's definitely the case with this author, just that it puts me on guard.

Do you know what chapter the first year stops at? I want to give the story a try anyway.

I do want to say that first year isn't great, but that's because his purpose is to subvert the usual WBWL and Slytherin!Harry tropes, and first year is when he establishes the tropes in order to do so.

It's not pushing the limits of what's possible, it's pushing the limits of what's practical and cost-effective. When you get too long binding and printing costs go up and profit goes down.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  OC becomes Neville and starts Hogwarts, helping the story characters grow and try to alleviate the extension of the purebloods influence in Hogwarts through a Student Council. More emphasis on minor characters and battles, minimal extra OCs. On indefinite hiatus.

** Well, there's a mention of Lockhart being very good in “Seventh Horcrux”. Those who read it know that [[/spoiler][it's all Harry having issues with seeing reality for what it is]], so you may or may not want to count it ([[/spoiler][probably not]]).
