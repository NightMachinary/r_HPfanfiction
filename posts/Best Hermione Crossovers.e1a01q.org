Preferably well-explained. Please no bashing fics, and I'm fine with slash. Thanks!

** Linkffn(gods among us) updated recently.

Battlestar Galactica is the setting, with Harry and Hermione as transplants. They're in their mid twenties and very capable and basically make the plot of the recent BSG go much more nicely using magic, and explain some unexplained elements of BSG with HP style wizards. I kinda didn't like BSG but I finished it, and am enjoying this one.
