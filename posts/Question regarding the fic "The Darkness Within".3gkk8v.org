Hey, i was reading this fic when ff went down, i found the epub version on p0ody files but i also found something else called "The Darkness Within:The Rewrite" and it's summary talks about a triology. Since FF is down i don't know what the deal is, should i read the original one? Rewritten one? Is rewritten even complete? Original's summary doesn't talk about a triology, is triology complete?\\
Thanks in advance.


** Original is complete.

Trilogy the Original is in, is complete.

Rewrite is a alternate version of Original that is in progress.

** Your best option is to read the Rewrite and then pick up the original trilogy from where the Rewrite leaves off. The Rewrite quality is infinitely better than the rest, so just read that instead.

** "The Darkness Within 2.22: This is (not) a Rewrite."

Kudos if you catch the reference
