Harry raised an eyebrow, "But why should I compete in the tournament, again?"

"Binding magical contract." Crouch repeated.

"Yes, but what does that actually mean? How exactly is this binding magical contract supposed to make me participate in this tournament?"

Dumbledore shuffled a hand around in his robes before pulling out /Fanfiction For Dummies (Wizarding Edition)/, and flipping through it, "Goblet of Fire, Goblet of Fire...see page 654. Here it is, according to common fanon, failing to participate in the Triwizard Tournament will mean that you'll be stripped of your magic, turning you into a squib in the best case."

Harry raised his eyebrow...or tried to, but because it was still raised from before, he only succeeded in waggling his eyebrows a bit, "So if I don't participate in this tournament with all kinds of magical creatures trying to kill me, I'm mutilated and crippled for life, or roughly equivalent."

Dumbledore thought about it, "If you assume having your magic stripped away to be akin to have a similar impact on your life to having your arms cut off or something like that, yes." he agreed.

"And it's definitely binding, there's no termination clause or anything like that."

Dumbledore flipped through the /Fanfiction For Dummies/ book again, "Generally no, some fics have it that you're only bound to the tournament once you actually start participating, and there's some others that have Barty Crouch Jr. as the one to lose his magic since he entered your name in..."

"Spoilers!" Mad-Eye Moody and Barty Crouch Sr. interjected at the same time.

"...But for the most part, no, it's absolutely definitely a binding contract with no way out and that will squibbify you if you try to back out." Dumbledore finished.

Harry was silent for a few seconds, before he raised a finger, "Okay, so I need to bring up a couple of concerns I have about this."

"One, being forced to do X activities, on pain of permanent life-altering meta-physical injury, without any other way out of it, stinks to me of slavery, textbook definition. And, given that the Goblet of Fire is forcing this kind of slavery on innocent young schoolchildren, I have to ask, why isn't it considered a dark artifact and why hasn't it been destroyed yet?"

He raised another finger, "And two, what, in these fanfics, possesses you all to use such a magic item, with such dangerous properties, in a friendly competition between schools? I know it's a cheap excuse for why I can't just go 'nah' in those fanfics, but seriously, the 'lose your magic' clause raises more and worse questions than it answers!"

"It is somewhat excessive for a school tournament, yes." Dumbledore agreed, "It makes one wonder where the dumb silly idea of 'a contract can make you lose your magic' came from in the first place. Like those swear-on-your-magic cliches."

"I just had a thought." Dolores Umbridge suddenly piped up, despite her not supposed to be being in the room or even in the plot at all until the fifth book, "If you can have a contract suck away someone's magic, that actually gives my Muggle-Born Registration Committee some legitimacy, doesn't it? Because you have proven use of methods that can drain magic out of a witch or wizard, the idea of transferring that same magic to a muggle or muggle-born stops sounding like a complete fabrication."

** One of the points of fanfiction is to explore and interpret the events of canon. Losing your magic has come to be a quick and simple explanation for what 'Binding Magical Contract' means, because the consequences for competing in the tournament are so large (possible death) and authors feel there needs to be a commensurately high consequence for backing out --- otherwise, canon Harry could have just done so.

We only see one other example of binding magical contract in canon (Hermione's DA contract) and the consequence of that was to have 'sneak' scarred into the person's forehead. I agree it would be interesting to see some other consequences for the GoF explored. Would canon Harry compete in the tournament if it was explained that the consequence of not doing so was to have a second scar proclaiming him to be a coward stamped on his noggin?

Ranting about a specific trope is all well and good, but let's get some creative alternatives going.

1. Transfigured into an animal (sentient) for the duration of the tournament.
2. Blindness
3. Cursed to never finish fourth year until commitment is honoured (defence position style curse or possibly time travel shenanigans.)
4. (Bonus --- because this is fanfic) Gender swapped.

Unless you postulate that someone implanted into Harry memories of receiving correspondence from Ron and Hermione that summer (or something similarly far-fetched), the very popular fanon that Ron and Hermione didn't write to Harry during the summer before OotP is simply false.

Now you've softened it a little to saying that Dumbledore "defined" nature of her contact, whatever that means. That's progress. Eventually, we might get to something actually consistent with canon, like "Hermione followed Dumbledore's very sensible advice for maintaining operational security of the Order."

By the way, why is it that The Great Isolation gets treated like a character-defining moment for Hermione but not for Ron? Ron was there too, he followed Dumbledore's suggestions just as fastidiously, yet nobody ever calls /him/ a teacher's pet.

*********** The thing about HP, the series, narrative is we get to see things from HP, the characters, perspective. We don't experience stuff as it is, but as how Harry Potter saw, heard or felt something. Everything is colored with his opinion.

His opinions on things and events are filtered by his world view which was developed in an abusive household where he was living in a cupboard. It's not a normal upbringing.

The biggest twist he ever got was Snape's memory. Harry Potter's views on Snape were bare to all. Harry loathed Snape, and wanted him dead for many things, including murder of Dumbledore. But after seeing Snape's memory Harry's view changed so much so that he named is son after that man.

That memory was a shocker to Harry Potter but many fans saw it coming miles away. Despite seeing events from Harry's PoV some fans knew that things behind the scenes weren't going as Harry thought they were.

Similarly other events in Canon can be interpreted in ways other than how Harry Potter interpreted them.

--------------

Nobody calls him a teacher's pet because he wasn't that perceptive any way. He didn't have insight on things and was slow on uptake. And Harry, or viewers, didn't expect him to keep an eye on stuff and be eyes and ears of someone who did more against voldemort than all the Order combined in both wars.

He was a happy-go-lucky jealous guy struggling to make his place in a big family who became friends with the most famous wizard of his generation because he couldn't find a compartment with an empty seat in whole train till he reached Harry's one.

This is presuming that keeping Harry in the dark was a kind of betrayal (i.e., failing to stick to him). In actuality, keeping him in the dark, while unpleasant, was the least bad option, for reasons I have given upthread. Information, such as disposition and plans of the Order, was to be communicated on a need-to-know basis. Harry didn't need to know.

There's precedent and postcedent (broom in PoA and parchment jinx in OotP) for Hermione keeping Harry in the dark for his own good, all without any prompting from Dumbledore. You seem to be demanding of Hermione the same blind obedience towards Harry that you seem to imply she has towards Dumbledore. Hermione isn't Harry's appendage any more than she is Dumbledore's.

#+begin_quote

Now who's using loaded language? "Keep him hooked" in this case just means to stay in touch. As for not telling him anything, again, it's a terrible idea to send sensitive information through an insecure medium like owl post to a person with a mental link of unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive. Do you disagree?

So, Hermione should've ditched Harry and Ron after the Troll thing? Because, I don't recall them being particularly helpful to her after that, while being a huge drain on her time and constantly dragging her into dangerous situations. (Not to mention that without Harry and Ron, she wouldn't have been exposed to the Troll in the first place.)

Funnily enough, her ditching them kind of happened in HBP, and we all know how /that/ ended.

You know, Dumbledore wasn't just a school headmaster. He was also the leader of all forces then fighting against Voldemort, the only bulwark against Voldemort's takeover, and an uber-wizard with a century of general life experience and decades of experience fighting Dark uber-wizards, as well as decades' track record of fighting for Muggleborn rights. So, even if we suppose that Hermione couldn't figure out why Dumbledore had asked her what he had, it would have probably been a good idea to obey anyway, because, yes, he almost certainly /does/ know better.

What's more dangerous: withholding information from a friend who can't act on it anyway and would probably do something he'd regret if he tried, or disobeying your side's commander in chief?

Sociopath = Lack of remorse and shame do to lack of emotions.

Psychopaths = a person suffering from chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior.

I never said that people are emotionless or violent. People can be selfish by giving their food/money to needy people too. May be it brings them fame, power, followers or simply inner satisfaction.

Someones political ascension might be on shoulders of people he helped shelter or feed. A military commander might give free time to his soldiers because this will replenish and refresh his soldiers for next big mission.

Genes are selfish. They do everything in their power to make it certain that they are survive and are passed on to next generation. People care about their families because they are fine tuned to care about them out of need. This need may be based on comfort, monetary gains or personal pleasure.

Similarly these very same people and their ambitions may be hindrance to others. Someone giving everything in charity may be ruining economy in long term? Or depriving his own family of much needed attention because he was so invested in getting the inner satisfaction and peace from helping the needy people that he didn't care about his own family who weren't part of his activities as they weren't helpful to any of his selfish desires.

--------------

I appreciate that role of Dumbledre and accept that as a commander of one side he sometimes do what's best for the greater cause. Every leader does that. Sometimes the greater cause might hurt people that we care about. Dumbledore bashers think that Dumbledore's plan were hurtful to Harry.

So, considering that Harry wouldn't have been able to do anything useful with that information, was in the safest place he could be, had repeatedly shown himself to act impulsively, without regard for consequences, and is pathetically easy to manipulate [1], yes, it was a good idea to keep him in the dark.
2. That doesn't answer my question. Do you dispute that it was a good idea on its own merits? Harry seems to instinctively disobey any advice he is given, no matter how justified. That's great for resisting the Imperius, but it's terrible for every other situation.

2) It's getting repetitive. I don't think we are getting anywhere.

3) When in 5th year she /finally/ did something even her peers were surprised at Hermoine for breaking rules and standing up to teachers.

4) Dude there are countless things on it. I'm sure you have read all the arguments too. But let's start with things that aren't mentioned.

How is it that secret hiding location of Potter's was so easily known to anyone. What was Hagrid doing when Sirius came to pick Harry? According to Book three, and Hagrid's admission, Sirius told he was godfather of Harry and should be given custody of Harry but Hagrid denied saying Dumbledore asked him to bring Harry to him. All the while Dumbledore's other pet was prancing around at 4 Pivet drive /watching/ Harry's relative.

About serious: I'm sure Dumbledore has no idea of Sirius's loyalty as he had no spies in Voldemort's forces. Such a sad little old man. If only he had an informant in Voldemort's inner circle.

It all seems co-incidence at best and a planned mechanization at worst. It might be either his stupidity or manipulation. I pity him he was this stupid as a stupid person forced to lead a war is a victim cruel fate. I won't blame if he planned it. Leaders in war have to make hard decisions. But that's doesn't mean Harry fans won't call him out on it. Especially if there are people who will try to justify 10 years of child abuse. Living in cupboard under stairs isn't a perfect model of happy childhood.

******************** 1. Decisions should be made based on their expected future consequences. It doesn't matter how many times Harry had confronted Voldemort, because Voldemort still couldn't reach him while he's at 4 Privet Drive. So, there was no benefit to keeping Harry in the loop -- except for Harry's personal feelings -- but there was a great deal of risk to owling him sensitive information. Just hypothetically, what do you think would have happened had Ron or Hermione written about Lupin departing for some werewolf enclave, and Voldemort had intercepted the owl or read the information through the horcrux link? (Remember, Dumbledore didn't know about the limitations of the link at the time.) Or, if they had written something about Dumbledore recruiting for the Order, and the letter had fallen into Umbridge's hands?
2. Actually, I think I'm finally coming to understand where you're coming from. Correct me if I am wrong, but when you write "Again his friends should stick by his side, not other side.", you mean that Dumbledore is the "other side" (and Voldemort is yet another side), which makes Harry is the leader of his own side, separate from Dumbledore's. Then, if Dumbledore isn't on Harry's side, then someone (e.g., Ron or Hermione) following his advice in a way that keeps information from their side's leader (i.e., Harry) is a betrayal of their side. In particular, if Hermione takes Dumbledore's advice, that's still picking a side other than Harry's, even if she would -- independently -- conclude that the advice is sound. Am I getting this right?
3. Her peers had no idea what she'd been up to in the first 4 years, so their opinions aren't very valuable. And even then, she only looks like an obedient student next to Harry and Ron, who act like rules, no matter how reasonable, are for other people. Hermione's is actually the one with the healthy attitude towards authority.
4. So you don't actually mean that Dumbledore /ruined/ Harry's life, only gave him a crappy childhood. That's a bit different. Now, the grand conspiracy stuff isn't new. Godric's Hollow was never a secret location, and when the Fidelius was broken, anyone could find it. Unless Snape somehow observed Voldemort's /every/ interaction, they had no way of knowing that Sirius /wasn't/ a Death Eater, if Voldemort practiced any level of operational security, Snape would have never seen Pettigrew. What Dumbledore did know is that the Order had been betrayed and that number and identity of the traitors was unknown, so when Sacrificial Protection fell into his lap, he put Harry in the only place where he couldn't be betrayed by any agent of Voldemort -- with Petunia. An unhappy childhood is better than death by a vengeful Death Eater who'd gotten his hands on Felix Felicis.

And, it seems to me that Harry's fans tend to have an overinflated view of Harry's magical and leadership talents; which leads them want Harry to be Dumbledore's co-equal leader in the fight against Voldemort. When he doesn't actually take that role, they invent all sorts of conspiracy theories about how his potential was crippled by a Manipulative!Dumbledore.

3) Her peers had no idea and yet what we read as canon is actually opinion of Harry Potter instead of what's actually happened. So if we are reading opinion of others heard by Harry Potter than perhaps they have some merit. If this fiction was 3rd person omniscient and have said that she wasn't a pet but so and so tend to think her to be one then may be I would have accepted.

4) Dude don't expect me to post everything. I am sure Dumbledore bashers have written countless blogs on why they consider Harry's life was troubled by deliberate or mistaken choices of Headmaster.

5) Fans tend to have different opinions. Some believe Dumbledore was a good leader, others think he forsake far too many on road to greater good. Some people think that training and later successfully leading rag tag school children and thwarting DoM adventure counts as something, others might consider it....? Dumbledore doesn't seem to have done anything that actively stopped any of Voldemort's plan, except ring? Which coincidentally coincides with his life long fascination (obsession) with deathly hallows.

********************** 1. Good point about not being certain about the link -- though Dumbledore probably suspected -- but sending confidential stuff over owl was still a terrible idea for reasons I had outlined. Your hypothesis that Voldemort could have attacked Harry at 4 Privet Drive just by following an owl is inconsistent with actions of everyone involved, good and bad. If you really believe that he could have done that, can you explain 1) Why did Dumbledore, who certainly did want Harry alive at least at that point, leave him there? 2) Why didn't Voldemort attack him there for two and a half summers' worth, including after Dumbledore died, but attacked the moment Harry left 4 Privet drive without intention to return? The only answer I can see is that Sacrificial Protection, enhanced by Dumbledore's own magic, held until Harry would have turned 17 or left Petunia's home forever. And, the Elder Wand is just a really good wand with a weird loyalty system; Grindelwald had it when Dumbledore beat him, for example.

2. So I did get the underlying philosophy right, basically? My post wasn't meant to judge that position, but as an attempt to pass an "Ideological Turing Test" -- to restate your position in my own words in a way that you would agree with.

3. "Peers" was your word, not mine; if you had written that Harry was surprised or that her friends were surprised, I would have replied accordingly. In any case, so what if Harry thought it was unusual? Harry isn't actually that great a judge of character; and given his general attitude, of course he would confuse general politeness with blind obedience.

4. Nobody denies that Dumbledore could have done better -- though whether he could have done better given his knowledge, resources, and other responsibilities is a different question -- but notice that you've gone from "ruined" to merely "troubled".

5. Dumbledore abandoned Greater Good when Ariana died. If Dumbledore were after the greater good, he would have stuck with Grindelwald and they would have happily taken over the world together. His supposed obsession with Hallows is also largely fanon. That was Grindelwald. As for what he did against Voldemort, again, Harry didn't have need-to-know; but, do notice that Voldemort took the Ministry a month after his death.

   Harry training DA was conceived and organized by Hermione, betrayed by someone brought into the group via Harry (who brought Cho who brought Marietta), with the damage limited by Hermione's parchment jinx (which kept Marietta from giving details until she could be Obliviated). Then, Harry led everyone into Voldemort's trap, and once there, they only survived because the terrain favored running away and because Death Eaters were using kid gloves. (Notice how only Hermione was targeted with a lethal Dark curse; Harry and the pureblooded kids were targeted with Stunners and similar.) Even so, most of his friends were hurt and his godfather killed. That's not a success. That's a disaster, slightly mitigated by Voldemort's return being revealed to the Ministry -- which was definitely not something Harry had planned for. So, yes: it definitely counts for something. That something is that Harry may be good at keeping his head under fire and at some tactical leadership, but he should be kept as far away from planning and strategic decisions as possible.

Sacrificial protection? I don't how people even swallow that pill. Lily can't be the only mom in war to come between her child and death.

Secondly she decided to hide under fidelus and wasn't expecting to be betrayed. Why would she set a blood protection at Petunia's house that would need Harry's stay at Petunia's house?

4) I used troubled because I felt like some people get triggered by 'ruined'. I got the vibe that you were getting defensive about it. Anyway we discussed how coincidentally everything fell on Halloween night. Let's talk about coincident about Stone, Wraith and Harry's first year at school.

5) Ah! He had all the major positions in Magic world except minister who was easy to handle. He had Elder Wand and that cloak when series started. Later he hunted resurrection stone. His only contribution in 1st and 2nd war against Voldemort mention in canon is him retrieving that stone. I wonder why? Of cousrse he took ministry after Dumbledore's death. It was a power gap, that Dumbledore had tightly under his thumb. Before you try to say things like he did it for Greater Good of Britain let's realize that 'dark creatures' like Werewolves (and others) were still outlawed under his ministry. An innocent, and I'm sure he isn't the only one (he is just the one that Harry noted and we got to see), suffered for his incompetence at best and manipulation for Greater Good at worst.

I will call it PIS. Villains being villain and doing dumb stuff, or performing substandard, to suite a plot.

************************ 1)

That's exactly right. Sacrificial Protection isn't about hiding a place. Sacrificial Protection is about protecting the person or a group of people. Does it protect communications from being intercepted? Probably not. And, we do know that Dobby could intercept owl post.

Now, Voldemort could and did (in DH) locate 4 Privet Drive, but he couldn't hurt Harry while Harry lived there, until Harry turned 17 or left his home. The Ministry always knew where Harry lived, and nobody at the Ministry killed a parent of Harry's, so they aren't bound by the Sacrificial Protection.

Lily was certainly not the only such mom; but she was probably the only one to be offered to be spared if she let the child be killed. In any case, Harry reproduced the feat in DH. The blood protection activated on its own, and then Dumbledore took it and extended it to 4 Privet Drive -- where Harry's only surviving blood relative lived.

2) I'd still like to know whether I restated your point of view accurately.

4)

My point is that the supposed harm that Dumbledore caused Harry tends to be highly exaggerated.

5)

I apologize in advance how this is going to sound, but I would really like to know: have you read all the canon books, and if so, how long ago? Some of what you write directly contradicts them and sounds like it was taken from Manipulative!Dumbledore fic. For example, in canon werewolves can live freely, even if they aren't allowed near children, and vampires can be guests at a Hogwarts party. Greater Good was a philosophy Dumbledore abandoned more than 50 years before canon events.

As for the claim that Dumbledore didn't do enough, remember that point about the story being in a limited point of view? That means that we only get to know about Dumbledore's work what Harry knew, and Harry didn't know much at all.

************************* 1) We don't know what happened that night except that Voldemort killed his parents and then he tried to kill Harry. What stopped that curse? We can only theorize but can't say for certain. Canon only tells us what Dumbledore told Harry. And I don't really want to take his words as truths. His was commander of one side and when defeat of other side is linked to death of your trump card then you try to steer your trump card toward certain goals. Dumbledore knew about soul anchor in Harry's body.

Anyway back to how that love part. Neville's mom was in same position. I guess he must have some kind of protection too if love, sacrifice and choice is the key?

Harry's sacrifice (or love) didn't do shit for anybody. AK hits souls and drives it out of body. Voldemort's AK hit Harry and drove 1 soul out of Harry's body. If it was same thing as Lily's then everyone in castle should have survived since Harry willingly sacrificed his life for people in castle.

2) There are never only two sides in war. Yes to that extent I think you paraphrased my ideology better.

5) My point about “dark” creature came from last war. All the “dark” creatures supported “dark” lord. They were marginalized in supposedly good era.

How do you know what Dumbledore knew and when? You tell me to be skeptical of anything he says, yet you speak with a great deal of confidence about things you couldn't possibly know about.

Nobody offered to spare Neville's mom if she'd just let them kill Neville. In fact, Bellatrix, when she tortured the Longbottoms, wanted information about what happened to Voldemort; Neville in his crib was irrelevant. So, no sacrificial protection.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters killed a lot of Hogwarts defenders before Harry's sacrifice -- even though they were attacking a fortress, and they weren't able to kill any after, even though the defenders no longer had the Hogwarts walls to protect them. Do you have a better explanation?

2)

OK. So, my thinking is that while there were other "sides" in the war (like the Ministry), Harry and his friends just didn't represent enough combat or institutional power to be one. At best, they were the Junior Order of the Phoenix, needing adults for resources and if any actual fighting needed to be done. Even within that, there was no "chain of command". Harry doesn't outrank Ron and Hermione. So, Hermione and Ron don't report to Harry any more than he reports to them.

5)

It makes sense if you consider that Dumbledore /doesn't/ actually believe in Greater Good, and he doesn't want to have direct political power: he wants to guide, not govern. That's why he's happy presiding over legislative and judiciary bodies, and running a school, but he never became the Minister of Magic, even though he almost certainly could. This, in turn, stems from his past with Grindelwald and the temptations of power.

So, yes, werewolves faced discrimination after Voldemort's fall. Dumbledore can't change the society's attitudes overnight, and if he tries, any reforms he forcibly imposes are liable to snap back when he dies of old age.

2) Harry's friends were inconsequential in bigger picture. In realistic and pragmatic terms they were expendable, replaceable as they weren't vital to any part of story. Yes, they helped Harry in his adventures, but anything they did could have been done by anyone else too.

5) Werewolf (and other "dark" creatures) had no choice! Remember Death Eaters was a minority group. The whole reason they picked arms and violent movement against a majority 'liberal' side was that they had no real political voice. Dumbledore's Phoenix party, admirable may be, but doesn't justify it's existence as ministry was already on their side. Death eaters were fighting against ministry which had The Great "Dark Lord" slayer Dumbledore as it's representative. They were pushed back to the wall by ministry with all the rules against "dark" arts and "dark" creatures.

And, similarly, wizadring society is shown as making slow but steady social progress: more and more laws are passed against abusing Muggles, they have their first Muggleborn Prime Minister, and the Wolfsbane Potion is developed, so give a decade or two, werewolves would probably be accepted as well.

As for the animal punishment, I could totally see a frog bowl on the teacher's table in the great hall to hold the victims.

Depends on the meaning of participation. It's perfectly possible (and indeed very common) for contracts to oblige someone to use "reasonable endeavors" or "best endeavors" to do something.

I'm not sure if the binding magical contract in question is written down somewhere or if it's something more esoteric. But either way there is presumably something which determines the meaning of participation, whether that be the Goblet itself or some document which outlines the rules of the tournament as agreed by the respective Ministries.

************ Yes, I think it works.\\
Personally, I see the goblet as a format (a bit like the paper on which you would usually sign a contract) and an enforcer of the contract, as well as a judge which select the champions.\\
I think willingly putting your name in the goblet is the equivalent of willingly signing a more usual contract. Once the selection of the champions has been made, a contract is created, binding the winners, and then the goblet enforces it somehow.\\
In that case, Crouch would have 1. entered Harry and tricking the Goblet into 'thinking' that Harry himself was the one doing it and 2. tricked the Goblet into 'thinking' there was a 4th school in which Harry belonged to.\\
If magic can certify your signature when you sign a contract, it can probably certify a piece of parchment you toss in a goblet, too. It's maybe just not as secure, which would explain why Crouch could circumvent it while magical contracts are usually foolproof.\\
I mean, the weak point has to be the Goblet. Otherwise, it would be a loophole in contract magic itself, which wizards would use all the time.

Under Imperius, though, People wouldn't sign willingly. I don't think it would work. Through a creative use of the memory charm, it might be possible.

This is legitimate, yes.

There are a lot of reasons the Goblet stripping you from magic doesn't work well. That it enforces slavery which is wrong and thus can't happen isn't one of them. Wrong things can happen.

For what it's worth, there's a small plot arc like that in [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][/Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council/]] (Buffy × HP × Addams Family crossover).

IIRC, Wednesday Addams explains that their family stand for individualism and personal freedoms first and foremost, and for that reason they've been known to hunt and destroy “free will”-negating artefacts for centuries.

She describes Goblet of Fire as one of the meanest of them yet, and says that they've been previously unable to do anything about it because it's usually being very well hidden or guarded by the wizards.

** I have always liked the idea of magical fairness. You know how there are story's and fables where if you help a disguised genie, they are obliged to help you back, or how a witch can demand a first born child in exchange for magical cabbages which save the mothers life. So I could definitely see it so that the higher the reward, the harder it is to break the contract. And by harder, I mean that if you break it something happens. Maybe Harry could not use that concept of magical fairness the next time. Maybe when he needs it most, his luck will abandon him. Or maybe he is labeled oathbreaker, and would be incapable of swearing on his magic, which would actually be quite terrible. But, since he didn't enter it purposefully, and doesn't really have much to gain, but everything to lose, he could probably break it off with minimal consequences. In my mind anyway.

It's such a small leap in logic too... it really makes me mad that no-one even thinks of that idea. Here you have a device that has been proven to be able to make people do things against their will and is able to punish them in some esoteric way if they refuse yet nobody considers to use this as a weapon against their very real enemies?

Someone really needs to write a story about how there's some kind of degenerative mental disease that has infected Wizarding society. It would explain why Muggleborns are reasonable when they join and then after they are infected start becoming gradually more retarded.

#+begin_quote
  "The Triwizard Tournament may have started as just a friendly competition between the schools of magic... until the fourteenth century. That's when a scandal involving Beauxbatons' champion -- who was from Lorraine -- and Durmstrang's champion, from neighboring Burgundy, triggered a minor border war between the two duchies."

  ...

  "But there's no binding between you and the Goblet; that'd be impossible since you didn't enter the Tournament yourself. By definition -- by the very fundamentals of contract law, magical or not -- you cannot have a contract unless both parties agree to it. An enslavement, maybe, but not a contract. But there is a binding treaty - and make no mistake, treaty is just another word for contract - between the governments of the schools' champions. That treaty requires them to ensure their citizen will follow the rules."

  "Wait," Harry said, incredulous. "You mean the British Ministry is going to make me compete? What happens if I say no?"

  "If you defy all their persuasive efforts," she said, looking oddly solemn, "they will do the only thing they can to fulfill the contract. Since they must ensure that their citizens compete, if you refuse to compete, then they will exile you, and strip away your identity as a magical British citizen."
