Please recommend fanfics where Harry doesn't want to save the Wizarding World or think of it as his responsibility, but wants to kill Voldemort for pure unadulterated ReVeNgE. He wants to shit on his corpse and kill the fucker again and again.

Prefer completed fics. Thanks.


** linkffn(A Flower for the Soul by TheBlack'sResurgence)

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him. The sequel, Wrath and Remorse, is published on this site.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
