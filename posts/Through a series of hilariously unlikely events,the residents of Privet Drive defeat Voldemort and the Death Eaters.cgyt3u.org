** "Was it love, Dumbledore...?"

"Yes.... and no. Petunia's love for her good china was a powerful force, indeed, one that Death Eaters could never understand, eating as they typically do off cheap throw-away styrofoam. Voldemort's curse, as powerful as it was, was no match for her fury over the Royal Doulton. What chance did Tom Riddle have, confronted with that kind of ancient magic? Nothing in his life had prepared him for that."

** There was one that had a panicked Dudley try to escape the house during a DE attack, and when exiting from his bedroom window, fell on, and crushed Voldemort.

​

I laughed for about 15 minutes.

​

I personally am working on one where Lucius decides to offload the diary in Harry's first year, rather than 2nd, and actually gives it to Harry, who takes it home.

Spotting the diary, Dudley steals it because he's a little jerk, with Harry never noticing.

Dudley takes the diary to Smeltings and upon finding out that rather than being a bully, he is bullied by the upper forms, so he hides in his room and uses the diary to write incredibly bad fan fiction for 1980 TV shows. He starts with an Airwolf fic and the resulting assault on the English language slowly drives Diary!Tom insane, until he commits suicide, causing each of the other Horcruxes to all do a step down with each falling to the previous container, so the ring's soul fragment is pulled to the diary, the locket's to the ring, the cup to the locket, the diadem to the locket, and Harry's to the diadem. (Nagini having not been Horcruxed yet)

And Dudley starts his next epic, maybe an A-team tale, causing the new poor soul fragment to suicide, wash, rinse, repeat.

Working Title: Dudley Dursley, Savior of the Magical World.

*** I need this in my life. The Horcruxes just committing suicide over reading Dudley's fanfiction is hilarious.

** ''This magic stuff is all a load of Rubbish'' Harry stood transfixed on the side in-front of him Voldemort, the person from his nightmares was there and vernon dursley was there tearing Voldemort a new one . 'Go on then use your twig' Vernon taunted at Voldemort. Harrys mouth fell open Voldemort seemed to be waving his wand constantly and yet Vernon stood tall and proud and was laughing at Voldemort's attempts.

Harry had figured when the death eaters had shown at privet drive he was done for, He remembered the sight of voldemort standing above him rising his wand ready to strike him down... only to be socked in the face by an angry Vernon dursley who had then preceded to Pummel Voldemort brutally.
