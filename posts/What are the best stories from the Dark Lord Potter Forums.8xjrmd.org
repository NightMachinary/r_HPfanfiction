I have always been a fan of Harry Potter And The Boy Who Lived, but that's dead as a doornail. Other than that, what are the best stories, one shots, and crossovers to come from DLP?


** The stories exclusively on DLP are usually just unfinished or unedited ones that were never uploaded to FFN. DLP isn't really a place where the end results of stories go, just where they're reviewed and revised before the polished products are released.

The only things you'll most likely find are contest entries, which are primarily oneshots.

** They show their age and are also on FFN but anything by Silens Cursor. Specifically linkffn(Speak Softly, Love) is rather incredible. It's on DLP but I linked you it from FFN.

  Antonin Dolohov hadn't always been a Death Eater. He once was a champion. He once had a family. He once had a wife. This is the story how he lost it all. Winner of the DLP July Politics Competition.

** There's a rare gem of a HP/Annita Blake crossover by Nuhuh (master of crazy!powerful!Harry).

*** This was my answer the last time this thread popped up. The truth is that there's not many fics that are exclusive to DLP and are long enough to be worth mentioning.

** I remember seeing a hilarious post, written in House-Elf pidgin, in which Harry dies and Dobby performs the Bone-of-the-father etc. ritual, except that he takes a very creative interpretation of some of the components. I haven't been able to find it again, however.
