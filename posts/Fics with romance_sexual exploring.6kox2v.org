Looking for fics that more or less follows the books plot. M/F pairing, but no Ginny please!

I always skip over the sex scenes in Hp cause usually it's cringeworthy. But I was reading Whiskey Accident and kept thinking that it would be great reading some M rated exploring from when they start having sex (preferably not before 16-17 age). Like H/Hr when Ron left them in DH, and Hr stumbling in on H jerking off and going from there. Or just the beginning of a relationship where everything is new. I'm not explaining this well. Preferably older women but anything goes except Ginny and slash

I am not looking for a smut story, but a story with a plot that has good sex scene writing. Mostly read femslash and I still haven't found HP sex scene that I don't just skip.

Thank you

** The two fics I can think that might qualify for your request of are both Harry/Ginny, but in both of them Ginny is super OOC. Dunno if these will do it for you, but you aren't getting much response, so here they are anyway.

Linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker) takes place in Hogwarts with Harry as the Defense Professor and Ginny as a 7th year, but it is a pretty controversial fic. It's actually really well written and I think it's a great fic. The caveat is that this fic explores rape and PTSD extensively, and it gets pretty graphic. it doesn't glorify the rape at all; the purpose of the fic is hurt/comfort and recovery from extremely traumatic experiences. As you can imagine, the romance/sex in this fic moves extremely slow, but it is pretty satisfying. Ginny's characterization is substantially different from canon in this because she's several years younger than in canon and she's been through a truly horrific tragedy. Harry's been through some similar shit as Ginny (though indirectly), so he's not the same person as in canon either. This is the same author that wrote Backward with Purpose.

Linkffn(The Prodigal Daughter by iluvfanfics1) is a post Hogwarts fic where Ginny goes away to study in France and makes a triumphant return with all the neat powers like Empathy and something called the Fire Goddess. Harry's super OP in it as well. I remember the premise was decently interesting when I read it a decade ago, but I have severe doubts that it has aged well. The sex/romance is particularly interesting due to an Aura/Magic sharing mechanic between Harry and Ginny. The author of this fic uses a much more pre-HBP characterization for Ginny, so you may find it palatable. This is definitely the lesser of the two fics by far.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** You might give this a whirl - linkffn(Holly Polter by wordhammer). I know it says it's just a smut fic, but plot keeps happening. Anyway, let me know if it does anything for you.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
