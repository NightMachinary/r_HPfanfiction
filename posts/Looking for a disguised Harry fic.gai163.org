:END:
What I can remember about the fic is that Harry was disguised and was looking for potions when Snape found him and tried to talk to him. Harry was getting the potions for the injury's that's he got due to abuse. He dropped the potions and ran way from Snape. I think there might have also been something about Harry learning healing from Pomfrey.
