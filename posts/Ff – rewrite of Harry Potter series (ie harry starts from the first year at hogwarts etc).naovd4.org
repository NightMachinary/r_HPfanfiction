Where Harry starts Hogwarts from the first year, we've got the whole Sorting and meeting friends crap etc. Honestly dark!Harry would be great, but anything else works too.

It doesn't even need to be good, I just want to read some more of it, even though its quite cliche

(I mean things like "Sarcasm & Slytherin", "Victoria Potter" or even "Harry Potter & The Wizarding World")


** Oooh, 'A Very Slytherin Harry' series by geoffaree! It's ongoing, in the 5th book right now. And it has slash (Blaise/Harry)

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
