Lily Potter neé Evans was a woman willing to go beyond the ends of the earth for her son. Even going so far as to somehow bend the long established rules of magic and not only block, but reflect the premier unblockable curse. She was a woman who did things right and would never leave a job unfinished. So is there any doubt she considered her motherly duties complete after sacrificing her life for her child? Of course not, a little thing like the cessation of her life was never something that would stop Lily. No, not death, not life, and not the cycle therein was going to get between her and her son. She just needs to figure out what needed doing, and when.


** After the 3rd year incident with secret Animaguses disguised as animals, Severus is paranoid, immediately attacking any abnormally smart animal with the Animagus Dispelling Charm. While Crookshanks turns out to be a normal cat, Hedwig turns out to be a Animagus in hiding...

*** Maybe Lily is stuck in the Animagus form and Snape accidentally frees her when he does this?

"Animalis hominum!" Snape yelled and a bright blue/white spell struck Potter's bird.

Like a sped up muggle film, the bird began to change, shifting and morphing until...

There she was, the only person he ever loved, Lily Evans. Her once blood red hair had turned snow white and her body had been slightly disfigured to be bird-like from the long-term use of her Animagus form, much in the same way Peter Pettigrew had been slightly disfigured to be rat-like, but this was unmistakably Lily.

Her mind hadn't caught up to her body, her face was scrunched up as she was rapidly flapping her arms, attempting to escape by flying away. "...Lily?" He asked in shock. Only when she heard his voice did she open her eyes.

"...Sev?" She asked, it had been so long since anyone had called her that, since she had looked at another human being with human eyes. If it hadn't been for Harry, her old self would have been completely forgotten, it nearly was forgotten, like an old dream fading away.

"Harry!" She yelled, bolting up onto her shaky feet. "I need to see Harry!" She almost fell over, only Snape was there to catch her.

"You must wait." Severus said, still reeling from the shock of this discovery.

"Wait!? I need to see Harry, I need to see my son!" Lily said viciously, kicking the air manically as she tried to scratch his face with her feet unsuccessfully.

"Lily! You must wait, at least until you're clothed!" Snape barked in his teacher's voice. Suddenly Lily stopped and her eyes slowly looked down at her body, completely naked except for a few feathers.

"Oh... OH!" She squeaked, pulling the cloak off of Snape in a desperate attempt of covering herself. "Don't look!"

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

******* It's well-written, but it's nauseating in the glaring plot holes where Lily doesn't possess a snake to speak with Harry. She's stuck with no one but Sirius to speak with until Harry's last Hogwarts years.

** So... Lily Potter somehow manged to effect magic, so she came back as Headwig? Wow. You wanna know something sad if that's true, Harry saw her die twice, once as Lily Potter when he was one, and the 2nd when she was Headwig during the battle of 7 Potters, the first time he knew, but the second time he didn't, wow, that'll be sad.

**** The curse hit the snowy owl, her body dropping from the sky. As her boy cried his grief, he didn't see her body shifting as she fell, turning into Lily Potter nee Evans. But He saw. He saw and he turned on his fellows with a snarl "You told me she was dead!" He cried, lashing out with sickly orange and purple spells, sending Death Eaters to the ground screaming "Well not again, damnit!"
