Haven't read this pairing for a long time now and I want to read them again.


** If you want long I have long. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]] is 82% the length of the original series and is one of my favorites.

If you are ok with Fem!Harry and femslash I love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]] and its sequels. I find the relationship between Fem!Harry and Hermione in it adorable.

  A year after the death of Ron, A depressed Harry is dragged out of hiding to investigate Draco Malfoy's supposed murder of Cho Chang. Hermione tries to get her friend back. Great teamwork between Harry and Hermione.

  A marriage law has been passed, Hermione has to choose between Snape and Draco. She takes the third option and nopes out of the country with Harry.

  In a wizarding world with a strict caste system Hermione has herself legally and magically bound to Harry to prevent herself from being bound to someone else. Lots of worldbuilding including customs, what would fashion look like with magic, and a lot of snapshots of what various parts of the wizarding world look like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1][The Cupboard Series 1: The Cupboard Under the Stairs]] is the first in a 6 book + epilogue series. Hermione pushes Harry to improve himself in first year, this changes everything.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622306/1/The-Day-The-Dursleys-Came-To-Hogwarts][The-Day-The-Dursleys-Came-To-Hogwarts]] Before the first task Snape brings the Dursleys to Hogwarts to taunt Harry. This breaks everything. Tropey but i think it mixes up the tropes to good effect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] Harry is blinded by the killing curse as a baby and doesn't go to hogwarts, Hermione has the speech center of her brain horribly damaged in the troll attack, they meet in a mundane school for the disabled.

#+begin_quote
  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

** Linkffn(You're my Density) Harry got his memory wiped and Hermione is a fugitive in Voldemort's Britain. Time travel back to Hogwarts era and let's try this again.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) A marriage law is passed after Voldemort's defeat so Hermione decides to overthrow the ministry and chop everyone's head off. Harry becomes the new chief warlock, Hermione the minister and together they wage war on all the other pureblood governments in Europe. Harry/Hermione, Ginny/Neville and Ron/Flying Invisible Battle Tank.

Linkffn(Patron) was already mentioned but I have to second it, it's a very unique Harry/Hermione story where pureblood traditions are turned up to 11.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) Hermione is expelled and learns thievery to steal things from Death Eaters for Dumbledore. After the war, she gets her revenge. The H/Hr romance doesn't start until after Hogwarts when Harry becomes an auror and is getting increasingly frustrated because of that one thief who is always a step ahead of him.

** Here's some of my favorites which are completed and of longer length off the top of my head and in no particular order.

- /Coming Back Late/ by alchymie. Totally awesome fic. Deathly Hallows and politics and wonderful characterization. Sadly, it's been abandonded, but there's enough present to provide an exciting read, the story's climax, and a good bit of the resolution. Several points are left hanging, but what'cha gonna do? One of the best HHr fics ever written IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- /Time in the Fire/ by Odment Tweak. This might be my all-time favorite fic. It's not perfect, but it knows how to hit you right in the feels. It's a time-travel fic with a twist. I've probably read this one 50 times. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- /Resistence/ by lorien829, or really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][loriend829]] for that matter. She's got several wonderful fics that are all worth reading, this is just my favorite of the bunch. It was written before Deathly Hallows - so there's some differences there. It's from Hermione's perspective in a world where Voldemort won the last battle, and it follows how the surviving good guys continue the fight. It's pretty awesome. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Notebooks and Letters/ by chemprof. This is the fic that got me interested in the HHr pairing years ago. The premise is that the published HP books are an embelished telling of the events that really took place. Hermione sits down with her daughter and gives her the real story through reading her old diaries and letters. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione. Written before Deathly Hallows, so again, some differences there. The author is excellent and her characters are spot on. She also adds some new and very imaginative elements to the HP world. She also plays with the soul bond and love potion tropes in a way that is incredibly creative - it's the only time I can think of that they've been done well. Excellent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Origingally published on the now defunct Portkey.org, this fic adds some changes to year 5. Because of some tricky magic with unintended consequences, Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's. It's a great story. I remember following it as it was being published and the excitement that came with each new update. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- And then of course there's my humble addition to the fandom: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) It doesn't really stand with the above fics, but I'm adding it anyways.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
