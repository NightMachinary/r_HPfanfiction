Petunia Dursley sat in the rocking chair on her porch and stared into the twilight. Her husband,Vernon, long since deceased , and her son Dudley lived in the city with his family.

She reminisced on that faithful day when they had to leave their beloved home at #4 Privet Drive and flee to this quiet country cottage, which she has since grew to love as her own.

If it wasn't for that nasty man who killed her sister , life would have been much simpler .

Mrs. Dursley remembered the years of constant abuse by her husband, more emotional than physical. He viewed her as nothing more than a slave, someone to wait on him hand and foot , who never stood up to him or answered him back. She remembered him growing his son up to be a bully, to think he's always right and it hurt her to know she didn't have an input in his upbringing .

She remembered that faithful morning when she found her nephew on her door steps. Learning of the death of her sister killed her inside but she couldn't let it show. Vernon hated them and everything they stood for , her sister and brother-in-law . Yes, they were estranged and she was jealous of what Lily was ,but she was her sister after all.

Vernon refused to keep the toddler but the note ...... the note . They couldn't send him to an orphanage! The child had to stay ! Every time Petunia showed one ounce of love toward the infant, she was mentally abused by her husband and one day it became physical. “I fell down the stairs holding a basket of clothes “ she explained to the doctor when she learned of her fractured foot and broken wrist . Poor deceased Mrs. Figg her elderly neighbour assisted her without question during the time it took to heal.

Petunia felt sick and disgusted at herself for treating the poor orphaned boy like dirt after but at that time she felt relieved that the physical abuse had stop. The worst she treated Harry, the better she was treated.

Fireflies filled the field beyond, as a single tear trickled down her face. Mrs. Dursley , formerly of #4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, wished she could go back in time and make up to that little boy for the years of hate and abuse he went through. As she looked up at the moon, warm and milky in the sky , she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and relief of the man that Harry Potter had become.

** Very nice.

Few comments:

1. Nice idea, but the psychological drama just cannot be done well in few paragraphs, this needs (and could carry) a lot more space to develop.

2. Yes, she was a victim of domestic abuse. The problem is that most bullies are victims of somebody else's horrible treatment (“I and the public know // What all schoolchildren learn, // Those to whom evil is done // Do evil in return.” W. H. Auden, September 1, 1939), and there just has to be somewhere a point where any decent human being says “This just crosses a line. I cannot do this to my nephew, I just have to go to police.” Two wrongs don't make one right, and she should be at least struggling with her own guilt. She just cannot be one-sided poor bullied victim.

3. Or perhaps they didn't do THAT much. One of many reasons I don't like about naturalistic child abuse stories (broken limbs, untreated wounds, dirt, hunger) is that it makes such situation distant, something which “those people” do to their children. Low level mostly emotional abuse which JKR wrote in the books (and I know it wasn't the most important reasons, she wanted to keep the books PG-13) is on one side much less and on the other much more terrifying, because it is much closer to our everyday reality. This kind of everyday abuse hidden behind perfectly neat gardens of the suburban uniformity is way closer to us to make us uncomfortable.

*** Thanks so much for the comment !! I had way more ideas but I didn't want to make it too long. It's also my first time writing fanfic and I wasn't sure how well this perspective would sit with the community. I wanted to write more about abuse and how it makes normal humans do unthinkable things. Even where I am from , I've seen people abused and take out on others. I was also considering the timeline where women may not have stood up to men as they do now. Maybe I'll work on developing the story line a bit further and maybe you'll see an update soon ☺️☺️

** I did enjoy this story the writing is well done and immersive. I know the book gloseed over the specifics of the abuse Harry faced, the interpretation I always had was of neglect, not so much physical abuse. Many persons look at the time Harry spent at the Dursely's in the same way you approached this fic.

Additionally, Petunia harboured deep jealously and resentment towards her sister ever since she was rejected by Hogwarts. Resentment that built over years may not just vanish simply because Harry was an innocent baby. Regardless, your story really does humanise and soften Petunia. Keep writing.
