You know like reading fairy tail and chewing on an electrical cable to "eat" electricity or trying to use the clone seal while "mixing chakra" for shadow clones or ripping an array from Fullmetal Alchemist and trying to use it kinda shit which can only get better if the MC develops it and makes new magic derived from magic derived from fiction.

P.S. we're not actually looking for those examples because they are examples though it would be nice if you could link fics including those examples.


** by using fairy tail example i assume you read linkffn(Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar)

ill get back on the other crossovers, need to remember thier name

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

** Oooh I'll be camping out in this thread, see if anything good pops in. I love these kinds of stories. It's such a shame the vast majority are abandoned, crap, or most often, both.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

*** eh hows that one work out? It seems to be a sidexside crossover... I find those... really weird and not very good.

My crossover categorizing system:\\
Side x Side crossovers: Konoha and Hogwarts are both places that exist. Just hidden from each other and everyone else too. I find it rather... clumsy.\\
Ancient History crossover: One of the worlds came long ago, and their time has long since passed. But someone has rediscovered their historic abilities. These I like. The immortal Naruto or Harry helping/mentoring his counterpart I like too.\\
Imaginary Crossover: The other world never existed, except in the fantasy of an author/mangaka. But chakra/magic can be induced to... mutate... under certain conditions, when a child is young enough. I love these the most.

*** Whelp I have it a shot.... Godamnit sometimes I just want to beat authors over the head with some basic writing rules.\\
This one especially, so many inline authors notes, half of them explaining how he doesn't remember this or that fact. LOOK IT UP! Or gloss over the part you dont remember, but whatever you godamn do, do not pull the readers attention to it with a (which side is kakashi's sharingan on? I forget.)\\
I can see why you didn't read too much of it. I read the first chapter, I thought I could live with a few bad inline authors notes, but... ugh. Then I got to the chapter end and found out that it's probably going to have waaaay more slash than is reasonable.
