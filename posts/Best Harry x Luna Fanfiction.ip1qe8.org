Completed or on-going. Preferably about 50k+ words if completed. I'm fine with any house Harry, Dark Harry. Just can the ship just be Harry x Luna. Not like any Harem thing. If its ongoing I would like it to be over 20 or around that number. Unless theres daily or weekly updates.

Thank you! I hope I havent been too much trouble.

  For his 21st birthday, Luna has a surprise gift. And it's nothing Harry could have ever expected or predicted. Then again, nothing about living with beautiful weirdo Luna Lovegood is ever predictable, is it? Post-war Harry. "Be a freak like me too," Luna whispers. Story about PTSD, abusive childhood, and letting go of the past. COMPLETE!

#+begin_quote
  Harry knew Luna well...didn't he. This is a little oneshot, featuring what could have been on the night of Horace Slughorn's Christmas Party. There are no lemons, but there is a rather intense discussion of more mature themes. Just a little lighthearted snippet, with spades of fluff, along with a bit of humour (I hope?). Harry x Luna This is not stolen, read the Author's Note.

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.
