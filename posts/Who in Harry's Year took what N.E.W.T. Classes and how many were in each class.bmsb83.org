I'm particularly curious about 6th Year Potions with Slughorn but I'd also like to be able to better gauge the skill of Harry and his classmates and take that into account when writing.

Ideally this could be a resource for canon skill comparison.


** That's a tricky question to answer, since Harry spent most of HBP obsessed with himself and his problems (Malfoy plotting, Quidditch captain, intense envy of Dean for being with Ginny, Hermione's jealousy and anger about Ron and Lavender, Hermione's jealousy and anger about his annotated potions book, Dumbledore's stupid lessons). He was never big on noticing people outside his small circle of interactions anyway, let alone with so many demands on his attention. Depends if you rely on the book, too, or if you want to include the movies which stuffed extras in everything so Hogwarts didn't seem so hilariously small.

From the best of my memory, since I don't have the book on hand: Harry, Ron, Hermione are the only Gryffindors to take NEWT Potions, and HBP references that only a dozen people were waiting outside before class. Ernie MacMillan was the lone Hufflepuff, four Slytherins including Malfoy but not Crabbe or Goyle (he looked lost without his sidekicks), which means presumably four Ravenclaws.

Rowling wasn't big on naming people present but not participating in the scene. Or acknowledging many characters in Hogwarts at all, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are practically blank slates. You can give whatever talents at school subjects to whatever students and it's unlikely any readers will quibble with you. They mostly exist only as names in canon, if not fanon.

*** Your memory is impressively right - here's what the book says:

#+begin_quote
  When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner. (HBP, Chapter 9)
#+end_quote

In the same chapter, Zabini, Nott, Boot, and Corner are mentioned by name as being in the class as well, which still leaves one Slytherin and two Ravenclaws unaccounted for.

**** Sweet. The Potions scenes in HBP were my favorite parts, probably because they were the only times things weren't going wrong. I've referenced that scene before in an argument with a friend who was trying to defend Snape, so the rough breakdown stuck with me.

Literally one Hufflepuff and three Gryffindors continued to NEWT Potions, a course apparently required for several significant careers in their society like law enforcement and medical care. Unless there are many other witches and wizards being trained at other British schools, which weren't big enough to ever be mentioned even during the Triwizard Tournament, those numbers aren't promising. And are indicative of just how badly Snape is ruining the future of literally their entire society, even leaving aside any actions during the wars. He could have stayed out of the Order and the Death Eaters and still done more just through his attitude and incompetence as an educator!

***** Snape being a bad educator isn't really canon. I use that word specifically since he's a right prick who shouldn't be around kids, but that doesn't mean he isn't teaching the curriculum well.

You're looking at things the wrong way. I'd guess that your perspective is skewed from what is considered normal. Passing an OWL is very difficult, and isn't expected that everyone will pass their exams. Let alone scoring EE or O. Harry is an exceptional wizard. We know from several sources that he's much more skilled than even qualified adults.

I think you're also failing to properly recognize that the wizarding world is small, it doesn't have a huge demand for high skilled positions. There is almost certainly only the one wizarding hospital in britain, which means there isn't a need for new healers every year. Tonks was the only Auror in several years. Because why would they need to hire more than that?

****** Voldemort was only ' the worst Dark Wizard in a century'. Since wizards can live well past a century that means there are people who in living memory knew a dark lord worse than Voldie. Given that the entirety of the population is potentially armed and many of them have reason to oppose the Ministry there should be demand for enough Hit Wizards and Aurors to hold them back.

I'd assume Hit Wizards are a more typical police force since you only need O.W.L.s ( 5 including DADA) that can be expanded in times of crisis but maybe are kept down to a few dozen in peacetime.

Aurors are an elite force that probably would not be flexible due to how long it takes to train them (2 years) plus the low pool of applicants ( since a decent portion of the population stops after O.W.L.'s and very few people are going to get 5 N.E.W.T.s). They probably retire around 70 since wizards still age and physical frailty would impede them ( some last longer but some also die in the field) so we can estimate a career lifespan of about 50 years. If Tonks was the first in 5 years there would be only 10 assuming no deaths and a constant rate of growth. If she was the first in 2 years it would be 25. Realistically there are between 1-2 dozen aurors, maybe 3 dozen if you fudge it. It's a tall order for them to monitor and control a population in the low tens of thousands.

Just out of curiosity, what do most wizards actually do?

Wizards never had the industrial revolution, since magic can't be mass produced. Every wizard is an artisan, every magic device is hand crafted. Most of them live like the Weasleys, in a rural area, growing some or most of their own food, and having some sort of trade to supplement the things they have to buy.

Basically wizards are homesteaders.

****** Our only examples of his actual teaching in Potions is putting instructions on the board and telling people to go do it, arduous homework assignments, constant negative feedback and usually after the mistake has ruined something, ruining students' work, and grading with bias. So even if you ignore all the other parts of being an educator, he's a terrible teacher. The only times we see him actually teach, he doesn't teach!

Educators do more than just impart knowledge, though, even if he's pitifully incompetent at that part. Educators also manage the classroom and create a positive and respectful environment. This means not harshly criticizing students, particularly for personal things unrelated to the lesson. This means preventing malicious academic sabotage, some of which leads to genuine health concerns. Applying rules consistently and fairly. Not singling out students for abuse. Preventing bullying in and outside the classroom, helping all students especially bullied ones feel welcome and safe, and treating everyone equally and fairly. And wow, I'm just listing things he should have done based on what he didn't.

Teachers teach. They are also responsible for the students, and for the classroom. Snape is none of those things. And even if he was good at actually teaching the material and just a jerk otherwise...

Neville Longbottom. At 15 months, his house was attacked and parents brutally tortured until they're feeble, barely-conscious amnesiacs, who he visits regularly and is thus continually reminded of his loss, and compared to and always found lacking. His family abused him for years as a child, culminating in him nearly drowning and being held out a window by his ankles and then dropped in favor of literally a slice of cake. Neville had a terrible childhood, starting school as a nervous wreck with a poor memory and the butt of every joke. And when presented with a creature that manifests as his greatest fear, it steps out in the form of Severus Snape. Despite every other horror and trauma in his life, a professor he interacts with multiple times a week is his greatest fear. That's the kind of thing that, if it happened in real life, any teacher would report to at least the school principal if not the child services department of their government. And something would come of it.

Being a teacher is more than just good student grades. He is a terrible teacher, educator, any word you want to use, canonically. Let him go write a textbook or teach adult classes.

******** Or we can say it is true, but being a story with story elements, Snape is able to get away with being an awful teacher because that's his literary purpose. The defense goes both ways.

He exists to be alternately a red herring antagonist or an impediment to Harry's goals, and he is established as antagonistic to Harry not just by directly bullying and enabling student bullying of Harry and others, but by being a terrible teacher, helping convince Harry that Snape has ulterior motives in working at Hogwarts. He stays despite that because of Dumbledore's protection.

I admit that appeal to authority is a logical fallacy, but I am a teacher. I've spent several years in training at university, taught lessons in a wide range of schools and ages, and am currently employed as one. Snape is a bad teacher. Again, even ignoring that teachers should be positive authority figures, not negative ones, his pedagogy is awful. When you run practical lessons, students should already know their tasks, safety precautions and concerns, the components, the direct purpose of the procedure, and the educational purpose of performing it. That's true for physics, it's true for chemistry (which she deliberately modeled Potions on), it's true for cooking classes!

********* You can't apply muggle expectations on a magic class. Potions isn't chemistry, and it certainly isn't cooking. Despite the superficial similarities.

There is no reason to think that Snape does nothing except 'Directions are on the board, get to work". That is a piece of horrid fanon, right along with Binns only talking about Goblins. I also think given the competency students show at potions that however Snape is teaching it's probably the correct way. Again ignoring his attitude and only talking curriculum.

We can only guess the myriad of things that go into potion making. We know theory of magic runs very deep, so do personal relationships and emotions in regards to magic. It's entirely reasonable to think that experimentation is important to the process. They don't measure exactly, that's not how the magic works, instead they have to learn tell when something is correct. The ingredient from this magical creature doesn't work exactly the same as the same ingredient from a different animal. So precision in potion making isn't the same as precision in chemistry. Doing and failing therefore is the way to learn.

It's all speculation, but really the consistent belief that competent adults don't know what they're doing is frustrating.

And he can't even do this right. HBP clearly shows simply reading SNAPE's instructions works wonderfully.

The DADA position shows professors have a ton of leeway on their curriculum and textbooks. There's no reason Snape couldn't have put his own improved/revised instructions up on the board.

***** In defense of Snape, in OoTP when Umbridge is evaluating the professors and trying to oust Snape she notes that his class 'is well ahead of 5th year level' and regards him as competent despite having some reasons to suspect him as a loyalist of Dumbledore. Snape is a dick to his students and that likely discouraged some people from continuing but I don't think he's actually bad at teaching the material.

Potions always came off to me as a more scientific subject than the other classes, and since most wizards suck at logic it would make sense that relatively few of them were good at it.

Thinks the ideal class is one that sits, greets her in unison, and reads the textbook repeatedly for the whole year. And wants the students undertrained so they don't rise against the government. She assesses Snape's teaching as competent?

I thought the "material above age level" was a dig at him, too, like he's teaching stuff that's too hard, too early. Like Hagrid introducing third years to hippogriffs.

  "The ministry doesn't bother comparing statistics between departments," I said, handing him the parchment, "but I thought it might make for an interesting exercise. Guess what I found, professor. Since you began teaching at Hogwarts, less than 1 out of 10 students take the Potions NEWT. Down from 6 out of 10 for your predecessor. That's an 80% decrease in NEWT potion students. Admittedly, your NEWT pass rate is 100% where your predecessor's was 80%. Still, he graduated 4.8 NEWT potions qualified students for your 1. That's still a 79% decrease. That means there are 79% fewer Hogwarts graduates qualified to be aurors, healers, and potioneers. As Hogwarts accounts for forty-three percent of total OWL graduates and fifty percent total NEWT graduates, these numbers are reflected in a 37% drop in applicants to St. Mungo's and a 52% drop in applicants to the Auror Academy. Because of you, an entire generation is relegated to lower paying jobs, and our society faces the very real possibility that we will have to extend the retirement age or face severe shortages at both St. Mungo's and the ministry. Congratulations, professor," I drawled, "you have single-handedly done more damage to our society than Voldemort ever hoped to."
#+end_quote

The numbers are invented, but the point is plausible. Plenty of authors have their own version of this. Waivers and on-the-job Potions remedial lessons to ramp up Auror recruitment in the wake of Voldemort's return are ideas I've seen before.

Rowling made him Potions professor because she didn't like chemistry, and the implications of his poor teaching weren't visible until she started developing the world further, inventing careers and prereqs. Even then, it's a story, and that wasn't the point, so it was never explored.

Plus he still loved his childhood friend and died nobly as a sacrifice for the sake of her (child), so she absolved him of his direct and indirect damage to their society and named the child of one of his victims for him...
