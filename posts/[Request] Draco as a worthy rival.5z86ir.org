Does anyone know of any fanfictions in which Draco is actually a worthy rival to Harry? To me he seems to mainly be a nuisance most of the time, especially in the earlier canon books and most fanfics.

If not, does anyone have ideas on /how/ he could become a worthy rival? I'm thinking of writing him this way in a fic I recently started, but have been focusing on pre-Hogwarts while I work out how I want to portray certain characters. My current thoughts are to write him a little like Tom Riddle, in that I want Draco to be good at charming people and hiding evidence of wrongdoing.

Before anyone asks, I have already tried the search function on here and elsewhere and come up short thus far.


** He has 0 cunning or courage in canon so you would need to change that in order to make him something more than an annoyance.

This means no more visits on the Hogwarts Express just to insult people. Instead of calling others derogatory terms he would use hidden insults like "Weasley, respect for your bravery. I wouldn't dare to even touch those robes."

Also instead of threatening people with his father, he writes Lucius, who then goes after the family (whether in Death Eater Regalia or by financial or legal means).

**** He should also never use the word mudblood in public and especially in to their faces. He should even be careful around other Slytherins (who are not Crabe, Goyle and Parkinson) when talking about his political views. It a wonder that nobody blackmailed him in canon about informing the daily prophet that Lucius Malfoys son openly supports Voldemort ideals.

You should also improve Harry in your story if you're improving Draco. HIs sarcastic side is often strongly downplayed in fanfiction even though its one of his best attributes. HIs cunning also needs improvement if you look at how he handled the situation when everyone thought he was lying about Voldemort return. I would expect more from someone who could be great in Slytherin.

*** I would rate him at 1 cunning and 0 courage.

Seriously though, he was pathetic in all ways, and I will never understand why he became as popular as he did...unless it is literally off how hot people saw Tom Felton.

**** That, and a lot of people love the "he's a bad boy but deep down I know he's good. Maybe deep deep deep down, but it's there. Maybe. And /I'll/ be the one to change him!" clich√©.

It's weird because Draco never came across as anything but pathetic in canon.

*** I disagree - his trick of getting Harry and Ron to go to the fake duel took a certain amount of cunning, and if I recall correctly the only reason Harry avoided any trouble was because he had his invisibility cloak. Afterwards we don't see much evidence, though.

** I know the stereotype is Crabbe and Goyle are buffoons that almost fail out of Hogwarts, but realistically why would a clever Draco want that? Turning Crabbe and Goyle into competent second-in-commands would help both his image and stop him from needing to worry about them.

They don't need to be geniuses, but they shouldn't be stupid imo. Plus if Malfoy is the reason they're smarter, they'll owe him a lot more loyalty than if he just bossed them around.

EDIT: This also gives you a subplot if you want (or a source of humor). Draco trying to tutor Crabbe/Goyle, as well as their personal mini-arcs from flunkies to decent students.

** While it may be tempting to completely remove the whole "My father will hear of this" thing, don't. A cunning Draco would know that someone with the kind of political and financial and (magical?) power that Lucius Malfoy has, is an asset. Thus using his name to open doors and secure windows of opportunity isn't cowardly. It's just using what you have.

As long as he doesn't go shouting it out to everyone for every real and perceived insult, it should be ok.

He would have to be smarter, think a few steps ahead to the repercussions of possible actions, and he would need to be much more loquacious, not just shouting out to all and sundry about mudbloods and blood traitors.

Also, the Nimbus 2001 debacle from Second year, that would never happen. I mean if Slytherin won, people would say that they sold out a spot for the brooms and that was the sole reason they won. If they lost, it would be an embarrassing in the extreme, as they would have lost in spite of superior brooms. Its a lose-lose situation.

*** Although this is quite different from what I had in mind, it is extremely helpful to hear other people's opinions too! My original reason for posting was to hopefully gain some back-and-forth, so I'm very happy.

In response to specific points you've raised:

- I'm imagining Draco to be pampered materially but otherwise have a very strict father with high expectations. To Lucius, Malfoys deserve the best so this is 'normal' for Draco.

- I agree that Draco should be smart and naturally good at certain sorts of magic. Early exposure to Dark Magic is likely.

- I'm thinking that his attitude towards muggleborns should be patronising and a little snooty rather than hateful.

- Alliances within Slytherin are a given, along with possible links to pureblooded students from other Houses.

I think I'm going to make his temper 'cold' as opposed to Harry's 'hot-headed' approach. So no outbursts from him, but threats, backhanded comments and mysterious misfortunes.

** Steps to making Draco a worthy rival to Harry

1) Give Draco some nerve, instead of running away from the Duel, he and Harry both should have prepared accordingly for it, and actually Duelled. Do to this being relatively early in Harry's First Year, and right before he even got his Quidditch Broom to play Quidditch, this could have a profound effect on both Draco and Harry. Harry may realise that his true calling is to be a Duellist when he mops the floor with Draco, or he realised that friends aren't everything when he is disarmed by Draco, and Ron runs away, leaving Filch to find them, taking points etc... Either way, canon will diverge immensely.

2) Make Draco realistic, none of the flamboyantly calling out his Father's name whenever beaten, none of the whole "he is redeemable". Draco is someone that clings to power, like his father, he is most definitely not in a grey area when it comes to Voldemort.

3) You could also make him the rival that never was, be it him dying during third year or second year. Or actually going to Durmstrang. Don't make him one of those comic villains that constantly shows up to randomly Duel Harry to the death, maybe being beaten by Harry in a Duel will cause Draco to spiral out of control, into something like a Tom Riddle, thinking that a Durmstrang education would be better for him anyways, disregarding his mother's pleas.

4) No Slash, no secret sexual tension. If you want a deep rivalry, don't ruin it for forcing a story to go a worse off route, I'm not saying that you can't, it's just that you'd be ruining any rival development you had between the characters, by shoving a tedious relationship down our throats.

5) That brings me to another point, no love triangles. It's cutesy for years 1-4 but honestly, having to deal with that during Harry's angst phase, or Good vs Evil phase, is just honestly troublesome, you'd be opening a whole can of worms just for a minor plot point.

6) Have fun. If you want to change Draco enough to become a worthy rival, you might need to change Harry as well, changing someone like that in the magical world entails may things. New Wand, New Patronus (in Harry's case), New Animagus. You could even change the world around them, maybe a different Hogwarts with more classes? Harry finds out more about his family due to Draco's constant spouting of pureblood law, turns out that the Potters are known for their abilities in Transfiguration, being capable of breaking many of the 'laws' Hermione talked about. So Harry discovers his own talent for the subject.

*** Good points, all of them. Some thoughts:

1. We don't know what a wizard's duel actually involves or the cultural connotations. You could instead play up his cunning by taking advantage of Harry's lack of knowledge of the wizarding world, and more or less his sole source of information somebody who he would know would be more interested in the excitement of the duel than the sensible strategy.
2. Yeah, fair enough. But again, don't make him /obviously/ a Voldemort supporter. He needs to be cunning to be a genuinely Slytherin rival. Publicly downplay anything that would harm his image.

I mostly agree with 3-5, but for #5 in particular both dating the same girl in different years (4th and 6th/7th for example) would provide an interesting conflict.

And for #6, definitely play around with the world. Probably try to avoid the inheritance cliches though, but a balanced additional power (For Harry, transfiguration at the expense of potions? If you make sure to demonstrate the powers he is missing in proportion to his advantages) This sounds really interesting overall.

**** I'm using canon as a baseline rather than as a set of checkpoints to follow, so I'm unsure whether the duel will happen in first year. I was going to see how I felt once I'd finished writing the first lessons of the year.

I have done some notes on magical politics, and have included inherited titles (but ones which make sense when compared with actual British political history over the last 1000 years e.g. Duke, Earl, etc all have very specific definitions, so I created a new class of nobility for magicals who declared loyalty to the Crown at some point - Magisters).

I really like the idea of dating the same person at different times, but this will be a looong way in the future as I'm starting from First Year.

I'm changing up Harry some in terms of what he is good at: I think someone who has been cooking and gardening for nearly a decade will be much better at potions and herbology than Canon Harry. I plan to put his wand magic on a slower burn, with him only starting to see major improvement several months in /at the very earliest/.

*** I am most definitely playing around with the world! I want the Wizarding World to feel bigger but also slightly empty after the death toll of Voldemort's rise. I've been having a lot of fun playing around with history and culture in my notes, and a little politics (don't worry, I'm not about to give Harry half a dozen votes on the Wizengamot or anything equally ridiculous).

Pairings of any sort will be unlikely for the foreseeable future. I've never been a fan of drarry so no worries there.
