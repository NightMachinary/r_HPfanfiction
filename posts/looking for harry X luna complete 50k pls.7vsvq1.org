ok i am a huge fan of harry x luna but its hard to find fanfics that are long and complete. any reccomendations?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] (196k words, complete), linkffn(2919503) -- 7yo Luna kidnaps Harry from the Dursleys, hijinx ensue!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][Power of Paranoia]] (104k words, complete), linkffn(8257400) -- After 4th year, Harry decides he's had enough and exits the country, inadvertantly causing Magical Britain to collapse. Years later, Dumbledore tries to get Harry to come back. Not really a Luna-ish story, she's just sort of there, but otherwise it's a good story.

** [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=19238&chapter=0]] This got taken down on ffn for some reason but I tracked down to this weird ass Russian website to re read its goblet of fire and gryffindor doesn't take his name coming from the goblet well so he's excommunicated from the house and ends up living in an enchantment laboratory flitwick lets him use he's pretty overpowered and the pairing is pretty slow but I really enjoyed it 118K if I remember correctly

** Try The Horse Linkffn (1785390) Long and windy, has some lots of mixes of genre and feeling, as well as time travel, Harry/Draco kind-of friendship, a Harry who is pretty typical teenager in terms of emotional things, saving the world, and a snarky Horse.
