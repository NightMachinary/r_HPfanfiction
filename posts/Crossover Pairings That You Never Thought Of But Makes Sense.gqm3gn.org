Give me your list of crossover pairings that you had never thought of but would make a lot of sense.

Go wild, everyone!


** I saw a really intriguing Elsa/Harry once, but didn't go hunt it down to read it.

But with all of the Ice Queen™️ Daphne and Fleur fics, out there, I think it has a lot of potential

*** They have a similar aesthetic but honestly I think Hermione might attempt to be a bit controlling and it wouldn't work out.

** There's a really well-done Harry Potter / Faith Lehane on AO3 ("Harry Potter and the Gaining of Faith"). Two jaded, traumatized teens forced to grow up way faster than they should have, Faith helps build Harry's confidence and self-worth, while Harry provides a stabilizing influence and gives Faith someone that genuinely cares about her without reservation.

*** I remember looking around for more stories with that pairing after reading it and being disappointed there weren't any, totally agree it has a lot of potential.

** Not quite a pairing, but I remember once reading a story where Aerith Gainsborough basically adopted Harry as his big sister and thinking that someone like her is exactly what canon Harry needed.

As far as actual pairings, I once read a Ron/Thor drabble that didn't go much into the relationship, but the more I thought about the pairing, the more I liked either that or Ron/Loki. Ron would love Asgardian feasts, and he and Loki would bond over feeling overshadowed by older siblings. Plus I imagine Ron impressing Odin by managing to keep up with him at chess, lol. (And Frigga and Molly Weasley as conspiring in-laws is a delight!)
