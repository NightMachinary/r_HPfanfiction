I used to have the link to this fic saved but I seem to have lost it. My link wasn't on ffnet but the fic very well could be on there.

The scene with Beauxbatons I'm referring to Ron and Harry attempt to levitate the carriage to stop it from falling. Madam Maxime comes out and yells at them before realizing and helping instead. (Simplified but if you'd recognize the fic then you know what I'm talking about)

Another thing that stood out was Harry always saying â€˜freaking' but spelling it wrong (bothered me so I notified it lol)

It's a rather smutty fic that I'm hoping to find again. Thanks! If you need more details I'd be happy to provide them.

*** That's the one yep! The link I used to use: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][fictionhunt]] appears to be down and the whole site isn't up. Found this other version on a foreign website [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=33471&chapter=0][fanfics.me]] seems normal enough but I'll be copy pasting the whole fic into a doc for secure reading ðŸ˜‚
