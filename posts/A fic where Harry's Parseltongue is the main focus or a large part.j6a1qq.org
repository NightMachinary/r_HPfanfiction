Im looking for fics where Harry constantly uses his ability to speak to snakes. Where he'll just hiss in the halls without a care for what anyone thinks, or just use it really really often. Or a fic where the basilisk is a main component. Though im not really looking for a fic where he only uses his parsel to speak to a pet snake, i wouldnt really mind those either. Anything else is fair game, though i do prefer M/M!!!!


** ''A very Slytherin Harry''

It gets bad in the third part but it's worth reading

** I am on chapter 18 (of 20) and we haven't reached the 2nd task so I dont think it is complete and the last time it was updated was 2017 but it's all about Parseltongue

** I'll drop my fic down below. Harry discovers his Parseltongue somewhat relatively late into the story (by CH10), but it does become used a lot from then on forward. It is not M/M, but I think you'll enjoy it regardless.

  [Book 1 of HP & the Path of Knowledge] A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for magic. His new life eventually throws him on a journey for answers - those relating to his mysterious cursed scar, his unknown parentage, and the intricacies of magic itself. Alas, if only it was ever that easy... (AU Pre-Hogwarts)

** linkao3(the venom peddler)

linkffn(harrys's chamber of secrets)

In the first one he raises loads of snakes, basically the whole fic is about him and his snakes.

In the second one he finds Salazar's library and uses parselmagic to eradicate all his problems.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
