** Linkffn(10182397) Has an interesting origin for Dementors. I personally liked it but there are others who don't. Edit: Plus it manages to be both a story about a bad guy, and so wholesome at the same time.

The movies are also canon, and they of course show their faces in grotesque detail. The wiki describes it like this:

/"A Dementor's face has empty eye sockets, covered with scabbed skin. There is a gaping large hole where the mouth should be, which is used for sucking the soul out of the victim in a process called the Dementor's Kiss"/

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose]]

Its a very bittersweet tale where Harry has an almost connection to dementors and his search for answers (up close with them). It really delves into dementor lore as you want! I just re read this a few days ago, still as compelling as I remembered.

** Not a fic, but an excerpt from a world building document I periodically add to. An alternative interpretation of Dementors.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps the prime example of a creature that feeds off emotion is that of the dementor, who feeds not on the happiness they sap from their victims as many think, but on the despair that they leave behind. While dementors currently work as the guards of Azkaban, they are natural predators, and it is only their natural hunting tactics that make them suitable for such work. Short term dementor exposure results in chills, depression, and an overwhelming feeling that one will “never be happy again.” Long term exposure to dementors results in the destruction of memories with positive emotion attached, leaving the victim with literally nothing about which to feel happy.

  Before their exile to Azkaban, wild dementors hunted alone, living in the dark and gloomy corners of the world. Falling upon prey that wandered into their territory and paralyzing them with despair. Victims were kept alive for days on end, while the dementor destroyed their happiness and fed on their despair. When the dementors sensed that their prey was close to death, they would end their days-long meal with a feast of the concentrated despair of a lifetime worth of negative memories, cleansed of all happy thoughts, as they consumed the soul of their prey.

  As dementors feed off of despair, hope and happiness are poisonous to them, which is why they seek to destroy them, and why the patronus charm, as a magically concentrated beacon of positivity drives them away. The concentrated positivity of a large group of humans was generally enough then to keep wild dementors outside the walls of human settlements in the past in much the same way. It is only in dark times, where all hope seems lost, that dementors will approach groups of humans, when their powers are enough to suppress any attempt at joy capable of driving them away. There is a reason that the popular image and view of death personified mirrors the description of a dementor. As many an unfortunate family, in the throes of mourning did not possess enough happiness to ward off a dementor that sensed the approaching death of a human, and came for the free feast.

  The alliance with the ministry came as a matter of national emergency when the dementors began changing their hunting tactics. The growth of the nation and muggle population began limiting the dark and dismal places that dementors occupied and cutting them off from potential food sources as people flocked to larger towns and cities. In the end, the once solitary creatures banded together to storm the smallest villages they could find, using their numbers to smother hope and happiness in a way that they could not do alone, turning entire villages into cesspits of pain, before consuming the souls of all within. Records are unclear as to how many villages or people were lost before the creation of the patronus charm.

  The new charm scared the dementors, as they were yet unaware of its limitations, and when the ministry offered Azkaban and the despair of its inmates as a carrot, while using the patronus charm as a stick, the dementors were twisted into an uneasy alliance that has been kept ever since. The continuous supply of despair is both lifesaving and tortuous to the dementors, who continually feed off of the despair of prisoners, but are rarely given leave to complete their hunt, destroying the souls of man.
