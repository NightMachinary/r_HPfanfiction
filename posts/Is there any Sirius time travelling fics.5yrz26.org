** linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) is the best, though not quite time-travel.

linkffn(Gillyflower, Hemlock, and Heliotrope) is incomplete, but has James, Remus, and Sirius time-travelling into the era of the books. Sadly incomplete.

Both are slash, Sirius/Harry, though Gillyflower hadn't really gotten to the meat of that (pun absolutely intended) as of the last update. Thread saved, as I'm always on the lookout for more!

I know of one or two others where Sirius doesn't time-travel properly but is returned to his 22-year-old self after falling through the Veil, a Groundhog Day sort of scenario. Is that something you're interested in as well, or are you looking for strictly time-travel?

#+begin_quote
  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  In another dimension, in a past that didn't quite happen, three friends are forced to flee a world of ashes and death to hunt down the only person able to save them. Will Harry Potter once again be forced to become The Boy Who Saved? Or will he sink into darkness as the atrocities of the other world crush him in despair? Slash; HP/SB. M for later sexual content. Literally AU.

  The concept of the 'do-over' is used in, at the very least, hundreds of Harry Potter stories. Here's my own take, using a HP character that actually has a good reason for getting another chance to make things better.

** There was a great one called Slytherin Black that was part of a writing challenge a while ago. It was taken down once the challenge was over, but the author, Jilly James, is planning to finish it for an April challenge. So the already written portion (100K) should be posted around April 1st. If you're willing to wait.

[[http://www.roughtrade.org/project-file-slytherin-black-by-jilly-james/]] You have to join the site to view.

It's slash, Sirius/OC.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
