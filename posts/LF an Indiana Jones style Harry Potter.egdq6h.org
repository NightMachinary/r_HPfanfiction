** You might like my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", where the trio are curse-breakers working for Gringotts and searching for Atlantis. Traps, curses, cults, politics and dark wizards complicate matters.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

*** Hell yes. I love that fic. You totally nail the Adventurous Globetrotter going from Disaster to Disaster feel - the Uncharted to the prequel's Tomb Raider, so to speak. And you have one of my favourite ever interpretations of Ron.

TL:DR for the OP - I very much second Starfox's self-rec.

**** There's also The Archeologist by Racke, if you're okay with a fem!Harry that doesn't really change him all that much from masculine Harry, he just happens to be a chick now and is kind of alright with it. Bit exposition-ey in places, but overall it's got enough style and amusement to the story that I enjoyed it.

There's the second-person fic recc of Bungle in the Jungle by JBern. Well-known enough that you've probably seen it recc'ed around before, so I'll just say that you'll either like JBern enough to push through the second person or not and leave it at that.

There's Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer, which I haven't read myself, but it's apparently good enough to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/]]

There's another I haven't read called Harry Potter and the Magic of Life - same addendum of non-reading, but the consensus seems to be less favourable regarding the author's writing, though the story is purportedly still interesting enough.

If you want more, this question has been asked a lot of times. Try google 'Harry Potter Fanfiction' and either 'Bill Weasley Mentor' or 'Archaeologist' or 'Cursebreaker' then 'Site:reddit.com' to find more. I think there's also a couple of communities on FFnet dedicated to this topic, but I don't have those links to hand.
