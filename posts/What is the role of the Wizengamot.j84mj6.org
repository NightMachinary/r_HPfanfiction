I've been looking for information in order to write my fanfic. Since we are not given enough information on the Wizengamot, I had to do a little digging to find some information that has lead to this view.

The Harry Potter fandom believes that the Wizengamot is both a court and a parliament. I have the same belief.

  Occasionally, a Potter made it all the way to London, and a member of the family has twice sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter, who was a member from 1612-1652, and who was a great supporter of the Statute of Secrecy (as opposed to declaring war on the Muggles, as more militant members wished to do)

This leads me to believe that the Wizengamot was involved in the signing of the statue of secrecy. Most likely the members of the Wizengamot had to vote on it.

  Faris “Spout-hole” Spavin. Longest-ever serving Minister for Magic, and also the most long-winded, he survived an ‘assassination attempt' (kicking) from a centaur who resented the punchline of Spavin's infamous ‘a centaur, a ghost and a dwarf walk into a bar' joke. Attended Queen Victoria's funeral in an admiral's hat and spats, at which point the Wizengamot suggested gently that it was time he move aside (Spavin was 147 when he left office).
#+end_quote

This leads me to believe that the Wizengamot had powers to remove the Minister of Magic. Since other Ministers have also been pushed out, mostly likely by the Wizengamot.

Unfortunately the fandom, mostly when it concerns fanfiction, believes that seats on the Wizengamot are hereditary. Which they is no proof to back us such a claim. I recently saw a post, in which a commenter said that the seats are probably co-opation. In which, the members of the Wizengamot elect new members after one retires.

And since we have seen that the Wizengamot has judicial powers.

My opinion is that

*The Wizengamot is legislature and also a high court based on the House of Lords. Except that the seats on the Wizengamot are not hereditary. They are most likely co-opation.*


** It is quite likely that JKR has designed the Wizengamot after the lower house (elected) and upper house (House of Lord) in Great Britain. How power is distributed and the method of procedure is only little illuminated in the books (book 5) and there it seem to be the exceptions. Full Wizgamot for simple underage casting is unusual, would only be a hearing with normal ministerial staff. How elections are held and at what intervals is not explained in the books. Likewise, the voting rights of the individual MPs or whether the minister has a veto is not explained.

We don't even know what the rights and duties of ministerial staff like Arthur W. or Umbrich are or whether they are appointed by the Minister / Wizgamot. So authors have a lot of freedom to experiment, see the whole Political Harry fics.

** In the books, we only see it function as a court. Its been said to have legislative functions as well, but I'm not sure how much that's fan theories vs canon- in book five, we mostly see Fudge governing by decree in place of a legislature.

One thing to note- despite being almost ubiquitous in fanfic these days, there is no evidence of Wizarding Britain having a formal aristocracy or noble families having hereditary Wizengamot seats. If they did, it is highly unlikely that Lucius Malfoy would have been waiting outside during Harry's trial, instead of occupying his seat inside. Likewise, we never see a Black or Longbottom sitting on the court, or hear any mention of it.

The court appears to be presided over by the Chief Warlock-during most of the main period of the books, this is Albus Dumbledore, though after he is removed, Amelia Bones presides over Harry's trial. Its unclear to what extent the Chief Warlock has actual power, or if its mostly a ceremonial position. Notably Fudge sits on the court as well, and seems to take the lead in interrogating Harry- its not clear if the Minister or Department heads normally sit on the court, but if so then that means there isn't really an independent check on the Minister's power (its also very problematic to have Moody, an Auror, on the court during the Goblet of Fire flashbacks, unless he was just there as a witness- it means that the cops are essentially acting as the judges/jury).

How people end up on the Wizengamot is unclear- its probably not hereditary, but they could be appointed by the Minister, selected by the Wizengamot itself, or even elected (I doubt the last one, though, as it seems to be treated more as an office to which notable witches and wizards are appointed). Its also not clear what the qualifications for membership are- presumably one must be of age, and know about the magic world, and there's no mention of any non-humans being present, though whether that's because of formal bans on non-humans/non-wizards participating, or just informal bias, is unclear. There doesn't seem to be much gender discrimination- women and me both feature prominently on the court. It is also possible for someone to be removed from the office of Chief Warlock or the Wizengamot (Dumbledore in book five), but the procedure for this is likewise unclear.

We do know there are about fifty members- I strongly head canon a standard 49, as 7x7 is a magically significant number, and an odd number will help avert tie votes.

Nothing is ever said about parties or how elections work in the books, although Pottermore confirms that Ministers for Magic, at least, are sometimes elected (every seven years, I believe, though there have also been cases of a replacement being appointed, ie the office being offered repeatedly to Dumbledore). Given the small population of the magical community, I rather doubt there is much in the way of formal parties, but you could probably divide Wizarding Britain during the books roughly into three informal factions: Pureblood Radicals/Death Eaters, Conservatives/status quo, and Reformers.

My advice if you really want to get into the details is to research how various government courts and committees work, and pick whichever details feel like the best fit to you (as long as its consistent with whatever has been previous established). I think your guess above, as far as they go, are fairly plausible, and a better take than most fanfic interpretations of the Wizengamot. That said, we never see it in a legislative role, but a large court which votes on the interpretation/legality of laws fills a similar role in some ways.

*** Another thing I forgot to add- its noted as unusual for the full court to hear a case like Harry's. "Minor"/routine stuff is likely normally handled by smaller committees, with only major issues/cases decided by the full court.

** honestly it's fiction. If those details matter to you then they probably matter in your style of story making. there's not much in canon so you can make up whatever nitty gritty details you want

all we know really is what is stated above and that it's desperately corrupt and very vulnerable to a hostile take over
