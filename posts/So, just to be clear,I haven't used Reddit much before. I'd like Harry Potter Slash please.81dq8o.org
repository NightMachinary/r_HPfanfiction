Harry Potter Slash please, longer fics, though just good Harry Potter fanfiction is always good.

I'm not terribly used to Reddit btws Also, no homosexuality hate, being gay/a lesbian is not a choice. I am autistic, a lesbian, yet still a person. Shock! Horror! üò±üíèüë¨üò±

** Hi there!

So, I'd recommend linkffn(A Lack Of Color). It's Harry/Cedric around the Triwizard Tournament. Very cute, very sweet and the relationship is believable. There's a sequel as well if you like it.

I'd also recommend linkffn(The Condition To Tutoring Harry Potter). Harry/Roger Davies. I really enjoyed it.

Plus, if you don't mind time travel fiction, there's linkffn(Shiny and Blue). Harry/Dumbledore, with Harry going back in time. It's not my favourite fic, but it's easy to read.

I don't share the stigma that quite a few people here have, and I'm glad to hear of your interest in these fics. I hope you enjoy!

** Probably one of the most well known slash stories. It's Harry/Snape by the way. Pretty good story. I don't remember exactly whether thefirst story is slash already, it's been a few years, but it does turn into slash.

Though I find your comment at the end rather odd. You're already starting off thinking the worst of people, assuming people here will be homophobic and setting yourself up as a victim.

**** Not OP but emojis are seen as the inability to write properly in quite a few online communities (at least here in Germany), either because, like in the case of this thread, they add nothing of value or because they are just spammed. Instead of taking the time and effort to write out what they are trying to express, people just dump a bunch of emojis and are done with it. Especially in text/discussion heavy communities, that seems disrespectful since it looks like whoever is using them cannot be bothered to actually write something. Also, quite often they come across like one of those in-chapter authors notes, trying to express something that is obvious. Like in this case, where OP already wrote those thoughts out and the additional visualisation is considered unnecessary. On quite a few websites, using emojis gets you instantly downvoted, no matter the actual content.

Not a huge fan of most emojis myself, but I frankly don't care about the whole debate.
