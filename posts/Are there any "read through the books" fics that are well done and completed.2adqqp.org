** The only one I've found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8343560/1/Revisiting-First-Year][Revisiting First Year]], which has Harry going back and telling Lily, James, Sirius and Remus what happens with the help of some Pensieve memories Dumbledore edited to be like the books.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1847346/jlmill9][This author]] used to have all seven books completed, plus a sequel to describe how, and what had changed with the future knowledge. They used to be on FF.net, but sadly, they had to be deleted, because -apparently- a while back there was a great /reading the books/-purge.

I do think they are still on other fanfiction sites, though.

**** I know, the problem is that most of them just have the characters reading and reacting to every little bit... instead of just saying "they read through the books" and then have what they do with that knowledge. So much potential wasted /EVERY/ time.

** How are those "fanfics" not illegal??

Making an original story in the HP-universe is one thing. Flat-out copying every single word in the books is not. That's just flat-out illegal and no respected site should feature stories like that.

*** I think you misunderstood what OP was asking for. It isn't just a copy-paste of the books. Its someone going back in time and telling the Marauders, or Dumbledore, what happens, or some AU shenanigans happening and them getting a copy of the books.

Snippets from the books might be used, but the focus is more on the reactions of the reader.

**** "snippets of the books" does not mean "every single word", even if you put a whole paragraph in between a single sentence, you still copy-pasted the whole book.

***** By snippets I meant not the whole book. The fic I linked skips over large sections IIRC, its been a while since I read it, and not only the non-plot relevant parts.

*** First, what are you talking about. Second, are you confused? Third, JK Rowling is on record saying she doesn't mind fanfiction as long as it doesn't contain adult themes.

Trying to sell fanfiction as books is illegal though.

**** These are the types of fics that have literally the entire book copy-pasted in their story with only a few lines of (often very poorly done) "discussion" in between paragraphs.

Fanfiction generally falls under "fair use" and is thus legal (regardless of what the author wants, even pure porn stories about harry Potter are legal) However you cannot just copy the entire work and put it online for free. That's a clear copyright violation.

Do you have any references to court rulings including fan fiction or the like? I'd be interested to read more about it. I'm really not sure how copyright would apply to typical fan fiction, which rarely quotes directly from source material. It seems like a quagmire of trademark violations, of course, but that's much different.

  In 2007 two [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Davis_Law_School][UC Davis Law School]] professors argued in the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Law_Review][California Law Review]]/ that "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue][Mary Sue]]" fan fiction "that challenge the orthodoxy of the original likely constitute fair use". Citing /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music,_Inc.][Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]/---which established that commercial parody can qualify as fair use if it can be perceived as commenting or criticizing on the original---and the subsequent /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suntrust_v._Houghton_Mifflin][Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]/, the authors wrote that "Similarly, many Mary Sues comment on or criticize the original, while at the same time create something new ... Mary Sues can be commercial and still be fair."
