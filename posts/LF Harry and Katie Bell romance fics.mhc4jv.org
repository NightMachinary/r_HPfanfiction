*** This is a good one and relatively new. Glad to see that someone recommended it as well as wrote it. There's far too few Harry/Katie stories.

** I love Harry/Katie: thing is, aside from a few canonical details (such as being a Gryffindor, one year older, being "kind", and she was pissy with him in his first year -- I think she was a DA member, too), she's actually a blank lump of clay to mold.

But people don't take the opportunity. :(

Wait, really? When did that happen, besides when they lost 150 points?

**** That was it: when Harry, Hermione, and Ron lost all those points, she and the rest of the Team were pissy with him, calling him "the Seeker" instead of his name. Understandable from an outside context, really. Aside from that, she was said to be "kind". I suppose it doesn't help that her actress (second one, I mean), Georgina Leonidas, actually does fit the "kind" stereotype about her looks -- soft brown eyes, a slight smile, et cetera.

  Harry walks into a good time.Or, a confused Harry attempts to solve a problem with someone else's help for once, and saves the world by accident. Well, Leanne does.Or, Katie is really very pretty and Harry is made aware of that through the power of physics.

  Fifth year isn't going great for Harry until a teammate catches him hiding an injury. Katie Bell gets the ball rolling, but Harry's the one who picks it up. A few new friends can go a long way to fixing Harry's problems.

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.
