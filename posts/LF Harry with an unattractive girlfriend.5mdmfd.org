Title.

Thank you


** Luna in fanfiction always gets the same treatment as Hermione. All of the traits that Harry describes that suggests he does not find them physically attractive are morphed into attractive traits. Hermione's frizzy hair, for example, often transforms into glossy ringlets. Luna is usually portrayed as ethereal and nearly fae-like in fanfiction, even though in the books she's got dirty blonde hair and bulging eyes. And girls are always described as petite, but then mention is made over and over of their mile-long legs. Those things typically don't go together. "Petite" pretty much rules out the possibility of lengthy limbs.

It's a bit of a peeve of mine as a reader. You don't have to "pretty up" the characters to make them worthy of being the main love interest. I actually think it would give the relationship some extra depth if everyone wasn't described as looking like they just stepped out of a GAP ad.

**** Oh, come on. FanFiction as a whole is wish fulfillment. Why would someone write a main love interest as ugly for the sake of them being ugly? For most people, that's neither fun to write nor fun to read. I certainly don't want to read something like that. You might differ with me on this, and that's fine.

I also disagree that writing someone as ugly adds any meaningful "depth" to the relationship. As if the uglier the people involved are, then the stronger or more meaningful their love is. If that's true, then it would work inversely as well. And that's ridiculous.

It's also ironic that you guys say writing in attractive people is wish fulfillment, when doing the opposite is also wish fulfillment. Why does OP want a fic in which Harry has an unattractive girlfriend, I wonder?

It's especially ridiculous when you consider that this is taking place in a fantasy world where there can be any number of ways to beautify a person through potions or whatnot.

Edit- I forgot that on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]], logic = downvotes. I wouldn't mind if it didn't restrict how often I can post site-wide.

  FanFiction as a whole is wish fulfillment.
#+end_quote

A generalization like that easily applies to literally every other work of fiction. Why wish for anything when we've got real life?

But /blatant/ wish-fulfillment, which over-writes other crucial elements of a story like plot, conflict, character development, and interesting characters (not Mary Sue's), is a horrible blight that appears in an overabundance of fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Why would someone write a main love interest as ugly for the sake of them being ugly?
#+end_quote

I agree; blatant character features shouldn't be randomly assigned. It works both ways: if a character's beauty or ugliness is relevant to the story (simple symbolism, development, etc.), then I would expect some description or reveal about their physical characteristics. But excessive, awe-inspiring beauty or the explicit opposite for no other reason than fluff is grating and extraneous to the story; it's usually a red flag for a poor author.

For example, GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire is /filled/ with descriptions. Even the smallest character gets far more of a description than the average novel. But that's because it contributes to the story (most of the time). His world is supposed to be rich and vibrant, with characters that seem real. It fits the rest of his writing style. Important physical traits (like the ugliness of a certain dwarf) are constantly relevant to the story.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Wish-fulfillment :)

Or perhaps any other variety of reasons. When I see the phrase "unattractive girlfriend", I'm not expecting to think of fics where "ugly" is a main point; I think of fics where there's less emphasis on the physical.

#+begin_quote
  logic = downvotes
#+end_quote

Phrases like "I also disgree" and "ridiculous" and "Oh, come on" are not logic. But more importantly, the [[/r/hpfanfiction]] community is a bit more cynical toward tired cliches than the ffn review community. And so defending a trope like wish-fulfillment isn't going to go over well.

If you want karma, just post some generic bland stuff on [[/r/funny]], they upvote anything :P

If it were that easy, one could assume that /everyone/ in the HP universe was drop-dead gorgeous, and that's obviously not the case from some of the physical descriptions given in the books. Personally, I'd like to see more "normal" people described rather than every character being considered "stunningly beautiful" because that gets boring after a while. Also, just because someone is plain or as you put it "ugly" doesn't mean they aren't interesting. I'd rather hear about Harry falling in love with someone with an actual personality rather than some chick who's got perfect rosebud lips and sparkling cerulean eyes.

As far as your downvotes go, I'd blame that on your pissy attitude. It may not have been intentional, but your post's tone is pretty condescending and aggressive considering this was all just a conversation about preferences in character development and variety.

However, I have this plot bunny, in which Harry's love became horribly disfigured/scarred as a result of the War, but he stayed true to her, despite many temptations by other 'beautiful' witches. The story would be depressing and heartbreaking though.

***** Are you implying that a female with access to these things wouldn't use them? What's with this double-standard? For Harry or Voldemort to go use potions and rituals to get muscles, and good looks is alright, but for a woman to do the same is suddenly "Mary-sue"?

To be clear, excessively spamming rituals and the like for benefits is bad writing. My point is that a ritual or two that suit Harry's interests are fine, but one for Hermione or whoever else is not? That's inconsistent.

I was a fatass until I started consistently going to gym some years back. I've come to enjoy working out. Nevertheless, if there was a a weight-loss potion or muscle ritual available to me then, I would have still done it. Similarly, if I was ugly, I would jump at a means of fixing that.

A fair number of authors make their MC's solve magical problems that are in the range of decades of research or someone's full life work in the course of months which is beyond stupid. Canon Hermione was an activist, and while she was intelligent she was not a researcher, making her solve research problems is stupid.

** Ironically (or perhaps not given my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5atpzk/hpfanfiction_survey_2016_survey_on_demographics/d9kptt1/][own]] theories in the past), two stories that might fit the bill here are two Harry Potter / Daphne Greengrass stories.

First, LuanMao's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]]/ | linkffn(5864749) . In the story, Daphne isn't quite ugly, but is entirely, thoroughly plain, both in terms of looks and in terms of personality.

Secondly, storytellerSpW's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy]]/ | linkffn(9774121) . It features a Daphne wherein she is attacked and disfigured by Dark magic.

** I think it is funny that there are so few stories where Harry has an unattractive GIRLfriend. I primarily read slash and there are a couple Drarry fics I can think of where Draco isn't the best looking (describes as scrawny or when older he is losing his hair, has a gut etc.) and there are TONS of Snarry fics where Harry loves Snape despite his looks and actually learns to find Snape attractive even though no one else does. It's interesting to me that het writers would rather "pretty up" female canon characters than work their canon descriptions into the story.

**** Eh, I don't see it that way. If you read the character descriptions, then MANY of the characters are not described as very attractive. Glasses. Hooked noses. Scarred. Frizzy hair. Unruly hair. Bull-like face. Frog-like face. Rat-like face. Fat. Why would so many adults wear glasses and be fat if there were easy fixes for those things? It either doesn't exist or requires continuous potions / expensive.

Yes, though, I never see pairings between unattractively described anyone in any fanfiction. In fanfiction, everyone being featured is attractive, or isn't unattractive. I prefer to look at it like this... if Harry is describing this person and will form a relationship, then he probably does find them attractive on some level and will describe them to be so. I'd rather see a fic where it swaps point of views for a relevant reason to the plot, and that person describes the other as most society would see them. What I do see a bit of is OC main character describing themselves as unattractive, then someone gorgeous liking them anyway...

*** I agree with you partially. Harry considered Hermione "pretty" after she admittedly conned the school nurse into fixing her teeth, and spent hours and tons of beauty products on her hair. That implies that for the hair thing at least, there's no magical easy fix. Hermione said herself that it was too much bother to go through all the time, and she only did it for the special occasion. If there were easy magical fixes for appearance, people would do that instead of the hair tonic.

And being described as "pretty" is different from "beautiful." Sort of like how something can be called "cool" but it's not the same level of cold as "icy." But that's just getting into semantics, so we can probably agree to disagree on that.
