I noticed that no matter how cunning, resourceful, or apathetic Harry is, never once have I seen a story where he actually keeps his head down around Umbridge. I have read stories where Harry is supposedly the most Slytherin of Slytherins, cunning and powerful, feeling disdain for his fellow students, yet he won't keep his mouth shut around her.

Does anyone have any good stories where he actually manages to just keep his mouth shut, and avoid getting in trouble with her?


** And despite fanfiction having a million rehashes of Harry's first class argument with Umbridge, not one of them has Harry make the most obvious argument: if there's nothing "out there" to defend from, why does the Ministry have Aurors?

**** Mmm, but remember that Aurors being a general police force is something of a fanon invention. In canon, general crime is investigated by the Ministry department responsible for that area. So, Arthur Weasley, for example, has a number of "police powers" in connection with enforcement of Muggle artefacts law, including the ability to raid locations.

The Aurors are specifically dark wizard hunters (and apparently protection for the Minister for Magic).

***** People forget about both the Hit Wizards and the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol. The MLEP would be the ones to deal with petty and non-Dark crimes like theft. In fact, they were mentioned as such in canon:

#+begin_quote
  A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, “ ‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.' This is getting ridiculous...”

  “A regurgitating toilet?”

  “Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing --- well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those --- those pumbles, I think they're called --- you know, the ones who mend pipes and things ---”

  “Plumbers?”

  “--- exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.”

  “Will it be Aurors who catch them?”

  “Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol --- ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”

The MLEP seems to be more like the regular police force, with the Aurors corresponding more to the CID/Major Crime Squad.

Bob Ogden was noted as being the head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad:

  “Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?”

  “I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” said Ogden.

******** Nice, I'll remember to include them when I get to the "Harry is missing" part of my fic. Although for Harry Potter it would probably mostly be Aurors, I think.

*** It is kind of unrelated, but your question sent me down a different train of thought. What Umbridge and the Ministry did in book 5 is only unreasonable because they still taught Defense. It would have been far more reasonable to just get rid of the class all together.

First of all, the position is pretty openly known to be cursed, bad things happen to everyone who takes the position. Was someone trying to get rid of Umbridge by placing her in the job? Even if noone thought of the dangers, it seems like a poor long term decision to have the first Ministry appointed teacher only appear for one year.

Second of all, if they are insistent that nothing is out to get you, removing the class seems like less effort then continuing to teach it. Even if done poorly, compulsory defense education will always make the students and more importantly their parents think that there is a need for it.

Finally, and this one bothers me the most, what is the Ministry's long term goal? To piss off every magical family with children? You put the Senior Undersecretary of the Minister himself into the position, and all the grades plummet, failed OWLS and NETS abound, students who get good grades in DADA all of a sudden get poor grades, tales of corporal punishment and being attacked by Hall Monitors. The public backlash would destroy Fudge. In fact, assuming the events at the end of book 5 didn't happen then the DA might have saved the career of Fudge.

Sorry about my rant, it just dawned on me that by Harry keeping his head down, then not only would there be less pain throughout the year, but everything would be fixed the next year on it's own. Also that removing the course is by far the more effective plan then removing a high ranking government official from her job and investing so much time and effort into political suicide.

**** They probably can't remove the whole class just like that, though.

And the whole decision to instate her in the function of a teacher at Hogwarts was a result of Fudge being delusional, in any case. So I wouldn't try to look for common sense in that.

*** I was going to go with 'Werewolves' as the most obvious argument, followed by Poltergeists, Boggarts and Dementors (though that one would just lead back to the whole 'Harry is a liar' thing).

*** Why should a country have a military if it's involved in no wars?

Just because the Dark Lord has been defeated doesn't necessarily mean there should be no more Aurors. It may be justification for reducing the scope of their power and their numbers to more manageable peacetime values, but they should never just straight up go away.

For example, say after Voldemort's fall the auror force gets disbanded. Fifty or a hundred years later there is a new dark lord. Now we're all screwed, because nobody has had the extensive training or the knowledge to fight a dark wizard in decades.

** That's a rather unlikely outcome, since her principle reason for being at the school is to discredit him and Dumbledore. He wouldn't be able to sit silent on the basis that she could demand answers from him and punish him either for not replying or for the 'tone' of the reply. Harry just made it easier for her by rising to the bait every time for the first few weeks. Once she'd gotten him kicked from Quidditch he appeared to be defeated (most of his focus was shifted to the DA). From then on Harry may have been 'behaving himself' but she had the bigger target to handle and the community to subjugate.
