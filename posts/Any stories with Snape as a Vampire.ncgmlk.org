What it says on the tin. There are so many stories that joke around Snape being a bat or outright Vampire, yet the market for stories actually involving Snape as a Vampire seems pretty empty...\\
Are there any good stories (I am not at all picky about pairings, I read everything as long as it's decently writtenðŸ˜…).


** Two Severus/Harry stories by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7761634][Prince Consort]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1573352/chapters/3340145][The Leader]]

  Dumbledore in order to negotiate the vampires joining his order, gives Harry over (to Severus) not caring what harm would befall the teenager. The Vow Severus and Dumbledore created is broken in the process allowing Severus to benefit from it. Creature inheritance - Severus as a vampire. SS/HP A/U Manipulative Dumbledore. Harry sees Remus as a father. What of Sirius does he stand a chance at claiming back the love Harry held for him as a child? slash.

  Albus Dumbledore's been searching for Harry Potter for seven years, he accidentally and unknowingly bumps into the eighteen year old and stirs the hornets nest. Not only is Harry out for Dumbledore's blood he has to put up with Voldemort encroaching upon his territory - Harry controls the underworld. Watch as the most powerful leader takes on the Death Eaters and The Order for dominance. SS/HP Top Harry Bottom Severus.
