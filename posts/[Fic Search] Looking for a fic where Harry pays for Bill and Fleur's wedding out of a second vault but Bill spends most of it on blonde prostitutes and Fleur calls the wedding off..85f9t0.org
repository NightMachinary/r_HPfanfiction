I doubt this fic was any good but it's bugging me that I can't find it. I think Harry set up a mini-vault for the wedding expenses. Ginny helped or ordered prostitutes for Bill's stag night. All of the Weasleys kids, Harry and Lupin attend but Harry and Lupin opt out of the orgy.

Then Harry goes outside the little cottage and Fleur turns up. Harry tries to get her to leave like a bro but she turns the wall of the cottage see-through and isn't a happy bunny. She transforms but Harry transports her away and I think she gets him drunk on wine but is switching hers with water.

I think it might be Harry/Fleur. I remember that there was lots of recrimination the next morning and Harry was acting like everyone's bitch.

I've never been unable to find a story that I can remember so much of. Even if this story is crap I'd appreciate finding it if only to stop it niggling away in the back of my mind.

*** Thanks, that's the one. I've been searching on fanfiction.net which explains why I couldn't find it.

Edit: Argh. That was terrible. What evil force made me remember that??

**** There are some truly awful fics in my /favorites/ list from 10+ years ago that I refuse to get rid of. Partly for nostalgia, partly to force me to acknowledge my shame.

***** One of the first fics I read was The Grass is Always Greener. Not sure if it's good or anything (I think it was the first I read) I have it on my favorites I don't remember it at all but I refuse to unfavorite it because of the nostalgia.
