Obviously, the books had to follow some guidelines because of the target age group. There's some swear words, but the heavier ones are implied/described instead of verbally used. It's the same with the 'rude hand gesture.'

So, what about in fic? Do you find regular swearing in fic sounds ooc because the characters are limited in canon? Is it sometimes overdone in fic? Or do you think they just wouldn't swear much even if they were allowed to in canon?

I always thought Ron would be pretty liberal with his swear words. He'd hush up around Molly and try not to use them around Hermione (cause she'd lecture him), but he'd be swearing up a storm with his brothers or Harry. Hermione wouldn't swear, Harry has his moments, and Ginny comes out with some words that surprise them all.


** It doesn't really bother me, though I suppose I'm guilty of having characters swear liberally in at least one of my fics (though it makes sense given the tone of the story). I can certainly see why others would be annoyed by it, because no one ever explicitly swears in the original series, and suddenly seeing implied profanity explicitly detailed in a fic might be off-putting to some readers.

As for it being OOC? I dunno. This is a series that takes place in England/Scotland in the 90s, and features a cast of mostly teenagers; the fact that their language is so sanitised is what I find far more OOC. Of course, Jo had to clean up the language because HP was first and foremost a children's/young adult's series, but, having spent some time living in northern England as a child, I have a very hard time believing /only/ Ron swears with any regularity.

*** Pretty much this. I would've been a decade younger than the trio, but I still can't imagine a time where English teenagers /never/ swore.

If you're going for a strictly canon feel, it's probably worth just saying "____ swore/cursed," as JKR did as a compromise. Otherwise, as long as it sounds well-placed and the story is rated appropriately, I can't see much of an issue with frequent expletives.

** There's a ton of "___ swore," as you mentioned. Some of it goes unnoticed, but it's actually fairly frequent in the later books.

JKR has pretty much said that she had to limit the swearing due to the nature of the audience:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: Well, I think - I've got a feeling I've told Stephen this already. My editor won't let any of the characters swear. Which is sometimes difficult because Ron is definitely a boy who would swear. So you will have noticed that I get round that by having him - Ron used a word that made Hermione say "Ron!". So I do that quite a bit with Ron.
#+end_quote

Ron likes swearing, but I can't imagine him peppering his speech too liberally with cursing because he wouldn't dare curse in front of his mother. So cursing is still going to be a sort of subversive act. Same with all of the Weasley brothers. They would swear, but it wouldn't easily slip off their tongues in regular conversation.

I've always been a fan of precision swearing for Hermione. I don't think she would ever be that into it, but if you're writing Hermione/Ron, it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't wear off a little. And after all, Hermione does tell Ron "where he can stick his wand" and calls him an arse after he returns in DH. She's not completely opposed to swearing.

***** Oh, gotcha. Yeah, I agree. Especially as she gets older. That applies to all the canon kids - I think adulthood would introduce more vulgarity into their speech, though not in a constant, edgy, streetwise way. But profanity is a common idiom with a wide variety of style and purpose. British slang is very creative that way.

I don't remember Harry or Hermione swearing in the first few books, wizard style or otherwise. I don't think it would have been unrealistic even if it were the case; swear words are always the first things to be picked up when exposed to a new culture/language, in my experience.

** Well...too much profanity is a turn-off no matter what I'm reading. If every other word is vulgar, that's overkill no matter what. I don't care if the characters are hardcore gangstas, it's distracting.

That said, a moderate usage really depends on the character's age and origin; it seems natural for the teenaged characters to swear occasionally. The parent characters...less so, depending on who they are. The fact that Molly Weasley, for example, doesn't swear is what makes her 'you b----' so powerful and awesome. The lack of profanity in canon doesn't bother me at all, either, so either way is fine.

** I dislike it when characters pepper their speech with swears. It's not how they talk in canon, and it doesn't really fit. Wizards and witches don't seem to have much access to muggle pop culture, and they go to boarding school, so they aren't exposed to those sorts of speech patterns enough that they'd likely imitate them. You don't swear as part of normal speech unless the people around you do as well, or you deliberately like to sound vulgar.

On the other hand, canon characters obviously swear sometimes in canon, although it's often implied. Most everyone swears when they stub a toe, or when they're furious, so I don't think it's weird for even the most polite characters to swear then. I can also imagine Ginny swearing to get a rise out of people, but that's still a deliberate decision, not a casual part of normal speech.

I tend to think of swearing as a crutch for writers with a poor vocabulary. There are, however, notable exceptions to this. For example, I recently finished a book in /The Expanse/ series featuring a diminutive, elderly woman with an absolutely filthy mouth as protagonist. She swore in moments of tension not only as a way to relieve her stress, but to assert her dominance and push her worldview on the other characters. I don't know how else the authors would have 'shown not told' these particular facets of this character in such an easily relatable manner.

Your views about the canon characters' use of profanity makes sense to me, but I don't remember enough about Ginny's dialogue to say whether or not she was particularly creative in that regard. In HP fanfic, though, nine times out of ten authors use swearing as a method to make their emo!Harry seem 'cool.' I think it's OOC and don't see why Harry would use casual profanity in any context.

*** I quickly back away from fics that try to make Harry 'hardcore' with constant profanity. Often, it's not even a creative use of profanity. It's just one or two words on repeat. Swear words - any dialogue really - should be representative of a character's personality or situation. If it doesn't do that, it's unnecessary.

As for the Ginny thing, I admit that's more headcanon. I can imagine Molly not wanting her to pick up swear words, and Ginny finding it wickedly amusing to do so. The inventive ones would be specifically dropped in front of her brothers just to get a reaction.

** Swearing in stories doesn't bother me except when done badly - like anything else. If the characters start effing and blinding left right and centre, that's always going to put me off. But another thing is when American authors try to swear in a British style: "Bloody buggering balls" is a phrase I see far too often, and which has never, ever been uttered by any British teenager.

And trying to spice up wizarding expressions can be awful too. "Merlin's saggy left buttock" and nonsense like that. Just no.

In an M-rated story, there's nothing wrong with having a character say "shit!" or similar. If you're writing for a younger audience, just don't do that.

** I think there's suspiciously little swearing in canon as it is already. All teenagers, away from their parents? Harry didn't have a mother figure growing up, so there's nothing to stop him from swearing like his life depended on it. Ron and Ginny probably learnt a lot of very colorful language from their older brothers, and a lot of teenage boys simply swear because it makes them sound cool.

So I think swearing is far from OOC. In fact, the only important character who probably doesn't swear a lot is Hermione.

** The problem with swearing is, that colloquialism doesn't translate well geographically. Sure, the basic swear words in the English language are the same everywhere, but outside of that you have a distinctive national/local flavor of swearing in different regions.

That's the reason why I tend to dislike excessive swearing in Harry Potter fanfiction. If you ever see an American try to do a British accent, those familiar with it will just shake their heads sadly and bemoan the colonials' lack of culture.

That also works the other way around. If you're doing it right, people might not understand it as you intended. I'm not a native English speaker for example and only grew to understand the less formal way of communicating in several English-speaking countries around the world after long years of practice. Put some of the less common swear words in front of non-native English speakers - and lets not forget, that this is a not inconsiderable part of fanfiction readers after all - and it will likely fly over their heads.

My point is: better leave it out if you can't do it right, but even authentic swearing may not be the best choice for an international audience.
