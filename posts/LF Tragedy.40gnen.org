I'm really in the mood for a really sad story. I'm searching for a fic that brings me to tears and doesn't have a happy ending. I would prefer if the topic would about Harry's death (because of the horcrux), but an other topic would be fine too.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12266&chapter=all][Counting To Five Thousand]] is the best one I've read. Written Pre-DH, deals with Harry's death. It's a rather short story, just three chapters and 12k words.

  A look at the actions of a main character from the point of view of other characters. When death rocks Hogwarts, you'd be surprised who's affected. Chapter Twelve: Rosemary Sprout tends to her garden, the students - and the other professors

** The original ending of linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) (i.e., reading only that and ignoring the happy-ending sequels) qualifies. It's gloriously angsty and tragic, and I love it.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.
