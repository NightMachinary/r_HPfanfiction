There was this story where Harry created this rune ring that separated junk, the only problem too much junk over a period of time and it over heated. SO he turned the system in to a power plant producing energy, by boiling water as it separated rubbish in to different components. so as he made clean energy, he got raw materials to sell on to other businesses.


** Sorry, I have no idea what it could be. It sounds like an interesting read though!
