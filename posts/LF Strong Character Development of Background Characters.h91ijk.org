I'm looking for stories that either feature the pov of a side character or have strong character development of a side characters. I don't care about length, when it occurs, crack or ships. I want to ask that you stay to the magical world, however, and keep other characters' personalities compliant to the canon. I would prefer no OCs, but if it's a good rec then I might read it.

Side characters I'd love to read about: Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, Hannah Albott, Susan Bones, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zinbini, Dennis Creevy, Colin Creevy, Angelina Jones, Lee Jordan, Lavender Brown, Patil Twins, Justin Finch-Fletchey, Ernie MacMillian, Anthony Goldstein, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Cho Chang, Aberforth Dumbledore, Ariana Dumbledore, Dudley Dursley, Petunia Dursley, Arabella Figg, Regulus Black, Garrick Ollivander, and Myrtle Warren (Moaning Myrtle).

Also, please no Daphne Greengrass! I want to read stories about characters that aren't often featured. If you've got anything that develops any of the characters above, please send them!

Also, one of my favourite one-shots is Cauterize by Lady Altair [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]].


** Not from others by floreatcastellum has amazing development of Colin creevey and similar side characters as they are ginnys classmates, definitely worth a read

** Colin Creevy doesn't have much personality development in canon beyond his first year. This fleshes him out a bit more: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14006610]]) Canon-compliant.
