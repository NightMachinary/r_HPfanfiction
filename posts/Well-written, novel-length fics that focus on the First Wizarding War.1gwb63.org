I'm in the mood to read about the first Order of the Phoenix and/or the Death Eaters during Voldemort's initial uprising. :) Novel-length is preferable, but I'll read a short fic if it's good. Ratings, pairings and main characters don't bother me. :) Does anyone have any suggestions?


** I'm beta reading for a fantastic James/Lily fic that involves a lot of the characters and happenings of the First war. It's going to be two novel-length stories. The first is almost complete and the second will pick up after the Marauders graduate from Hogwarts and become part of the Order.

I'm obviously a little biased, but I think Before They Fall is the best Marauders fic I've ever read:

** I'm writing some. Be patient though, because seven novels of fic is gonna take some time. I've just lost my job though, so should have a bit more time to spend on it.

I'm with you though, the First Wizarding War is really intriguing. I'm having lots of fun learning about it!
