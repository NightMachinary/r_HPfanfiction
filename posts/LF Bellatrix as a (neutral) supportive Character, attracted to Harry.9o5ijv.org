Whether she works for the Order right from the Beginning or is a neutral supportive Character (but to important to kill) that gives both sides hints.

No matter what role she has, it would be good if she is attracted to Harry (she once was to James, but since his Son was given his appearance, she feels also attracted to him) No necessary smut, but innuendos/erotica would be good.

Concerning Harry: a shy/embarassed persona as well as a Cocky one like his father, when confronted with her is ok.

Doesnt matter if he is dating someone and she might become jealous about Bellatrixs behaviour.


** I'm guessing you've already read it, but linkffn(5511855) kinda fits this.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** On the one hand, what Hellstrike said is absolutely correct as to the physcology of most males.

On the other hand, I'm all for equal privledge of both genders going to jail for predatory behavior. So I agree and disagree.

Now, considering this is fantasy and make believe and that thier cultural norms arent ours, do what you want.

But in order for this particular relationship to work it has to he either A ( Younger Bellatrix with no Voldemort Influence) or B (Bellatrix with no Voldemort Influence but general Black Tragic Flaw. IE Highly unstable and prone to making really really really really really really really really really really really really rash decisions)

*** Seduced by an older woman is a really common fantasy. Ask any guy, they are either gay, have crushed on one of their teachers/mom's friends/attractive neighbour or they are lying. 45 isn't too old for that, especially not with magical longevity and magic in general to fix some of nature's flaws. Hell, the actress (Helena Bonham Carter) is 52 and still attractive today (she was in her 40s during the movies). At least half of the Bellamione shippers are into that pairing due to her (most are girls though, but the same principle applies).

There's even a German proverb about this, which roughly translates to "You learn to ride on old horses".

**** Doesn't mean it isn't rape and illegal. It's not about “nature's flaws”, it's that a child can not consent to sex with an adult.

Gross. Go away.

***** If Harry is 16, that is perfectly legal in the UK, 15 if they take a vacation in France. Hell, they can actually get Married in Scotland if Harry is above 16.

The current French president was seduced by his teacher (39) when he was 15 and he is still married to her, but I guess we better lock her away as rapist if you say so.

***** I'm not going to say that there are no situations in which older teenagers - young adults - cannot consent. But saying that a healthy, of sane mind 16 year old cannot physically consent to a relationship is... well, you're going to be in the minority.

In some places you'd be breaking the law. In others you wouldn't. Laws are a causation of the morals of the masses, not the other way around. The only time the law should dictate a moral position is when deciding how the consequences of breaking them would affect those around you.
