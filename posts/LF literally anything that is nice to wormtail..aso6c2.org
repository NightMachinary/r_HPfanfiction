  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)
