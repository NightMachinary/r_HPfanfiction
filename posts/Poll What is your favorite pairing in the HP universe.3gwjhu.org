As the title says, what is your favorite HP pairing?

I made a small poll with several major pairings listed as options. Of course there are about 50 billion characters in the HP world, so I'm sure I missed a few of someone's favorites. I did try to pick from what was most popular. Feel free to post your pairing if it wasn't listed in the poll.

[[http://www.poll-maker.com/poll387079xDDab461a-15][Take the poll!]]

Edited to add: [[http://www.poll-maker.com/results387079x6DE8b517-15#tab-2][Check the results]].

Harry/Other is out in the lead. From the comments, it sounds like that's mostly Tonks, Fleur or Luna. Next is Harry/Hermione, then Harry/Ginny.


** Since I started reading HP fanficton I've grown to love Harry/Luna. It's a shame that there don't seem to be many stories with it that are good enough for me to want to read.

** I don't consider myself to be a shipper, but I think Bill/Fleur is the most interesting and well-written of all of the canon ships. I don't think I've ever read a fic for it, though. Maybe I should change that.

I picked Harry/Ginny on your poll because I think I've read more of it than most of the other options, and I was pleased that they ended up together in canon.

I don't really have an objection to any canon ship, though I like some more than others. I dislike a few fanon ships, but not very many.

But if we're talking monogamous ships it's either Bill/Fleur or Tonks/Lupin. One of these I also have queer headcanons about.

ETA: Harry/Draco has to get an honourable mention.

*** The Top 5 ships in the HP fandom are, from what I've seen: Harry/Draco, Draco/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione and Neville/Luna. In whichever order. So it's only natural that these would switch orders in various polls.

****** For a ship that didn't happen, Harry/Hermione is still extremely popular and still one of the most popular ships. And well, many still dislike the way Harry/Ginny happened in the books, despite it being canon.

At the end of the day though, ship what you like!

** Bellatrix/Hermione

The best ff i've read so far had this pairing. I found it excedingly well done in the context of the story.
