I'm not a fan, idk why, of Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's gp, just that I preffer the link to the Blacks through Dorea, and I'm a fan of Arcturus.


** I just refuse to acknowledge the Pottermore comment on Harry's grandparents and will continue to refer to them as Charlus and Dorea.

**** Fleamont and Euphemia.

Fleamont Potter became an excellent duelist because people made fun of his ridiculous name. He later invented the Sleekeazy Hair Potion and made tons of money.

He was at least 50 years old when his son James was born. As a result, he and his wife really really spoiled James.

For a long time, many people thought that Charlus and Dorea (n√©e Black) were Harry's grandparents. When JKR added more to Harry's ancestry, some of them got very upset.

If Charlus and Dorea had remained Harry's grandparents, he and Ginny would have been third cousins, as Ginny's grandmother was Cedrella Black. Perhaps JKR didn't like this connection.

***** Thanks! I feel like Rowling waited too long to give us names of other characters and small Minor details that the ideas and names on fanfiction became popular and considered Canon.

***** It also weakens Sirius selflessness slightly, because then he helped family, and not "the son of the family who helped me" - and it weakens the Potter's willingness to take in Sirius even more.

*** Why? Charlus and Dorea were never mentioned in the Books either.

I believe their names first appeared on that Black Family Tapestry created for the Movies.

I don't understand why people would take that seriously, but express such great hate for Pottermore.

**** No, they show up on the tree JKR drew for Book Aid 2006, before Book 7 and before Films 5-8.

I didn't say I hate Pottermore. Just that, much like Cursed Child, I'm not acknowledging that it exists.

***** JKR drew the Black family tree as a donation for a foundation or something. Much like Pottermore's Fleamont and Euphemia, Charlus and Dorea come from peripheral material.

I think Charlus and Dorea are unlikely to be Harry's grandparents when you take the canon books into account though. Sirius and Harry took a look at the tapestry together in book 5, and I think Sirius would've mentioned and pointed out the Potters to him if they were there, considering they were his foster parents and all. Also, he would've mentioned they were so closely related or that Harry was a Black by blood. Also, according to the dates on the tapestry Dorea died around the same time Sirius ran away from home and lived with the Potters. The dates don't add up.

I don't have a problem with Charlus and Dorea in fanfics, but I don't agree with the idea that they should be canon or that they're better canon than Fleamont and Euphemia because they're not. If they were just names I won't have a problem either way. Charlus and Dorea were cooler names. But it's a bigger deal than just names. That lineage makes Harry a Black and that decidedly shouldn't be canon. Harry was never meant to be a Black. It affects several things, for instance the whole reason Sirius's will was so iffy is because his heir wasn't a Black by blood.

**** The tapestry was drawn by JKR for as a donation for a foundation. It was set up for an auction I think, and they used it for the movies later. It's from just as doubtful a content as Pottermore is.

*** Similarly, I refuse to aknowledge the belief that Charlus and Dorea make much more sense as his grandparents.

Which is actually a much easier belief to have since, iunno, mine is actually canon.

** Yes! I recently read an awesome fanfic that had been languishing unread on my favorites list, "The Reclamation of Black Magic". They are his grandparents, and I quite enjoyed the deviation from canon so far once Dorea enters the story in chapter 2. I'll say no more (the premise and Dorea's role are just neat), so here's the link:

linkffn(12058516)

Only downside is the story isn't updated all that often.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

*** Well for one his name is pretty cool. Also since most of the Black characters are blank slates you can do what you want with him, and since Sirius only THINKS he bought an Order of Merlin you can say Sirius always thinks the worst of the Blacks and give him a real one.

  We all know the story of Harry Potter. But what if Harry was raised by his grand parents? Lord Charlus and Lady Dorea take young Hadrian from Dumbledore before he can leave him with the muggles. This story is me trying out something new. If people like it then i will continue writing. Oh, and I DON'T own Harry Potter, obviously.
