********** Unlike snape/harry, there are definitely some pseudo-incestuous vibes there since vernon raised harry for a significant portion of his childhood. Not to mention that he was abusive. I also find snape/harry wierd af, but vernon/harry just takes that to a whole 'nother level.

*********** True. I still think the similarties are astonishing. Canon vernon and snape are both abusive and in a position of power concerning Harry. And some Autors who write snarry even forcibly add the incest angle by at the same time making snape Harrys dad (ao3 tags can tell you a lot that you never wanted to know). I think Alan Rickman was a trully gifted actor - whatever you wanna say about snape (the character) he made him likable above all else.

*********** Language has changed. There was no word to describe who they were or what they were experiencing so people used what they did, oftentimes with negative results.

Some Native American Nations had a third gender role.

Thomas or Thomasine Hall wore both masculine and feminine clothes. After a rumor spread they were with a servant woman (sexual misconduct with a servant if a man), they were inspected and the court ruled they were both a man and a woman. They ruled Thomas(ine) had to wear both women and men clothes simultaneously.

There's also Joseph Lobdell who lived as a man for 60 years and was unfortunately committed to an insane asylum but was able to marry a woman legally.

During the American Civil War, there were several cases of women dressing as men to fight but there are some that continued to live as men after the war until their deaths.

Such was the case with Albert Chashier.

A more unfortunate case was after the war. Frances Thompson, a formly enslaved trans woman, who was among five women who were raped during the Memphis Riots of 1866 and had testified before Congress. She was arrested 10 years later for "crossdressing" and it was used to undermine not only her testimony but of other black women who had been raped.

The politician Murray Hall was famous after his death when it was found he was assigned female at birth. He was then buried in a women's cemetery in women's clothes.

Dr. Alan Hart, who pioneered the use of the x-ray in tuberculosis detection and saved thousands of lives, was one of the first to receive an hysterectomy in 1917-18. He was also one of the first to undergo sex reassignment surgeries in America (Germany had been doing such surgeries earlier). To get his hysterectomy, he used an argument by claiming a person with such "abnormal inversion" should be sterilized. Dr. Joshua Gilbert, the doctor he approached for the surgery, accepted to do so, saying Alan was "extremely intelligent and not mentally ill, but afflicted with a mysterious disorder for which I have no explanation."

My point is it wasn't as understood as it is now but they very much existed and shouldn't be forgotten or swept under the rug and neither should their struggles.
