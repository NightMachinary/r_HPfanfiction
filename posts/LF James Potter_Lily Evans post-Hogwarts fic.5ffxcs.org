Hi there. A while back I read this James/Lily and I can remember the plot and some details quite well, but not the title, and I can't seem to find it anywhere. I read it on FF.net, can't remember whether it was completed or still in-progress.

The plot is something like this: after graduating Lily went back to Cokeworth and got into a fake marriage with a childhood friend (possibly named Richard, whose very peculiar surname starts with a B), who is in love and has a secret affair with a man named Paul. The First Wizarding World is underway, but Lily plays no part in it, as she is committed to being a housewife. Her father is ill and her mother died, and Lily sometimes goes round to pay him a visit.

Padfoot shows up in a park wounded, and Lily takes him in. He eventually reveals himself as Sirius to her and at some point James Potter comes to pick up Sirius. From them onwards, James visits her whenever â€˜Richard' is at work, and their excuse is that James is either a contractor working on renovating their basement. As the war gets worse, Lily wants to be involved, so James takes her to meet Dumbledore. At this point I don't remember what happens very well, but they go to Malfoy Manor and are both injured by Death Eaters.

Thank you!
