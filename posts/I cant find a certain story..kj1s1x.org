I dont remember what its called but it was set in prisoner of Azkaban i think. It involved a group of Harrys muggle friends coming from the future with the third book. There are a few other points that stood out in the story like harrys muggle friends could control the elements, and the fact that harry is Dumbledore grandson but I dont really remember anything else.

If you could help me find it thank you!
