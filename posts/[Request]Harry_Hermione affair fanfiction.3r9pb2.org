** So uh, I don't generally read that ship but I have one rec if you don't mind smut in it. If you don't like it, don't even bother. [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025401]]

It is well written though, as all of the authors fics are.

Post-Epilogue affair. Just a few chapters, but decently written as far as I remember.

  DH spoilers. Hermione's wandering train of thought as she washes the dishes. 'Ron will kill me if he sees me cleaning without a wand. You're a witch, act like it! he'd say. He doesn't understand that I need the distraction...' HHr.

Love Lost. Love Found.

Epilogue happened, but [[/spoiler][Ron and Ginny die in Chapter 1]], so Harry and Hermione get together and struggle with telling their kids. Fluffy.

*** Different strokes for different folks, friend. We all have our own reading preferences and guilty pleasures, let's keep this a positive subreddit and not judge other people's preferences. After all, I'm sure none of us like the side eyes from people who think we're weirdos for reading fanfiction based on children's books :)

*** Possibly because the fic OP used as an example is a pretty good example of a "good" affair fic: one that avoids bashing, has realistic character development, and doesn't try to absolve Harry or Hermione for cheating on their spouses. Besides, can it really be worse than the numerous Draco/Hermione affair fics out there?
