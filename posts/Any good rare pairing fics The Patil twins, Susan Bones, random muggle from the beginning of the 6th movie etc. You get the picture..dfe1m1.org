  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** My own linkffn(12745758), which in turn was influenced by linkffn(10751741).

Harry/Lisa Turpin. I didn't go for the alt/goth themes Call Me has, but I really enjoyed that fic as a refresher from the usual "post OotP" angst fests.

For a specific story with a rarepair, there was the Toymaker's Daughter which was Snape/Tonks.
