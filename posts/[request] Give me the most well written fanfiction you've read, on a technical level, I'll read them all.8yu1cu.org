To clear myself up, I'm looking for something well written from a purely literary, technical, point of view, vocabulary, sentence structure, imagery etc. Very good writing in that way is something that I feel I miss a lot in fanfiction. Give me something that describes the world in a different way, something that doesn't feel the need to announce a change in POV because the writing is competent enough for that not to be necessary. Give me something that doesn't use the same over used terms to describe each character, something that avoids the 'bushy haired' Hermione, the 'sallow' or 'greasy' Snape or the "twinkly eyed" Dumbledore. Maybe I'm asking for too much but I want to read a well written fanfic, one where the writing is actually interesting in itself.

I'll try to give everything a read, but I retain the right to judge by summary and anything longer than around 250K, in my books, will have way too much filler, so unless it's because it's multiple books, I'll probably be avoiding it


** linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) - strong characterization, nonlinear narrative, balanced ensemble cast, impressively woven into canon, first in a lengthy series

linkffn(Yellow Submarine) - devastating dramatic arc, tasteful angst

linkffn(The Changeling) - strong characterization

linkffn(gone was any trace of you) - descriptive nonverbal communication

linkffn(Cauterize) - blurb style

linkffn(The Malfoy Case) - good plotting, nice blend of genres, good postwar worldbuilding

Edit: added descriptions, these suggestions might be too romantic overall but each excels on a technical level

Not really but kind of a spoiler?

[[/spoiler][Time is a circle. Past, present and future is set in stone and impossible to change. Shayalonnie brings everything to circle and entwines the smallest of details perfectly - in my opinion. It's full of romance, pairing Hermione with Remus and Sirius at different points. Full of smut. This fic is one of my favorites and even through 5-6 complete read throughs, I still find little details and Easter eggs that mindfuck me because of how thoroughly the fic has been written. With the exclusion of Deathly Hallows - which is even still mostly canon with minor changes - she follows through almost exactly how book 1-6 went. The smallest details end up becoming important and it really boggles me how everything comes together so well. It's such a satisfying fic in so many ways. I really feel that if you don't like it 1-2 chapters in, then you're probably not going to.]]

I don't agree that they ‘generally have a higher quality', but that basic spelling and grammar are one way in which things can /be/ higher quality. But spelling and grammar are very basic, and not enough for something to be ‘technically well written' to a high standard.

Saying a fic is the most thoroughly edited as an endorsement is like recommending dating a man because he is the most thoroughly cleaned: yes, someone who isn't clean is off-putting and you're unlikely to want to date them, but “cleaner than everyone else” seriously under-rates what the rest of the dating pool has to offer and is a sadly low bar.

Does editing mean a story is necessarily good? Not by a long shot. But it's a pretty good bet that most of the truly exceptional fics out there have undergone some degree of editing and revision on the part of the author/co-author/beta/whatever.

I agree: that's what I mean by “well-written” as well. By that standard, HPMOR is not particularly well-written: something the first account I met “discovered” a few times as part of their game. Certainly not “technically flawless” which previous conversations with this person revealed referred (in their meaning) almost entirely to spelling, grammar, and using long and rare words with their correct meanings.

******** HPMOR has always seemed, to me at least, quite well written in general, if only by the standards of other fanfiction. Its characters remained fairly consistent in their characterization, events generally occurred by way of generally rational character decisions, and the decisions were at least mostly aligned with character goals. My main problems with it was that the Harry was basically an SI with annoying characterization, the pacing was abysmal, and the author seemed keen to jerk his own cleverness off at every opportunity at the cost of any true character development outside of, bizarrely, Draco Malfoy because the author couldn't stand having a MC who wasn't a total Mary Sue.

I suppose my point here is, all of my problems with the story don't necessarily indicate any problem with the technical skill of the author (outside of the pacing problem, though I suspect that that was due more to the authors fondness for side stories only passingly relevant to the main plot than anything else). And even the problems that do exist with the story are tiny compared to those I've seen in other, similarly popular stories. You're right, the story is so far from flawless its not even funny. but, in proportion to the hate it gets, it's better than 90% of the shit out there.

I'm not in on whatever history you and play_the_puck have, so I'll stay out of any argument on that front. If their definition of editing is limited to stuff like spelling and grammar, then yeah, I agree with you 100%. slapping a coat of paint on a pt cruiser doesn't make it a Bentley: it just makes it a slightly less shitty looking pt cruiser.

PS do you have any fic recommendations that do meet with your standard of writing? I'd be interested to hear them.

Also i am confused as to why you claim he has no character development when I find that its one of the few that /does/ show changes in all the characters as the events of the story take place.

I mean, after you said ‘see for yourself' about other threads, I clicked through and I'm pretty sure I spotted another of your alts that you didn't properly separate (I was partly clued in because it reminded me of the username I first saw you under, which I had forgotten until now). Dr Who? And taking a comment on that account along with that other username I remembered, I possibly know your actual first name. You might want to go through and sanitise.

This is my fic. In 2017, it won the largest international writing competition in the category of "Riveting Reads". It's a full-length novel in the style of JKR. Good formatting and copy editing, almost 500k reads, keeps in line with book canon unless necessary for the plot (which is not often).

"Preceded by rumors of their prophetic birth, pure-blood twins, Fred and George Weasley, follow in the footsteps of their three older brothers by attending a school for witchcraft and wizardry. All should be well...but from the moment they enter Hogwarts Castle, the identical boys are met with high expectations, troublesome situations, a mystery fifty years in the making, and their ever-imminent expulsion. Aided by two classmates and using their newfound aptitude toward mischief-making, the twins are compelled to resolve the mystery in order to avoid being ejected from the school and excluded from practicing magic for the rest of their lives."

I'll admit that I'm new to the fanfic scene. I'm super old school and wrote all 7 Fred and George books just for my wife. Had them printed and bound, etc. I never let anyone else read them until recently and Wattpad has been an enjoyable experience (at least on my end). You should give it another chance! I mean, book one did win an award lol. I've got a bunch of Potter related material on my profile, actually.

** If you want technically brilliant writing, then "Hogwarts Houses Divided" by Inverarity is definitely one of the best fics I can recommend. It's about Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts, and it's pretty OC-heavy, but it's so incredibly well-written that it almost feels like it could have been canon. linkffn(3979062)

Anything by Northumbrian is well-written, though I'll say my fave stories of his are "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" and "James and Me." They're also very OC-heavy... in fact both those stories are written from the POV of Muggle OCs who unknowingly come into contact with the wizarding world. The main character of "Strangers" is a Muggle housewife who befriends the eccentric new neighbours, the Potters... and "James and Me" takes place almost two decades later, and stars her daughter who's all grown up, at college and suddenly meeting up with her old childhood friend, James Sirius Potter. linkffn( 6331126; 8465313)

If you don't mind a TOTAL AU, then I can't recommend "Reign of the Serpent" enough. It depicts a world where Salazar Slytherin took over the wizarding world, and now rules over magical Britain like an immortal emperor. The story follows a lot of characters, but Hermione (thrown into a much more savage and war-like wizarding world) is definitely the main character. linkffn(9783012)

And finally. if you want something closer to canon, then the "Weasley Girl" series by Hyaroo does a good job of capturing the tone and feel of the early canon books, while going its own way. Premise is that Ron was born a girl instead of a boy, and this leads to a different Weasley dynamic and the plot goes in a different direction. linkao3(3721921)
