** linkffn(A Black Comedy) fits the bill. You've probably already read it given how often it gets rec'd here though. Some of nonjon's other works, namely linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter?) and sequels also fit, iirc.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]/ (W: 194,707; Complete) also displays an oversexed Harry. Here, however, he's a dark magic addict that usually succeeds in finding sexual partners not by charm and seduction but by overpowering them through magical compulsion.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is one of the best in this area. Harry doesn't get around quite as much as in A Black Comedy, but he is supremely confident, charming, suave, and a bit reckless.

And he gets the babe at the end.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
