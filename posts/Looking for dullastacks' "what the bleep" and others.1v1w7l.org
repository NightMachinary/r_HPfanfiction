I have recently re-read some fanfics and several of them recommended either dulkastacks in general or what the bleep? in particular. After some searching via Google I could sadly only find some dead links and further mentions of how good the stories were. Therefore I am now hoping to find someone here who may have saved a copy of those fics before they were taken down.


** dullastacks got published! or was in talks about getting published, then she took the stories down. she actually posted an update last year saying her books will be turned into a movie! [something along those lines]. i have copies of her stories, pm me.

*** I read that announcement, but I wonder why that means she (they?) need to take down the mostly anonymous fanfics. Probably lawyers avoiding the possibility of other lawyers lawyering her out of her new writing job, but its still nice to see people get some recognition in the field they obviously love.
