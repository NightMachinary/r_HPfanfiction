** "Of all the wands in the vast arsenal of Gregorovitch, nothing was more profitable Voyennaya Palka model of 1947. More commonly known as the VP-47, or Palka. It's the world's most popular war wand. A wand all hit-wizards love. An elegantly simple 12 inch amalgamation of ebony wood and dragon heartstrings. It doesn't break or misfire. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do."

*** The impression I got from the books is that Wand makers are very secretive about their craft. I doubt Olivander is registering wands, but in OotP, Ministry visitors have their wand contents recorded on a piece of paper. So the Ministry keeps some record of wands, it seems.

**** Agree with the secrecy of wand makers, hence Olivander getting kidnapped and Gregorovitch being killed.

Since wands are so integral to the lives of wizards and witches, tracking the wand seems like it would be a really big deal in terms of controlling/tracking the population. The tracking could function similarly to how mobile phone data is monitored.

Lastly, I've read several fics where Harry or Sirius go to Knockturn Alley to obtain a wand that can't be traced. It always proves critical in giving them more freedom.

** Can you bond with more than one wand at once? I know you can do so sequentially, but I don't know if a person could actively get two wands they could use well at the same time.

*** Yep: in Deathly Hallows, Harry is the “master” of Draco's wand and the Elder Wand at the same time - and possibly his original wand, if the pieces count

**** IIRC, the Elder Wand is noted for being disloyal - I'm not entirely sure I'd count that as a bond. It's also supposedly a special case above other wands (not counting the Myth, just the functioning of the wand), so I'm not certain how it'd apply to regular wands if it did count as a bond. Good point though - my doubt aside, I had forgotten about that.

Whether the pieces count is an interesting question though - Hagrid could technically still cast through a broken wand with his umbrella, right? It'd be interesting to know if a wand 'died' when it got broken or just became technically unusable without some retooling. Like removing all the buttons and controls from a machine.

Important answers for this though - if the Elder Wand doesn't count and the pieces don't either, then Harry still only has one wand-bond - Draco's.

***** The elder wand is actually considered extremely loyal - most people thought you had to kill its owner to truly gain its loyalty. The thing is, this isn't true - you just have to defeat its owner. At the end of the day, it's just another wand - a very powerful one, but just a wand.

*** From canon it's never explicity said but, everything points to yes, you can have multiple allienances at the same time. However I don't know if the're things like a "percentage" of compatibility of something like that. do remember a pasage saying the gang having progress with their stolen wands, but not quite yet like their original ones
