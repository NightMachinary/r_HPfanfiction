Preferably a Harry who is studious enough to get the riddle on his own.


** Harry is a Dragon, and That's OK linkffn(13230340)

Harry gets lost and finds a library (Ravenclaw common room). He falls asleep reading and no one bothers him because, well, he's a sleeping dragon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
