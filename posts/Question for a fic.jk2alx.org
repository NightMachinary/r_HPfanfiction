writing a story, and am trying to figure out, how did muggle parents send their kids mail at hogwarts? did they have to wait for a letter from their kid? or did the post office sort it out?


** Im pretty certain I remember reading that sending a regular letter through the post, only addressed to Hogwarts, is intercepted by ministry workers at the post office and sent on through the normal owl method after collection.

This may have been a fanfic idea. But I've seen it so often I lost track of canon VS head-canon.

A different idea could be that muggleborns are further encouraged to purchase a personal owl lest they be subjected to the slow delivery times sorting them out from the muggle post requires.

Edit: Also Hogwarts owls are free and numerous. Owls also understand the request to wait for a reply. This, I think, is the actual cannon method. As how else do muggleborns reply to their first Hogwarts letter?

*** I think Aunt Petunia did this when she was little and asking to go to Hogwarts. So I'm pretty sure it's canon.

** I think there are two really good options:

1. as [[/u/woodsiestmamabear][u/woodsiestmamabear]] said having the ministy worker intercept letter addressed to hogwarts
2. I think it could be an interesting take if it was explained to muggle families how the post system works that way they could send letters with owls as well

   1. as for how to get the owls: the best option, in my opinion is that the kid either has an owl or uses hogwarts owls to send letters and the parents can respond with the same owl, or you could have a system set up where muggle families can get a ministry owl to send letters when they need to

sorry if this is useless :)

** I would guess that there are procedures in place because diplomacy is conducted between magical and nonmajiques governments.

** In Arithmancer it looks to me like Hermione sometimes gets stuff by owl from her parents. What happens at the other end isn't clear. It sounds like her parents either get to keep an owl at home, or have a way to summon one when they want to send something.
