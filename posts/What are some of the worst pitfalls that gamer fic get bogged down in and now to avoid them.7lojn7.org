At first this post was mainly about small fixs that could be made to gamer storys to stop them from getting bogged down in things like to many skills which could easily be fixed by giveing the Gamer the ability to merge skills and perks that do a simallr things into a higher tier skill/perk.

But really that doesn't get at the core of the pitfall that almost all gamer fics fall into which is focuseing on the gamer ability itself to much. When the story's should really be about showing how the Gamer ability has changed Harry and his Time at hogwarts.

What are some of the other pitfalls large and small that gamer fics fall into and how would you go about avoiding/fixing them in current and future storys?


** - Getting bogged down in stats, abilities, numbers, etc. If half your word count is a character sheet, you have a problem.

- Spending too much time on "grinding", that is to say slaying non-important monsters for XP, without advancing the plot.

It's not just Gamer fics which have these problems, but also the original manhwa itself. The endless grinding and detailed mentions of protagonist's skill-ups bored me to tears, whereas him fighting real enemies is actually interesting.

That's just my opinion though - some readers seem to /like/ these things.

*** I love grinding, but only if it's in creatively described and unique instances, with circumstances that differ from instance to instance, and with some measure of real danger.

I suppose the only thing that still defines this as "grinding" is that it is happening outside of the main plot to raise stats and loot gear, but other than that it's fine.

I would probably love grinding as a way to advance character bonding and exploration even more.

*** Some fics do the grinding well, and so it becomes interesting. Yes, after reaching a certain level/skill amount, the grinding should be shown less.

** Biggest thing?

"The Gamer" is not a plot. It's a worldbuilding mechanic. It can be used to drive the plot, it can even be a red herring unrelated to the plot. But it is *not* the plot.

Think of the most awful, most overused tropes you can, and I can guarantee that you can find great stories that heavily use them. Think of the most unique and interesting tropes you can, and I can guarantee you can find god awful stories that use them.

So if your entire story is just "lol, harry's a Gamer," then it'll be an awful story /because it's not a story./ And, unfortunately, nearly all Gamer fics (regardless of what world they're set in) fall into this pitfall.

Related to this is basically getting the main character to max level before the "story" even starts. It's all and good to start off Harry as a baby/small child with Gamer powers, but if he's a literal god by the time he turns 11, what's the point? Where's the story? What's the plot?

Another pitfall of Gamer fics I often see (that's still related to all this 'plot' and 'story elements' nonsense) is that they don't do their homework and define the limits, drawbacks, and balance points of their Gamer system. The best of the Gamer fics I've read basically just copy the mechanics of other, preexisting systems. It doesn't really matter if it's a dice-based system like D&D, or a usage-based progression like Skyrim, or an XP-based perk system like Fallout 4, as long as it's relatively consistent and, above all, balanced and limited then you can use it as the framework for something other than a superman fic where he flies around all day stopping muggers. Even at max level, The Gamer shouldn't be perfect at everything.

** Don't waste any time grinding. If a fight is no challenge for the character, don't describe it. Don't fixate on mechanics. If it doesn't affect the plot, don't focus on it. Reading about a level up is boring. Keep the stat sheet in your planning/notes, not in the story.

*** I feel like the stat sheet can be used creatively, if the character looks at it from time to time to self-reflect.

Looking at it, and finding out your stamina is low or you suddenly notice your charisma is at -2.

But again, that's story and not mechanics, so your point still stands.

***** I feel like the constant updating of skills and stats mid chapter is worse than showing a stat sheet at they bottom of the chapter in an ideal world I would rather they show it in the writing and then show stats sheet at the bottom of the Chapter.

Like if Harry gets a Potions skill instead of having constant Write that Harry potion skill has level up show use by compare the Potion to the other students in Class around him by having hims complete the potion faster than other student or have his potion be a better quality.

instead most story's just have

*your skill has level up*

*Potions making lvl-4 (10%)*

or something to that effect

** I just want a different exp or skill system for once. My favorite gamer fics are different from the norm. And most of all, I want to get away from /Harry thinks of something vaguely smart +1 INT. Harry comes up with a plan to grind. +1 WIS./ I'd love it if there was a gamer fic with a Skyrim like skill system, or a Fallout one, or anything but the boring old JRPG system.

*** linkffn(12711543)

Is supposedly going to utilize a skill grid system a la FF10/FF12. Still pre-implementation though, and author has gone off grid for a bit.

To answer the OP: Plot out the story before you write it. Nearly 100% of gamer fics are abandoned by Hogwarts Year One because the author loses interest in the munchkinry, or they just get bored with it. It's all well and good to implement the idea, it's just that in my experience so far NO ONE has finished it.

If you want supergrindy Harry who has massive stats before Hogwarts, what will you do to make his school years a challenge? If you make him develop gamer's mind while at school, how would that change the canon plot?

In other words, think through how much the mechanic will BY NECESSITY alter the plot before you start writing, or it will fizzle like every other Gamer fic out there. Simple example: Canon Harry somewhat struggled with(read: was not a prodigy) his first year, academically, mostly due to him being a kid. Would Harry, whose INT stat rivals McGonagall, or Dumbledore, struggle with tasks designed for 11 year olds? If he powerlevels his magic, how will Quirrellmort respond?

Edit: for one more thought

**** If i were to write a gamer fic myself I would go with the Danmachi Levelling system and first thing i would would be to work our when harry's Level ups would be for example:

First year: beating the Troll and saving the Stone

second year: Killing the basilisk

third year : when he drives away all the dementors

four year : one of the first two task and The escape from the gave yard

Fifth year: no Lvl up

Sixith year Level up at the end of the year

so byt the time that harrys reaches the graveyard in fourth year he is Level 6 that would probable change a lot as the story went forward especially the later years but that's the basics which means I can assign average lvls to other characters

lvl1: 99% of muggles never move past lvl one

Lvl2: the majority of wizards

Lvl3: the average auror, and Death eater

Lvl4: people like Moody,Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jr and Dolohov

Lvl5: Dumbledore before his Duel with Grindelwald

Lvl6: Dumbledore after His duel with Grindelwald

Lvl7: Grindelwald with the Elder wand

Lvl8: lord Voldemort and Dumbledore with the elder wand

Lvl9: Voldemort using the wand when he is not its master

I made Wielding the Elder Wand the Equivalent of Two Extra levels when wielded by its master

but there is a lot more to a gamer story than levels which is why i have not written one. As soon as I Get to trying to plan out perks and How different the story would be After the End of fourth year i get overwhelmed.

** Obviously Hitpoint based combat. If your combat system boils down to "spell X does Y dmg" the writing ends up being atrocious. If you can die from ten piercing hexes through your toenail then I would seriously consider a different concept. Or alternatively, surviving a magical laserbeam piercing your head is just as bad.

HP tanking or armour/MR stacking may work in games but it makes a bad reading flow. Most, if not all book adaptions of video games forgo the concept for that reason. Hell, 99% of all gaming fanfiction replaces hitpoints, stamina, mana values and cooldowns with the limitations of the real world. I have not read a single Mass Effect fanfiction which includes anything but cooldowns, which are explained with limitations to Omnitools or biotic amps.

If you want to include hitpoints the most elegant solution is hiding the values. You can see that in games like War Thunder where damage calculation is done with damage values, armour and module hitpoints but you don't know yours or the ones of your enemy unless they reach 0 and something stops working/blows up.

*** HP I have never seen make sense through a fic,

Someone was bleeding out in one at -1 HP/sec and Harry had some chocolate fudge in his inventory that he earlier learned was +100HP and in the beginning he described making a shittona pancakes that had some decent healing.

Okay, the fudge and pancakes bought you enough time to make it to Pomphrey...

** As others already mentioned, the biggest pitfalls are the stats sheet, and grinding. For some reason, people who write Gamer fics feel that readers will keep in mind the amount of damage reduction the "Early Defensive Skill of Protection" will give them, or the +1 in HP and they would copy paste the stats again. Stat sheets should not appear more than twice in a 10,000 word chapter, and even that is pushing it. The people who write 20 words of actual content while the rest of the chapter consists of their wank sheet are those lacking in imagination to think of something that would let the plot run.

Why tell the amount of stamina the character has when you could show he's tired?

Thr grinding is the same as the stats sheet, especially since they go hand in hand. The author needs to write training sessions fun for the readers to read. People don't to read about him chpping trees in the forest to improve whatever stats he needs. Focus on the plot. If the only purpose is to showcase the character, then what's the point?

Authors should write a story that uses Gamer mechanics, not the other way around.
