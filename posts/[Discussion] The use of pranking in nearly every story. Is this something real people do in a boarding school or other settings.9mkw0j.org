I don't think I'm an entirely boring person. I was a well received amateur stand-up comic for a couple of years. I like a good joke, and I'm a fan of puns. I've never spent time with pranksters though. I didn't realize, until HP, that this was something people do more than a few times in their lives, like the Senior Prank in HS, or on April Fools Day. Is this something Rowling took the opportunity to use as a way to describe various magical effects, or do people really act like this in the real world outside of my immediate surroundings? Does it bother anyone how often pranking is brought up whenever The Marauders or the Weasely twins are around? Is it a cultural thing in the UK? I'm just curious.


** I have two theories:

1. I think when you don't have TV, movies, internet, video games, etc., kids come up with creative ways to entertain themselves. And I think that's where pranking comes in.

Or...

1. It could also just be a narrative device. It's the most entertaining way for readers to watch kids entertain themselves in a way that moves the plot and character development forward.

EDIT: OK, I've thought about this a little more, and I'm remembering now that the boys I grew up with did come up with a fair amount of pranks. Most of them just weren't very memorable. I remember the ones that went badly the most vividly --- like when they started to shove a Port-A-Potty after our camp counselor went inside, so that it seemed like it was almost going to tip over. They got sent home after that ðŸ˜¬

So, dumb kids doing dumb pranks is definitely a thing.

I also know that the author John Green has talked about the pranks that his friends pulled at his U.S. boarding school.

EDIT2: I'm doing a really terrible, neurotic job answering your question, lol. I also just remembered a story my friend told me about, when she was in high school, that she and her friends would constantly prank the administrators. They broke into one person's office and replaced a ton of the stuff in her room with penguin figurines. She told me the administrator got her back her senior year by giving her an envelope that contained a very real-looking letter from the college she'd applied to, which said her acceptance had been rescinded. She said she was sobbing in the hall for like an hour, until she saw that the letter had CC'd the Society of Penguins at the bottom.

My friend told this story to a large-ish group of people. She was laughing, but we all looked completely horrified, lol

** So this is just anecdotal evidence, but my father attended a boarding school in the UK when he was a child and has many, many stories of pranks that he or other students carried out.

Interestingly the majority of his stories is the students attempting to prank the teachers and not each other.

There was more of a comradery between the students (although they weren't separated into four distinct houses based upon personality traits they exhibited as an eleven year old which, incidentally, is a terrible idea and sure-fire way to stunt the emotional growth of the students.

** Pranking in the sense of elaborate, highly organised events like you see in fanfic? No.

Pranking in the sense of spontaneous, opportunistic practical jokes? Yes. Mostly it's some form of violence disguised as a game :)

*** Thank you. I feel as though I'm not as sheltered as I was thinking I might be. My sister and I (both adults with adult-ish children) are planning a prank for Christmas this year, but it's not something we do often, maybe gag-gifts, but this is our elaborate scheme:

We have a White Elephant exchange at my father's. It started because my father, my step-mother, and my aunt are all teachers and (sorry to disappoint you kids) they often recycle the presents they get from well-meaning kids that aren't "World's Best Teacher" mugs. My aunt however has slowly built it up to include entire Bath and Bodyworks sets, booze, and other pretty expensive items so that the rest of us feel like cheap bastards. Now, my ex moved out a few years ago, but he left 90% of his crap in my apt. His mother is the Queen of Garage Sales and Thrift Stores. I have small plastic bulldogs, ceramic pig heads, a sculpted wooden eagle, a crap ton of cheap novelty stuff, you have no idea how much schlock this woman felt was absolutely necessary to stuff into my apt. So we're going to collect a couple of crates of it, wrap it all, and make sure that my aunt is required to take home about 25 items of the garage sale reject variety, because the one rule is you don't open the stuff from your family section's donation pile. Aren't we crazy?!

** Pranking really only happens when you're in an enclosed area with nothing else to do, with other people, and you don't have transportation to leave.

And its mostly dudes.

If we have to be bored out of our minds we're going to find someway to entertain ourselves. Most of the time its more of a Nodding of the head, coming to terms, then swearing vengeance and getting them back. So, all in good fun.

Most guys know theres certain lines can't be crossed or they get punched in the face. Which is tend to be why most girls view pranking aa bullying, becauase around other girls theres no social heriarchy that can be maintained or overturned by simply punching the other girl in the face or stomping her out, which is why most of the "pranks" tend to be maliciuis in nature (Because theres no potential consequence). The physchology of the acts is different.

Why is why you tend to run into "Fred and George are bullies" interpretation sometimes

***** The school bitch, Chris(tine), was banned from Prom because when Carrie had her first period in the gym locker room and was scared that she was dying, Chris and her friends were taunting her and throwing tampons at her and then Chris skipped out on the detention she was given for it. One of the "nice girls", Sue, asked her boyfriend to take Carrie to Prom because she felt bad for her. This pissed Chris off more since Carrie would be going and she couldn't. So, a night or two before the dance, Chris and her boyfriend and crew went on her command to a pig farm to slaughter pigs for their blood. Then Chris had her friend rig the vote for Carrie to be Prom Queen. They balanced the bucket of blood over the stage and waited until she was crowned, then they dumped it over her and started laughing and mocking her until she lost it. Chris was the orchestrator behind everything.

** I think it does happen in very closed environments. I went to public school, where you spent most of your time outside of school, relatively speaking (even if most of your waking hours were in school). Most of the mischief at my schools involved skipping classes, sneaking off campus for lunch, or similar. Why pull a prank when you can skip class and go see a movie? On a closed campus like at a boarding school, where every aspect of your life is subject to (potentially draconian) school rules, I can see people pulling pranks as a way to let off steam.

*** Thank you for your answer. It looks like the others seem to agree on the closed environment thing. I was in a rural HS where a bunch of small towns sent their kids together. The 'bad' things we did included sneaking off to the dock with the janitor and/or some of the teachers for a smoke (you didn't get in trouble if you bummed them smokes) or, as you mentioned, just skipping school.

Edit: the part about supplying the teachers with cigs.

After that, it's perfectly justified to simply ignore that kind of stuff.

** Not so much â€˜pranks all year round' but I went to a private (not boarding) school in Australia and the graduating year had muck up day until the second youngest Nangle boy crash tackled his cousin in my year and got it banned. I distinctly remember lines of â€˜cocaine' (flour) spread around the school, desks and chairs stacked and zip-tied together to block off an entire hallway, forcing people to walk all the way around the building to get through, and kids running around with water guns. Also, a staff member (not a teacher) once got kidnapped, gator-taped to the top of a lamp post (yeah, our school had lamp posts) and held ransom for money to go to charity. Other than that, we'd disappear on teachers, hide the whiteboard eraser, draw dicks on the board and just generally be shits.

** I was about to write and say I didn't find it all that common either but then I sat down and really thought about it and actually, yes, we did a lot of it. While I didn't go to boarding school, we sure as hell pranked our most irritating teachers. I'm not a big one myself, but I appreciate the amusement nonetheless.

Highlights include:

- once all looking at one spot and when she looked at it, choosing another.

- one teacher liked to blow a whistle, have you stand and answer his questions. it's a lot funnier if someone begins doing the sound of music. he is forever known as captain von trapp now.

- moving the entire furniture in the classroom backwards then waiting for the teacher to come in sitting quietly

- letting loose one of those ferrets on balls you get for toys and then all jumping and screaming like a tom and jerry cartoon.

- creating an evil fairy ('miss tilly') who would leave calling cards when stuff was moved

- all the printers were on the same network so if someone in classroom 2 printed 'HELP ME' or a variety of other things it could come out anywhere across the two buildings or sixth form.

- we had two sets of twins. you can imagine.

There was also a variety of student on student pranks such as overloading the toilets with washing up liquid, several food fights (I will never look at tuna again after getting pelted with it), wanted posters, waiting with water pistols full of orangeade (this backfired when the deputy head came round the corner) and being a 90% white british area, having students called Jesus and Midas on the student council in Sixth Form meant people loved to leave jokes like spray painting things gold or leaving Jesus puns on the white board.

There was also one day a year, usually the last day of term before Christmas or summer holidays, teachers would do things and wouldn't say anything. For example, our male science teacher showing up in a blonde wig, white dress with two balloons in his shirt and not commenting on it even when a balloon burst or when our head of year was supposedly late for assembly and rode in on a motorbike dressed as Trinity from the Matrix and just got on with reading the announcements.

** My school didn't have much pranking. More traditional bullying which was terrible. An example would be getting ripped out of bed at 3am to be thrown into the shower. One would have to strip naked and sing a song while the older students showered the younger with ice-cold water. Luckily, my roommate and I locked ourselves in the bathroom the moment we heard the door open.

*** Yikes! Glad you found a way to at least avoid some of that. When my kiddo was in HS the bullies did shit like shove people down the stairs, destroy their clothes in gym and throw them away, and throw food at kids at lunch. One 13 year old had her head put through a window because she was pregnant which meant she was a slut in the bullies' minds and that made it okay to them. I don't really know which would be worse. The bullies never really got in trouble at her HS, I'm assuming as it seems like something that happened often that they didn't where you went either.

***** It seems that might be a difference in what people would get away with in day school vs a boarding school perhaps? Hopefully things don't escalate to that degree anywhere else, but perhaps boarding with people and knowing you were going to be around them all of the time as well as more adult supervision (I assume?) rather than being able to just go home or bolt from school after doing whatever raised the level of atrocity in their behaviour.

** It depends. I remember there being quite a few pranks when I was in elementary and middle school, though relatively few comparatively in high school.

I grew up in the days where you didn't usually get a cell phone until 8th grade at the earliest unless you were one of the spoiled rich kids. So we had to entertain ourselves in between classes somehow.

In elementary school, I remember the pranks mainly being spitballs, jump scares, licking your finger and putting it on someone's neck, writing swear words on desks (mostly 'ass' lol), etc.

In middle school there were more pranks on the teachers and staff, like moving their stuff around on their desk, making farting noises when that one absurdly fat lunch monitor lady walked by, and plenty more pranks on each other like farting on someone's pencil or backpack, pantsing, twisting ketchup and mustard packets so that they would burst when someone stepped on them or sat on them, rearranging furniture, drawing mustaches and anime hairdos on every portrait or picture hanging on the walls, etc.

High school pranks usually involved messing with someone's powerpoint presentation or speech, printing out gross pictures or dirty jokes and taping them to the walls (usually the restroom), writing the names of hot girls on the restroom stalls, drawing dicks on things, etc. By that time most of us had cell phones (though almost no one had a smartphone until college iirc), so we looked at the early memes, stupid youtube videos like Powerthirst and the early fanmade Lego Star Wars videos, and paparazzi pictures of whatever celebrity was popular at the time looking for nipple slips or whatever.
