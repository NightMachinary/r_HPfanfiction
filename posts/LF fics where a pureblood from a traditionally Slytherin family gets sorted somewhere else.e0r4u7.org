Exactly what it says in the title, except they get placed in preferably Gryffindor. Being placed in Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw fics are also good, OCs are acceptable, no weird pairings, could be any era (Potter-era, Marauder-era) but that is all.

Thanks guys!


** A lot of fics set in the Marauder era have a traditional Pureblood kid end up in Gryffindor and become friends with James and part of his Marauders gang. His family doesn't take his sorting well and ultimately he runs away from it.

** Draco in whydoyouneedtoknow's dangerverse series is sorted into slytherin iirc, but his mother is out of the picture and his father in jail so it's not quite the same as most. But there's still a decent chunk of plot featuring him and his father so it's still somewhat relevant.

*** I wouldn't mind either if he turns into a blood traitor eventually too, in canon we see Light wizards turning Dark for various reasons (Pettigrew, Quirrel etc.), but the reverse isn't too represented aside from Sirius Black. Just interested to know more about potential dynamics of becoming a blood traitor rather than being born one. Does Malfoy turn blood traitor?

**** *SPOILERS*

It's a Harry is found and raised by Remus type story. At one point Harry is abducted by the Lucius. In the process of rescuing Harry, Remus makes a deal with Narcissa that involves him raising Draco (who is maybe 5ish?) as a normal healthy child. So Draco isn't old enough to really have his own prejudices at that point and is more or less raised entirely blood traitor and never has a moment of "turning blood traitor." However, Narcissa confesses that she and Lucius were Voldemort supporters and she and Lucius go to Azkaban, then Narcissa commits suicide. Lucius stays in Azkaban for a large portion of the story but breaks out around the halfway point, and there's a running plot thread involving him trying to "turn Draco back to the dark side" until pretty close to the end of the story. (The whole series is over a million words so if it feels a little disjointed that's probably why. It's actually executed very well imo.)

But, if that's too far left, there is a story by the same author, where in 6/7th year at the height of his personal suffering Draco starts dreaming of a 'parallel universe' where many things are different (tom riddle was never evil, for one), and slowly becomes more and more connected to it, with the assumed eventual result of turning full blood traitor.

  "If you're thinking that I'm not going to put you in Slytherin, then you're quite right," sniffed the Hat, sounding somewhat vindictively gleeful. "The house which actually suits you best is---HUFFLEPUFF!"
