For the sake of argument, let's say that splitting one's soul into multiple fragments and storing them across the country is a terrible idea, and it resulted in Voldemort being reduced to little more than a mindless grumpy smoggy cloud. Let's also presume that each individual horcrux (along with the almost-but-not-quite one in Harry's scar) funcion as they do in canon, so there's still the potential for a 16 year old Tom Riddle to come back should the diary come into the posession of someone who would use it like it was just an ordinary book.


** Umbridge, Fudge, Lucius Malfoy, and their ilk. Young Harry comes into the Wizarding World looking for acceptance and adventure, and finds out that the real enemies are the same no matter where you go: petty viciousness, self-aggrandizing bureaucracy, and political corruption.

** Well books 1-3 show us that other than Voldemort Harry really doesn't have many confrontations. He doesn't share Hermione's views on house elf welfare and while he doesn't condone magical racism he doesn't really get to fighting it before Voldemort is introduced as its figurehead.

I'd say if we remove Voldemort, Harry would have an antagonistic relationship with Draco for sure, but probably not with the Ministry (since he doesn't really contradict anything the ministry does before the war begins, and there is no reason to think he would publically set himself against the status quo until he is much older) . The book itself would probably shift to drama about being famous for something you wished had never happened, and striving to become your own person.

If we went into Harry's adulthood he probably wouldn't be an Auror, but would he be a social revolutionary or a quidditch star? Who can tell?

On the subject of the horcruxes lying around: Generally this can be as good as you make it or as bad as you make it. It will more or less negate the idea of your prompt though since horcruxes are a lot like the one ring, they affect you and attempt to restore Voldemort to life. You can use them as a cheap angst generator to make Dumbledore extra worried but at this point you just have a HP rewrite on your hands with no first year.

**** I got the sense that the reason Barty took soooo long to get Harry to Voldemort for that whole ritual thing, is Barty wanted to assess Harry for himself and get an idea whether Harry might be a suitable replacement Dark Lord.

Some death eaters thought maybe Voldemort's prophesied rival was going to be another Dark Lord and try to usurp him. If that was the case it would explain why Barty helped Harry in the tournament and also tested him with the Imperius curse to see how well Harry could resist it. It would also explain why he entered Harry in the tournament to begin with, because what better way to assess someone's abilities than the Triwizard Tournament?

Ultimately he seems to have realized Harry was too good and pure hearted to take up their cause and sent him to Voldemort as a sacrifice.

** What would be interesting is if the wizarding world did a full 180. With Grindelwald the saying was magic is might, it was more about wizards versus muggles. Which led to Voldemort who was pure blood or pure blood versus everyone else.It would be interesting to see a Muggleborn terrorist group.

After Voldemort the pureblood essentially you go into hiding or try to hide their supremacy and a bunch of laws that are pro muggleborn get passed which leads to tension and because of the war that they just came out of being seen as too pure blood isn't politically correct. Pureblood start wearing muggle clothes is buying random muggle things to blend in and show that they are being politically correct.

So first and second generation wizards try to rip up the establishment. Someone like Tonks who may try and hide her pure blood mother ancestry could be a cool antagonist.

*** I read once something like this but it was post-war. Muggleborns are frustrated with the Ministry for taking so long to try the Death Eaters and many still get away on technicalities or by lying/bribing/selling other people. Dennis Creevey is particularly offended when Harry doesn't even show up at Colin Creevey's funeral because he is busy attending Fred's and starts believing that even if Voldemort's gone, Muggleborns will always be treated like second-rate citizens. He starts rallying the angry Muggleborns around him and they begin attacking all Purebloods, including those that had been good guys during the war such as the Weasleys, Andromeda and Kingsley.

And Dennis, who was mostly unaware of Harry's social circle (I believe that that particular point is even touched... I think Colin even lied to his family or was deluded about what good friends he was with Harry), felt that Harry chose Fred over Colin because Fred came from a pureblood family.

*** One of the many, /many/ plot threads in Prince of Slytherin is a Muggleborn /Darklord/ whose actions actually drove the Ministry into more Pro Pureblood shit. Like with most of the ideas in that fic, it's a decent one that deserves to be explored all on it's own, but is completely lost in the overflowing melting pot of ideas that is that fic.

**** I'm of the opinion that Dumbledore was either malicious/had other intentions, or he was just plain incompetent. From the very beginning, when he was tasked with protecting the stone, for example, he made a set of â€˜protections' more like an obstacle course than anything else that some eleven year olds solved with not much trouble. I mean, maybe some of it was the other teachers, what with the animated chess set that Ron could solve or the fire barrier that had its clue right there with a little riddle that hermione (and me as a 12 year old!) could solve. I mean, why not just leave the barrier as it is without any potions or riddle to the correct one? But Dumbledore was still overseeing the whole thing (and was also in charge of doors, which could be opened with a first year spell?), and just a bit of forethought would've protected the stone much better. Makes me think the whole thing was staged to trap Voldemort/see how Harry and his protections work against him. Then second year when he couldn't figure out what the monster was when a smart 12 year old could! he had all the same clues they did, except maybe Harry's parseltongue but that was easy enough to guess with /slytherin's/ monster (ofc it's a snake, what else?). It's just a lot of things like that, where children handled the situations just fine, if a little badly, and he didn't do much. And between believing if such a famous and powerful figure is incompetent or had other intentions, I like the latter.

***** Our knowledge of Dumbledore's motives is inherently limited by Harry's perspective, so we can only speculate and offer indirect evidence. In this particular case, you claim that the relative ease with which the trio got through the obstacles is evidence that Dumbledore had intended for them to. But, you have to look at other explanations as well.

For example, an alternative explanation is that the obstacles were there to "keep honest people honest", and the only real trap in there was the Mirror of Erised, something that used Voldemort's (or his agent's) very intentions against him, since any such agent would want the Stone to be used.

Or, Slytherin's monster: remember that no one except for Myrtle actually died. Is it even common knowledge that a basilisk's gaze can petrify under some circumstances rather than kill, or is it something that Hermione figured out from the totality of evidence---including something that Dumbledore could not have known, which was that the creature spoke Parseltongue?

You can question Dumbledore's competence (though I prefer to interpret it as there having been circumstances of which Harry was not aware), but Dumbledore never forced Harry into confrontation with Voldemort.

***** I don't think Dumbledore was trying to prevent Quirrel or Voldemort from reaching the final part of the obstacle course. The stone was there as bait set up in a way that they could corner whoever was trying to steal it. He was likely hoping to lure in and capture Voldemort's wraith.

Remember that the stone was still trapped in the Mirror of Erised at the end of the course, and there's no possible way anyone intending to use it could have gotten it out.

Over Christmas break, Dumbledore literally removed the mirror from the 3rd floor, stuck it in an unused classroom, then disillusioned himself and sat all night waiting for someone to walk in and mess with it. I'm 99% certain he was waiting for Quirrel or Voldie to show up, not Harry.

I second Dumbledore as a semi-antagonist. He meant well, but he really messed up Harry's life. Voldemort killed his parents, but Dumbledore killed his childhood. I can find only 2 explanations for Dumbledore's actions and inactions: He's either evil and manipulative, or massively incompetent. Either is bad news for Harry.

The dual-antagonists of the series are effectively Voldemort and Malfoy. If Voldemort is gone forever, or at least effectively neutralized as a threat, then the primary antagonist would be Malfoy and his circle of ex-Death Eaters, without a doubt.

** I'd say diary Tom, and this would fit with the prophecy.

It says Voldemort would mark the kid as his equal. So, teenage diary Tom being restored to a corporeal form could be considered fulfilling the prophecy. He's more Harry's equal than a 70-ish year old undead-ish creep with a sliver of a soul. Diary-Tom already is annoyed by/dislikes Harry for defeating his older self as a toddler by the time they meet.

In canon JK couldn't do that the way she set it up, because it would have meant Ginny's death. But a fanfiction writer could probably come up with something good and feasible. Or just kill Ginny off, and give Harry even more reason to go after him.
