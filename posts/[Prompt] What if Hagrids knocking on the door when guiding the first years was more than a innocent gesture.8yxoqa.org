Such as his role as "keeper of the keys" allows him to disable the active defenses preventing unkeyed or unknown people in. This would go along with the sorting hat adding people to Hogwarts wards.

Another idea going along with the one above is that someone forces Hagrid to let him enter the great hall (threatening to kill the first years he is guiding) so hagrid doesn't do the knock, causing the wards to trigger to hostile forces.

I just want fanfics plz


** Hagrid knocks three times: "All good, everyone's here who should be and nobody's here who shouldn't be."

Hagrid knocks twice: "We have a little problem, bring your wand but be discreet."

Hagrid knocks evenly four times: "We have a BIG problem, animate the suits of armor and prepare for a huge fight."

Hagrid knocks to the tune of Beethoven's 5th: "Someone from the Ministry/the examiners are here."

Hagrid knocks to the tune of Shave & a Haircut, plus additional knocks: "A small issue has arisen; could the Charms (one extra knock)/Potions (two extra knocks)/Herbology (three extra knocks)/Transfiguration (four extra knocks)/Every (five or more knocks) Professor come here please?"

Hagrid knocks 8 times, in a knock-knock-pause pattern: "Madam Pomfrey is needed immediately."

Hagrid scratches at the door: "I tried the animagus transformation again, can someone fix me?"

*** Hagrid knocks numerous times with no discernable pattern: "I'm drunk and I've locked myself out of my cottage by mistake"

Not far fetched at all. The Tower of London has something of the kind that has been going on for seven centuries at this point. Go look up the Ceremony of the Keys, which has been securing the Tower at night for seven centuries uninterrupted. It was slightly late one night during the second world war due to a bomb dropping nearby that required them to take cover briefly. The Yeoman Warders sent a note of apology to King George, they regarding slacking under fire as a serious matter.

** I think I read one when I got into Fanfictions a few years back. It was short, likely around 10-15k words and the chapters didnt have any connection to each other.

Hagrid was massive, compared to people think hagrid looks like because of the movies. He was a halfgiant, means he was resistant to most regular spells and you would need a couple of fairly good spellcasters to down him for good. And that fanfiction used that fact.\\
The chapters displayed Hagrid charging and destroying anything that attacked people who lived at Hogwarts. Werewolf-Lupin on the grounds attacking students? chained and collared with a few broken bones to tell the tale and a happy Hagrid petting his new wolfi.

Dementors swooping down to kill Harry and Sirius Black on the grounds of Hogwarts? A moonmad drunk hagrid charging in welding torches and trying to set aflame the Dementors.

There was also one chapter about Hagrid having absolute control over the keys and him being able to initate absolute lockdown in case the headmaster is incapacitated or gone.

I think there were 8-9 chapters.

if anyone got the link, please send it into my direction.

*** I'm reasonably sure you meant wielding torches but I want to believe you meant he was wielding welding torches because holy shit that would be awesome

**** Haha :D Sorry, my laptop suffered the fate of a spilled milktea, and well, it still works but sometimes not all keystrokes are recognized.

Anyhow, yes of course I meant wielding torches. But I see your reasoning for why wielding /welding/ torches would be awesome. I think we need a technology/steampunk-savvy Hagrid.
