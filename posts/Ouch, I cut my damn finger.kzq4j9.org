:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I find myself remembering this hilarious scene and wondering "Where did I read that?". This might be a difficult one.

Harry goes to Diagon and buys one of those blood-warded, password protected trunks. The only issue is that you can only set the password once - when you give your blood for the first time. So, he swipes his finger at the pointy edge of the trunk meant to give his blood to unlock it, and goes like, "Son of a bitch, I cut my finger!" and that is set as the permanent password for opening the trunk. I believe this becomes sort of a running gag later on, with people laughing at Harry each time he has to open his trunk.

Hopefully, someone with good memory remembers this and can tell where it comes from. The only clues that I can give is that it is neither a short story (oneshot) nor slash, since I don't read any of those. Also, not a crackfic.


** This seems familiar but I can't remember exactly which fic this was from. Let me try and find it

Edit: I think its this one. linkffn(12350003). right at the end of the first chapter

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

*** Isn't Harry the Hufflepuff about him being ridiculously lazy? Like he invents new things because he wants to do less. And ppl think he's a genius but he spends most of the time sleeping? It was very funny. He started multiple businesses and got lectured about the rights of house elves when he started using them for mass production of socks or something.
