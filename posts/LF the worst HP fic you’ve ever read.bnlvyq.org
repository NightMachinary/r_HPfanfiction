** I think it was deleted. It was a Starwars Crossover with a SI Draco as the protagonist. 'Cept the 'self' in this case was a bonafied drug addict. So it started out with 'Drugged up Draco' tricking Dobby into stealing a fuckton hard drugs from muggles. 'Druggy Draco' then became a pusher at Hogwarts and somehow turned Hermione Granger into his personal slave/assistant. (In first year)

Only redeeming quality was that there was repercussions for his actions, because while Hermione was with him she couldn't help Harry and Ron, and as such Voldemort got hold of the stone and was resurrected that summer.

'Druggy Draco' proceeds to change school with Hermione to Durmstrang. There he applies and receives a bunch of money to build some sort of contraption, described as if it was a submarine. Or rahter he has Hermione invent it and build it with the help of Dobby or Muggles or sumthing.

This contraption was supposed to help 'Druggy Draco' survive Voldemort, but to buy time he offers Voldemort a fuckton drugs. Claiming they are the reason for 'Dracos' power. (Read Mary Sue SI powers)

Voldemort procedes to get high as a kite for a year until the contraption is done and Draco, Dobby (?) and Hermione take off into space... litterally. That's when the Starwars Crossover comes in, with an extra spash/camoe of Stargate not entirely sure.

And that is when it turned really fucking weird. If anyone has a link I'd appriciate it, i Sadly lost it and I don't this I dead it on one of the big sites.

**** Voldemort is an atheist Reddit troll.

Mostly everyone's speech always follows the pattern '"speech," speech-verbed adverbly,' to such a ridiculous extent, that it almost has to be satire by that alone.

Author's community college writing instructor repeatedly provides her with constructive criticism for the story.

Here are some samples of the text to showcase this.

#+begin_quote
  "You're still pretending to be dumb," the Reverend pointed out truthfully. "We know all about your plot to illegalize Christianity, Voldemort."

  Voldemort blinked stupidly again and questioned evilly, "Wait, this is about my Reddit account?"

  "Is that what you call your godless coven?" Dumbledore queried knowingly. "Well yes I have indeed seen your so-called Reddit Account; and just try to deny your hatred of Christianity when you post things like this-'kristians all sux. their religion is stoopid and should be illegal. i will rite to congres and tell them to make law.'"

  Harry Potter laughed intelligently; because Voldemort did not even understand proper spelling and grammar.

  "That was a joke," Voldemort retorted unintelligently. "That whole account is a joke. I mean, 'Voldemort_the_righteous_skeptic'?" He laughed with the nervousness of one who knows he is damned. "Of course you're not supposed to take it seriously."

  "Do you think religion is a laughing matter young man?" Dumbledore demanded righteously. "Well it is not! What sort of a joke is trying to outlaw religion?!"
#+end_quote

Another sample that perfectly exhibits the satirical nature of the piece:

#+begin_quote
  "Convert him!" Dumbledore commanded bravely; and all at once-the students began to shout.

  "You have been tricked by the lies of society," Harry shrieked knowingly. "You deserve to burn in hell!"

  "Come over here!" Dean Thomas screeched articulately. "Debate me on religion!"

  "I'm just so upset that you don't accept the Bible," Hermione sobbed femininely. "The Bible is the best book ever. Why can't you just respect that?!"

  "I'm a Gryffindor Hat now!" Draco yelled boldly with the inspiring zeal that so many newcomers to the faith have. "Do you hate me now? I bet you do!"

  Voldemort covered his ears with the discomfort that heathens often find themselves with when they are confronted with the truth; and he shouted loudly to drown out the word of the Lord, "You've been preparing to do this? To scream at me?"

  "It is the work of the Lord!" Dumbledore explained accurately.

  "Aren't there better ways to spend your time than preaching to a bored idiot who makes fun of people on the internet?" Voldemort questioned hedonistically. "Your Lord seemed to be pretty concerned about helping the people around him. Is that not his work anymore?"

  "How can we focus on helping people; when there are people like you trying to destroy us?" Dumbledore countered astutely.
#+end_quote

Some incrediblly well-done self-awareness:

#+begin_quote
  "I told you before, that Reddit account is a joke," Voldemort whined pathetically; but the Reverend shook his head.

  "I thought that might be so at first," the Reverend commented fairly. "But it was just too realistic."
#+end_quote

And the last line, which is a sad commentary on the so-called 'power of faith':

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort sighed wickedly; and he shook his head godlessly; and then he walked away depravedly. But even as the fornicating, drug-addicted Evolutionist disappeared into the distance, the righteous little ones continued to pray. They knew that, if they screamed loud enough, they could change the world.
#+end_quote

All of these are from the last chapter.
