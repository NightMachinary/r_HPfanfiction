Can list, as many or as few, as you'd like. Can also add more, if you think up any, later.

Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like, is perfectly fine.

Anyone, can be the main character, can be on any site, can be, any length, can be old or new. (Would rather, it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine).

I'm fine with male pregnancy (but truth be told, I'd rather it not be detailed), but if a favorite of yours, has detailed male pregnancy, feel free to recommend, someone else, might like it. Would appreciate if, you listed a warning of detailed male pregnancy, if there is.

I'm NOT okay with Weasley bashing, I do NOT like when authors have the Weasley's use Harry for his fame and fortune. So, if some of your favorites, have that trope, please make a warning, for it. I might not like it, but others might, so you can suggest them, for that reason, if they're your favorite.

Can be rare pairs, can be common/popular, can be slow burns, or not, can be as AU as possible, or as canon as possible, or anywhere in between, as long as they're your ultimate favorites.

If a story, has kinks or anything like that, feel free to share, if they're your favorites.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
