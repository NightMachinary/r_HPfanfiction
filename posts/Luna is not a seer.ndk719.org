** Luna is weird. She is supposed to be a character that the reader feel sorry for, but at the same time she is really "loony" and a true conspiracy theorist (though to be fair, these people were not seen the same way when Rownling wrote the books compared to now).

Still, I think her "Seer" abilities came from her popularity. Some writers liked Luna and wanted to write more about her, but at the same time they didn't want her to be just "Loony". So they decided to "upgrade" the character by making her right in the end. And making her a Seer is the easiest way to make her still be strange, while also telling the truth. And while it doesn't follow how Seers work in Canon, it's not like people care in fanfics (hello Magical Core, Lordships and Marriage Contract . . .).

I think OotP came around the times when the conspiracy theories actually became a widely known phenomenon due to US starting the war in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks (which some people claimed that the Bush administration was behind and they were using it as an excuse to steal oil from Arab countries).

*** I like Luna in the form of "consipiracy theorists are right 1% of the time".

I mean, conspiracies do exists, and things that we called crazy theories turns out to be true conspiracy. (MK Ultra is one of them. So if one makes hundreds of claims and theories, odds are they'll be somewhat right at some point.

Not unlike fake seers when you think about it.

So, I like Luna making hundreds of theories, and once in a while, one turns out to be true, to even Luna surprises.

Because tropes are tropes. Neither is Hermione an all-knowing library, neither is Ron a clueless idiot, yet there's fics like that.

That's in a way one of the points of fanfiction. It allows the writer to explore ideas that don't need to hold their own when compared to canon.

** I don't have a problem with it, but don't really follow the logic behind it either.

My best guess on where it comes from is that she “disconnected” from reality and unlikely to let logic weigh her down ala Hermione. That, and people read too much into what nargles and snorkacks could mean and say she's hinting at the future.

** The whole point is, Luna /could/ be a seer. The whole point of fanfiction, atleast for me as an author, is to explore the universe of could-be is and what-ifs. If authors like writing it that way, isn't it fair to let them do so? I'm sure there are enough fics out there where she isn't one....

And if you're annoyed at the risk of reading a story and Luna becoming a seer in that, well, you run that risk in every fanfiction. There will always be stories that you like and that which you don't. This is the risk with any book, to be honest. :)

****** That's an excuse, and a poor one at that. You argued your point using Ron as an example asking why Ron didn't seem to have few if any stories where he's a Seer, but Luna did. I'd argue that there are actually more Seer Ron stories than Seer Luna, because in most stories where authors change Luna's character, they actually make it to where she just sees more, as in other planes of existance, or possible branching paths of the future. Luna rarely ever sees an unchangable future, and usually remembers what she sees. Seer Ron though usually sees the unchangable future, and it's usually only noticeable after the fact it's happened.

Basically i've read more stories of Luna as a person who sees possible futures, less Ron as a Seer, and than Luna as a Seer the least.

** I think 'Seer Luna Who Can't Say Anything Directly' is a really interesting technique to write her, but a relatively dull narrative direction to take her in.

Like, when trying to write her character, imagining if she'd read your entire story but was only able to allude to it indirectly or metaphorically seems to get a decently wise, enigmatic, and slightly mad version of Luna that seems to work pretty well.

But explaining her actions and insights watsonianally as her being a seer often doesn't turn out very interestingly. I think the best explanation for Luna is just the canon-esque "Oh, that's Luna. She's weird."

** I actually haven't read any fics where Luna is a seer (lol), but its fanfiction after all.

I have read many fics were Luna is a /very/ perceptive person tho, and someone who knows how to read the others very well. Something like “She doesn't speak much but she observes”. In my fics I write Luna that way; she's no seer but she quickly figures people out, and is able to see the bigger picture.

IMO Luna is one of those people that see the details in things many people tend to oversee, so that's why it'd seem she's a “seer” I believe. She knows what will happen not because she sees the future, but the situation as a whole and is able to make a good prediction of an “obvious” outcome no one else has figured.

** As much as I like R' Blot as a writer, he unfortunately popularized the trope that there's something always /special/ about Luna, like her being a seer, to the point where it's all mostly just cringe-worthy now.

She's a semi-traumatized, lonely young girl. She has her quirks, but she's not a seer or anything as esoteric.

She's /just Luna/.

And every time I see a fic with her being overpowered like this in someway, I cringe and press the Almighty Red X now.

That's because you're misunderstanding divination. It's true that people don't remember prophecies that they give, but that is only one type of divination, and it's not the type that Luna normally uses in fanfics (at least not the ones I've seen). Tea leaves, crystal balls, tarot readings, and probably plenty of other methods I can't think of at the moment all let the user remember using them (though Luna doesn't usually use those either).

Luna's ability is usually to just generally know the future, which is still at least slightly supported in canon by Trelawney's predictions in her first lesson.

**** No, the book says that Firenze thinks they are malarkey. And centaurs are shown to be very proud, so it is very in-character for them to disparage other forms of divination.

But the actual evidence shows that those methods of divination are legitimate, even if no one in the books, including Trelawney, is very good at them. Harry saw the grim in his tea leaves, which correctly predicted Sirius's appearance, even though Trelawney misinterpreted it. Trelawney used cards to accurately predict the Death Eater attack on Hogwarts, but didn't believe it.

But even if we choose to accept Firenze's claims, that still leaves us with the centaurs' astrology, which is also a form of divination that the user remembers.
