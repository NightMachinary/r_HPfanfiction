I'm really enjoying writing this fanfic, which started based on a prompt about Harry being an owl Animagus and Hedwig teaching him to deliver letters (found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k4jckg/harrys_animagus_form_is_a_owl_hedwig_teaches_him/]]).

That prompt snowballed in ideas in my head, combined with my opinion that there's not enough fics in the world in which Harry's greatest worry is normal school stuff - so I decided to write a longer fic in which that pretty much is the case, and in which the snippet I wrote for that prompt would fit pretty well.

Just now, my fic hit 10.000 words in length - just at the same time that the characters leave the Hogwarts Express. Please check it out, review, et cetera:

** Low key gonna tell you to crosspost it on AO3 as the audience there is a lot more supportive but otherwise its very nice. Been reading some edgy stuff, i need the fluff to balance it out.

This crosspost has also revealed that, while I'm close, I haven't actually hit the 10K word milestone yet - so close! Dang author's notes counting on FFN but not on AO3...

  AU: Voldemort died that Halloween night, thanks to a combination of spells created by Lily, James and Dumbledore that gave Harry a "power the Dark Lord Knows Not". Follow Harry through early life in a world that's slowly rebuilding itself, with parents who love him and without a Prophecy still looming over him.
