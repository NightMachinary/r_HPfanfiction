** Literally the only pirate Harry fic I know is Rocking the Boat and it's also accompanied by Manipulative!Dumbledore and GrangerParentsTeachTheKidsToFuck (BDSM style, too), so it's not something I can recommend for its actual quality. It's just the only thing I know that meets your request.

Aside from that, there's really only cringy anime pirate fics that I've never read because I know literally nothing about anime and a single good Pirates of the Caribbean crossover that I cannot find friggin' anywhere.

**** Smart choice. :)

Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Have you done a subsearch? Maybe someone on this sub has asked for pirate stuff before and been luckier in their results than I?

If you don't know how to subsearch, find the reddit search bar, type whatever you want in, then click the box to limit your search to this sub and you'll get all the posted threads containing whatever words you put in your search.

****** Heh. Fair enough. Maybe try post-it notes? Stick those fuckers everywhere and they're the best memory aid you'll ever find. :)

#+begin_quote
  Harry is left with the Dursleys just after his godfather had died. One thing leads to the other and Harry is fed up with being a puppet. He breaks free and finds help. And boy, does he start rocking the boat.
