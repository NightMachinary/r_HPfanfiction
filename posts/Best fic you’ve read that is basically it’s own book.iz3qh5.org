I'm talking those fics that make you go “just change some names and you're golden” kind of fics. Harry Potter lore is merely the base of the story and the author builds upon that in an entirely original way. Longer fics preferred, crossovers and AU welcome.


** Inverarity, the author of /Alexandra Quick,/ actually thought about doing this, but he explains [[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/186540.html][here]] why he hasn't.

There's also this [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/alexandra-quick-and-the-thorn-circle-by-inverarity-k.13590/][absolute gold DLP thread for it]] where one of the primary debates is whether it's actually fanfiction in the first place.

He doesn't? I read up to the point that they gathered all the heirs of the various races on the other world and sent them to Hogwarts to protect them. At that point I went "fuck me" and gave up on it, thinking that it's turning into a Hogwarts story again. Are you saying that doesn't happen?

The thing that makes it so good in my opinion is the fact that it follows Snape from birth to death and it's quite like real life: sometimes you have good things happening to you, other times they are bad, sometimes life is unfair and you don't always get closure or happy endings.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] comes to mind. It befits greatly from being in the HP universe, but only uses a few elements heavily, namely Dementors, Azkaban, and Umbridge. It has a wonderful atmosphere halfway between thriller and Lychian nightmare. Highly recommend.

It would take some filing of serial numbers to be sure since the whole premise is keyed on a magical prison that sucks the happiness from you, but I think it's doable. It doesn't use Harry's character in an irreplaceable way, and the only other heavily borrowed character, Umbridge, could be replaced with an identical bureaucrat. It doesn't use Hogwarts or other major world building elements, so I think it is possible. The writing is certainly as good or better than typical pulpy novels.

Both series are extremely well written and function as regular published work. Alexandra Quick examines the United States's Wizarding World (wayyyy better that JK Rowling) and The Stygian Trilogy is the next generation a la Dystopian YA.

After /Alexandra Quick,/ probably my favorite fanfiction series, and incredibly underrated. I wouldn't describe it so much as dystopian YA as a mashup of genres. The first book is somewhat dystopian because it takes place during an epidemic, but there isn't really a dystopian element to the second and third books; I also find the second and third ones remarkably mature.

But yeah, great writing and characters and highly recommended. I'm reading Slide's Anguis series right now as well and it's equally tremendous.

***** Haha yeah, it's set in 2024 I think so hopefully post-Covid? There's a novel magical illness, but I think it's contained to Hogwarts. The school is in quarantine from the rest of the magical world with very little line of communication iirc. Albus, Scorpius, Rose, and two other OC students and a professor are the only ones who don't get the illness (I think the reason is explained, but I forget) and the plot is around their efforts to uncover the source of/treatment for the illness and regain contact with the outside world.

But yes, somewhat spine-chilling. And exceptionally good (the first book is actually probably the weakest in the series)

******* It's complete, the first book has a pairing between two OCs and (I think) a Scorpius/Rose thing going on. Second book establishes a love triangle between Scorpius, Rose, and an OC. Albus has an on and off thing with another OC. That's about it IIRC.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Last night, they went to bed in their dorms. This morning, they woke up in either A) an abandoned building, B) unfamiliar apartments with unfamiliar school uniforms, C) a plush bedroom nicer than their entire house... or D) the League of Villains' headquarters, because of COURSE Izuku still manages to draw the shortest straw even when others are screwed over too. UA tries its best to prepare its students for anything, but one topic it never covered: what to do if you wake up in an alternate dimension. Six students suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar world where the balance between Heroes and Villains is more unstable than ever and they have no idea how they got there or to get home. All they know is that this world is horribly wrong, and they're largely on their own. (Well, except Izuku, but he thinks he'd prefer that.)

** Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) feels like that to me. It operates on the premise that Voldemort won the first war, so it borrows basically zero plot from canon. Takes concepts from the original, like werewolves, and fleshes out a whole society and culture for them. It's abandoned near the end in a very painful way, but there's still well over a million words of it to enjoy.

**** Well, I wouldn't call it a crack fic tbh. But since Harry is gay there're some slash elements so its not up to everyone I guess.

Basically it's “Harry goes to different school“ type of fiction but this one school is not really for humans. The new school is a mixed one mostly for non-humans like vampires, werewolves, demons etc. There only few humans because it's hard for them to survive there.

So, there's a different magic system, different werewolves (like, Lupin is basically a puppy to them). Its very HP-centric with bunch of OCs. Original characters like Snape or Voldemort are at start and somewhat in the end, but the story and writing itself is so good it could be just published as it's own book changing a couple of names here and there.

*** I was excited to try this rec out, but I honestly could barely get past the first chapter. The writing was clichéd and flowed poorly.

I'm a fan of the pairing, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone going through this thread.

** linkao3(all the young dudes) is a marauders era beginning in their first year running all the way up to just before ootp- 188 chapters but it's so well paced it feels right, there's a slight canon divergence that remus' father committed suicide so he was raised in a boys home meaning he ends up much rougher round the edges. the writing is so emotive, i was so engaged that i read the whole thing and then didn't think about anything else for days.

it's really good if you're into a more realistic portrayal of the marauders and their lives seeing as they were at school in the 70's, explores muggle culture a little and sits well alongside what was actually happening in the muggle world as well as a really interesting and believable lead up to the first wizarding war.

i also love the portrayal of the marauders vs snape thing where it's portrayed much more like a rivalry than a victim thing and remus is much more involved

honestly i cant recommend it enough please read it even if marauders stuff isn't usually your thing it gives so much motivation to the way remus and sirius act in canon and provides a huge backstory that slides right in to the golden era

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
