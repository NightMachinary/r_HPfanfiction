A friend of mine is interested in reading some fanfiction so I am looking for suggestions. Only real requirement is no slash. What I am looking for are the fics you think are the crème de la crème. No length requirements or limits.


** linkffn(cauterize)

Short, brutally sad. Very good writing.

*** Seconding /Cauterize/.

Fanfic has many roles: extension, hole-patching, full counterfactuals, & subversion are some of the main ones.

‘Extension' is arguably the ‘purest' fanfic role, and so it's entirely appropriate that an extension fanfic be someone's introduction to the genre.

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) is good for an almost authentic approach with the single divergence of Slytherin instead of Gryffindor.

linkffn(A Different Begining) AU with potters alive and a few OCs, but with the same plot as in Canon.

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw) Divergence in 6th to explain a bit of fanon concepts like Marriage Contracts, absortion of the Horcrux and Introduction to Daphne as a major Fanon character, even if she's unique as fuck in this particular fic.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) DIvergence in 4th year with the introduction to the fanon-favourite idea of Harry being a descendant of Salazar, also a different Fleur and introduction to a Darker Harry.

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) Introduction to Harry's fanon Black heritage (Through Dorea) and the concept of both Magical Maturity and Custom Wands.

linkffn(Delenda Est) Introduction to Time Travel, Politics and a different type of war, with the idea of a non-Evil Bellatrix (can't really say she's a goodBella in this fic) Also AU elements later on.

I think those are a few good introductions to fanfic for the Potterverse, in my opinion.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project.

Get them started on the best "do over" fic in the fandom, characters all have good motivations and no one is particularly ooc. It also doesn't dwell on the stations of canon. Personally i think its as close to a perfect mix of new and old as can be found outside of Out of the Night.

*** Can you tell me why are you bothered by "ing"? I am not trying to attack you, just genuinely curious. English is not my native language, that's why I wondered if its considered bad form or something. Or is it just when it's used excessively in one sentence?

*** It was my first HP fanfic and it ruined HPfanfiction for me in a good way.

I am a sucker for smart and intelligent main characters. I am not a native English speaker and when I started English literature Harry Potter was first novel that I picked from school library.

Sadly, JKR's main character and several other things were a serious let down. There were giant plot holes and everything seemed half ass cliché.

Prophecy child (1), orphaned at childhood (2), sad childhood (3), abused (4), is the only one that can defeat the most vile villain (5), mustache twriling villain at that (6), becomes friends with a bit and a girl and forms a famed 'trio' (7) and embarks on a journey in a world where every adult is either incompatible (8) or secretly evil (9).

Coming from my native language reading JKR's world was a let down. In my language even preteens often don't read such childish stories. I failed to see why this thing was as famous as it was.

Anyway, someone recommended HPMOR. This story was a really captivating tale.

But I think it's not up everyone's alley. Starting fanfiction with this might be a bad idea. It might drive him away if he hates rational things. And by chance of he dies like this thing then he won't ever be able to enjoy other subpar fanfiction.

*** Those are both pretty heavy to start on imo. I read Denarian far into my fanfic experience and while I can acknowledge it's better than 90% of what's out there, I didn't enjoy it. I think you gotta ease into ff with some of the fluffier stuff before you really dig your teeth into stuff like Wastelands or Denarian.
