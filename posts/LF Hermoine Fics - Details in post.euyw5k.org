Hi yall,

Back again looking for Hermoine fics. I'm looking for:

At least:

- Hermoine with not Harry/Ron/Draco
- Romcommy? Generally uplifting or at least a happy ending

Added bonus:

- Completed short fics or one shots
- Post-hogwarts adult Hermoine fics
- From a diff fanfiction site than the main one. I'm hoping to explore other sites.
- Avoiding angst.

Thank you a for all the help!


** The Arithmancer series is not much of a romcom, more of a world building exercise, imagining what magic could be made to do. It's an interesting read, though, and complete. Hermione/George, including later marriage and children.
