I want so badly for there to be a crossover of Harry Potter and X Men. I have looked but can't find anything like this. Has anyone seen a fanfic of this crossover?


** Third Path to the Future is a long Marvel crossover that features the X men heavily. It's unfinished atm but it was updated a couple months ago. One of my favourite crossover fics to date. (Sorry bout mobile link)

** dellacouer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4388682/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-that-Waits][Harry Potter and the World that Waits]] is the first that comes to mind.

Another is bobmin's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7404056/1/Mutant-Storm][Mutant Storm]].

** Complete crack, and yet strangely compelling.

** Not /quite/ X-men, but from what I remember a few weave in and out of the story - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage]] has Harry raised by Comic!Tony Stark (as opposed to MCU Tony). Even if it's not what you were hoping for its worth a read. It's quite old and unfinished, but I think it still gets updated.
