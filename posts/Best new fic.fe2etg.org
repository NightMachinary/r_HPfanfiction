#+begin_quote
  Tom is three years old when Mary, his twin sister, is taken from him. After eight solitary years at Wool's Orphanage, he learns that he shall see her again at Hogwarts, a school of magic. Will their reunion be a peaceful one, or will they travail through seven years of waxes and wanes, through which their world becomes increasingly torn by war and desire?

** I mean, this is self promo, but both of these have received great feedback overall and I am super excited to unveil future plots and such. The first is a Gryffindor Harry fic that will not be a canon rehash but will still cover all 7 years. He enters the magical world in a completely different manner than canon, is actually driven and will be powerful, but will actually have to progress instead of instantly being Dumbledore/Voldemort level. Currently about to enter year 2, but will update every Sunday until at least the end of 2nd year.

The second was started a couple of weeks ago and it is a bit heavier on the AU side. It is a Slytherin Harry fic that will also cover all 7 years. There may be a bit of bashing in this one, but it will be very light compared to most others of its kind. It updates every Saturday and I don't really want to say a whole lot due to spoilers and such. Fair warning, it is WBWL and contains a Female Voldemort, so if that's a turn off, fair enough.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

*** This is the first sentence:

"That was the first sound that could be heard by a small, raven haired ten year old boy who sharply awoke from his uneasy slumber, groggily throwing the thin, beat up sheet he used to sleep with off to the side as he clumsily fumbled for his glasses with one hand, while the other tried in vain to remove the sleep from his eyes."

Hoo-boy is that hard on the eyes. I'm gonna give this a hard pass.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.
