What happened there? I thought we'd see Emily back or Harry up to something but we got the return of someone else entirely. And did we ever find out why Harry and Avery got along so well?

Definitely been left on a cliffhanger but could be [[/u/TE7]] messing with us rather than planning a sequel. What did everyone think?


** I was heavily disappointed. I've never been a big fan of this fic in the first place, but I never considered it bad by any means. Well, until now.

Nothing is resolved. Yeah, there'll obviously be a sequel for that, but the general rule is to at least have /something/ resolved before you hop on a sequel. The whole thing with Voldemort isn't resolved after Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but you still have the main plot get resolved. We know who was really after the Stone, why they wanted it, etc etc. We get none of that here. We got zero explanations.

Imagine if Philosopher's Stone ended right when Quirrell dies and Harry passes out. It would be incredibly unsatisfying. There was all this conflict building up and then it just... falls flat. The epilogue is just half unrelated nonsense and half about a generic powerful!Harry talking around annoyingly idiotic people.

Speaking of annoyingly idiotic people, it really irks me when authors make people stupid to the point where they're downright delusional. You have Harry telling the Board of Governors and Fudge that he didn't want to be headmaster for his entire life. And then Fudge asks him immediately after why he's applying if he doesn't want the job at all.

Like really? Is Fudge just that fucking delusional that he hears something completely different coming out of Harry's mouth? But then Harry corrects him... and then a moment later a member of the Board of Governors asks him the same damn question Fudge asked him, after Harry already gave his answer. Wtf?

This issue fucking plagues Harry Potter fanfiction, where Harry will be saying things and his "enemies" will act as though something completely different came out of his mouth, or like they just don't understand the incredibly simply words Harry is saying. You see it often with GreaterGood!Manipulative!Evil!Whatever!Dumbledore fics. While I've never been a fan of this fic, I still thought it better than 95% of fanfiction. So to see TE7 do this was just a big WTF moment. It is easily the most irritating thing to read for me.

The only thing I liked about the epilogue was seeing Dumbledore finally die, because his characterization was just terrible near the end.

*** Well, except about the fact that I actually really liked the fic while I read it, I completely agree with you on all of your points. The epilogue left me with a sour taste in my mouth since I felt it accomplished nothing except establishing Dumbledore's death. It actually feels more like a prologue than an epilogue.

** I'm just trying to picture if HPDH didn't have the /Flaw in the Plan/ chapter. Imagine it. Harry is in limbo, talking to Dumbledore, and then the next chapter is the epilogue. We don't get him waking up and finishing Voldemort, it's just straight to the epilogue. And then:

#+begin_quote
  The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

  But then, as he watched the Hogwarts Express pull away, he saw someone waving at him from one of the train's windows. Any thoughts of this being a young fan of his were instantly swept aside and replaced with a sense of familiarity. He knew this man. He had seen this man, had seen him in one of Voldemort's visions from the war.

  Grindelwald!

That's kinda what this epilogue feels like.

** I found this ending very baffling, and the whole turn that the story took in later chapters was disappointing and abrupt. What, exactly, is Emily planning? I assume she isn't actually dead, or there wouldn't be any point to her entire mission. We had all this interaction between her and Harry that didn't result in anything. We also had some kind of H/Hr romance that... also didn't result in anything. Overall, the author doesn't seem to know how to write a plot, and leaves all sorts of situations unsatisfying and dead in the water. I thought this story was going to be some kind of revolution/reform of the entire Wizarding Britain, and following Harry as he interacts with that seemed quite intriguing at the start, but then I don't know what we're supposed to expect now. A sequel where Harry has to defend against a revived Grindelwald movement? MEH.

*** Emily realised she wasn't going to succeed and found a way out of it, giving Harry a huge "victory" in the process.

The H/Hr stuff was explained too. Emily knew Harry fancied her, wasn't interested, and tried to deflect his attentions on to Hermione but with only partial success. In the end, Harry realised that he couldn't trust his feelings for Hermione: for all he knew the affection he felt could have been caused entirely by Emily. So he left to discover what he really felt about things. The epilogue makes it pretty clear that they've met since then. They're not together, so I guess they decided it wasn't going to work.

***** You don't. But you kinda do.

Hermione mentions she hasn't had a vacation since a trip she'd taken to Japan five years previously. Hedwig then hoots at her. You learn later in the chapter that Harry has been in Japan for five years.

She later reminisces about the oppressive nature of the air in Japan (which is implied in Emily's diary) from 'the last time she saw him'. And she correlates the magic she is sensing from Harry with that power in Japan.

I don't say it, but the implication (and truth) is that Hermione went to Japan to see Harry.

** I'm left a bit melancholy about the whole ordeal. I enjoyed the fic more than I expected, though I had no idea what I was getting into prior to looking at it. I hadn't even realized it was so popular a topic of discussion here as I don't browse here specifically much and most posts don't make it my larger frontpage. It was grammatically a bit rough in places and the lack of page breaks was irritating but the plot was decent for the most part. I read the entire story in about 4 days after stumbling on it over the long weekend.

I hadn't seen much like it actually, the take on Emily/Voldemort and the relationship with Harry. I enjoyed that part because it was very much different from what'd I seen prior, though I am only now returning to HP fanfic reading. I find myself wanting to read more stories with different relationships between Voldemort and Harry than mortal enemies because of it.

But I don't think we saw enough of Emily and her state of mind in the present for the conclusion with her to be satisfying. It explored her journey but did little to really explore who she was at the point of her ressurection and how Harry affected her. She presented as just a cross between the girl in her early years and Dark Lord later. It implied and even outright stated a lot about her passions and lack thereof and that explains the ending but being left wondering exactly what she thought of Harry and how she viewed him beyond her claims of manipulation was disappointing. Perhaps that was the point, to leave it up to the reader to interpret it but I find it a bit frustrating in this case. The lack of closure between them was irritating.

Perhaps a sequel will address this more. Before the return of the character at the end I would have been more or less content with the conclusion as it stood. I might have liked to see what Avery and Harry got up to and how their relationships developed over time in a spin-off or something but without that last section of epilogue it felt finished if a touch disappointing. Now I'm left simply hoping we might see more of Emily and how Harry views their relationship years later. How she might have viewed him during this fic.

I enjoyed the story in the moment and the during the reading of it for the most part. Some pieces of character were a bit tough going down but overall I was compelled in a way I hadn't been in some time reading HP Fanfiction. It has encouraged me to keep looking for stories in the fandom, as clearly I have missed more than I might have thought given how extensively I used to read and search out fics I liked. If I reread the story sometime in the future I will likely be ignoring that last section of epilogue until such time that a sequel is being released.

******* LdS resolves Harry's childhood.

I was going to respond with something much more involved but there's a simple answer. Harry began the story as a boy and ended it as a man. He started as a victim and ended with a nonchalant attitude of power. Is that not enough?

Arthur C Clarke wrote in his Afterword to Rama II "In real life, of course, no story ever ends".

Does LdS wrap everything up in a package and seal it with a bow? No. Very few stories do. Tolkien couldn't manage it and had to resort to that time line at the end of Lord of the Rings. Clarke, Asimov, dammit the bible is pretty open ended.

I understand the wish for a "They all lived happily ever after" story. But this was never going to be that. There *should *be more to Fanfiction than who ends up with whom.

********* I usually don't respond to people that don't like me. I'm not going to change their mind and there's no reason to get into an argument about it. They've got their opinions on my work and they're more than entitled to them.

The vast majority of this thread has been negative, which makes me rather sad as I thoroughly enjoyed writing this last chapter and thought it was a pretty solid piece of writing on my part. But mostly I'm just not going to get into arguments with people who don't like my work. There's nothing that either of us gain from that.

Granted, this chapter was a first for me. I've never written anything with the intention of writing a sequel. So I perhaps thought I needed to try to hook too hard into what's to come. I've told people countless times that LdS does not have a happy ending for Emily and figured after that, they accept her death as the closing of her ark in the first story. After that, I wanted to focus on what's to come.

The sequel, if I ever write it, will be done in the same style of LdS in that there will be bits of the past interposed with the present. It will explore the scenes referenced in the epilogue and show how that changed Harry and got him to where he is now. The Harry that appears in the Epilogue knows a lot more than he lets on.

I don't think I'm internet famous. I'm more like esoterically HPfanfiction known about.

I enjoyed it! I personally feel that an ending really shouldn't answer every single question that comes up, seeing as how that doesn't happen in life and it was fairly obvious that this is a Story #1 in a series. Though I was mightily confused at first when it switched suddenly to Grindelwald's point of view due to the lack of any sort of page break.

Also, I never like to see an author sad because of negative feedback.

** I won't repeat what other people said, but I will say that I was disappointed. TE7 should've never killed off Emily, and should've instead dove deep into Harry breaking bad. Harry killing Dumbledore, doing bad shit, etc. Then, Emily revealing her true colors and turning on Harry once he filled his purpose. You could've even had Grindelwald coming back as part of that. A conflict between Harry vs Emily vs GG would've been interesting.

LDS was always about Emily for me. Harry was boring, mopey, and annoying. Which was fine, as I was expecting character growth (jumping 10 years forward w Super!Harry isn't growth, it's basically a new character). That never came, so ultimately Harry was just a waste.

So ultimately, it was an interesting premise pulled off well, only to putter and falter at the end.
