Hey guys, I've been digging, and I can't find this fic I'm thinking of, probably because the part I remember was more of a sub-plot than a main focus (I think). Basically, Dumbledore is working with the Prof. Vector (I think) and using arithmancy to predict possible outcomes of the war. There's this matrix that shows all the different lifelines of different key players and how they interact and intersect. Snape was obviously a key player, though I remember that Vector (or whoever) didn't know who it was and simply referred to him as "the spy". I remember this scene when Dumbledore shows up at her house at some insane time of night and drags her to an order meeting. That's basically all I remember. Sorry... Can anyone help me out?


** Is it linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria)?

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

*** Huh, it was! Wow, I feel dumb. I have that one favourited, but I didn't realise it was the same one I was looking for lol. Flipped through a few chapters, and sure enough, there's Prof Vector and the matrix and Sev's lifeline blinking in and out of existence. Thank you!! :-)

**** You're welcome! And I actually searched through that fic twice before I was confident enough to post it as an option - once I was thinking about the arithmancy, I couldn't remember the rest of the plot.

** I think I've read this fic. I can't think of it right now but there is also one where Hermione, Vector, and Pansy end up working on an arithmancy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][Phoneix Song trilogy]]

**** Ugh, that makes so much sense. Another one with a similar plot point is linkffn(The Twenty) which I would also recommend.

** I know the exact fic you mean. Harry and Sirius divert the timeline away from the 'favourable' one which is canon. I'll see if I can find it in my favourites.

  Sirius breaks out of Azkaban two years before schedule. He's pissed, half-mad and prepared to do anything to protect his Godson. He's going to make the Wizarding world pay for the hell it put him through- and have some fun along the way, of course! Super! Sirius, Dark Lord! Sirius, but not evil. No slash. May include ships later. Mainly from Sirius' (and Harry's) point of view. AU.
