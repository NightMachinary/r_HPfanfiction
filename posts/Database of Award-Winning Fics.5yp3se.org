This might be too big a lift but on various sites I'll read in a story summary that the fic was winner of some online community poll. (ie siye's Dumbledore's Silver Trinket winner).

I know siye has a trophy room for all their winners, but does anyone have a general database of such winners across the numerous fic sites? Or at least a link to them on each site?

And for discussion, do people feel like the fics that win these awards accurately reflect quality writing very often?


** On SIYE it was a given for years that at least one of the bi-monthly contest awards would be won by one of the mods, who wrote an insipid series of self inserts. And, generally speaking, if you didn't pen their particular brand of fluff (with a couple exceptions), you were frozen out of any awards.

Fanfiction awards are really nothing to put much stock in.

*** I'd agree with your comments about SIYE.

There are certain writers on SIYE that you know will win the award if they have a qualifying story. There were also writers who only wrote stories for challenges and won every time. Most the authors who wrote challenging fics have either moved out of fanfic or moved to other fandoms.

*** yeah, to be honest not expecting much. I've just gone through about everything out there on fanfiction.net and siye that I'm just trying see if anything is worthwhile on any other sites, but as you said, I can't put much stock into these awards.

Weird how almost every person who says that has written a decent fic that never got nominated for an award.

**** Meh, one of my stories did manage to win a couple of awards there, largely because several of the "regulars" opted not to play that month. It was a hollow victory, to say the least.

** As someone who has won a few of these fanfic awards I have to admit they did a good job of stroking my ego. But I am well aware that they come from niche sites and so there wasn't a lot of competition, particularly my Mugglenet ones. I do not at all think it means anything more than a compliment. Some of them also came with some really helpful feedback.

I now use them in my summaries to try and attract more traffic because I'm shameless like that.

*** Got banned from the site for two weeks for having a different political opinion from someone, and clearly a moderator. When I was banned for "Ad-Hominem" despite literally being called a shit-head, and a retard, for my personal beliefs. I immediately message the site at the 'contact us' link, tell them that they're banning me on no grounds. I get a simple two sentences in response after the two weeks, I didn't reply, simply shrugged and didn't really go on the site after that. I come to find when I type in the site's URL, that I'm permabanned with no reasoning being given. LOL. The funny thing is, I was on the politics section itself, where having a different opinion was supposed to be okay. But if you actively support Trump, you are insta-banned?

** I find that winning an award means very little in this fandom (and to be honest, most fandoms) in regards to quality... it might be better off finding an author that you like via recs or what have you and then looking to see if the authors have any favourites listed etc.

** ultimatehpfanfiction.com has a good collection of fics, some long gone from other sites. Not all there is good and the layout takes time to get used to but you can find some real gems there.
