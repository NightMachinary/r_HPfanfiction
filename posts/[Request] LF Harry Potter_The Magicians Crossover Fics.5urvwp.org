Since there are fanfictions depicting Harry Potter crossing-over with Percy Jackson, I was wondering if there was one where he met the students of Brakebills (or attended it himself), or maybe ended up in Fillory?


** Not really. There are a few new stories but they only have a chapter or two, which is a shame as I think the crossover would be very interesting.
