Im so bored and I'm looking for some amazing OC female novel-length fanfictions to read during Winter break.

1. Preference pairing: Draco Malfoy x OC//Harry Potter x OC. (I'm also okay with other HP Characters x OC, as long as the xOC)

2. Please don't be Dark. Bonus points if it's a happy-ending story

3. Reading platform: mainly on fanfic.net, tumblr, ao3, wattpad. (If you have any, please recommend as well)

4. I've read To Be A Slytherin and The Diary of an Orphan. And I LOVED IT. Hopefully y'all can recommend something like that. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤©

5. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I don't like waiting for the fics to finish. So please recommend those that are already completed.

Thanks ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜šðŸ’–


** Green Eyed Monster on fanfiction.net by Sphinx-legend. To Be A Slytherin actually plagiarized a lot of GEM so I'd recommend reading GEM

** I could recommend mine, if you like. :) It's Draco/OC. Has dark moments, but plenty of light to balance it out.

** My Snape/OC is very light-handed, the onscreen action is mostly chats over tea. It's different to any other fic I've seen out there.

  Mess with power and you get what you deserve. Bilia Stevens had nothing left to lose when she took the wand, stone and cloak, so if she could meddle with time and space and gain eternal protection from death, why wouldn't she?"Send me where I can do the Wizarding World the most good," she said, as a sop to Fate, but it was Death that laughed in her ears as she tumbled into the nasty little bedroom of a nasty little man.Well, Bilia Stevens wasn't all that nice herself, if it came to it.

** I'll shamelessly plug my own fic, Valkyrie. It's not super long yet, but I do plan for it to be quite lengthy and I'll be updating regularly. I haven't added any relationship tags because where's the fun in that? But my OC will develop a relationship with an age-appropriate male canon character (she's thirty) later on in the story.

I don't do sad endings, but there might be sad bits in the middle.

  What would you do if you were suddenly transported into a storybook world, one where you have all the answers? This is the decision Lorelei Smith has to make when she goes from certain death to being unceremoniously dumped in the world of Harry Potter. Try as she might, this new world doesn't feel quite real to her, and the temptation to play with fate is overwhelming. If this is a dream, then that makes her God, doesn't it? Despite her uncertain grasp on reality, real lives hang in the balance. One woman and her dog have the power to turn the world on its head... for good or for ill.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is technically Harry, but such a different Harry as to effectively be an original character (which is justified, as she was raised by both her parents in a society that didn't fight a war against Voldemort, but instead faced a political campaign of discrimination). It's actually quite a bit longer than novel-length; the fourth book alone is nearly half a million words (and has one chapter left to go).

1. There's no pairing as yet, but Draco would like to be considered as an option for Harry, as would another original character, Leo (admittedly not /entirely/ original, as he's inspired by George from the Song of the Lioness, but he's not a carbon-copy).
2. Judging by the four (well, three + 95% of a fourth) books that have been written thus far, it will have a happy ending. There are certainly tense scenes (like the climax of book three), but it's not a horror story.
3. The main series is on FFN. I do also like to recommend a spin-off series that diverges in fourth year, and is hosted on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1722145]]
4. I haven't read those two stories, but this Harry is sorted into Slytherin (and belongs there; unlike Crabbe and Goyle and even the canonical Draco, this Harry really does show clear goals and a willingness to make sacrifices in order to achieve them).

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
