I remember reading a fic awhile back where Lily was the daughter of the Roman Empress, making Harry the heir to the Roman Empire, I honestly don't remember much about the story but any help is appreciated


** Currently on mobile, so I can't properly link, but was it either Dominus Mundi or King of Kings, Ruling over Rulers?

****** Honestly, no. I kinda lost the will to continue writing that story, especially since more new ideas came up and I gradually became uninterested in continuing to my old stories.

** Sorry for the off-topic. I don't know the name of the story but what's the point in being heir of something that no longer exists?

*** From what I remember of the story, apparently the magical side of the Roman Empire is still around, I don't really remember any details
