I've recently read a story in which Harry had to pay damages and restitution for his part in the Gringotts break-in and his escape with the dragon. He ended up carrying what remained of his wealth with him, because he didn't want to keep doing business with the goblins, as strained as relations were.

That was only a small side-topic of the larger tale, but it got me thinking. Are there any stories where this is more central to the plot? Where Harry has to deal with the only financial institute of magical Britain not being available to him? Where Harry makes a virtue of necessity and possibly not only muddles through it but turns things around on the goblins in the end?

Anything that fits the general topic is fine. Thanks for your suggestions!

** What We Lost linkffn(12952598)

Fairly minor. Harry basically doesn't care that Gringotts has blacklisted him. Eventually however, people start to realize Harry Potter, The Chosen One, The Man Who Conquered, does not business with Gringotts. Is there something wrong with the bank? Should they look for alternatives as well? Gringotts unfreeze his assets and politely ask Harry to make a statement that everything is fine.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

**** the film had the sword disappearing in that same scene in the film but he had run of into the depths of the bank with it. always thought the films implied that the death eaters cleared the whole place out looking for him. it'd be the same way he attacked hogwarts.

The goblins of Gringotts are the main antagonist of the fic until about halfway through, when Harry gets the heck out of Britain after being captured and tortured by them.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

** I remember a fic I read long ago I think it was Haphne story. Where Harry tried find some book about Dragon taming written by Merlin or some artifact. He reads lots books in muggle university. He goes on lots of adventures, fights a thunderbird and his magic gets wonky. Hermione uses Elder Wand to fix Harry magic just like he fixed his holly wand. I don't remember it's name.

** Strange Reflections has Harry and all other Potters have to declare that they are not there to rob or attack the bank every time they enter. Also I forgot who but someone had a snippet where the goblins tried to have him arrested thinking he would bargain with them like a politician. Instead Harry attacks them head on.
