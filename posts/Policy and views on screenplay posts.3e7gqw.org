Hello! I want to know what the subreddit policy and peoples' views are generally about posts or links to fics or stories that are in a screenplay format. I have worked on a screenplay version of the Marauders with some OCs and original scenes. Could I link to it here?

Thanks!


** I don't think there's any rules against linking it, but I'm fairly certain that the fandom has a dim view of screenplay posts. I can't know for sure, but I don't like it.
