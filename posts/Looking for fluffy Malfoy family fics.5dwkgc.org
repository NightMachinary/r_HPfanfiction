Pretty much as the title implies--daily life Malfoys (bonus points if Snape is present at some point as well)

I'm a huge fan of the Malfoys so I'll take any recommendations.\\
No Lucius bashing/abuse though.

Thanks in advance!

It's technically a dramione but the Malfoy (fluffy) family relations are an important part of it. As is Snape. Over the top at times, the Ginny bashing can get grating, but a feelgood fic nonetheless.

** This is a short self-rec of Lucius & Narcissa after Draco is born; I've not got anything else to link because the few fics I have done are focused on Lucius, so they're not very fluffy.

I'm afraid I haven't got much else to rec, because good characterisation of one of the Malfoys is patchy at best, let alone both at once.

*** I'm interested in any Lucius fics if you have any recs of those as well.

Thanks for the link!

**** Hmm, well, I've got a vaguely fluffy thing which is Draco, Lucius and Scorpius post-war; linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3418655]])

And then I've got one called Birth Of A Viper, which is a kind of origin story. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4000972]])

Aaand depending on how much you like the Lucius&Severus friendship, I've got a piece with Lucius at his grave post-war. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4236531]])

And if you haven't seen the artwork of Makani, even though you are looking for fanfic, I totally recommend looking them up. I LOVE Makani's particular interpretation of the Malfoy clan. Link is here: [[http://makanidotdot.tumblr.com/tagged/harry-potter]]

For example: [[http://makanidotdot.tumblr.com/post/10809702322/what-draco-what-hi-huehuehueheu]] is the cutest damn thing that's ever existed.

***** I am so excited right now! These look perfect!

And I've seen a few pieces of that fan art on Pinterest but am thrilled to have the source!

Thank you!!

  Wow. I did a Lucius Malfoy origin story. It's about 5k, and warnings for basically everything including abuse, parental death (technical patricide), sexual references, being a horrible person and so on.This is the origin story in play on my Lucius Malfoy RP blog.
