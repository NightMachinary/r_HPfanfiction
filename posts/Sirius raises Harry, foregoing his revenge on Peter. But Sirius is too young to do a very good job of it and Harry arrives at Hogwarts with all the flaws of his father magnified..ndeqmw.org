Harry shows up at school very much the little prince proving Dumbledore's canonical trepidation of fame from a young age entirely valid.


** Sirius doesn't do a very good job. But it has nothing to do with youth. He remembers how his own parents brought him up, and regulus. He decided to do the exact opposite of what they did.

As a result, Harry arrives just as messed up as Sirius did, but in a different direction. All extremes are bad.

** So he's somewhat spoiled, self-confident, intelligent, loyal, mischief-making? He 'bullies' racists? Because honestly I don't like all these "ACTUALLY JAMES WAS THE DEVIL" tropes that pop up.

*** Yeah Harry growing up to be more like James wouldn't be a bad thing , James had more good qualities then bad ones not to mention most of his bad ones are from one single memory of the person who hated him most which shows him in the worst light possible in one instant. If Harry died and had a child, Malfoy could show the memory of Harry almost killing him and easily make him look more bad then good in one instant.

**** It's not just that instant. It's also canonical that Lily hated James for the first 6 years of Hogwarts because he was such an asshat. He obviously got a lot better, but it's not just "lol Snape says so"

*** Its worth noting that even McGonagall who had no problems shit talking dead peter when she believed he was a hero was openly sad about James and lily's death.

Its worth noting that James potter accepted Remus as a werewolf which I imagine would be a rare thing as a wizard

And that's why I specified that his flaws are magnified.

Yes James gets a bad wrap because is the prevalence of WBHL stories and Snape apologists, but James wasn't a saint either. He was complex and changing even in the few snapshots we have of him. I'm asking for a story where Harry is raised by a man blinded to that complexity by regret, guilt and friendship.

**** But Sirius was aware of James's faults. He's snappy with Snape still, but Sirius was unjustly locked up for 10 plus years in prison while Snape, a marked inner death eater, had a job, a warm place to sleep, and got off....so it's not a surprise he's bitter towards him. Basically, Sirius was thrown into the equivalent of Guantanmo Bay while a real terrorist got off scott free just because he flipped after a few years.

Sirius being rightfully bitter towards Snape doesn't mean he wasn't aware that he and the Marauders could be bullies and that he fucked up towards Snape.

That said, I do think a "Sirius means well and tries but does a somewhat shitty job of raising Harry" could work. Sirius was aware James could be arrogant and I could Sirius making sure Harry wasn't arrogant, but I could see Sirius-who was young and probably traumatized as fuck-having too many women around, drinking too much, not watching his language around Harry so I could see a kind of foul mouthed, trouble maker kind of kid who was raised by a succession of random women being an interesting take in a fan fic.

***** That I can see (and like) - it was the automatic assumption that "Harry is like James THAT'S BAD" that I couldn't run with. Sirius tries his best but it would really be believable that Harry doesn't get the most stable upbringing with him. Maybe he leaves Harry's essential care too much to Kreacher, resulting in a Harry who is used to having house-elf magic take care of mundane realities? The bit about women rotating in and out of Harry's life is especially interesting.

** And this is worse than the abusive childhood he had?

Like there probably were a reason both Lily and James chose him above other pepole and i can see this Harry being way diffrent than the canon one, but a prince i doubt. He would know where his fame came from and the cost of it

*** Not sure where I implied any of that. All I referred to was Dumbledore's concern for the effects of fame, not any of his other actions/inactions regarding Harry.

Also I did stipulate a version of Sirius who /wasn't/ capable of raising a child, so your doubt isn't relevant to the request.
