For example, I can't stand any form of Severitis - whether Snape's the secret father of Harry, the mentor, anything.

(All opinions are welcome. Yes, even if they're controversial, like my own.)

Edit: Just found out it's Severit-U-s, not Severit-I-s.


** Hmm, let's see. The top five that come to mind for me are:

1. Poor spelling, grammar, or formatting.

2. Excessive canon rehashing. I can actually tolerate quite a bit of rehashing, but if the story goes out of its way to keep things the same that would logically change. The worst offender is having the opportunity to dramatically change the DoM fight, but still having Sirius die in the exact same way.

3. Wrong Boy-Who-Lived. I don't know what it is about this trope, but every time I see it in the summary, it sounds like the most boring story imaginable to me for no reason--and that's before you get to the extreme-OOC James and Lily.

4. Infantilizing Harry. This is most common in Severitis fics. I know the more common complaint is that young characters sound too mature, but Harry always seems to wind up sounding half his age in these stories.

5. If I actually get past the first chapter, I've found that the most common thing that makes me click away is, "It got weird." I can't really explain what constitutes "weird" or give an example. It's that something happens, or there's a plot twist that feels "wrong" to me, and I'm out.

*** There was this one really cool story (Barefoot?) about how Harry had this power where he kind of absorbs the memories/history of any object he touches. It was very interesting, but I kind of lost interest once Harry became OP emo Harry, and then things started getting sexual. I didn't read that far, but I think he winds up getting a Harem and Hedwig turns into a human girl... and also becomes a part of the harem, I think. It was one of the most dramatic declines of my interest in a story I have ever experienced.

If you just read until it gets weird, though, it's still a pretty good story.

**** That's what's so strange about it, though, because I actually /didn't/ have that reaction to Barefoot.

It's hard to think of an example because the fics I don't read are much less memorable than the ones I do, but I went through the recently-updated fics and found linkffn(11894165), which I'll use just because it's the highest-rated example of what I'm talking about. It got weird for me when Hermione and Draco wound up accidentally soul-bonded (if by another name), and I couldn't keep reading. And I know that sounds hypocritical because I just wrote an accidental soul bond (by another name) myself in /Lady Archmiedes/, but I just couldn't take it in this one.

To be fair, I was afraid the incident in /Lady Archimedes/ would be poorly received for precisely that reason, but that turned out not to be the case. I like to think that I set it up better, whereas in /The Eagle's Nest/, it came completely out of left field. Plus, while I sometimes read Dramione, I have a much lower tolerance for it than other pairings, which probably contributed.

I could apply this to other tropes, too. I think it's not the particular trope, but subtle differences in how it's used that make it work in one fic while another crashes and burns.

**** I still follow /Barefoot/, and... I see why you'd think that way, but /Barefoot/ kinda skirts the line on both accounts. He never gets a true harem, though at one point he considers polyamory with the Human!Hedwig and Tonks. And things get "sexualish", but there never is any full-blown smut. Point is, yes, it got weird, but it didn't take over the story (the current arc is a very neat Azkaban one) and didn't get /too/ off-the-mark.

After reading this story that has evil Dumbledore done well, I can't read any other fics where he is evil without comparing the 2 and being sadly disappointed.

All that to say, if you are going to defame a character do a good job of it.

Also it is possible to make any character a villain if you do it well.

** Things that will make me leave a fic instantly

1.  Poor sentence/paragraph structure and/or text that is essentially all dialogue with no prose (as I am not a fan of screenplays).

2.  Bad magic. As in magic by physics or science, immature, poorly thought out.

3.  Bashing, for obvious reasons.

4.  Ultra-perfect-genius-goddess Hermione.

5.  Whiny bitch Harry.

6.  Shit Rons.

7.  Any fic that has a Harry yells at Dumbledore for wanting to sacrifice Harry and cast everything aside but also has any of the following: Harry being equally willing to cast morality aside, Dumbledore and the Order being unwilling to kill a bitch (recall /DH/), people behaving as if an eleven year old throwing a temper tantrum is a great example or moment that opens their eyes.

8.  "Prongslet." Because as we all know, the proper term for the child of a stag is calf.

9.  "Marauder names" that don't poke fun at the person it applies to.

10. More annoying than entertaining. This is One Metric to rule them all, One Metric to find them, One Metric to bring them all, and in the reading bind them. I will violate any of the above points if I am sufficiently entertained.

** For me it's usually horrible writing style. I understand that like 99.99999% of fanfic authors aren't professional writers and I cant hold them to that standard. But if a fic reads like an 11 year old wrote it then I'm out.

Being stupidly over powered with no reason, if it's a time travel/soul going back in time fic and the character is over powered then sure it's probably reasonable, but if it's a normal fic and harry is throwing up wards and stunning people on his first train trip to Hogwarts then I'm out.

Rehashing the books. Making harry a girl but repeating the books word for word other than changing names and pronouns is not a fic, it's just stupid.

Strong OOC without a reason really gets me. It's a magical world, come up with a reason for Snape to suddenly be not an asshole, or for Tonks to fall in love with Harry. Damn love potion or a spell or something, you can do lots with a magical world at your fingertips so just throw in a few paragraphs to explain your weird OOC!

An over crowded plot really annoys me. Make a good plot with a few sub plots and it will keep everyone interested, but if you have 3 or 4 main plots going on with 30 subplots all at one time then it's just to much going on, it's not realistic!

Climbing up on a soapbox and preaching your ideas and views. I come to fanfic to escape my world for a while and relax, I don't need weird psudoscience or politics messing that up! I'm looking at you rational thought fic I can't remember the name of!

I wonder how well he would have done without copying from Hermione all the time.

But you're right, the Twins are very clever, it just stretches belief that an 11 year old would fall for that. Or that he believes he would have to wrestle a troll. I'd expect your average 7-8 year old to find all of that a little dubious... in particular since the twins have a history of pulling pranks.

But I have a bit more in my sack of "Ron is really kind of dumb" examples. What about the Triwizard? How dumb do you have to be to genuinely believe Harry would have entered himself in the tournament and then lie about it to his best friends? That's the most charitable interpretation of Ron's character here. Because if he didn't actually believe that he's just a spiteful little fuck.

I don't really understand how that's any more charitable? How does believing that Harry would enter himself and - even more ridiculous - then lie about it not make Ron a giant idiot? It's completely out of character for Harry. Ron knows this.

Those are marvellous rationalisations, which I don't agree on at all (Ron has older brothers, who are adults and surely cast some spells when they came home after 6th/7th year)... but even if I accept such rationalisations Ron is still a huge idiot for casting a spell, that he doesn't even know he can cast, without testing it beforehand and without knowing that it is even a real spell in front of his would be friends in order to impress them. Compare that to Hermione, who cast a spell that she found in an actual book and actually tried to cast before. That's like basic common sense. If I were an observer to that scene in the compartment I'd have wondered if Ron is a special needs kid.

That's an amazing recipe to set yourself up for failure. Remember, this is the guy who can't even get Wingardium Leviosa right because he's too dumb to pronounce it correctly and gets mad when someone exposes his stupidity (which is also dumb, because then you will stay dumb because people won't tell you that you're wrong anymore).

** Too many damn things to name, really. I mean I won't read slash, mpreg, bashing, you have be able to write decently. Good detail, logical emotions.

I really hate authors dumbing characters down to make one character in particular appear smart. This happens a lot in Luna fics. Everyone around Luna is an idiot and their #1 response is "What?" and to stare blankly at her.

like if the topic of a conversation is which truck someone should buy and Luna comes along and says "Ford" - everyone around looks at her as if her response is so brilliant that is needs additional explaining.

I really hate emotional harry. He doesn't scream often in canon, yet some fanfic authors make screaming his #1 reaction to everything. !Evil characters which fall into the bashing category. Everyone wants to make Dumbledore the villain but they can't write a decent villain to save their lives.

99% of Gringotts scenes. I do not give a damn about anyone's will. Not anymore. I do not give a damn that Harry's "core" is "65% Blocked" (Like WTF?!) or that you want to give him every ability under the sun that he will NEVER USE. I'm sick and tired of helpful goblins, dumb adults, and fanfic authors thinking that everything that Harry does is "cunning" and have other characters stare at his god-like cunning in absolute amazement like "OMG! Such cunning,. Much Slytherin!".

While I agree that a raging Harry is no fun, having him show some emotion isn't bad. To use an example from one of my stories, if Harry get's a family, then it's ok when there's a scene dealing with homesickness and probably Harry's confusion about the entire thing because he never had someplace besides Hogwarts to be homesick about. But at the same time, it should be used with caution, since having every other scene deal with a mopey Harry isn't good either. I feel like most authors are too quick in resorting to extremes. A little moderation would be good.

For example, Ron was an arse to Hermione around the Yule Ball. Having Hermione hold that against him (she can hold a grudge for a looooong time, just ask Crouch Sr) makes it a realistic portrayal of her character. Hell, it could end their friendship permanently. But having Ron join the Death Eaters because he wants to "put that Mudblood back in her place" is just pointless bashing.

** The biggest one for me is sexism. It suggests to me right off the bat that I'm not going to be interested in where the author's taking this story or characters because it's a base level disrespect to your setting and characters.

So any one of female characters being 1) weepy and useless, 2) self-sacrificing to the point of absurdity, diminishing themselves and their own skills, 3) happy to let super!Harry talk down to them (bad enough when it's say Hermione, /unforgivable/ when it's an older adult like McGonagall or Augusta Longbottom), 4) obviously there to be a pair of boobs with blink-and-you'll-miss-it characterization and a blonde/brunette/redhead/pink wig depending on whether she's Fleur, Hermione, Ginny or Tonks.

Beyond the dullness of it, it just breaks any sense of realism for me; in my several decades on this planet I've never met a girl or woman who would happily behave in those ways and let herself be treated like that, and who would legitimately have /no/ desires of her own whatsoever. Let alone one of the strong-minded female characters from the books behaving like that. The only character I could /just about/ see it from is the much-maligned Pansy Parkinson, who for some reason doesn't seem to be a popular character in fics.

EDIT: It says a lot about how the fanfiction community's changed in this last 10-15 years that this post has had fluctuating up and downvotes. I find that interesting, personally. I'll have to look and see if there are any studies into that kind of thing.

*** A caveat to that: sexist behavior has been fading for the last hundred years, but if you rewind 20-30 years /and/ feature an isolationed, explicitly-outdated society, a bit of in-universe sexism is not out of place, even if it's frowned upon by the audience.

Sexism on a meta level (within the narration or the plot, and not explicitly associated with one sexist character) is, quite obviously, not acceptable. The distinction is the first is a character in a historical context being a bastard within universe (which doesn't reflect the author's opinion), while the other is the author himself being a bastard to his audience. The distinction is critical, for it makes the difference between a good story with vile characters and a vile story.

Regardless, it's best to not be sexist at all. Most fanfic authors don't have the skill to avoid being an asshole, so it's best that they just treate people like people, regardless of gender.

As an H/Hr shipper I really hate 98% of that fanfiction, there is so much wrong with it. Someone else pointed this out by when they make Hermione more important to Harry than Ron is, or when Hermione doesn't seem to care about Ron.

They always make Hermione into some smart pretty girl, when in reality Hermione is a bossy, pushy, she is stubborn, she isn't sympathetic, etc.

They like to make Ginny into a whore, or Ron way too stupid. Ginny is not that, and Ron isn't stupid.

You don't have to have a DBZ-style "the Big Bad is going to destroy the planet!!1!" conflict to have a conflict.

What about a post-war fic where a now-insanely-powerful Harry has to deal with the aftermath of the war---how relationships have changed, dealing with loss, finding a routine that doesn't prod at his nerves or PTSD?

How about a fic where the /people/ are the conflict rather than some murderer or combat? What if post-war, things just didn't change? Muggleborn are still treated poorly and roughly shoved into the magical world; werewolves are still mistreated, and many murderers are still not in Azkaban. Being able to vanish the entirety of Hogwarts with a flick of your wrist wouldn't solve any of that.

** The fic has to be well-written technically for me to even bother trying. Aside from that:

1. I HATE cafe/highschool/college/generic modern life/some other popular series (Avengers?) AUs. It just screams "I have no imagination" and/or "I'm trying to write therapy in the form of fic, Harry = me".

2. By the same token I can't stomach "reader", "imagines", self-inserts or mary sues. Basically anywhere the author isn't trying to explore the characters but is just using them as a convenient screen for their own (usually extremely boring) issues.

3. Don't like fics where favourite character (often Harry) has special powers or heritage or is a veela or a half-mermaid or whatever (unless it's REALLY imaginative and well-explored). Or where the kids are on-par with the adults, or adults are treated as stupid.

4. Characters that are unrecognizable -- either bashing them so they're vile when in the books they are clearly decent people, or making them into a saint because they're the author's favourite even if they're a raging dick in the books.

5. Also seconding the hate for Severitis. I very rarely like Snape as the focus in fics because 75% of the time he's unrecognizable and so is everyone else, in order to make him the hero.

** Lupin, Snape or Malfoy in a prominent role: The first ran from his pregnant wife and never gave a fuck about Harry, Snape was a thoroughly shitty human being and Malfoy was a spoiled brat. Not even a spoiled brat who's a credible threat like Joffrey "Baratheon", just a whiny guy who is little more than comic relief.

The happy Weasley family. I have a personal experience with bad family, and let me tell you, adults who say that they will help you, are concerned and all that crap, and yet do nothing are pretty much the worst that can happen to you. And Molly does just that to Harry. In CoS she says that she has her suspicions about the Dursleys, and yet never calls the cops/DMLE. It is definitely a personal thing, but for this reason I can't stand any story where Molly is Harry's honorary mother. Sending food is not a proper response to child abuse.

Postwar stories where the pureblood supremacists haven't been purged from the Ministry. You won the war, you make the rules. Hermione should know that the only way to defeat fascism is through total defeat and a massively restructured government. And Hermione would tell Harry, who just defeated Voldemort in a 1vs1.

A close to canon Battle of Hogwarts. A frontal assault against a fortified hilltop position with several hundred yards of open ground all around should not work. In fact it would be like shooting fish in a barrel for the defenders.

Horcrux hunts where they think that Horcruxes make Voldemort invulnerable. His body dies just as easily as without them and it would be a lot easier to deal with Horcruxes without the magical Gestapo running around.

*** Ugh. Any fic that places Lupin in a fatherly role with Harry drives me crazy.

- He disappeared from Harry's life until he was 13 and returned because of Sirius.
- He threw the death of James/Lily in Harry's face to shame him for his lack of safety while hiding the fact that Sirius was an animagus and knew multiple secret entrances into the school.
- He disappeared again after PoA, not even showing interest when Harry was entered into an extremely dangerous tournament. There's something wrong with a guy on the run being able to keep in touch when Lupin can't bother.
- He doesn't show special interest after Sirius' death either. There's a line in HBP about Harry had hoped Lupin would write to him but he never did.
- He used Harry's parents again to try to justify leaving his own child and lashed out when Harry rightfully called him out for being a coward.

Lupin was not a father figure to Harry. He was seemingly uninterested in Harry the majority of the time. It bothers me seeing him in this role like he's at all fit for it. I especially hate when it's a story where Sirius is really the guardian but Remus is presented as the better and more mature person who hangs around so Sirius doesn't screw things up. Really?!!!

You seem to confuse "prominent role" with "positive light". What's wrong with having a properly characterized Snape as an antagonist, or using Draco to his intended potential as a bungling villain comic relief?

**** Because I find neither interesting. Malfoy's best moment was getting face punched by Hermione. I mean, sure, you can crack a few jokes of him being more than friends with Crabbe and Goyle or throw some shade at Darry, but that stops being funny at a certain point. He is not funny enough to be the comic relief and not dangerous enough to be a credible threat. He is a little shit like Joffrey "Baratheon", but he doesn't have the same amount of nearly absolute power behind him. Draco is pretty much the boring tutorial boss where you show that you understand the controls of the game.

Snape is an annoyance at best. He is an arse, an awful teacher and a horrible human being, but what's the worst that he'll do, give you detention? Unless you write him as an outright Death Eater who turns his coat once more, he is not really dangerous. He is not bad enough to warrant a stunner from under the invisibility cloak followed up with a late night visit to Aragog like Umbridge. Some people see him as conflicted, tragic character. He's pretty much the guy who gets shot down by a Jewish girl after a racial slur and then signs up for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen][Einsatzgruppen]] in revenge.

And Lupin is a walking pity party. Sure, being a werewolf isn't easy, but it's still far better than growing up in a cupboard after watching your parents getting murdered.

Tl;dr: I find these characters boring and they fit neither as comic relief nor credible villain (With the exception of "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!")

And let's take a look at his redemption, shall we. He was an atrocious teacher who fucked over an entire generation by depriving them of Aurors, Healers and whatever else profession needs a NEWT in potions. His teaching methods were so bad that he became Neville's boggart. Not Bellatrix Lestrange, who turned his parents into vegetables, but his teacher. He also nearly got several people mauled by a werewolf because he didn't take the Wolfsbane, which he just brought to his office, to Lupin. His occlumancy lessons were nothing but torture without instruction and his one redeeming deed was a mail delivery. That does not lool very redeeming to me.

  Lupin, Snape or Malfoy in a prominent role: The first ran from his pregnant wife and never gave a fuck about Harry, Snape was a thoroughly shitty human being and Malfoy was a spoiled brat.

#+end_quote

These are all true in the canon. Lupin is an inconsistent character who JKR doesn't put much thought into. Snape, for all his complications, is a vile person that relentlessly bullies small children, and is a god-awful teacher. Malfoy is a boring, imbecilic turd without the tiniest redeeming factor, and remains so until the epilogue, where he is present for no other reason that I can see, other than to show that the trio (other than Ron, who is still, unaccountably, a git) have moved on from their schoolchild rivalries.

I don't see that this means that fanfics have to preserve these characterizations. Lupin has potential as a good-person-with-a-furry-problem if you don't make him make the same ill-conceived decisions as in canon, and/or give him credible excuses when he does (having Lupin be out of contact with Harry prior to 3rd year in particular is forgivable if he's manipulated by Dumbledore). Snape can't believably do a 180 and become a wonderful person, but if you change his choices, especially during Harry's 1st year, you can make good-ish!Snape work. Malfoy isn't much of a character to begin with, and he's so shaped by his choices and interactions during his 7 years at Hogwarts that you can do basically anything to him and find some way to justify the personality shift.

***** JKR characterizes Lupin as a caring, sensible person whose lycanthropy has forced him to develop a great sense of restraint and caution, but which doesn't lead him to act particularly distant, save for his omission of his role in Harry's parents' lives at the beginning of Harry's 3rd year, which did not prevent him from being a good professor to Harry. This is the case when he is in the picture, and aside from his behavior as regards Tonks and, later, his unborn child, never changes.

When he's not in the picture, i.e. when JKR forgets that he exists because he's not Sirius, he becomes a hidden, faraway figure that doesn't care enough about Harry to so much as check up on him during the Triwizard Tournament. Before Harry's 3rd year, he doesn't even merit a mention, in contrast to Sirius, who gets a mention IIRC in the very first chapter of the Philosopher's Stone. Moony might as well have not been invented yet, and probably hadn't been.

His only major onscreen sin was to consider running from the responsibility of raising a child, and despite Harry's severe negative reaction, he had a damn good reason to be wary. He's not some deadbeat that wants to remain a bachelor without the albatross of a baby to look after, he's a man that, monthly, becomes a savage, uncontrollable beast with superhuman strength and agility. Those concerns may be easily addressed 99% of the time with simple precautions, but this is a man who has lived since childhood with a crippling terror that he would someday hurt someone, and who has once before, through a lapse in vigilance of entirely his own making, nearly done so.

** Bad grammar is the worst. It's one thing to not see minor issues in your own story (you're too in it, you don't have a beta, you rewrote something and forgot to amend something else) but having complete disregard for how basic sentence structure works is too far and makes it unreadable.

I hate the Luna stereotype, where she is nonsensical. I equally hate when she is all-knowing.

Extreme bashing is hard to read, even if it is Dumbledore, but especially when it's Ron or Ginny or whomever, it just makes me skip and if I skip parts too often in a story I'm out and I'll go look for another.

Time travel generally bugs me unless it's canon (POA) or makes sense in the grand scheme of things, and that's really the key to everything. A lot can be forgiven if it makes sense in the story and the writing is well done. The better the writing the more likely the tropes will feel less trope-y.

And last but not least, rambling author notes which possibly include replies to every single comment on the last chapter and your personal banter. Give me a note about the story or don't say anything! I did not do a search for a specific word count to find every other chapter (!) to be a letter to your friends. Sorry, I really don't care.

- Consistently bad writing: This is fanfiction, I'm fine with the occasional error or head-hopping, but if you prove to me that you really don't understand what 3rd person limited is or how a story works in the most basic terms I'm out.

- Canon rehash: I can deal with repeating some of the stations of canon, but the story can't revolve around the same mysteries. I already know that it's a Basilisk, that Sirius is innocent and that Moody is an impostor. These things can all be in a fic, but if they are the main focus/drive it turns me off. All bets are off in an AU/divergence fic: give me reason to belief that maybe it's the real Moody and we're cool.

- Also Fics that aren't AU, but have decidedly OOC characters without reason or explanation. Most notably with Draco and Snape. "Draco is secretly a really nice guy" just won't work after 6th year, arguably even earlier. Especially if it includes "Draco returns to Hogwarts for his NEWTs after the fall of Voldemort" - that's actually insane.

- Next gen fics. All the canon pairings are bad and the epilogue sucks ass. I have zero interest in any story that mentions Albus Severus Potter unironically.

- Creature fics. Just no.

- Personal quirks: I *hate* Romione so I avoid stories with that pairing like the plague. If it isn't tagged and they appear as anything except a very background couple I'll drop the fic immediately. Reading about their UST and how perfectly they compliment each other literally churns my stomach.

To me the these AUs plus ones like High School AUs, Cafe AUs and such are basically just the Author saying "here's the characters you love but I made them boring".

Butchering the characters names - no one is impressed by any one calling Voldemort "moldyshorts". Also Harry has a great name, please use it and stop calling him "Hadrian" when you want to make him fancy.

OOC - I don't mind a character being OOC if they have a reason to be that way, but most of the time they seem to just be OOC so they can make them cool and edgy.

OC - I've just had too many bad experiences with them being Mary Sue/Gary Stus.

Spelling, Grammar, wall of text and Lapslocks - That speaks for it's self.

Main character being OP - I think making the character OP just usually makes them boring, I want to see characters struggling and learning.

Implying that's a good thing. Harry is probably better off in a cupboard than becoming best buddies with Diarymort, being a pompous git at the ministry or *shudder* like Ron. Not to mention the twins who are just incredible amounts of wasted potential because they direct all their energies towards rebelling against their stifling mother.

The good parts of their family like Bill are probably elated to live as isolated as possible from the rest. "Hey everyone, this is my fiance Fleur whom I love very much!" "Flem!!!" "Yeah, go away you Veela tart!". Yeah no, being a Weasley is completely awesome. Maybe Harry can get some lessons from Molly on how to insult his godfather in his own house too.

Lord/Lady pureblood bullshit. My eyes roll out of my head and fall into the garbage disposal. Not really, because I still have eyes, but I find the style of writing in these types of fics to be difficult to read. I think my problem with fics using this trope is the Victorian-esque vibe that the writers are trying to create and I'm not sure it translates well to the Harry Potter world. I can be convinced otherwise but I really dislike the fic Contractual Invalidation which reminds me of this trope, but I understand that it's considered a gold standard fic.

Fics that feature sociopathic main characters. This includes the Art of Self-Fashioning, which I also understand is a well written fic. I worked some years ago as a therapist in a correctional facility and I find most fiction (fan fiction or otherwise) that feature characters like this to be triggering.

** Multi- compartment trunks: Nobody needs one, especially an eleven year old. This particularly hurts when the author makes it a portable house but then has Harry own several properties (just move into one of those). The only time thats acceptable is if Harry does a Newt Scamander and starts beast collecting.

Excessive titles: The wizengamot is equivalent to the Commons not the Lords and is elected. I get it authors want Harry to have cool titles, but make it something different, e.g. if I was writing and gave Harry a title, it would be 'Sir Peverell' for the Arthurian connection and have Master of Death, be something like defender of the faith. Sounds tropey but at least its different

You surprise me. Most people who have travelled before /dearly wish/ they had an infinite-size trunk to pack /all/ of their favorite stuff in, or even a portable house to avoid unfamiliar hotels and just be at home even when they're camping out in the jungles of Borneo.

My point is, the wish-fulfillment appeal that makes Dimensional Trunks so popular in fanfiction is evidence enough that, actually, a very large number of people /would/ love to own one.

What seems more reasonable to me if you want to avoid Dimensional Trunks --- and by all means do --- then make them what they are: incredibly expensive luxury items, of the sort that you either enchant yourself in your garage (which I think is what Moody did) or that you would have to spend half your Potter Fortune to get.

** 1) poor spelling, grammar, formatting. If I can't read it, I can't enjoy it.

2) changing canon(too much). If the premise of the story is a "what if this one thing was different", that I can live with. What I won't read is stories that go "what if this never happened? Genderswap, alternate ships, time travel, muggleborn high school AU". Just stop...

I do prefer complete canon compliance (excluding cursed child) but if it's written well I can still enjoy it.

3) Rushing the plot. If the story starts with someone waking up on September the first, and 3 paragraphs later they're in their new bed in their new house at hogwarts, talking to their new friends, there's a problem.

4) 'Mione.

Go to jail. Go directly to jail. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200

5) Lack of consistency/changing canon information (not the story, but background information). When an author doesn't take the time to check established lore/facts/knowledge /etc. This one can be the one that breaks a story for me, or it could just be a minor gripe I have with it.

For example, when I read a next-gen story where Victoire is only a year younger than Teddy instead of two. To be fair, we don't know Victoire's exact birth year, but it's a simple matter of counting backwards and examining the context of the epilogue to realize that she has to be at least two years younger. You could go further to say that two years is likely the real number, since a three year age difference is a bit much at that age.

But I digress, sometimes it's a minor issue, sometimes it's the author changing the way magic works.

6) Overly simplified or changer character personalities.

As an example, this is the main problem I had with Cursed Child, and why I ignore it when considering canon compliance. Harry grew up without a real family, so the notion that we would ever say what he did to his own son is unthinkable. Yes, people change as they grow up, but his unconditional love for his friends and new family would never leave him.

Also when they make Harry super powerful and give him a bunch of powers and he learns martial arts or some Shit and becomes a dragon animagus but then only uses one or basic spells. They could make these great battle scenes but nope it's one two simple spells and he wins doesn't use anything else that has been talked up the whole story. Also why is it always a damn katana that they pull out like come on. ( I actually like most of the powerful or godlike fics idk just something about a badass powerful Harry is cool as long as the author makes it work, by that I mean it's gotta keep me wondering about what's gonna happen next not just have me quit half way through because I know who he gets with and that he wins in depth imaginative battles help instead of just "Harry threw a couple stupifys dodged and repeated untill the enemy ran away" it's hard to find one like that though. )

** I love good Hermione/Snape fanfictions, but I HATE when authors mention him realizing she is "all grown up" (this, and curves in the right places, womanly figure, not a girl but a woman, etc.). You can't just force a romantic intrigue between a young character and an older one by making the old one realize the young isn't that young looking anymore, it's just gross. My favorite Snape/Hermione fics usually take place years after Hogwarts for this reason, or with some kind of time turner magic involved. Same for any other Hermione/older guy fics actually.

Oh, and I really hate when I find a decently long fic and find out that the romance starts in chapter 3. I want them to be friends first, then maybe something will develop... They've talked twice and suddenly they're in bed withe each other ? Come on. It's chapter 3, there's 40 chapters left, couldn't they have taken a bit more time ? I usually close the fic when it happens, unless the plot seems very very good and there's a great adventure-action story in these 40 remaining chapters.

If you are going to write HPFF, please for the love of JKR know what the spells do. Did you really just have someone cast silencio so the characters aren't overheard? Cause that's not how this works... There aren't all that many spells in canon, use them (and spell them) properly. And if you are going to create a new spell, don't give me some long ass description in the author's notes about the etymology of the spell. You should have just shown me what the spell does, I don't need an additional explanation.

If your author's notes are as long as the chapter, I will think hateful things.

•Things that are patently wrong in terms of cannon that they could have checked in the HP lexicon. I'll give it a pass if its information from Pottermore- like James's parents, but if it's something like the age of a Weasley or a plot point it annoys me. For example, I just read a fic where Hermione brings Sirius back from the dead because he owes her a life debt. Life debts can in the logic of the story bring back people who have not been struck with the Killing Curse. It's been a while since I've read the books, but I ertinly remember Sirius was hit with a Killing Curse before falling through the Veil, so I couldn't even continue the story.

•Also, since I read a lot of Marauders fics, I like it when people keep them consistent to the period.

I did reread the story when I came back to fanfiction and the nick name still didn't bother me in that particular story. But if muddled memory serves, it wasn't just a randomly picked. There was an actual discussion between characters as to how it came about, the reasoning behind it, and it even played into the story line some. Maybe because with the reasoning behind using the nickname it didn't come across as OOC or trite where as normally it seems like the author just decids that a character is going to suddenly be sweet.

A scene that ends before a character says it back, or expresses it in some other way (holding hands, hugging/cuddling, I can think of a few) is what I prefer.

It's also a personal thing because I feel awkward when I say "I love you." Even to my own father.
