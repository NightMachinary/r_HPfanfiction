Ronald Weasley sets off on a journey to combat his inner demons and achieve greatness , the stories his dad told him about Mad-Eye Moody caused his life goal to become an auror and a dueling champion .

I totally love this story, Quirrell is competent, Slytherin Ron who is focused and does his best not to be a lazy idiot, prodigious harry, I hope it keeps up in the same direction.

The best part is that the author realizes that Ron has so many undeveloped sides which he tries to show every chapter, I hope it keeps up.

AND NO BASHING OF COURSE.

Downsides : Grammar and Spelling mistakes, I hope the author fixes that.


** Gave it a read and it's a good story.

It does fall into the theme that only Malfoy, Crabb and Goyle hold any blood prejudice's and everyone else has none despite being raised by death eaters or death eater associates.

While I understand why authors want to give the character friends that arn't bigots, I would be interested to see more stories where the main character becomes friends with slytherins despite the bigotry.

This was a perfect opportunity. Unlike Harry, Ron is a pureblood and while not rich he is "genetically ok". We could see Nott, Blaise or Daphne actually express the views of their parents as Ron tried to convince them why it's wrong. Or they become friends at school despite their views and end up on opposite sides of the war.

Either way enjoyable story and thanks for reading my rant.

*** I don't really think that your solution is a true improvement it just adds angst and a different dimension that you need to juggle. Unless your fic is written with that in mind this concept is mostly a sidegrade .
