What the title says. She unfortunately took it down last year It used to be on harrypotterfanfiction.net and focuses on the romance between James Sirius Potter and Agatha Bennett


** Just so you know, LF stands for looking for, so you literally wrote looking for for it.

** Rule 6 is the most frequently broken rule on this sub, imo. If the author took it down, respect that.

*** While i do follow the rules, rule six is bullshit, once you post something to the internet it is no longer just yours. It belongs to all the people read and enjoyed. We are not obligated to stop reading and shareing a fanfic anymore than we are required to burn books that the author no longer likes.
