Preferably long stories 100k+ words. I have read some books where theystart of having him Harry Potter but then suddenly, within the first 20 pages or first year, see the need to hide the fact that he is Harry Potter. Suddenly he is someone else, and the Potter line is dead.

Are there any good stories where Harry Potter is a student of Beauxbaton, or have been? I quite like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2392328/1/We-In-Faith][We, in faith]] but it is discontinued.
