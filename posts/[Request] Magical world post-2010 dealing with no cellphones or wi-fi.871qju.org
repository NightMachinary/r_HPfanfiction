Honestly it would feel bizarre and cultish and I would likely conclude that my "friend" is lying to me and being a right shady bitch. Then I'd ask around to our mutual friends and see if they're being treated the same way. Then a parent would find out and questions would be asked and it would start to get really messy.

TL;DR: Is it necessary for a muggleborn to sever all ties to her muggle friends in order to avoid difficult, unanswerable questions? Is that a realistic decision to ask an 11 year old to make?

** One of the interesting things about the HP world's lack of technology is that it makes you consider how valuable said technology actually is.

Does anyone really believe, for example, that social media has made people happier than they used to be? Mental health issues in children/teens are on the up, and body image issues are crazy. The difference between the kids at school now compared to, say, 10-15 years ago is extreme, in terms of how obsessed everyone is about their appearance.

It seems to me that magic largely fulfils the useful parts of technology without carrying the life-altering baggage. For example, Floo and apparition mean that it's easy to keep in touch with friends and family and communicate with them instantly (not that this matters at Hogwarts, since all your friends live with you). But because they are essentially ways to allow you to communicate face to face, they don't have any of the problems that come with *constant* communication like social media (as opposed to communication on demand, which is what apparition/Floo is) -- the need to maintain a profile, the comparing of your life to others, the stress of constant availability and read receipts, cyber-bullying, FOMO, etc.

Another example: the intent-based nature of apparition also means that navigation for wizards is easy, so no need for Google Maps (arguably the greatest day to day quality of life improvement made by information technology).

What else is there? Camera phones mean that you always have a camera on you to take photo and video, as opposed to having to carry a separate camera. But magic has two solutions for that - space expansion charms meaning it's no problem to carry a camera around, or simply viewing memories directly.

On the entertainment front, wizarding culture seems to be a lot more about spending quality time with family and friends, going places, seeing the world, having adventures etc., rather than individuals having the resources to keep themselves occupied indefinitely on their own while shut inside their own house. While this comes with disadvantages, there's certainly an argument that the Muggle world has lost something that it used to have in terms of closeness of family relationships, social circles, contact with nature, etc.

It's somewhat ironic that the magical world, which defies and overrides natural law on a constant basis, is a lot more in touch with the natural world than the Muggle world, which relies on the natural order for the functioning of all its technology.

We Muggles are addicted to technologies that don't necessarily make us any happier in the deep, fulfilling sense, though they keep us entertained. Is binge watching a series on Netflix really more fulfilling and life-enhancing than spending several hours with family or friends in the kitchen, cooking together, then eating dinner, not rushed in front of the TV, but rather spending several hours over it, savouring the food, the company, and the conversation?

(In many ways, the lifestyle of British wizards is closer to the French than to British Muggles!)

*** Er, your conclusion says that "the kids would rapidly adapt, and be happier and healthier for it". And while the rest of your post makes a thorough argument for why they'd be happier, it fails to justify why kids would adapt so rapidly. Just because something is healthier than what you're used does necessarily not make it easy to switch from your old habits if you've had them long enough; consider healthy eating vs. junk food. Most people who routinely eat junk food intellectually "know" they should be eating more vegetables and such, but that doesn't stop them in practice. So what makes you think that the kids who've grown up on smartphones and such /would/ so easily adapt to their new and better life, rather than experience extreme withdrawal for what you precisely called an "addiction" earlier in the post?

  “What's the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart, we can just ask you.”

  Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?

  As a vast number of people have pointed out to me in the last twenty four hours (some of them related to me by ties of blood) Colin DID develop a photograph from his camera in 'Chamber of Secrets' (my previous answer stated that he never did so).

  Cameras, like radios (or, as the wizards call them 'wirelesses' -- they're always a bit behind the times when it comes to Muggle technology) do exist in the wizarding world (there's a radio in the Weasleys' kitchen and we know there are cameras because of the moving photographs you see everywhere). Wizards do not need electricity to make these things work; they function by magic, but in the case of such objects the wizards liked the Muggle invention enough to appropriate the idea without adding cumbersome plugs/batteries.

  I have an old notebook in which it says dev sol (potion) magic [indecipherable word] photos move. Adept as I am at interpreting my old scribbles, I can tell you that the original idea was that wizards would use a magical developing potion to make their photographs move.

  SO... as Colin's batteries can't work in Hogwarts, clearly his camera is running off the magical atmosphere and he is then developing his photographs in the magical potion that causes the figures therein to move. All of which goes to show that Colin has a lot more initiative than I ever realised.

Firstly, if you start questioning everything characters say about magic as unreliable, then we basically know nothing. You might as well do away with canon altogether at that point. It amounts to substituting the notion of canon correctness with "everyone has an opinion and there's no correct answer".

Secondly, JKR explicitly stated in interview that she uses Dumbledore and Hermione as authoritative voices to tell readers about the way magic and the magical world works:

Because, I just, one, she's a tremendous character for a lot of reasons for a writer, which also is she can carry exposition in a wonderful way because you just assume she read it in a book. If I need to tell the audience something...

  JKR: Absolutely right, I find that all the time in the book, if you need to tell your readers something just put it in her. There are only two characters that you can put it convincingly into their dialogue. One is Hermione, the other is Dumbledore. In both cases you accept, it's plausible that they have, well Dumbledore knows pretty much everything anyway, but that Hermione has read it somewhere. So, she's handy.

**** Ahh yes that, I had blocked that part from my mind because it was stupid.

Physics doesn't bloody work that way. If you change one of the fundamentals of physics, the world would work radically different. Lightning is an electrical charge. The human brain uses electricity to send signals. Turning off electricity is like turning off gravity: Sure you would float, but a lot of other things would break too.

Of course, you could say that it was just an overly simplified explanation by a child and the real reason is (insert overly complex magical explanation here). I could totally see setting something up that was intent based (magic interfering with items that are intended to be used to eavesdrop), or maybe 'general electronics don't work because magical signals cause random electrical surges that most electronics are not designed to handle.' The problem is, there are electronics out there designed to handle random electronic surges (EMP-Shielded), and simple designs (like radio) would NOT be effected.

This reminds me of the "Wildflower" (muggleborn) path in Magical Diary, where the love interest gets all pissed at the magical instructors doing the whole "magic and science don't mid" speal. Science isn't like magic, you can't have a world without science like you have a world without magic. Science is simply the orderly and rational investigation into natural phenomena.

***** Why do you think that it works via disrupting electrical current, or through any medium of physical interference? Magic is attuned enough to human concepts that:

- "Food" forms a part of the rules of transfiguration.
- A job position can be cursed.
- Squibs can see Hogwarts but Muggles can't, despite both not having any magic, the only distinction between the two being belonging to different social categories.
- The Fidelius can be cast on "secrets" specifically, not information generally.
- The Taboo can be cast on linguistic items.
- Numbers have magical significance.

It's perfectly possible for magic to interfere with electrical technology but not interfere with lightning and still be consistent, because the fact that one is technology whereas the other is a natural phenomena is the kind of human distinction that magic is perfectly comfortable making. It just requires a non-physicalist worldview, which clearly is appropriate for the magical world, it being concerned with the supernatural, which defies and overrules the rules of the natural, physical world.

My own view is that the physical phenomenon of electricity itself isn't blocked in some universal sense, but rather electrical items fail because they are symbolic of modernity - the pinnacle of the rejection of the mystical and magical. The objects are just thoroughly Muggle in nature and therefore cannot stand the magical environment of Hogwarts. It would not just be electronic items that failed at Hogwarts under this view, but rather, like Hermione states, all "substitutes for magic", including mechanical objects which can similarly be considered symbols of modernity. The objects' conceptual associations are what is relevant to whether or not they are incompatible with the magical nature of Hogwarts, not the physical means by which they work.

I believe I did leave the door open for 'intent' based magic. The problem with intent based magic is that it is ripe for Munchkinry.

Whose intent is it? The user, the original spellcaster, or some modern bellweather? The user would seem to be out, otherwise all it would take is one well-educated muggle-born student who understood the principals behind the technology to unravel the whole thing. The caster? Long dead and with outdated notions of modernness, that would seem to block pretty much all invention, not just imports from the magical world. Some modern bellweather? Like the headmaster tied to the wards? Seems then all you would have to do is convince the headmaster of their use?

Of course, you could personify magic and say there is some global sense of what is modern, but that opens so many potential problems...

To detail the problem, if all "substitutes for magic" were blocked, do quills stop working the instant someone creates a spell that auto-transcribes notes for you? Whose judgement is used?

Can't be the student, or it would be way to easy to game.

You could say it is the spell-caster, who had quills so they wouldn't be blocked by it, but then most modern technology is covering use-cases that are entirely different than anyone would have foreseen. It would seemingly be easy to circumvent.

It could be attached to a modern person (the headmaster). Still would be easy to circumvent though, just go through him.

If magic itself makes the judgement, then you can play all sorts of games with what it views as a substitute. Again, do the quills stop working as soon as a spell is invented?

Plus, you would imagine the process of 'magicifying' an object starts pretty simple: You take a car and make a simple change: Say zero gravity on it. The rest of the car would keep working under its existing model, what would happen if you take it to hogwarts? I'd imagine Author didn't go through every subsystem and meticulously remove anything muggle (well maybe, but still). So does all someone have to do is magically enchant an object with a basic spell for it to work? My laptop is magically closed unless i use a spell to open it. There, it is a magical object now :P

You're still assuming that magic has to be physically consistent or in some sense universal. A world where physical law is suspended is only vastly different if it is not suspended selectively.

The boulder example is also a poor one, because when an object is banished, the magic is all in the initial launching of the object, so of course the object then follows physical law afterwards, because there's no more magic in effect.

A more pertinent example would be a broom, which has a continuous flying Charm which does indeed continuously override physical law by allowing the broom to fly in defiance of said law. But it doesn't turn the entire universe's gravity off, nor does it turn off the gravity that means the rider rests on the broom, nor does it turn gravity off in the sense that it ceases to attempt to pull the broom downwards (you accelerate on a dive). Rather, the Charm simply makes the object fly regardless of gravity and the absence of thrust, correct aerodynamics, etc., in a very selective manner.

#+end_quote

Apparently I have been unclear, because I was very much not advocating "intent magic", which is one of my pet hates. It's far too subjective. In canon, to be truly successful with magic you have to study the theory - see Hermione, who reads magical theory and can therefore cast more advanced spells, and is able to pick spells up quicker, or Dumbledore and Voldemort, who are both praised for their academic ability and practical spellcasting as if they are one and the same. To me this indicates an objective system which must be studied, where knowledge, not subjective belief, is key.

Therefore, the answer to your question is "magic itself", but not by virtue of reference to some determining factor but rather because magic itself has complex rules which can be studied and learnt. Part of magical theory would cover the nature of magicalness as opposed to Muggleness, and this would in turn dictate which objects fail at Hogwarts. It is this interesting mix of objective and subjective which I believe gives the HP magic system its unique charm -- essentially, taking concepts which we Muggles can only conceive of in reference to the opinion of a subjective thinker or group of thinkers, and turning them into objective facts intrinsic to the universe. Notably this is not giving magic sentience. It is simply incorporating human concepts into the objective nature of the universe.

******** Ehh, but it is subjective. If magic determines what is "muggleish", and is somehow giving the exact result you would expect from society, that means its standards are tracking society somehow. Which is a loophole that could be exploited. Eventually it has to come back to the wizards/witches in society to make that determination, or what magic thinks is muggleish will differ from what the culture thinks is muggleish.

I have no problem with it not being universal, but it is the overly broad brush that bugs me. Science is nothing but a deep and intimate understanding of how the world works, and engineering the application of such. Many of the advances done by science are not things like electricity, but say, understanding how light works to craft lenses to make better telescopes. The power came from understanding, but nothing unique was created physically.

There are two ways to look at this, a low-level approach or a high-level approach:

If you take the low-level apporach, the problem is, any modification to how the underlying rules work would have deep and profound consequences. Ultraviolet light is simply light, even though we cannot see it. The fact we can produce it by running an electrical current through a diode is not really important, there are many natural sources that we can play with Ultraviolet light in as well. And most of the improvements we get from our understanding of how it works remains even if we are using those natural sources. If magic changed how that worked, even in isolated circumstances, there would be all sorts of physical consequences that would make no sense from a conceptual standpoint but make perfect sense from a scientific standpoint. (Such as animals who CAN see ultraviolet light having problems if magic changes the rules).

Now, I have read some series that DO take this approach, either from the start (Hell's Gate by David Weber does this), or added on after (The Pern Series strapped on a sci-fi background to an initially fantasy tale). HP obviously does not have the author research necessary to rely on this, and as you point out, it doesn't really fit with the universe.

A high level approach is easier: You can imagine an ease-dropping charm that makes it so anyone who is trying to listen in on a conversation gets static. The problem is, this doesn't really fit with the model of 'electricity doesn't work at Hogwarts'. If the charms are blocking behavior or intent, does do not cover all possible applications of the technology. Someone bringing recorders to say, record bird calls, wouldn't get caught up in magic targeting easedropping. You can imagine even the old can-and-string mics getting caught up in this.

This works out pretty nicely because you can imagine such spells stopping even magical methods that don't counter the defensive spell, it is simply that non-magical methods can never defeat it, while magical methods can work in magical counters to the defensive spells. But going this path /really/ doesn't block the usefulness of understanding the world around you, in fact, it probably makes it MORE valuable....

The only explanation that seems to fit is the one that [[/u/Krististrasza]] gave, which is that the common/easy cases are blocked by the magic, and everyone just assumes that it applies to all cases. But if you actually studied exactly what was happening, it wouldn't be that hard to get around....

Firstly, it does not follow logically that magic must be tracking society. The obvious alternative is that the rule determining Muggleness is fixed e.g. "Any object which is a product of philosophies, world views and activities which reject or are ignorant of the magical nature of the universe". (Overly simplistic compared to what I imagine wizards would write whole books about, but you get the gist of the idea). That's a fixed rule but nonetheless is flexible enough to take new objects into account as they are invented. It's also not really exploitable. None of your ideas about quills etc above work.

Well, as a preliminary, this is a bad definition of science, both in terms of common use and in terms of philosophy, but since this isn't a philosophy of science class I will simply note the fact and move on.

Now, to move on to the substantial point, I think you're making a fundamental mistake in not seeing that, in the HP world, the Muggle understanding of the universe is simply contradicted by the way the world behaves. So long as magic is absent it can describe the natural world moderately accurately, but by failing to realise that there is a supernatural world, its most fundamental positions such as conservation of energy are woefully inadequate - or at least, highly limited.

You keep assuming that the way Muggle science explains the world is correct, and then considering whether magic changes it and what the consequences of that would be. But that's putting things back to front. The Muggle explanation was "wrong" to begin with. It's not that optics is an accurate description of light, and then magic may mess that up. It's the optics will be only a partially accurate theory in the first place, missing out on all of light's magical qualities and nature.

I put the word "wrong" in quotation marks because this leads into a discussion of a position known as pluralism.

I tend to take an approach informed by the philosophy of Hasok Chang on scientific pluralism when I consider the interaction of the natural and unnatural worlds in the Harry Potter universe. I don't really agree with this approach in real life but it's a good model for magic, I think.

Essentially scientific pluralism is the idea that there is not one scientific truth but rather it is possible for there to be multiple, conflicting scientific explanations for a given phenomena, each one empirically adequate and yet each one describing the world in a different way. In this view, therefore, science is not about discovering the way the world "actually is" but rather is the invention of empirically adequate models. It's quite an interesting theory, especially when you get into details such as the epistemological status of observations using instruments built according to and with results interpreted in light of a specific theory (e.g. the electron microscope). Nonetheless in real life pluralism's biggest problem is that no one has actually managed to develop an equally empirically adequate but contradictory scientific theory in comparison to our current best knowledge (though there's some interesting work on the different formulations of Newtonian mechanics).

RETURNING TO HARRY POTTER...

My preference for theory of magic is that it describes the world in a way that is fundamentally incompatible with modern science - it will have its own way of describing substance and composition, for example, potentially based on the old Aristotelian system of physics (which was of course developed before the Statute of Secrecy, and stuff like teleological causation definitely seems to be a thing in the HP universe). From the perspective of wizards, the Muggle periodic table would simply be wrong - it fails to account for fundamental (magical) properties of what substance is, how it behaves, etc.

But then how do you explain the fact that Muggle science works so well for said Muggles? That's where the pluralism comes in. It's not that the periodic table is "wrong". It's that it's another way of describing the world. Neither the magical theory of matter nor the Muggle one would be true. Rather they are both empirically adequate (relative to their own set of observations), each one thoroughly confirmed by observation, and yet those observations fundamentally contradicting each other about the most basic constitution of the universe.

Fundamentally, the world is split into the natural and unnatural worlds, and the two are simply distinct. There is no universal, consistent set of rules for the universe as a whole. And when the natural and unnatural clash, the unnatural overrules the natural.

********** Umm, I think you misunderstand what science is.

Science is simply the study of observable phenomena in the world.

Wikipedias Definition is a bit more dense: "Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe."

In other words, Science is not some authoritarian set of theories or laws, but is simply the process of studying and understanding the world. In the case of of demonstrable conflict with established theories, the theories are changed. If magic is in any way, shape, or form predictable, then it could be studied with science.

My favorite way to describe it is "The simplest set of theories that can adequately describe the observable universe". Often times, we KNOW the current scientific theory is likely wrong, but we go with it anyway it adequately describes everything we can currently observe. If we get more data that disproves the current theories, THEN we update our theories.

I mean, science didn't have to wait for "Theory of Everything" (String Theory and the like) to adequately describe the observable world.

If you presented magic to the scientific community, and it acted the way it does in the HP books (with predictable results), then you would very quickly get a scientific theory on magic, and updates to existing physical laws.

If your separate magical rules end up with the exact same outcome for items in the visible (non-magical) world, then what is the point? As long as science can measure them and make predictions, that is all that is needed. Being 'right' has little value.

If there was a magical system that was fundamentally different, the world itself would be super surreal, much more than depicted in the books. We had a fun conversation on this subreddit about construction and magic earlier, addressing this.

If not, the the magical system has to be, at some level, based on the same principals that the muggle world is based on. After all, if science finds some new element, there would have to be some magical system that explains it as well. At which point, they are basically the same.

*********** As I said above, I do not intend to get into a philosophy of science discussion, which would be hugely tangential. Suffice it to say that "what science is" is in fact a highly disputed topic with multiple schools of thought. The position you advocate is merely one of them, and it would be disingenuous to present it as the settled view or somehow "correct".

At this stage I will simply note that in common use, "science" can either refer to the scientific method or the scientific body of knowledge about how the universe works. When I say that magic and science are two separate systems of rules, the natural and the unnatural, and that they are not unitary, I am using the second meaning of "science" above, i.e. that the universe itself does not work according to a single, consistent set of rules. As Richard Feynman once noted, the scientific /method/ is perfectly able to study a non-unitary universe (albeit with much more difficulty, as generalisation is more problematic), but all current scientific systems assume that there is just one single, consistent set of rules by which the universe operates. To introduce disunity would be lethal to all current scientific understanding, even if it is not lethal to the scientific method itself.

(I should probably also note at this point, so that you do not waste time trying to explain your view in further detail, that I wrote my master's dissertation on this very topic. Any adequate attempt to address the issue would take tens of thousands of words and still lead to no firm conclusion, so I think it's best that we leave it alone rather than repeating well-rehearsed arguments already readable in the literature.)

In any case, I reject the notion that all you need for the scientific method is predictability. Observation is just one part of the scientific process (and, while trying to avoid the discussion referenced above, not a universal feature of all scientific activity). Another important part is coming up with an explanation/description which is sufficiently precise and general. It is this part which I doubt is possible with magic. Consider my proposal for an example of magical theory above:

#+begin_quote
  A Muggle object is object which is a product of philosophies, world views and activities which reject or are ignorant of the magical nature of the universe.
#+end_quote

Good luck turning this into something more scientific. It's not about predictability -- every time you bring, say, a computer onto Hogwarts' grounds, it's going to fail predictably -- but rather about the rule being fundamentally "literary" in nature. What makes an object the product of a certain philosophy? That's just one of those kinds of questions that is not apt to scientific analysis, like "what is beauty?" Of course, that does not render the question meaningless -- there is a real sense in which beauty exists (and since there is beauty-related magic, definitely exists as a real thing in the HP world). But it's not the kind of question science is able to answer.

************ First, just a clarification on the science thing: I had intended to say that if it was observable and predictable, then it could be rationally or scientifically studied, not that you needed it to be observable or predictable in order to rationally or scientifically study it.

Onto the HP Part:

But it is the fact that it is a rule that is 'literary' in nature which makes it such a juicy target. Of course I want the characters to explore that, and try to exploit that. Since the rule here seems to be "No 'high' technology allowed", figuring out exactly what is high technology and how it works would be a natural first step to trying to understand the world.

I'm a big fan of Sanderson's thoughts on magic ([[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law]]). A strong set of rules are important if you are looking for a self-consistent universe.

I mean, "An excuse for the author to exclude anything they don't want" is a fine literary reason, but it isn't one I would expect the more rationally aligned characters in-universe to accept :P. After all, what is technology? Harry's glasses kept working, even though those were a "product of philosophies, world views, and activities which reject or are ignorant of the magical nature of the universe".

*I* know that it applies to items (like electronics) that would ruin the atmosphere intended for the book. And as long as it isn't examined too closely, that is fine thing to hand-wave. But if you are looking (as the OP is) for details in how that works and how the characters deal with it, the exact rules and functions are extremely important to define and flesh out.

Since HP isn't one of those magical universes where magic is entirely irrational, and is pretty well integrated with the modern physical world, that would be kind of what is needed for a fic as described by the OP?

It should hopefully be clear that I disagree that HP magic is at all "well integrated with the modern physical world". For the reasons elaborated above, I think it clearly works by concepts rather than physical quantities. So, for example, the answer to the question "would the shield charm block radiation" is "only harmful radiation" because the Shield Charm is the concept of protection given magical reality. It's not a filter system which can be investigated by experiment, nor is it reducible to physical properties. Rather it is a teleological device which nature is determined by its goal. And notice that I say "its" goal, because again, I'm not talking about the caster's intent here, I'm saying the concepts are built into magic itself.

(Not to mention the fact that the HP world is dualist, which is fundamentally opposed to physicalism...)

I think JK Rowling does a very different kind of worldbuilding to an author like Brandon Sanderson, who is famous for his “First Law of Magic”:

#+begin_quote
  An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.
#+end_quote

I like Brandon Sanderson's books. There's no doubt that they have inventive and well thought out magic systems. However, a result of this approach to magic is that it ends up feeling like something out of a video game, or a tabletop RPG. It's easy to see why: for something to be understandable and predictable in the way required by the above law, it has to be mechanistic. Everything has to fit together. It has to function.

The problem with this is that the real world is complex, and our attempts to describe and explain it are messy. Our scientific theories are incomplete, sometimes contradictory (for example, the famous tension between quantum field theory and general relativity), and fail to answer more fundamental, philosophical questions about why. As a result of this, we naturally associate messy complexity with realism. Brandon Sanderson's magic systems, for all their functionality for storytelling, simply feel far too simple and too neat to be real.

The truth of the matter is that no author can hope to simulate the complexity and mess of the real world. Any magic system that you attempt to explain comprehensively so that the reader “knows how magic works” will feel too simple. If you want your world to feel real, the reader shouldn't really know how magic works, just as we don't really know how the natural world works in real life. And I propose that this is the type of worldbuilding JK Rowling is attempting: she wants her wizarding world to feel authentic, and to do that you have to sacrifice Sanderson's first law.

So what is JK Rowling's approach to worldbuilding? I believe it is what we might call “worldbuilding by allusion”. The books do not explain magic to the reader, in the knowledge that any explanation given would feel shallow and simple compared to the real world's complexity. Instead the books allude to the existence of explanations. Like the real world, these explanations are incomplete and at times contradictory. This helps the world feel authentic.

A key aspect of this is that we are drip fed bits and pieces of these explanations, not as a genuine attempt to educate the reader, but to help us buy into the idea that magic is a complex thing which wizards are attempting to understand. The bits and pieces of magical theory we do hear add flavour and depth to the world, and give some clues as to the type of explanations which exist. Without these drip fed pieces of information, the magic would feel characterless and shallow. Alluding to the existence of explanations is a tricky business, because if you don't give enough flavour then it just leaves an empty void, like you've come up with your world on the back of a beer mat. An example of this type of worldbuilding would be Lev Grossman's The Magicians.

The goal of good HP worldbuilding, if you wish to create a system which feels authentic, should be to allude to the existence of a system of knowledge about the world which is as complex as modern science, but nonetheless fundamentally different in terms of both how it describes the world, and in terms of what methods of investigation and explanation are appropriate for the subject matter. I consider the magical theory is much more likely to look like ancient philosophy, religion, law and literary analysis than scientific and mathematical reasoning. This isn't because wizards haven't got around to appropriating scientific methods, it's because those methods are the ones which are most appropriate for the subject matter.

I shall leave you with a quote from one of my fics which attempts to allude to the details of such theories:

#+begin_quote
  Victoria pulled out her wand and made sure her grip was light. “Wingardium Leviosa,” she said, swishing and flicking, and before she was even finished with the incantation the feather began to move, floating upwards gently as if it had been caught in a draught.

  Susan snorted. “Figures,” she said, “was that really your first go? I don't understand what you're doing that I'm not...”

  Victoria shrugged and Susan turned back to her own feather. As she practiced, Victoria gazed up towards the ceiling. The spell was fun, no doubt about that, but it didn't seem as good as it could be. Why limit yourself to just floating something upwards?

  Curious, she pointed her wand at the feather and yanked sideways, almost like a fishing rod. The feather jerked in place slightly, but otherwise remained unmoved. She was sure she was missing something about the spell. It couldn't just be this, could it?

  “Something troubling you, Miss Potter?”

  It was Professor Flitwick. He'd approached her desk without her noticing, so focused was she on her spellwork, and was now admiring her levitating feather. “I dare say it looks like you've got the spell down!”

  “But why won't it go sideways?” she asked. “Look.” She performed the wand motion again, demonstrating the feather's distinct lack of movement.

  “A fine demonstration of the reeling motion,” Flitwick squeaked, “but no amount of reeling with move that feather, I'm afraid. Can you think why? Consider the definition of levitation.”

  Victoria drummed her nails on the desk, thinking back to her reading. “Levitation isn't the same as flying,” she said, thinking aloud, “it's a simple concept, but flying is a lot more complicated.”

  “Go on,” Flitwick said, nodding along, “what would you need to add, to turn the Charm from levitation into flight?”

  “Well, a sense of direction for sure,” Victoria replied, “one of the four winds?”

  Flitwick smiled. “Well done! Now, you don't want to upset the rest of the spell too much. Can you remember which of the winds is the friendliest?”

  “The west wind,” Victoria said with confidence, before continuing her train of thought. “But it needs more than just direction, doesn't it? It needs to want to move... some kind of will.”

  “Goodness me,” Flitwick said, his bushy eyebrows raised, “you have your mother's instinct for Charms. The concept you're looking for is ‘impulse', my dear, but I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it. We don't introduce it until next year. Put simply, the Charm must invoke an animalistic will to give it impulse, in this case an avian Form.”

  Victoria was stumped. “I have no idea how to do that.”

  “Thank god,” Susan interrupted, taking a break from her levitation attempts, “how do you know all this stuff?”

  Victoria stuck her tongue out in response. “I read.”

  Flitwick sighed. “If only you'd been in Ravenclaw... but no matter. Come to me after class and I'll give you some extra reading on the topic. In the meantime, let's see if we can figure out the final component of the Locomotion Charm. Here's a hint: it's not required for flight itself, but serves another purpose.”

  Victoria was forced to think hard on that one, the moment stretching out as she looked around the room for inspiration. Why would the Locomotion Charm have anything in it that wasn't a component of flight? Her eyes landed on Millicent, who was swearing at her feather in an attempt to get it to move.

  “Obedience,” she said, the answer coming to her in a flash, “there's no point giving an object flight if it doesn't go where you tell it.” Flitwick nodded slowly, clearly expecting her to elaborate further. “So.. the shackles? No, that would go against the whole idea of flight... the whip, then.”

  “Marvelous! Simply marvelous!” Flitwick exclaimed. “Ten points to Slytherin for outstanding magical deduction! Now, let me find that book...”

*********** If you want an answer, just look at what Hermione said. Electronics specifically are known not to work in the presence of large amounts of magic. But Hermione doesn't simply say they don't work, she says electronics go "haywire", they malfunction.

So my fanon answer would be to say that, for kicks, magic screws up the operations of the Logic Processing Unit present on circuit boards. After all, (goofy and probably not literally true though) wizard's aren't so good at logic (or at least at logic puzzles) so why not just run with the idea and say that's how it messes up electronics without messing up the brain or disrupting nearby lightning (in thunderstorms for instance).

Also, your spiel on science is kind of irrelevant. Science is founded on the assumption of naturalism. Magic by definition (especially in HP) is supernatural, so obviously it is not bound by the laws of the physical universe. Yes magic is predictable and there are magical theories, but it's not science. You can call it "super(natural) science" or something catchier, but it'sclearly distinct in its subject matter from what Muggles do and only a trivial definition of science would lump the two together.

************ But going Haywire usually suggests that the problem can be isolated and solved. The first question is does this apply to all forms of technology (such as Camera's, which are fundamentally simply a brief exposure to a light sensitive strip, or telescopes which are simply finely crafted light bouncers), or simply electronics.

If electronics specifically, then there is a LOT of interesting potential there. If it causes random electronic signals in metal, well first, it should make pretty much all metal on campus give off static shocks. Second, that could be pretty easily guarded against if needed (depending on the pattern).

If it somehow dampens electronic signals, that is even better. Items that restrict electronic signals are just as useful as those that are conductive.

I guess my point was any attempt to give this a solid backing would have lots of little nits that are worth exploring and fleshing out, and it is a lot easier to go with "something causes things not to work, and no-one has really looked into it" than "There is some magical sense of what is too technological to be allowed", which is at best a Had Wave, and at worst Applied Phlebotinium...

I'm not sure why you think it would be supernatural? HP seems to clearly state that magic operates under a set of rules, with predictable results. This would seem to fit directly under naturalism. It isn't like it is "I ask the demon from the other world to light my wand, and if he feels like it the Lumos will work"....

According to an interview with JKR linked elsewhere on this thread, Colin's camera normally worked via batteries meaning it had electronics. It only worked near Hogwarts once he moved to power it with magic (namely, the magic present in the very air near Hogwarts). You ask if it's just electronics; all of the examples Hermione gave were electronic. The only way to make them work is remove the electronic components and power them with magic.

Looking for a physics explanation doesn't interest me, especially since even then at a certain point the answer because "X just has these properties". I proposed an explanation in my previous post that didn't come down to "X is too muggle" or something.

Im not sure what you're on about with respect to me saying magic is supernatural. Magic doesn't operate according to the rules of the natural world, which is by definition supernatural. That there are rules and laws governing how magic works is irrelevant, as that has nothing to do with it being supernatural. There are laws and rules in mathematics and formal logic, and neither of those fall under the purview of science either.

I think it's possible Voldemort might have designed the spell with enough clauses to fight off direct workarounds (for instance, the spell probably /defined/ what a Defence Professor is rather than refer to the /title/), and for the rest, he's just counting on general wizard stupidity to overlook deeper loophole-abuse.

And anyway, in the Hogwarts Electronics' case, why would it matter if it's easy to work around? We don't see anybody try it. Maybe it /is/ relatively easy.

********* We don't know if that would even work. Magic doesn't have to follow logic or reason. The curse might just latch onto that new position instead, "realizing" that it's the same thing, really.

********** In order for us to say "It latches onto the DADA position", it /is/ following some sort of logic or rules. You just have to discover what they are.

Split the class up, have spell-work and dangerous creatures. Or merge those into existing classes: We know charms already covers some of what is needed in DADA, just expand that. Care of Magical Creatures could easily cover "Defense From" as well

Wizards have access to cheap teleprompters. Open a direct fireplace to another school and contract out the teaching of that one class to that school.

Assumingly, the curse doesn't apply to other defense-related institutions, like DA. Cancel the class entirely and go with a different educational model. 1 on 1 tutoring and book-learning from student to student overseen by staff.
