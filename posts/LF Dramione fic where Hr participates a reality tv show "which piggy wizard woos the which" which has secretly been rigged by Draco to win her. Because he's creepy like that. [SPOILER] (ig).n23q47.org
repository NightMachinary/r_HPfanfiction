:END:
First off, it's not "Simply Irresistible". Ginny signs her up secretly. Hermione hasn't been living a happy life. She gets a makeover for the reality show contest of "who gets to win the which" (not really, it's polyjuice). A lot of men are competing for her. Turns out draco malfoy owns the show and everything actually and it's all a plot for him to get close to her and woo the witch of his dreams because apparently he's been reformed.

I also remember someone straight and drunk (ron?) getting a BJ from some guy (Theodore Nott?) who's were mouldy teeth.

Oh and Oliver Wood is a contestant maybe?

Now that i think of it, it sounds kinda like an asshole plot because it objectifies the fuken heroine like some common harlot but i just need to know. It's been in my head for aaaages.
