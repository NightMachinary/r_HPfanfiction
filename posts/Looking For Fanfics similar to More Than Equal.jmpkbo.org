I started fan fiction and Harry Potter Fanfiction a few months ago. First read HPMOR and then found More Than Equal (by Ordinarily Prudent). Please can someone recommend fanfics like it as I enjoyed reading about a Harry that was skilled at duelling and was the Heir of Slytherin?

â€‹

Oh, I've also read An Insect among Gods while I was searching and liked it the same way.


** The only one of those I'm familiar with is HPMoR, but that doesn't really involve duelling, and Harry is only the heir in the sense that he speaks Parseltongue.

He does get quite a bit better at duelling in linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter), if that interests you.

** Hmm, I guess try this one. I took lots of breaks while reading the series to read other stuff but I kept going back to it. I liked the way the author portrayed Barty and all the Death Eaters. Very cool

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
