Harry Potter was having tea with Professor McGonagall when it happened.

"Professor?" Harry asked, "are you well? You look a bit... pale."

McGonagall looked down at her hands. They were shifting before her very eyes, wrinkles growing, disappearing then appearing once more. "Perhaps I should see Madam Pomfrey," she said, "it's like my body doesn't know how old it is."

At that moment, Hermione burst through the door - or at least, it looked like Hermione at first, but then her skin turned black, before switching back to white again. Back and forth it went, white to black to white, like a racial strobe light.

"Harry!" she said, panic in her voice, "what's happening?"

Harry grimaced. "It is as we feared. The Author has returned."

** Harry's scar began to sear with a sharp pain. He clapped a hand to his forehead, wincing. His vision blurred; the tea in his cup slopped over the rim.

He squinted through the pain, and when his vision returned, the table was lower down than he remembered, the light brighter, and the room much noisier than before. Not far away, something crackled and popped like a wood in the Gryffindor common fireplace, or hot bacon on Aunt Petunia's stove.

"Nagini?" came a voice from beside him. A fragrant brown lump, held between two sticks, was waved into his face. "The pork belly has finished cooking---here, have some."

/"Where am I?"/ Harry found himself hissing.

/"Your favorite Korean barbecue,"/ was the hissed reply, the sounds emanating from a pale, lipless mouth. /"I did promise you that we would do something special for your birthday. Lord Voldemort does not forget his promises!"/

** I would genuinely love to read a story where characters actively react to retconning as it happens before their eyes. Neville staring in bug eyed horror as Nagini's corpse starts to shift size and shape during the clean up, what used to be a demonic magically altered snake transforms into the headless body of a 70 year old Asian woman.

*** She's at least 20 years old in 1927, when CoG is set. That makes her ~90 years old at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.

And in CoG, McGonagall is 110-120 years old by 1998, as she was an adult teacher at Hogwarts in a ~1910 flashback sequence. According to the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/timeline/character-timelines/newt-scamander-timeline/][Newt Scamander timeline]], Newt went to Hogwarts between 1908-1914.

In this kind of crackfic, when McGonagall walks into an Age Line, it explodes.

**** To make matters worse, going by just book canon, McGonagall was not originally an older woman until Maggie Smith was cast to play her.

In PS/SS she's described with dark hair and as middle-aged iirc.

  *Question:* How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  *J.K. Rowling responds:* Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)

Nah, JKR was totally planning McGonagall's appearance in CoG for the last 20 years. Not only is McGonagall's age an issue in CoG, but her biggest onscreen contribution is zapping off a girl's mouth after she snitches on Leta, which contradicts the McGonagall who tells Fake Moody, "We /never/ use Transfiguration as a punishment!".

In hindsight, it bothers me that if she had just used young Professor Slughorn as a cameo character with zero plot relevance, it would have been perfectly fine and no one would have complained at all.

** It happened in the middle of Potions.

Harry had been struggling to keep it in, to prevent the final release held so fervently for the past hour. But alas: he was at the end of his wits; there was no way out, but /out/. Snape sneered at him in that moment, as if knowing what was to come. Without further warning, Harry let it all go, an enormous turd forming in his briefs as he shat himself.

The loud, roaring flatulence that followed shook the ground, and caused Draco to jump up in surprise. Snape's lower eye twitched. But beyond that: no one really cared that much--they all continued their Potions work as if nothing had happened.

"My, my, Potter. That was a... smelly one," said Snape drearily as he continued his patrols, losing his own interest.

Harry turned to Hermione. "This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me."

His friend turned her flying wheelchair around to face him. Using sign-language, she mimed, "Haven't you read Hogwarts: A History? We've all been shitting ourselves since Day One."

As if on cue, Ron stood up then to go to the supply closet, liquid brown spewing freely as he walked.

"Oh," said Harry. No wonder the castle always smelled poorly and the bathrooms were never used. Thankfully, he remembered then the spell to clean up matters. "Poopus Removus!" And just like that, it was as if nothing had happened.

** Genuine question. Do people announce new fics often? I haven't been a part of this sub for long so I genuinely don't know and genuinely don't know if it would be a good place for me to recommend my own stuff.

although, I pretty much write exclusively slash and I've gotten the vibe from this sub that this is not really a slash friendly place at times. Still, I'm new, so I might be purely mistaken

*** Not all that often, but it happens. There is a self-promotion flair for a reason. Not sure if I'd say the sub as a whole is not slash friendly, but those users who aren't slash friendly are very vocal about it, especially when it comes to Drarry.

But the way I see it, if you want to share your works with this sub, go for it! Likely somebody on here will enjoy it, you'd make their day and then you'd gain another reader!

ps: since you said you're new here, should you decide to link your works, be sure it doesn't violate Rule 8.
