Would accept science, an obscure branche of magic, an obscure legal loophole... anything other than love, which while good the first time, really gets old. Would also love recs where Harry is Voldemorts equal in someway (even though the prophecy says marked as his equal)


** Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) is a time travel fic where Harry actually genuinely becomes Voldemort's equal in ability, though their specialisations are very different.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

*** This is a good premise for a story. For anyone planning to read it, be advised that it is told from first person POV, and the person who's POV it is, changes.

** Well, it depends on how you understand love. Even in the books, it was not Harry snogging Tom Riddle which made him the winner.

** There's an old Harry Potter/Chronicles of Narnia crossover wherein Harry meets Susan and ends up going through the wardrobe to Aslan's Country. Turns out, the Power He Knows Not is forgiveness, not love.

** There was a one shot I read a while ago, which I am unfortunately unable to remember the name of. In it, Harry and Voldemort are dueling in a muggle area and Harry shoots a blasting curse at Voldemort. Voldemort sidesteps the curse, and it ends up hitting a natural gas line causing an explosion and blowing Voldemort to bits. This leads Dumbledore to say, "Natural Gas was the power he knew not".
