Mine takes place during the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff game in PoA. There is a science to this fucking scene so prepare for a fucking essay on the moving parts of how it plays out.

The main character, usually an OC, crossover character, or AU/timetravel Harry or Hermione has pressured the DADA professor to teach the students the patronus charm or has been teaching it themselves. Usually it's because the MC doesn't trust the ministry, is terrified by the idea of losing their soul for plot reasons, or just thinks it's a real useful spell that everyone can and should be able to cast.

In some cases, chapters prior to the game, MC has been badgering Dumbledore, their head of house, or ministry officials about removing the dementors from school ground. In some cases, MC has their slytherin friends write home to their parents to utilize sLyTHeRiN poLItiKZ. This is done so MC can be all “told you so”after the fact.

Any way the dementors descend on the game. Usually when this scene plays out, the dementors don't attack Harry like in canon, but descend on the stands and go after the students. This is necessary to set up the scene. If the author or feeling really dark and angsty some of the students get kissed or trampled to death in the panic.

Since the students have been learning the spell the wands spit out white clouds while the upper classmen have semi-corporeal shields.

Until, dramatically, the first corporeal patronus appears.

Who casts the first patronus is dependent upon what kind of story it is. If Hermione is MC, especially if she's timetravel, she might cast the first patronus. If it's a AU Hermione, it's less likely. If Time travel Harry is MC he is almost certainly the first to cast it. The exception to this is if it is a dark/angsty/ptsd time travel harry MC as the dementors will affect him too much to cast it. However, the sight of multiple corporeal patroni will give him the power to cast one. In the dark/angsty variety, time travel harry is definitely op, so he will have a huge (probably basilisk) patronus, multiple patroni, or a brighter patronus than all the others because power fantasy. If the author is feeling super angsty, it will be the first time Harry has seen his patronus in years bringing tears to his eyes, or his patronus will have changed causing an inner monologue on the person he used to be.

If MC is an AU harry, it's hard to predict how this scene will unfold. If the Au harry is op, he likely wipes out all the dementors. If Au harry is generally op but has a weakness he likely doesn't cast it or is one of the last to cast it.

If Mc is a better written au Harry or an OC, they will likely be among the second quarter of students to cast it.

If Mc is a crossover character they might not cast it (or even have magic), or only cast a shield. If they can't cast it period, they will be directing first years, keeping the people calm, or saving someone from getting trampled.

If Mc is not the first to cast the patronus and Mc is not Hermione, whoever cast it first will be dependent upon Hermione's characterization. Because Hermione will almost 95% of the time be either the first or second person to cast it. With on exception, if the fic features light Hermione bashing, an otter patronus will be noted.

If author is following Hermione's original character (book smart, exceptional at passive, magic, competent at defensive), Hermione will be the second person to cast the spell, with MC's 7th year friend or an unarmed older student being the first to cast it. If the author is not keeping to character Hermione will immediately cast it because she's somehow a Mary sue without even being the MC.

If MC can't cast the spell, the are probably using sonorous to encourage the students. The will talk about how their “lives, no their very souls” are on the line.

If the students are successful in driving back the dementors, MC gets to be smug, and Fudge might get fired. If the students fail and some get kissed, Fudge gets fired, possibly only because MC sends a letter to the prophet because the author is bashing wizarding society.

I thought this scene was the cute the first time I read it. Now that I've seen it again and again with very specific variations, I fucking hate it. There is only one story I like it in. Besides that one story, the trope is so cookie cutter and cheesy I can't stand it. What I hate about it is how it's not just a trope or cliche, like dark/edgy Harry or MC being able to tell which twin is which, it is an entire god damn scene. The scene itself is the cliche, not the situation. It's not even copy and pasted. There are specific changes to the scene to fit what kind of story it is in.

Please share any similar cliched scenes you can think of.


** Pretty much all H/G I've read early on would have me tab out now. When I got into HP fanfic, I wanted some more meat to Harry/Ginny since it fell short in the books. And the first few fics I stumbled across while fumbling with the FFN search mask all were soul bond fics with a temporal element (be it straight up time travel or messages from the future), and usually, them getting together was a very big deal. I remember one scene where they both became Phoenix animagi and went flying together, which caused a big firework-like display. Another had Voldemort die due to the power of love when they had sex (I still like that trope, although more for Horcrux removal rather than defeating Voldemort).

*** I've seen sex used in ritual magic, though I don't know if that's what you mean. Similarly I've never disliked this concept. Though I think murder via sex magic would be jumping the shark.

When I see the sex in ritual magic, it is almost always related to healing. Whether it has to do with Werewolves pack nature, healing, sharing magical damage, sharing years off a lifespan, or removing a horcrux.

Thematically, sex is more associated with life, so using it to kill sounds lazy on the authors part.

**** It was more "the Horcrux is destroyed through the power of love" than any ritual. They have sex, Ginny's love fucks the soul shard since Voldemort is the antithesis to love and he dies due to the backlash or transmitted emotion.

****** Goblin magic, although tbh I hate any long "Harry is a Horcrux and we have to fix it" arcs since to me it makes no sense that Harry could become one, so the sooner and easier it is gone, the better. Because it seems illogical that the protection which just destroyed Voldemort's body would allow a piece of his soul to infest Harry.

***** That's one of the parts I actually hated. Harry seeing all the students cast the spell before final being able to cast it is fucking cheesy. I would have preferred he not be able to cast it at all. It would been a definitive difference between cannon/au Harry and would have represented a permanent threat for a character whose soul time traveled when he died. Though the deaths of his friends tended to be permanent, there was very little threat to Harry

*** That was the one I was alluding to in my post. I also agree it is the most well done. But I still can't stand how formulaic it is. It is a scene that is drastically different from what happens in cannon, but has managed to appear multiples times in fan fiction. Every time it appears it has specific changes to make it fit seamlessly into the story.
