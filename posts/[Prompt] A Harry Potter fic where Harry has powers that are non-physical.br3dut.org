A prompt for an AU where the horcrux in Harry is attacking his mind and so he develops an interesting set of powers to defend himself. I haven't seen many fics where Harry has powers that are almost all non physical, so here are a few suggestions (you don't have to use them all)

The main one is that he can retreat into his mind and spend time there doing things like some portrayals of occlumency, and that he can seperate his mind / spirit from his body, which he does frequently which causes a lot of trouble in the muggle world.

When he gets to Hogwarts he cannot be sorted for (x) time because he's physically not in his body.

Mind magics --- Legilmency & occlumency, but week and needs developing from a book or teacher.

Astral projection --- (kinda) basically separating his spirit / soul / mind and floating around the physical plane, astral plane and maybe a well of magic or something.

Possession --- Able to possess animals (magical ones will actively try and reject him) and people (sentience means they are better at rejecting him, as does magic) He could possess the troll in 1st year to save Hermione or something, that would be cool.

General mental prowess --- Panmnesia, multiple simultaneous trains of thought, omnilingualism, higher intelligence, etc.

Minor telekinesis?

Dream manipulation / communication

Constant awareness of surroundings

Other general mind / psychic powers

Like I said, you don't have to use all of them, or any of them, but I thought the general idea was pretty good.


** This fits most of your requirements.

*** Ahh! It looks really good, but it hasn't been updated in almost 2 years, and I really hate reading something and not finishing it. How good was it? Should I still have a go?
