Let's say he wrote Harry's name and the fake school on the back of a random piece of paper and didn't realise it was the classlist until it was too late


** "Harry Potter!" Dumbledore called out. Harry froze in his seat. He couldn't believe it. There was an Age Line around the Goblet, so how on earth...?

Around him, the Hall fell silent and all eyes focused on him. He groaned when he saw Ron's mutinous stare. Apparently, his best friend thought he had put his name in.

"I didn't put my name in," he said desperately. "You know I didn't---"

"Ron Weasley!"

Ron's expression changed from anger to shock. Up at the staff table, Dumbledore was, for once, looking bewildered.

"Figures," Malfoy said loudly with a sneer. "Potter wouldn't do anything without his sidekick."

"Draco Malfoy!"

That shut Malfoy up. As he muttered that his father would hear about this, Dumbledore went on to call out the names of every single fourth year.

'Well,' Harry thought grimly as he made his way to the antechamber along with the rest of his classmates, 'At least they can't say I entered my name now.'

** But then, the goblet blazed to life once more, and... a long strand of paper seemed to flow from its flames. It continued without pause for a long few seconds, only to eventually drape itself across the Headmaster like a garland.

Those closest to him would later swear they heard him mutter "what the hell..." to himself.

Seeking for one end of the strip, he follows it along with his eyes, looking ever more perplexed, until he arrives at the other end. Fumbling, he turns it over, only to then seek the other end.

Finally finding it, he squints at the paper, takes a deep breath, and begins to read.

** "What if Durmstrang and Beauxbatons also fielded a class each?"

"It only seems fair..." Karkaroff's eyes gleamed as he gazed around the packed room - forty fourth years, the champions from the other schools, as well as a variety of teachers and Ministry officials.

Barty Couch furiously paged through the rules, dust flying from ancient pages. "It seems possible, equitable even. I can find nothing against it, given the circumstances."

Ludo Bagman's wide smile became wider as he interjected. "But of course the fourth years need a fighting chance, being younger. How about the older teams be 25 students a piece."

"Zat is a deal."

Harry groaned.

​

THREE MONTHS LATER

Draco held the replica Hungarian Horntail is his hand, face pale. The other students crowded around in the magically expanded tent. They were the only ones left, the older teams having already left to face their respective dragons. There had been a fair bit of yelling and screaming.

"We're fucked," said Terry Boot.

"Not if we follow the plan," interjected Susan Bones. "Hit wizard tactics, like we planned. Stunners and shields. And the seekers on brooms to grab the egg while it's distracted."

Harry and Draco's eyes met across the tent. Three months earlier he would have never worked with Malfoy, but now, needs must.

"Good luck everyone. Try not to die."

​

TWO MONTHS LATER

"But how can we breathe underwater?" Harry said, beginning to panic.

Padma Patil rolled her eyes. "Have you never heard of the Bubblehead Charm?"

​

FOUR MONTHS LATER

Harry panted as he ran through the maze. The fourth years had become separated when the swarm of blast ended skrewts had attacked them, and then separated again when a troll had come lumbering out of another pathway. More had been stunned in a brief but violent scuffle with the Beauxbatons team.

All he had left with him was Ron, Draco and Lavender. They looked shell shocked. Around them, beyond the hedges he could hear yelling as other teams came under attack.

Harry's wand spun in his hand as they turned a corner. "We're getting closer! Just follow the plan and we can reconnect with the others."

There was a flash of red and Ron hit the ground, stunned.

Mad Eyed Moody stepped around the hedge, wand raised.

"You've made quite a mess of things, Potter, but this ends here."

Three Months Later

Peter Pettigrew knew he shouldn't be surprised when nearly twenty students portkeyed into the graveyard, he saw Potter cradle his forehead and almost fall over from his pain.

That was enough time for the students with more experience with portkeys to get their bearings.

"Wormtail, kill the spares"

"Avada-"

"Stupefy"

"Stupefy"

"Stupefy"

"Stupefy"

He fell on the first one, the second one missed him, but the other ten hit him well enough.

Since the other schools would have their champions more or less decided and all of the valid ballots already placed. And then the cup's internal code ran an error and since all of the names were on the same page they all counted as a single entry.
