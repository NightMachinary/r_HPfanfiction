Mine was a song fic with emo music and a wbwl story line that had Harry cut himself. Not my proudest momentüòÖ


** Mostly the bashing fics. I used to think "yeah, show 'em what it is", especially if it's my favorite non-canon pairing, but now, ugh, I'm essentially agreeing "oh yeah, the only way for them to end up together is by removing their canonical pair", like a deranged stalker attacking their crush's lover.

Also, those fics where the first years, with no mental/soul time travel involved, somehow talk and act like high-schoolers. Bonus points for pretentious formal greetings between the purebloods. For some reason I used to love those fics, thinking "this is how it should happen", I really don't have an excuse for that since I've been a teenager, and I never saw anyone no matter how rich or noble blood talk and act like that.

One specific fic is HPMOR. I used to think about it as a masterpiece with all those logic, but looking back, they're caricatures of people acting in completely unrealistic ways, even for a fantasy world completely unrelated to the canon that happens to have people with identical names.

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

** I was really into teacher/student stories when I was 15-17. With Snape being the teacher. Now the though of Harry or Hermione ending up with Snape makes me cringe.

Luckily all of them have been purged because they were to raunchy for ff.net.

** Not going to link it, but The Real Us by Seel'vor. I first read it when I was a teenager, so I didn't realize how disturbing the underage sex scenes were. Likely because I was a curious preteen/teen and had previously read a lot of smut about people my own age at the time, not realizing that most, if not all, were likely written by adults.

I don't really have a problem with it, since they're fantasy characters and therefore no real harm is done, but it's still not something I'm comfortable rereading. I had reread it a few years after I initially found it, skipping over those particular scenes, and while I still enjoyed the story it's not nearly well-written enough for me to return to it even if I were to skip the underage stuff. There's a huge amount of bashing and OOC-ness (by design) as well, which, while I don't mind it, doesn't exactly encourage me to go back to it.

** I used to be super into fics where Harry had multiple personalities. I think it was a bit of a fad in the mid 00's. I also remember non-ironically loving songfics and wishing I had the talent to write one myself.

** I came looking for HP fanfics because I wanted a better Hinny romance arc. So I threw together a search and just started reading. Two million words later, I had somehow ended up having read like 6 soulbond fics and actually enjoyed that since it seemed like the logical conclusion for a relationship with magical people.

So I went looking for Harry/Luna fics and was disappointed that there were none with that trope. No problem, I'll just write my own... It was only while trying to write a soulbond fic when I realised the issues with the trope, and I can't say that I've enjoyed reading about it afterwards.

**** There are several, but the most obvious are that the common depictions would be a fast track to suicide if you would indeed share thoughts since you could never just take even 5 minutes for yourself, nevermind a whole day. The second issue comes from the fact that it is used in a predetermined way rather than as the ultimate evolution of an existing relationship. Which is especially dubious since it makes the whole relationship basically "there's no way out" at best, "rape by whichever diety created the bond" at worst.

** Yep. The first fandom that I really explored was ‚ÄúNaruto‚Äù and I read a story that I absolutely loved (Uchiha Naruto: The sage). To make a long story short, I read the entire thing and still treasure the experience as it all seemed so innovative and well done and I greatly enjoyed the plot-lines and twists, but then some years later I tried to re-read it and had to hop back before getting even to halfway point -the writing was really not up to my standards anymore, and the plots that once seemed so exciting now seem downright ridiculous, convoluted and repetitive.

** Huh. Not really. I mean, there are many stories on which I've changed opinion over the time, one way or another, but I can't really remember anything that I'm embarrassed about /having liked/ per se. I understand what is or isn't /socially acceptable/ right now, so I would maybe cringe at me /revealing/ that I liked HPMOR or Partially Kissed Hero or whatever in the past because that clearly branded me as a stupid loser by the general convention, but I don't find liking them /by itself/ cringe-worthy. I still understand /why/ I liked them, even if my views changed since then, and since everything in art is a matter of personal taste anyway, there is no point that says that the past!Me's taste was somehow less legitimate than my current taste.

My feelings are more or less: whatever you like, like it without guilt or regret. If you think that people will look down upon you because of it, then just keep it to yourself---but don't bow down to the pressure and needlessly turn /against it/. There are many works or authors I really, /really/ don't like, but I don't hold it against anyone who likes them, and that includes past!Me.

No cringe at my taste, past or present. /Maybe/ cringe at me putting myself into an embarrassing position by advertising my taste and having people judge me for it.

*** So you grandstand on other people and call them cringe for wanting to share and laugh about what they used to like, and be able to explore how they have grown as a reader and a person. I understand the first two parts of your comment but the last part was unnecessary.

**** No! I don't quite get how you got /that/ kind of malicious meaning out of that last past, but I meant it completely literally. Simply speaking: taste itself not cringe, being in a situation when everyone thinks X is embarrassing with you saying that you like X /maybe/ cringe (though preferably it /shouldn't/ be seen as cringe). Not exclusive to me, naturally. Though maybe the whole post was completely useless in the first place, since that could be taken as being needlessly precise about 'cringe at X' vs 'cringe at liking X' vs 'cringe at being seen as liking X' difference.

edit: Oh, I got it just now. Sorry, I might have worded the last sentence really badly. When I wrote 'having people judge me for it', I literally meant other people judging my taste as embarrassing /in the past/, with me remembering it /now/ and feeling cringe at the situation as a whole. /Not/ throwing shade at anyone here for sharing their experiences.
