** linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) is the best of the lot. One of the best written fics you'll find in the fandom.

/Save Me/ is another Ginny in Slytherin story, abandoned early. It focuses on Ginny's first year, which /The Changeling/ skims. linkffn(5639528)

There are several of those Dumbledore Army fics, similar to Not From Others. linkffn(A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor McGonagall; Ginny Weasley and the War for Hogwarts by edjameston)

linkffn(Secrets by Elizabeth Culmer) is Ginny's view of CoS. Decent read.

linkao3(Knives by Elizabeth Culmer) is one of my faves. Ginny takes revenge on Lucius for the Diary incident, or tries to. Warning for second person, which many people can't stand, but I think it works really well here.

linkffn(your loss or your arrears by irnan) is a fun detective story with great Ginny characterisation. Canon compliant.

linkao3(Left Hook by elicitillicit). Time travel to Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts. Writing is pretty great, as is McGonagall's characterisation.

linkffn(the albatross did follow by chromeknickers) has Ginny and Draco stuck in an infinite time loop. Fast paced and fun. linkffn(The One You Never Knew by SunnyStorms) has one of the best fight scenes I've read, with both Muggle weapons and magic involved.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12686&chapter=all#2][I Need a Hero]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260&chapter=1&textsize=2][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] are both excellent adventure stories with Ginny as the protagonist. Both Abandoned too.

linkao3(Heir to Nothing but Herself) is a character study of Ginny Weasley. Or one take of it, at least. Has a sequel too.

linkao3(Ginny Weasley: Dragon Slayer) is a story about Ginny slaying the fuck out of some Dragons.

  Who you are, whom you love, and where your loyalties lie - Ginny Weasley had never thought all of that could change as a result of a single night. Her postponed wedding to Harry following a Death Eater prison break was supposed to be a mere set back to the life she'd always dreamed of. But driven by anger and pride, she makes a fateful decision that will upend her entire life.

  It was not Harry's heroism, Ron's desperation, her mother's love, or her brothers' toilet seat humor that brought her back (though the toilet seat helped). Ginny breathed deep at night. She wept. She remembered how to rage. She snuck out at night and stole each of her brothers' brooms in turn. She took to the skies and brought herself back to life.

** The book club did this one a while back, it's really nice. It's not a ship-fic per se, but I think it will eventually be HP/GW. It's a great take on Ginny in Slytherin. edit - Not yet complete, but still updating at a decentish pace.

** Anything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][pottermum]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2505393/Epeefencer][Epeefencer]] are all actively writing fluffy Harry/Ginny stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2298556/Wanda-Ginny-Greenleaf][Wanda Ginny Greenleaf]] is another Ginny fan, some of her stories are pretty good, but this author really needs a beta.

*My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(6160345), is written in Ginny's first person POV. Short, but very entertaining.

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107), is the ONLY completed lone Ginny time travel.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387), is simply the best soul-bond fic out there.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is an excellent canon-compliant postwar family/mystery story.

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), only listed Ron and Hermione as main characters, but Ginny is just as important as these two. One of my favorite postwar fics.

*Here and There*, linkffn(7525570), is Hermione/Ginny femme slash fic. It's really good until the last few chapters.

*The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971), is a very unique, but very interesting story. Ginny plays an important role, but is not a sympathetic character. Actually, no one beside Luna is truly sympathetic here.

** linkffn(Seeking Ginny) is one of the best. It was published before all the books were out so it's pretty AU but it's really great.

For some reason I don't think I've ever seen linkffn(Ghost of You by blacktag189) recommended but it really needs to be. It deals with how the war affected Ginny and all the aftermath. Very emotional and long!

edit: should have seen that coming, bot picked wrong fic.

  "He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk." -- DH pg. 745. He didn't think it would be that easy...did he? **Completed**
