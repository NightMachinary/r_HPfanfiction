So, I'm looking for /completed/ fem!harry/tmr fics that explore it, I got the idea from linkffn(welcoming the unwelcome) and linkffn(the historical importance of runic war warding in the british isles), both are, imo uncompleted and abandoned, though idk if tHIoRWWitBI is abandoned or just uncompleted and on hiatus..

So, Complete, over 150k words fem!harry/TMR fics, the good ones.

Thank you, stay safe


** I have incomplete ones and one complete fanfiction which is way less than 150 K, so they don't fit your requirements. Do you want me to link them?

  What if Harry Potter was actually Heather Potter? What if she learned she was a parselmouth when she was a small child, and learned the lessons that snakes have to teach? This is my very first fanfic, I hope that y'all like it!

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

** Huh. Ok, you could try linkffn(8615605)

I dont know if it is going to be your cup of tea because of the pairing (It doesnt get in creepy territory, so rest asured.) It starts with Harry -Harriet- slowly getting a crush on Snape, who just cant believe how stupid she has to be to do that, and then tries to keep her away from him while at the same time trying to stop her from getting killed by Voldy evil plans.

Its really interesting, Though I have to recognice that it kinda doesnt count. You see, even though is complete, the story continues, and the sequel seems to be abandoned... Still the first part is still a worthy reading.
