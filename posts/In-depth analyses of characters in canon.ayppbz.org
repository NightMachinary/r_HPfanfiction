In developing my fanfic, I don't want to change change the characters themselves more than necessary. I'd rather do gentle reinterpretations of canon characters within my new setting (and avoid cliche fanon tropes as much as possible). To that end, I'd like to find a resource that has in-depth character analyses for the characters in canon, with their personalities, character arcs, thematic arcs, and for bonus points: common mischaracterizations. No idea if something like this exists, though. I looked on the HPfanfiction writer's section of the wiki, and it looks like something of the kind was sort of started, but abandoned maybe? If there isn't, I might need to make it, in which case I'd need help.


** I find more the HP Lexicon most helpful for in canon information (dates, major events, things like that). It cites to the books so you can then read in context if you need more.

And searching this sub and reading through the comments will be helpful for most characters in terms of common misrepresentations or analysis through discussion. Off the top of my head, I can think of dedicated threads for Luna, Snape and Sirius all in recent memory, and the archives go very far back.

*** Yes, but the data on there is deplorably shallow and just covers highlights to boot. Not nearly rigorous or in-depth enough. Thanks though!
