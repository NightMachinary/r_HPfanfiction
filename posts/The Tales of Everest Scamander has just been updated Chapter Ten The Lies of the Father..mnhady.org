Chapter Ten: The Lies of the Father.

Everest finally writes to her family back in the UK and finds out about their dangerous family secret.

For those who haven't started reading yet, here is a brief description of the story.

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.
