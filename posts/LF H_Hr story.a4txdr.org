I'm searching a H/Hr story where they get together in fourth year. One of the only things I remember is that Fleur was disliked by other Beauxbatons girls because she stole every boyfriend she could. She tried stealing Harry, got hexed by Hermione. Ther was more to it, but I don't really remember what exactly.


** Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion

Harry uses a loophole in the Tri-Wizard rules to make Ron his substitute after being injured. Harry and Hermione spend the year making out while Ron is an idiot.

*** I've read that one. It's Ron-bashing turned up to 11 (or possibly 12) for comic effect. Kind of cheap laughs, but could be worse.

** Adorable Violence comes to mind, but I'm not sure is the one you are looking for.
