** They are Muggles, medieval Muggles. I don't think Hogwarts has anything useful for them. In fact, they have no powers even against pranks from a First Year. I don't think they will like the status of being at the bottom of the social pecking order. Given how HP wizards treat and view Muggles in general, this is unfortunately very likely to happen.

On the other hand, Muggle world should be far more interesting to them:

- We thought King's Landing is huge with 500000 people, but this London has 10 million? How we see only very little shit, garbage, and pees being dumped onto the street?
- What are people moving around in? Cars, lorries, and no more horses? But they are so much faster! Only the Queen still rides in a horse drawn carriage sometimes?
- Supermarkets and major chain stores like Tesco provide so much goods for the common people that are completely unimaginable for these medieval folks.
- Very mundane or usual things for us, such as trains, Motorways and airports, will utterly baffle them. What will medieval people think of King's Cross and St Pancras during the daily commute? What will they think of jets taking off from Heathrow in 2 minutes interval?
- In London itself, there is still some medieval or old architecture left, buildings that will appear somewhat familiar to them, like the Tower, St Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Parliarment. But London also has significant number skyscrapers too. One Canada Square was built in the early 1990s, and existed at times of Harry Potter.
- Finally, the modern military: tanks, artillery, helicopters, fighters, bombers, aircraft carriers, submarines, strategic nuclear weapons... what will our medieval visitors think?

More importantly, these modern marvels have all been achieved WITHOUT magic! People having the same made up and potentials like them. How is all that possible? This got to get Ned, Jon, or Robb thinking.

*** Suppose Dumbledore invited Ned to Hogwarts for whatever reasons during Year 1, I can already see this happening:

#+begin_quote
  "Impedimenta!" Ned heard a voice behind his back, and he suddenly lost his balance and fell down.

  A blond boy with a pointy face led a group of children towards him, and said in a rather arrogant nasal tone "What is this filthy Muggle doing here? Has Dumbledore lost his mind? Wait until my father hears about this!"
#+end_quote

--------------

Dumbledore might want to protect him for whatever reasons. But the Books showed he couldn't even protect his own students, innocent children such as Neville from being constantly abused and bullied! The Trio might take side and defend Ned, but do you honestly believe one of the best and a proud warrior like Ned Stark would let himself be defended by 11 years old kids? Do you honestly believe he would put up with that shit?
