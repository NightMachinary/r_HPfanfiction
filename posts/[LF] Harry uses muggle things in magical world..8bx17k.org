** Linkffn(Blindness) [first time trying that so correct me if it doesn't work out]

Basically, Harry is born blind and doesn't go to Hogwarts, but becomes a genius in his own right. He and Hermione work together to bring magical help to Muggle through the guise of science. There's also a lot of interesting theory behind soul magic. It's nice and long so there's a lot there.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Methods of Rationality: [[http://www.hpmor.com/]]

It's a long one that only covers the first year and has an intelligent Harry. He uses a fair amount of Muggle tech to do things, and tests out the combinations of real science and magic.

It's not everybody's thing, but I really enjoyed it.

  A hero will rise, wielding a hereditary power that when coupled with a knowledge of contemporary technology will create a new world for Magicals and a new potential for humanity at large.
