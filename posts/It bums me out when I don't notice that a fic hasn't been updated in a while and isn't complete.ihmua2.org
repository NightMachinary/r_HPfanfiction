I started reading "A Fateful Walk" by Shygui linkffn(12150047) and I'm somewhat devastated that it's been nearly 2 years since the last update.

Are there any unfinished fics you've read where you experienced the same disappointment?


** I can't read anything that isn't complete. Ever. In the time it takes for another update, I've read at least a dozen other things and lost the emotional connection to the story.

This is also why I don't watch tv ...

*** My only caveat to feeling the same way is when it's a fic that is already complete and is updated 1+ times a week. Then it's like getting a treat every week, lol. I'll use those chapters as a bribe to do chores or something.

** There ought to be some sort of agreement that once a story is considered abandoned, it can be tale up by someone else to finish it.

I mean, if JK Rowling was ok with others continuing her tale...

** “James and Me by Northumbrian” linkao3(8402590) ... I still cannot decide whether I like Northumbrian more for all what he has written, or hate him for what he has not finished.

  After the final battle. A walk through the castle will shift the destiny of several people. Harry once again leaps without looking trying to save the life of a Slytherin witch he barely knows even after six years of school. The aftermath of his decision will have significant ramifications for those involved. EWE - please be aware that this Fic will go to some dark places.

** Sort of. But at this point my default assumption for any fic I come across is that it's incomplete and abandoned.

The most recent fic I've read that that I've felt this way about was linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream)

A combination of accidental magic, obliviation, head trauma, and an adoption basically turns Harry into Sherlock Holmes from the tv show.

Dumbledore seems to have gone down swinging, putting Voldemort temporarily down again.

Twenty years later, the police call on Harrylock to investigate the bizarre murders of Mr and Mrs Dursley.

  The summer after the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry Potter disappeared. Utterly. Twenty years later, Sherlock Holmes stumbled onto the case.

** Some devastate me when I know they are abandoned. Others leave off at a point where my head can finish up. Do not despair though, I have seen authors come back after a decade and others where they hand off story for finishing.

** I read so many fanfiction over the years and I will sad that a lot good ones are either deleted or abandoned. I especially enjoyed Misunderstood of star wars and was sad that its sequel has been abandoned. There was another fanfic of Kingdom hearts that I enjoyed but can't seem to remember. But two things that stood out for me was it was KH2 AU (no fantasy or school but KH universe) and the pairing was Roxas and Kairi. Scorpion Sorcerer of Harry Potter was another. That's all I am going to list as I read over a hundred.
