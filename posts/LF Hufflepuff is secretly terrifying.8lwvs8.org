I read a fic nearly a year ago, and I can't remember it's name, but I loved it. The only thing I really remember was a part where Harry pops up underneath the Hufflepuff table after going through a terrifying obstacle course.

Any other fics you can recommend in this vein would also be appreciated.


** I believe this is the fic you are looking for.
