(this is my first time posting her, so if I do anything wrong please tell me.) There is a fic I can't remember the name of. If you can, hopefully you'll tell me. It's set I Harry's third year, where Dumbledore tasks fluer's dad (who is a detective and named something like Hercule) with finding Sirius Black. They meet on the night bus when Harry runs away, and become acquaintances. That's all I can remember, Thank you.


** Wait, someone wrote a fic where Fleur's dad is Hercule Poirot? That's dynamite.

  When Sirius Black escaped Azkaban, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge sent for the Dementors to search for him. Dumbledore and Amelia Bones send for Mr H Delacour, former French Auror and consulting detective. Meeting Harry Potter by chance on the Knight Bus, Delacour, his wife, and his daughters are soon entangled with the story of the Boy Who Lived, and the truth about Sirius...
