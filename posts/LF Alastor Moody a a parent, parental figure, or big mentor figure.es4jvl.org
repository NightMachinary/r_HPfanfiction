As it says in the title.

I absolutely love reading people's comments on here, on another thread, there was a thought about parent or parental figure Moody, and I was just hit by loving that idea.

Can be a major point in the story, or a minor point. I'd appreciate it if it was from an already created character, but if the oc is interesting enough, I'll allow it.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Anyone can be the main character

Little to no character bashing, please. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to hate on someone, is usually a no go.

NO Harry/Hermione, or Draco/Hermione.

Can be on any site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Can be drabble/oneshot/multichapter

If Harry is in the story, I'd rather NOT have OP Harry, NO Harem Harry, no Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy, et cetra. Harry slightly smarter or slightly stronger Harry is perfectly fine, but have it be believable.


** A good few of the Harry/Susan fics have Moody as a mentor.

linkffn(5084287) Is a prime example. Moody is a mentor/trainer for Harry, and then later they bond after the events of book 4 in the hospital wing.

  After the events in third year, the wizarding world grows darker. Fudge seems intent on spending more time covering up what's happening than dealing with it. Could a stronger relationship between Harry and the Bones family change history?

** I love getting a chance to link linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). In this, Moody is Harry's guard on a quest during year 6 (AU after GoF though) and teaches him along the way. Moody also has a parental relationship with another character in the story, don't want to spoil anything. This is one of my favorite portrayals of Moody, really fleshing out his backstory and giving him some awesome battle scenes

** Backwards with Purpose actually has a nice mentor Moody but his part is regrettably short
