:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, i think i might be on ffn, but I'm looking for an old gen fic where Harry hides out the summer as help in the Leaky Cauldron. He like wears a headband and vanishes like superman wearing glasses.

Later on he befriends an American family who have magical little girls and the regulars think they are his kin. He also babysits for the family and plays a game with pigs...

It was a long time ago i read this fic. It had a yahoo group, if that helps.


** I believe it is *Realizations, by Wishweaver*

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

**** Actually, you'll want to switch to the version on AO3. The existing chapters have been edited and the author's working on expanding it (no new chapters yet, but the rewrite's finished). linkao3(25925863)

  AU Summer before Fifth Year story. If you recognize it, I don't own it. Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What does he do since he's not supposed to contact his friends until he gets the all clear?
