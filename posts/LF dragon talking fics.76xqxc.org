Im in the mood for fics where Harry can understand and talk to dragons by parseltounge, fourth year tournament is fine, but if there are any where he works at a dragon sanctuary that would be absolutely perfect! I prefer if it not slash, but can be accepted if it very little and/or easily skipped

I have already read the fic the "queen who fell to earth" so no need to link that one ;)


** [[https://kokopelli.nsns.fanficauthors.net/The_Letters_of_Summer/index/][The Letters of Summer]] by Kokopelli features a race of Snow Dragons that are fully sentient. Harry and Ginny interact with them a few times, learning magic and other things.

There's a nauseating amount of H/G fluff (at least for me) but otherwise it's a well written story.

** I think this should fit quite nicely. Harry "awakens" dragons the be able to talk to them. Then he quickly goes "Who needs Hogwarts? I got dragons!"

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

** There is always linkffn(Triwizard Tales by Clell65619), its fairly short but it is reasonably funny. The talking dragon is a fairly major plot point.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.
