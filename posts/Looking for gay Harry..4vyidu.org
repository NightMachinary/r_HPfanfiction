So as the title says I would like some stories, either romance as the main part or as a side part, where Harry is gay, he can be paired with anyone, as long as it makes sense within the story.

Any rating, sex is fine, preferably well written, preferably complete, but I will read uncompleted fics.

I'd like there to be some level of conflict, like when Harry comes out there isn't just overwhelming support, someone should try to make trouble, anyone, a close friend, or an enemy. If the story has a period of Harry coming to grips with his sexuality even better.

Thanks.


** Please don't downvote OP. It's fine if slash isn't your cup of tea, but let's not nuke an honest request.

People seem to like Turn. It's epilogue compliant and reasonably well written. I believe Harry comes to have an interesting and unusual job as well. linkffn(6435092)

To be honest, it really grinds my gears whenever an OP is downvoted for being anything other than hostile/vulgar/spam. It's a glaring sign of immaturity, hampers inclusivity and reflects badly on the rest of the sub, which sucks because the vibes around here are predominantly cool.

  Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts after the war to finish his schooling, with the blessing of Kingsley Shacklebolt and the promise of a job as an Auror. All he wanted was an easy year without any complications. He didn't count on Draco Malfoy barging into his life and knocking everything sideways. When Harry and Draco are forced apart, Harry must learn how to carry on living and loving. Ghosts from the past come back to life, and when two loves collide Harry faces the toughest decision of his life. A story about love, growing up and how, when it comes to matters of the heart, nothing is ever simple.

** There have been a few thread recently with similar themes: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4v1shn/lf_harry_in_denial_about_his_homosexuality/][LF Harry in denial about his homosexuality]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4c5v92/does_there_exist_any_stories_about_harry/][Does there exist any stories about Harry struggling with his sexuality?]]. I've linksub-ed them so their rec should show up here to (also this refreshes the EPUB/MOBI links if you what to down load it instead).

I do read a lot of HP/LV|TRJ. One I can think of which has a little of Harry protesting he sexuality is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard]] linkao3(266699). It is also very sweet and well written. However, most of the time, the conflict isn't that Harry is gay, its more who he is paired with. I'm going to recommend a bunch of stuff for you just in case:

For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685657/1/Hauntingly][Hauntingly]] linkffn(11685657) are new favs, even if the explicit slash bits are few and far between. Voldemort is still evil and still sort of insane, and /Harry does not have a good time/. He does not fall in love with LV straight away (or at all really).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon][Stand Against the Moon]] linkffn(10724291) has Harry as the leader of the non-human magicals after travelling to an AU. There is conflict about if Harry should be with LV, but not really about being gay.

For something more recently finished, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11330784/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sympathy-of-Souls][Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls]] linkffn(11330784) is more romance then slash as such, but still worth a read. Again, most of the conflict is about who Harry falls for, rather then the fact he is gay.

For Tom/Harry with fantastic characterization of both of them, anything by The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] linkffn(5725656) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] linkffn(5736901) are particularly excellent in my opinion. Tom edges on evil and not very very well, and the dialog is snappy and smart. Harry also /isn't a doormat/.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] linkao3(439865) has been recommended before I'm sure, but if you haven't seen it, it is worth a read. Harry mentions (briefly) that he realized he was gay in about the third time around his groundhog life loop. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9214710/1/The-Vitruvian-Man][The Vitruvian Man]] linkffn(9214710) is an old favorite of mine with a nice developing relationship. Harry dates girls first, but I don't think he angst over being gay much at all.

If do don't mind MPREG: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too. Both have Harry fighting against being attached to LV more then being gay.

** Twist of Fate is hp/lv. I've only read the first couple of chapters but it's really good so far. linkffn(5925524)

Check out Athey, she writes hp/lv. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey]]

Then there's this: [[http://fuckyeahhpslash.tumblr.com/]]

A Beasts Virtue is amazing though it hasn't really gotten to the slash part as its an WIP. It isn't really what you're looking for but I'll recommend it just because it isn't recommended enough.

"Schooled at Durmstrang, forced into political upheaval, pursued by dark and light wizards alike, Harry Potter becomes a leader and icon for his entire generation, thus turning the Dark Lord's attention to him - A tale of intrigue, bloodshed and manipulation coupled with an unhealthy fascination with the enemy. HP/LV. Politician Harry."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2526410/chapters/5614550]]

There also was this writer called maya who wrote hp/dm. She deleted her stuff from the internet, however I have a copy of her full works. So if you're interested PM me with your email.

** Oh! So many great ones. Longish fics:

[[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][Aorist Subjunctive]] by Minisinoo\\
*Summary*: Harry used a Time-turner to change his past. Cedric lived. Other key figures didn't. How can Harry and the Order fight Voldemort now? (HP/CD)

It delves deep in different directions: the war, the horcruxes, the Black family's dirty little secrets, and the confusing matter of being gay (or bi). It's actually quite excellent at that last one in particular.

I also second [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographer's Craft]] by Sam Vimes. (HP/SB)

--------------

Mediumish-length fics - no outright conflict, but a good few misunderstandings and coming-to-grips in some cases:

[[http://merry-smutmas.livejournal.com/124532.html?nojs=1][The Philosophy of Paper Umbrellas,]] by Empathic Siren\\
*Summary*: Harry Potter wants Bill Weasley, but knows he can't have him. He pines from afar, only to be forced to spend an evening with Bill as a favor to Draco Malfoy. Over pints of Stella and discourse about paper umbrellas, the evening takes a surprising turn. Warnings: Erotic spanking; a little bit of foul language.

[[http://hp-springsmut.livejournal.com/28004.html?nojs=1][May Contain Nuts]]\\
*Summary*: After Voldemort is defeated, the script for Harry's life comes to an end. Unsure of what to do with his life, he does nothing. Only one person is on hand to show Harry that a hero is not the sum of his vanquished enemies, but he's got problems of his own ... (HP/GeW)
