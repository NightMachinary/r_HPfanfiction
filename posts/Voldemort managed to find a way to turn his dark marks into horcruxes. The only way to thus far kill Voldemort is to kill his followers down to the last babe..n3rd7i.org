What happens now of he did this like Orochimaru did in Naruto? In Naruto this is one of the reasons why the villages haven't killed Orochimaru or hinted him down. Doing so would require killing thousands of innocent people.

But Voldemort here only infects his death eaters. This means that Harry now has to kill every single death eater to stop him. Every single one.

** I used that in my story "Patron". Though since Voldemort also was smart enough to send a few of his Horcruxes off to another continent, with the order to just stay safe, hunting down every last one wasn't a valid option, so they had to find another way to defeat him.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Plenty of Indy!Harry writers would look at that premise and say "So what's the problem?"
