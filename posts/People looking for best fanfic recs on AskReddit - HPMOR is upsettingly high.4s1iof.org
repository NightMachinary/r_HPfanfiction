** It is hardly the best, but I still think it should be recommended, because it tries to do something very different.

That said, here's one for the HPMOR fans which I think is by the same author, except it is a naruto fanfic. Some of you would have read this already.

** I've come to realise that any time someone on Reddit outside of the HP fandom talks about HP, they never know what they're talking about. I've also seen a post on Askreddit with 100s of upvotes where someone claimed that Draco was basically good all along by using bullshit claims.

*** I'm being a bit cheeky, I'm not actually upset, it's just funny because this sub hates it so much.

**** Ah. Ive never gotten why this sub hates it so much to be honest. Its not the best fic ever sure, but its still worth a read by anyone, and is one of the few decent "science of magic" oriented HPfanfics out there that I know of.

***** I only made it to around chapter 72, but I don't remember him focusing much on the science of magic after the first 20 chapters or so, and it basically becomes Ender's Game with magic.

***** I'm going to be honest, the title was just playing into the running joke of the sub that HPMOR should be banned, I don't have particularly strong feelings either way.

****** People shouldnt recommend it so much then ;)

Funny story, when I first found this sub and asked for recommendations, it was literally the first fic recommended. Not the first i read, but first response to my request thread (and like 10 others backed up the recommendation).

**** People repeat the statement that this sub hates HPMOR ten times more often than anyone actually disparages it.
