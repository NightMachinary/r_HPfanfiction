Anyone have any suggestions? Albus-bashing fics have gotten stale to me.

  Creeped out by all the tombstones, Harry and Cedric leave the graveyard almost as soon as they arrive. As result, much is different. Not sure of pairings.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** I don't like Dumbledore as being outright mentor as in linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip by ZebJeb) (which I stopped reading, because I just cannot take it anymore), but I like honest and sometimes unsuccessful (or too old and failing) Dumbledore. The one by [[/r/TheWhiteSquirrel]] (e.g., in linkao3(14078862)), or the sad and disappointed one in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) (that's the best part of otherwise not very good story). Or of course the angry one who is mad as hell and he just cannot take it anymore in the chapter 10 of linkffn(The Warren by DarkKing666) (it's crazy as this thing is packed with the original ideas, which I have never seen anywhere else; just see chapters 2 and 17 to see what I mean).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
