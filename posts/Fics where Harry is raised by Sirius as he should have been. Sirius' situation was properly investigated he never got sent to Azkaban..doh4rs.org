I'm looking for Harry at hogwarts with that background more than his actual upbringing, though I may be interested in that as well.

I strongly prefer it to not be Sirius/Remus.


** A Second Chance is very much about this, although Sirius still gets sent to Azkaban. The turning point from canon is that McGonagall never believed he was guilty and eventually wore down the ministry with her petitions to give him a trial about...I want to say four years in or so.

A warning that although it's not a smut fic per se, it does contain a /lot/ of references to sex, both consensual and not, and doesn't shy away /at all/ from describing explicit sexual acts in the narration. (Sirius definitely earns his fanon reputation as a sex god in this one.) This also extends to the students once they get to fifth year and it's less squicky to think about. For that reason I'm not going to call the ffnbot, per rule 8.

It's also kind of a doorstopper of a fic, at around 200 chapters last I looked. Not light reading.

**** Those are both accurate descriptions, although I can't say for sure if it's the one you're thinking of. Something tells me it wouldn't be the only one.

*** Who's the author? There's a dozen and one HP fics with 'second chance' in the title and my Google-foo is weak today.
