Pretty much the title. Looking for some kinky, dirty, smutty Harry/fem!Voldemort action. Any story where Voldemort is trying to coax the cum out of Harry and begging him to cum in her is a plus.

*** There is HP/fem!LV ? It's quite some time ago since I read it, and I can't remember this "pairing" in this fic.

**** If I recall correctly there isn't. At some point, however, Voldemort summons a female version of himself and she immediately sets out to attack and kill Harry's harem. His harem then proceeds to literally fuck her to death with their futa cocks.

It's a great story.

** It is still in progress and it hasn't fully dived into the smut yet but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13800042/chapters/31727376][Datura]] is a pretty thrilling tale of lust and fear between Harry and Voldemort.

*** Not really. Each chapter is basically a repeat of the last. There's no real plot, Harry is a little bitch, and it's basically all a pointless 7 chapter build up to a smut chapter.

**** I disagree for the most part, I think the story would benefit from Harry taking any sort of action outside of running away but that's really it. When it comes to shorter pieces like this I don't mind a missing plot as long as the character interaction is executed well enough.

There is content out there that is enjoyable even without a real plotline. The show Letterkenny has seen some recent success despite only paying lip service to the idea of a plot every few episodes per season. I don't see a reason why this can't be the same in fanfiction.

** Bump, hoping to see any more suggestions.

Maybe Ao3 would have more of this stuff?
