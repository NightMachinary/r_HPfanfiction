I'm not 100% sure if this would even exist, but I'd like to find a fic that either focuses on or at least includes a post-war Lavender Brown where she survives Fenrir Greyback's attack and has to deal with the lasting effects of her injuries. I would like it to be a more serious fic, or at least one with a substantial plot.


** Linkffn(Stars Fall by Lady Altair)

This is the author of Cauterize, a fourshot. Very solid.

  A post DH AU in three parts. We all craft our own happy endings. Even in the best of all possible worlds, romances decay and constellations fall from the sky, but Remus Lupin will pin them back up in a world that has already forgotten what he sacrificed.
