** I also liked Reign of the Serpent, but be aware that even if it's quite long it's still abandoned. I don't think there was a cliffhanger, but I definitely wanted more when I was through with it lol

Somebody also mentioned the Firebird trilogy.. that qualifies, but its also... problematic in my opinion. I managed to make it about halfway through the first installment before I noped out.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* from DLP.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow) has Voldemort as ruler of basically all of magical Europe-but he's pretty sane and his rule is orderly. The fix puts Harry in Durmstrang where elite Death Eaters are trained and he tries to fix the world from within the system. It's one of my favorites!

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
