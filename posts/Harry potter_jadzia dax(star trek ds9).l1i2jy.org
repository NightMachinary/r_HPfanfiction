This pairing came to me as a shower thought and I didnt really find much and as I'm a horrible writing I want to see if anyone else knew of something I didnt. Also I think this could work well because of the dax symbiote and if harry was immortal or something due to the master of death thing or somehow meets her twice due to time travel.


** OMG we need an infusion of trek xovers, stat.

I want Voldy to meet his mirror universe self.

I want Snape and Spock to compare notes on shutting down their emotions.

I want to put Lucius Malfoy in a room with Lwaxana Troi.

I want Tonks and Odo to get super freaky deaky with the morphing/shifting.

... and this is all just what I've got off the top of my head!!

*** I kinda want to see manipulative!Dumbledore get a stern dressing down from Picard. Or get punched in the face by Sisko. Or both.

** I don't think I ever saw that pairing, closest pairing I saw is Harry and an OC Klingon girl(in one of the best crossover HP/ST fics I ever read).

It should be also remembered that having the symbiote doesn't mean they are the same person, it's more like the inherit some memories and feelings, but each is a separate individual.

See how Ezri was different from Jadzia, making my man Worf really sad.

Hmm, I could see them getting closer by having Jadzia teaching Harry self defense and about the Federation and the Galaxy.
