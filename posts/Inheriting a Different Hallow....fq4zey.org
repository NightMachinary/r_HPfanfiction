A slight tweak to the legend of the Deathly Hallows...

The brother that learned to value and respect the inevitability of Death, who appreciated that life was not eternal and one should never want it to be, the brother who greeted Death as an old friend and passed his Hallow down to his son was Cadmus Peverell. Not Ignotus.

Antioch's fate remains the same. An arrogant, bloodthirsty wizard who fell to the conniving of a more cunning adversary.

Ignotus was a crafty wizard, his new cloak used to give Death itself the slip wherever he could. Reeking chaos and mischief under a Cloak that not even the Reaper itself could find him under. Only to trip on a root whilst fleeing the scene of a crime one day, foot twisting and snapping as he fled. Causing the youngest Peverell brother to collapse onto the rock that split his skull. His corpse discovered a year after the fact, laying cold and rotting and entirely invisible until then...

Unlike the others, Cadmus had always been the more temperate of the two. Antioch a man of bluster and boasting. Ignotus one of snide and cunning. Cadmus was quieter, calmer, a man with much less to prove and even less of a desire to showcase it.

He knew immediately that the soul of his beloved had no place in this world. Casting her back into the void with tearful apologies initially, though the two were able to come to some understanding in subsequent visits. The dead had no place in the world of the living, and Death could never truly be undone, it was this method of thinking that would define the magic he and descendants would go on to privately pioneer.

Death was a part of life, an unavoidable inevitability that should not be feared. Cadmus taught this to his son before he first pressed the Resurrection Stone into his palm; years on he then did the same to his.

When the Peverell's eventually married into the Potter family, this philosophy became theirs. Thus allowing them to appropriately covet and appreciate the artefact that came with their families union.

The Stone was a tool for knowledge and for comfort. It taught the ways of old and allowed closure for the living with those deceased. A reminder that they were not truly gone, and they would be together again in the future. Proof that Death would NEVER be the end.

All culminating in 1991, when a spindly child with big green eyes and a lightning bolt scar found an odd package among the smattering of Christmas presents he had not been expecting to receive. A gift from a mysterious source that had once belonged to his father (and had been used for no shortage of mischief in his time), a declaration that it was high time it was returned to him, with a solemn order to use it wisely...

On Christmas Day, Harry James Potter twirled the Resurrection Stone between his fingers. He and Ron Weasley were left speechless at the result...

《Additionally, Voldemort uses the Invisibility Cloak as a Horcrux instead》

** There's a fic with a similar, though different premise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8092431/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spirits-Within]]. It's been a while since I read it, but essentially James and Lily's souls are put into Harry when Voldemort attacks. The quality is ultimately dubious, though, with the typical signs of poor quality such Dumbledore bashing, mindscapes, etc. But it fits the prompt somewhat and you might be interested.

Harry dropped the pretty rock, eye twitching. They weren't letting him get a word in edgewise. He was only absentmindedly swirling the pretty rock around in his hand before two ghosts appeared and started talking about- Wait, they suspiciously look like his parents. Hmm... He must have gotten into Seamus' stash of whiskey again, and forgot he even did it... Yes, that's it.

** Love it, but I think it'd need to be someone other than Dumbledore who gives it to Harry or else we might see a very different Dumbledore than canon. We know he'd be tempted to use it, especially since it isn't cursed, and it can be argued that a lot of the poor decisions Dumbledore makes (of we ignore the plot necessity of them) are due to his compromised judgement stemming from Ariana's death. I suspect a Dumbledore who's been able to get closure from that incident would be very different, and likely far more competent, than canon Dumbledore. Not necessarily a bad thing, but harder to write certainly.

*** I think it would still work with Dumbledore for that exact reason. If he was able to seek closure in regards to Arianna, in the same way the Potters & Peverell's did in this timeline with their loved ones, I think he would become more proactive and lead to a different approach to Voldemort and Harry.

Additionally, if Voldemort had the Cloak as his Hallow Horcrux I feel like he'd actually use it more and be even more of a threat. Almost like a Rogue or an Assassin, than a magical juggernaut.

**** But he made a Horcrux out of the cloak, so maybe he wouldn't use it and instead hide it? Maybe he decided that he's powerful enough to rely on the cloak of invisibility. After all, he could make himself invisible with charms just fine. And the fairy tale about "hiding from Death's sight" is surely overblown and can not possibly be a literal description?

Remember, he did nothing with the Stone. He could summon ancient powerful wizards and learn their secrets and spells but he didn't do it. Maybe he didn't know or didn't connect the fairy tale to the objects and considers them just very powerful artefacts, and the Cloak then would be just that - an invisibility cloak, with very long-lasting charms, just an heirloom in that atrocious family.

***** My theory on that is the ring was a Gaunt family heirloom. He recognised it as something important to his family and thus that made it Horcrux fodder. I sincerely doubt he even knew how to use it or what it was and simply turned it into a Horcrux for that reason alone.

However, there is no way in hell Voldemort would completely throw away an Invisibility Cloak that had been passed down in his family for generations. He'd likely he immediately in awe/suspicious of the item and undoubtedly would make the link between it and the Hallows. Likely hunting for them much earlier than he did in canon.

I like to think he'd taunt Dumbledore in the Ministry duel for needing the Elder Wand to combat him. Maybe even sending Malfoy to kill Dumbledore AND retrieve the wand so he could kill him and take it for himself. Killing Snape a lot earlier (if he was still the one who executed Dumbledore).

How, though? It's not as if the Deathly Hallows mark is engraved on the cloak. And there are other cloaks of the invisibility in the wizarding world. When Draco saw Harry with the Cloak (on the train before 6th year), he just covered him with it back. So, for the one who doesn't know that it's really The Cloak, it's just a usual one, everyone can buy it or charm it themselves.

Why would be an heirloom in the family? Well, they were poor as hell and still clang for the title of a pureblood family descended from Salazar Slytherin. They are bound to have an heirloom. Why just a cloak? Well, the charms on it are surely very good and it's not as if they could afford to buy another one, so they just passed it down in the family. It's probably the last heirloom they had, having sold other pricey objects.

******* An Invisibility Cloak that has lasted centuries, even in canon it jumps out to Hermione and Ron as being suspicious that the Cloak is that good and has lasted that long. To an arguably wiser and definitely more intelligent Dark Lord (and maybe his early followers as well) that fact would be apparent and lead him to suspicion. Since the Tale is a fairly common wizarding fairytale I can see Voldemort quickly finding out what it is.

And you kinda just said my point for me, the Gaunt's would see the Cloak as far too useful to sell (especially as they'd never be able to buy another one, let alone of similar quality). Like the Ring, Voldemort would find it and 'pocket' it when he went to kill his uncle, then he'd likely do his own little observations of the Cloak and eventually reach the correct conclusion about it.
