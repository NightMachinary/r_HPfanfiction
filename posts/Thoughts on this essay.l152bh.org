** I really struggle to understand why people care so much. I like the canon ships, but I really couldn't give a fig if others don't. They're fictional characters and everyone is going to interpret them differently and apply their own ideas of what "works" romantically. It doesn't really matter and people seem to spend a lot of time and energy trying to convince people of something g that really boils down to a matter of taste and opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a simple boy who, each year, wishes to have no drama or adventure.
#+end_quote

​

i agree with almost everything except this, this is something common I've seen a lot and its simply not true.

while its true harry hates his fame and would obviously rather have parents than be the boy who lived its shown pretty early and multiple times over that harry would rather be in the thick of it rather than out of it. And not just because of the prophecy, Dumbledore even explains this in HBP.

​

#+begin_quote
  "But, sir," said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or --"

  "Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!"

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it."

  "Of course you would!" cried Dumbledore. "You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you... which makes it certain, really, that --"

  "That one of us is going to end up killing the other," said Harry.

  "Yes."

  But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew--and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents--that there was all the difference in the world.

Hate to be that guy, and I'm not saying that romione shippers don't do this, and I'm sure this is common in every ship, but from my experiences, harmony shippers are notorious of this, they only accept what they want to accept, about Hermione's character generally, and ignore things that don't fit their narrative of the character, deeming it OOC.

** Ship wars are the worst part of every fandom. Like, I understand everyone likes different things. I personally really don't like Harry/Ginny mostly because of the way their "romance" was portrayed in the books (it turned me off the pairing once and for all), but also because, in my opinion, Ginny is really boring. Still, there are people who love this pairing and why shouldn't they?

I hate the way the fans of every ship feel the need to make their ship "the one and only true ship", and preach to the world why they're right and everyone else is wrong. Frankly, it's what turned me away from Harmony - not only the fics are full of stupid tropes and rather boring, but most of the fans seem to be ready to tear down every character that stands on Harry and Hermione's way to get together.

*** I too don't like ship wars and my essay is addressing a very specific group of canon shippers who do exactly what I specified in the essay: those who demean and lower Hermione in intelligence, worth, and character and give Ron or even Ginny her actions to give them more character specifically. The canon shippers who do this tend to not even show they like Hermione as a character or person. I was not commenting on the ships as a whole or even saying Harmony is the one true ship. From the beginning I specified the type of canon shippers subject to the reason for the essay.

I myself have many different ships for Harry Potter, not just Harmony. If anyone took time to fully read my essay word for word without making false inferences or assumptions on my statements, no one would be claiming I'm preaching of Harmony being the one pairing that makes sense. My arguments are based on canon moments and using the canon to criticize characters seems to be a bad thing to do when people know you like Harmony.

Why Harmony is the top ship Romione and Hinny shippers end up in arguments with I do not understand. No other ship gets this much hate. People here claim it's the Harmony shippers themselves, but the thing is that most Harmony shippers don't bash or hate Ron or Ginny, they just don't agree with the canon relationship. The Harmony shippers that stand out to canon shippers are those who bash and show they deeply dislike canon through stories of Ron or Ginny doing heinous acts and such. But that isn't the Harmony shippers as a whole. Just like I don't think all Romione and Hinny shippers are filled with so much hate and spite for a non-canon ship.

Shipping Hinny and Romione is fine, the essay addresses those who attribute non-canon characteristics and events to the ships while claiming those added things to be canon. If people can add non-canon attributes to make Hinny and Romione work, then what is the issue with Harmony? Romione and Hinny shippers always claim that to make Harmony work, attributes and characteristics would have to be changed. Most Harmony shippers I've spoke with use pure canon events to fuel their support for the ship, why is that an issue?

#+end_quote

That's something I unfortunately find hard to believe. I've read through a lot of posts in the H/Hr sub, and while my appreciation for the bond between Harry and Hermione has deepened, I've also noticed that *nearly every single post that mentions Ron, talks about him in a negative light* (and even if it isn't in the post itself, the bashing is usually found in the comments). And don't even get me started on the fanfics...

It really frustrates me, because I love the friendship between Harry and Hermione, and I would probably enjoy reading stories in which their friendship developed into a romance. However, every single H/Hr story I've read (except two) contain bashing (and usually wildly out-of-character characters).

I honestly don't think that the hate comes from the pairing itself.

** There is no way that I am reading all of that, especially since I should be sleeping right now.

But the first two paragraphs make it clear that the author is biased against Ron and thinks that canon shippers are delusional.

#+begin_quote
  Communities in sites like Reddit heavily promote and recycle the same canon thoughts and images, but the notable top subject of these Harry Potter communities is their bordering obsession over giving Ron Weasley more props or candor for things he said and did in book and movie canon. After Ron, the next Weasley put on a pedestal is Ginny Weasley. The once fangirl who, unlike all the other fans of Harry's, was able to get close to him through his connection to her brother and family.
#+end_quote

And now I'm convinced that the author is delusional. Since when has Ron praise ever been the top subject of any major Harry Potter community? And since when had Ginny praise ever been even barely noticeable? Maybe I'm just out of touch because I only really interact with fanfic communities (where Ron and Ginny bashing are much, much more common than praise for them), but it really feels like the author is just upset that their Ron bashing comments keep getting shot down and downvoted, so they created some huge conspiracy in their head to explain it.

I also think the author likely completely missed the fact that, ironically enough, everything they said about Ron in that paragraph also applies to Hermione.

Basically, when people complain about Harmony shippers being obnoxious, this is exactly what they're talking about. And yes, the Romione shippers and the Hinny shippers and the Haphne shippers and all the others can be just as bad. But as a +filthy multishipper+ connoisseur of many fine ships, I can tell you that all of your ships can be enjoyable, but your arguments are all dumb.

A writer is free to do whatever they want with their characters, of course. But if a writer wants their characters to be believable and well-written then they have to adhere to certain self-imposed limitations.

When JKR wrote the 7th book, she could've made Harry fall madly in love with Goyle and then have him start badmouthing mudbloods.

With your logic, we have to shut up and accept this.

Well that's not how it works. When a writer does an oopsie, then the readers are right to reject it as "unrealistic".

** Author of the essay here:

The point of my essay is to point out the actions of canon shippers who change the actions and characteristics of Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and even Harry. I do not claim or infer that one ship is better than the other in my essay. I instead have pointed out common tropes or qualities canon shippers often give to Hinny and Romione. Only mentioning the Harmony ship a few times.

My reasoning for making this essay is so that the actions of canon shippers who feel the need to attack ships such as Harmony, change the characteristics of characters, and show spite towards those who do not share the same ship are addressed. The point of the essay is to show that canon shippers who change Hermione, Ron, and Ginny do so in a way that tends to sway in favor of two over one.

To crossposte my essay without my knowledge to a place it will be attacked and used to gather spite and hate is sad to see. I made my essay in mind to not bash the characters of Ron, Hermione, Ginny, or Harry. If you feel either Ginny or Ron were bashed, it was not my intention, I simply used and referred to book canon for my evidence. No empty statements were made that weren't based from actions and statements in the books with little mention of the movies.

As far as fanfiction, I can agree that Ginny and Romione can be written well and better than what was provided in canon. The fact remains that characterization of characters have to be changed in order to provide a true healthy romance/relationship for Hinny and Romione.

****** You are right, he's not explicitly pleased each time she cries and storms, he just shows he didn't care. Indifference or flat noted tones used when he speaks after makes it seem her reaction had little effect on him by showing no remorse or care.

PoA:

“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,” Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet. “I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway...” She glanced over at Ron too. “He doesn't want me to join in.” There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them ---” Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight. “Can't you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly. “No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry --- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.”

It is actually in Goblet of Fire he's pleased to see her storming off and we later see it inferred that she had cried.

GoF:

“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum ---” But Ron ignored Harry too. “Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are,” said Ron. “Don't call him Vicky!” Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.

******* We don't know that he doesn't care, though. In many cases, people put on a look of indifference but actually feel guilt. For example, when he calls Hermione a nightmare, it's clear he feels guilty because he looks "uncomfortable" and "awkward". However, because of his guilt he tries to justify what he has said (not to Harry, but to himself) but saying that she must have noticed she had no friends. He doesn't genuinely think what he did is right, he just wants to remove the guilt he feels because it hurts knowing that you've hurt another person. Also, there's a huge difference between actually feeling happy with what you've done, and feeling indifferent. He's hurt because Hermione isn't showing any concern about the supposed death of his pet, so he tries to make her feel guilty (which is petty, I know, I'm not defending what he said), but it's also understandable.

And, please, tell me where it is inferred that Hermione cried at the Yule Ball, because I've reread that chapter and I can't find what you're looking for. You're right, though. Hermione didn't cry (at least, the text doesn't say she does), but Ron did watch in satisfaction as she stormed off. I completely forgot about that.

However, your original statement was this:

#+begin_quote
  Most common are scenes where Hermione and Ron argue or are commenting towards each other. The end result of their arguments and words more often is Hermione in tears, about to cry, and running away from the room with Ron pleased with these results.
#+end_quote

You said that most scenes between Hermione and Ron involve them arguing or making [mean?] comments towards each other. That isn't true.

You then said that more often than not, their arguments end in tears (or running away from the room) with Ron being "pleased". Again, this isn't true.

They spend a lot of time with each other without arguing, and when they do "argue" its usually just bickering (which is more often than not light-hearted bickering and teasing). Ron makes Hermione cry seven times in the series (and in two of these examples she's crying from happiness) - at least, that's what I've counted, I may have missed something. I haven't counted the times Harry made her cry, but I can think of five times off the top of my head. That doesn't mean that Harry is mean, or cruel, or a bully, or anything like that. It means that friends have fights, and friends make each other cry. And that's fine.

Let's have a look at this text:

#+begin_quote
  "You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams," Hermione said now, "because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night."

  *Harry threw Ron a furious look.* Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself.

  "You were only muttering a bit," he mumbled apologetically. "Something about 'just a bit further'."

  "I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch," *Harry lied brutally.* "I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle."

  Ron's ears went red. *Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure*; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
#+end_quote

Can I get this one piece of text, and claim: /"Harry frequently targets Ron's insecurities and feels pleased about it"?/ No, of course not! Just because Ron feels satisfied in /one single/ occasion when he upsets Hermione, that doesn't mean that "most" of their fights end that way. The same way that I wouldn't pick out the one time when Harry sends Hedwig to peck at his friends and doesn't feel any guilt when he sees the Hermione's cuts, and then use to it to make extremely exaggerated claims.

#+end_quote

I was looking at this passage in some detail a few weeks ago, because I myself had thought I remembered some sort of "apology" of sorts from Ron after the troll incident. Except instead of finding one, I found this instead afterward:

#+begin_quote
  "We should have got more than ten points," Ron grumbled.

  "Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."

  "Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. *"Mind you, we* */did/* *save her."*

  "She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," Harry reminded him.
#+end_quote

What Harry /doesn't/ remind Ron at that moment of is that she probably wouldn't have needed saving if Ron hadn't driven her to tears so that she ended up crying alone in the bathroom in the first place.

And Ron can't even be grateful to Hermione for outright /lying/ to teachers to defend him and Harry without "grumbling" over points and feeling the need to point out "Mind you, we /did/ save her."

Sorry, but despite the one mention of "uncomfortable" you point out earlier, this exchange doesn't show /guilt/ from Ron at all, let alone actual remorse (or the imagined apology that I went looking for in the first place).

If we're going to bring up context, we need to look at /all/ of the Ron context. And this is what I meant in my other reply to a post of yours recently. There's a surprising amount of conflicting issues around his character when you read closely.

You clearly overlooked the first part of what he had said. Yes, he pointed out the fact that he had saved her life (which I, personally, definitely think deserves some credit, as /he had literally risked his life to save hers/). He also points out that it was good of her to get them out of trouble (which sounds like somebody who is grateful). He even thanked her for getting them out of trouble:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, *they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.*

  But from that moment on, *Hermione Granger became their friend.* There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
#+end_quote

No, we don't see an apology (though it's possible he did apologize in private). However, given the fact that he had saved her life, risking his own in the process, I think that makes up for speaking about her behind her back (which I'm pretty certain that every single human being has done before).

********** I didn't "overlook it" As I said repeatedly in my comments to you, I'm about seeing the /balance/. Ron has good features and bad features. You want to complain about those who see the bad. You want to emphasize the good. Fine. But there's both there.

/That/ was my point. At no point have I claimed that Ron doesn't do good things.

#+begin_quote
  He's clearly ashamed of what he's said.
#+end_quote

I think he feels bad that he made someone cry. Yes, I agree. But actual guilt or remorse at the sentiment he expressed? We don't actually see that. Maybe it happens, but we don't see it -- instead we get him sniping about her later.

#+begin_quote
  I think that makes up for speaking about her behind her back (which I'm pretty certain that every single human being has done before).
#+end_quote

Have I ever said something so mean to someone that it caused him/her to run away crying and then bitched about the fact that I had to go in and help said person later? No, I can't say I've done that myself. Yes, Ron deserves credit for bravery here (even though it's doubtful he would have gone had Harry not prompted him to, even if Ron had even remembered Hermione). But again my point is to see all of this in context. You can't just ignore what he says later and then say, "Oh, it's possible he did apologize in private."

This is precisely what I meant by "missed opportunities" for Ron that I brought up in my other reply to you. I /want/ to like Ron, and then he goes and says something like that, rather than being nicer to the person who he hurt badly in the first place.

*********** Thanks for replying!

It's just you claimed that Ron wasn't grateful to Hermione, and the /"good of her to get us out of trouble like that"/ and the /"thanks"/ suggests that he is.

Isn't feeling guilty when you feel bad? I don't know. For me, that's all basically the same thing. I'm not saying that he felt extreme guilt or remorse to the point that he was awake at night thinking about it, but he definitely recognized that he done the wrong thing and felt bad about it.

Have I made somebody cry before? I don't know. I hope not. But I have insulted somebody behind their back without them overhearing it.

#+begin_quote
  Ron was in a very bad temper by the end of the class.

  "It's no wonder no one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor. "She's a nightmare, honestly."

  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.
#+end_quote

I know that when I was eleven years old I probably complained to my friends about how annoying another person is. It's something a lot (if not most) children do. They get annoyed by somebody in class, and the first thing they do is vent their frustration to their friends. If you have never said anything mean about another person behind their backs then I am full of admiration because I think that most people do at some point in their lives.

Personally, I criticize Ron a lot more for, say, this:

#+begin_quote
  “Well -- you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I'd rather go alone than with -- with Eloise Midgen, say.”

  “Her acne's loads better lately -- and she's really nice!”

  “Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.
#+end_quote

He's not eleven any more. He's fourteen. Sure, he's probably not the first fourteen year old boy to call another girl ugly, but that doesn't make it right at all. Eloise hasn't done anything to him. In his first year, he was frustrated and in a bad mood. He vented said frustration to his friend. In this example, he seems to be insulting Eloise Midgen for no reason whatsoever (not to mention that I hate the whole "I'll only take the prettiest girl to the dance" thing -- I'm so glad that he grew out of that later in the series).

I probably should have made myself clearer in my other comment. I blame him, as in I think what he said was wrong. I don't blame him, as in I don't hold the fact that she was almost killed by a troll over him, nor do I think it's exactly the most terrible thing a person can do.

Also, I don't think Ron's "reluctance" to save Hermione comes from him not caring about her, but rather from simple common sense. Let's put it into a similar scenario: there's a fire in the school (not a fire drill, but an actual fire). A student is still in the school, and possibly has no way to get out. What would I do? Run into the school, risking my own life, to save her myself? Or tell a teacher, which would be safer and smarter? I, personally, would tell a teacher. Ron hesitated for a split-second, probably thinking about what a dumb and dangerous idea it is to run around the school with a troll on the loose. He then agreed, and went to warn Hermione. He also ended up saving her life. So, I don't see it as /"I don't like Hermione. Why should I bother about her?"/. I see it as /"I'm a kid who knows basically no magic. This is a dumb idea"/. He could have simply refused, and then Hermione would be dead.

I'm not saying that he did apologize. It's also easily possible that he didn't. I'm just saying that a lot of things happen in the background, and it's impossible to say that definitely didn't apologize. I imagine that if there /was/ an apology it would be an awkward apology that went on just between Ron and Hermione (when Harry is playing quidditch, or something). But, you're right. It's impossible to say whether he did apologize or not.

Also, when did he snipe about Hermione later? I mean, they've both bickered and insulted each other, but I'm not sure what you're referring to?

************ People can sometimes feel bad that they hurt someone but not necessarily regret the actual sentiment of what was said. It's common enough that we actually have a saying something like, "I don't regret it -- I regret that I /got caught/." We see -- through implication -- that Ron likely regrets he /got caught/ saying something badly about Hermione that /caused/ her to cry. Do we know that he actually /regrets/ saying something badly about Hermione in general? If she hadn't overheard him and if there had been no repercussions, would he have felt guilty about it later?

/That's/ what I'm referring to. I have no doubt that he regrets that Hermione ended up crying. What I'm bringing up is the fact that we don't know whether he feels guilty about the actual sentiment of his words.

And "sniping" was perhaps the wrong word. What I meant was complaining. Ron clearly feels like he deserves a bit of tit-for-tat when he comes off with his, "Mind you, we did save her..." comment later. It's not even strictly a "complaint," I suppose, but it's not a particularly /nice/ way of seeing the situation, given that he contributed to creating it in the first place.

Yes, he's young here. Again, I'm not at all saying kids that age don't do bad things to each other. Of course they do. And they don't have a lot of emotional maturity. But in this particular circumstance, Ron displays some immaturity and lack of perspective about the situation that's disappointing to me... compared to, say, how Harry handles things. (Though even Harry notes the calculation of points and how Hermione's points are detrimental, so I don't let him off the hook entirely either.)

#+end_quote

Please re-read what I said. I never claimed to have never said something bad about someone behind their backs. But when I /have/ done so and have /been caught/ doing so, I don't think I've ever been less than immediately apologetic, even when I was 11. I had enough people pick on me and say bad things about me over the years that I /never/ wanted to imitate such behavior. And, as I said in my previous post, I certainly never complained later that I might have had to help a person I might have hurt in such a manner (or implied that they /owed/ me something for helping them, which is closer to what Ron did).

Try interpreting the tone in that sentence. Why does Ron "snap" here? Why does he say, "oh... all right," rather than, "Oh, you're right!" or "Oh, we'd better help her!" or whatever?

The combination of "snapped" along with the phrasing of his reply at the minimum implies hesitation and likely reluctance.

************** Who is moving any "goalposts"? That qualifiers in that sentence are literally where I got my interpretation about reluctance, because it's very clear there.

And look, I COMPLETELY agree with you that it wouldn't be very rational for a 11-year-old with very little experience to go fight a troll. What is less forgivable (to me) is hesitance or reluctance to at least go /warn/ her, given that he was partly responsible for her being off alone. (Remember: they don't know at this point that they're going to have to /fight/ the troll; Harry's just suggesting that they need to go after Hermione because she wouldn't know about the troll at all.)

Harry, on the other hand, has no hesitance whatsoever (because Harry's an impulsive idiot, frankly... but he also does so because of his "saving people thing" and likely because he feels guilt by association since he knew what Ron had said).

I'm NOT at all arguing any of this from a "Harmony" standpoint. When I'm not on the HPHarmony subreddit, I don't give a crap about arguing about Harmony -- we're talking about Ron's actions here. And I don't think Harry does what he does because he's "in love" with Hermione or any such nonsense. (He barely knows her, they're only 11/12, and they're not even friends yet at this point.) He does it here because /it's the right thing to do/.

Yes, once Ron sees the danger and is actually on scene, he does step up. Which I admitted in my previous post when I said explicitly that Ron "deserves credit for bravery," if you actually read what I wrote, rather than arguing about something you're /imagining/ I'm saying.

**************** I disagree. You obviously interpret Ron's lines there differently, but that was precisely the line I was using to support my point that it IS doubtful Ron would have gone had Harry not prompted him to (which is true -- it was Harry who remembered and thought about Hermione... she wasn't even on Ron's radar at the time). And even IF Ron had remembered Hermione, I doubt he would have gone alone or encouraged Harry to do so, given how he "snapped" at Harry and gave a minimally positive "Oh, all right..." with a qualifier (don't let Percy see us...).

Ron is reluctant here. Yes, he goes, but there's absolutely NO evidence in the text that (1) Ron would have even bothered to think about Hermione and how she was likely out there alone without Harry's reminder, nor (2) Ron would have voluntarily said, "Let's go find her" without Harry's prompting. Instead, the circumstantial evidence suggests reluctance, which was precisely my initial point that you quoted.

The goalposts are the same. We're just arguing about whether the ball went through them or not.

EDIT: And by the way, I have no idea if you "ship" anyone, nor do I really care. But the way you're arguing suggests that you want to irrationally imbue some 11-year-old boy with a desire to save the girl he will ultimately end up with, when we have no evidence that Ron feels that way at that time. They're not friends even... yet. Ron has absolutely no reason to care about this girl, and why /should/ he risk his life for her? Harry shouldn't either, but as we later find out, Harry has this "saving people thing" (which this is probably the first exemplar of). Again, I give Ron credit for stepping up, for going along with Harry, and ultimately for facing off against the troll. It's really quite something, and I completely admire him for that. But I stand by my assessment that Ron wasn't thinking about Hermione earlier, and even if he had, his fear of the troll (and of his brother disciplining him) would have kept him from going after Hermione. Harry's initiative, though, is enough the pull Ron along -- which is still credit to his character, /but/ there's still reluctance. If there weren't, JKR would not have written that line that way. I suggest you may try to take a step back if you're viewing this in a Ron/Hermione lens and ask what the line is really implying.

Second, it's not Ron's fault that Hermione got nearly killed ny the troll. It's Voldemort and Quirrell. Ron's only fault is that he talked bad about Hermione behind her back.

And a more apologetic (or even self-aware) person would have realized that he had contributed to setting up the situation that happened, rather than feeling like he should have to view it as a tit-for-tat kind of exchange (i.e. she lied for us, but the implication is that she /should/ because obviously we saved her).

Ron's obviously not responsible for the troll. The question is whether he's taking responsibility for his actions -- that's the subject I was discussing in the previous post. And the circumstantial evidence is... he's not really thinking much about it later, no.

Again, as I've said in multiple other posts here, Ron is 11 years old. I don't necessarily expect a huge amount of self-awareness like this. But if he really was sorry for making Hermione run away crying, he wouldn't have made a comment later like that. That's ALL I was saying.

Okay, now that I have read the entire thing, not only will I sand by everything I said before, I would also like to add that the essay was incredibly poorly written (huge walls of rambling text that go nowhere, no conclusion, no purpose, and no connection to the idea of the stages of grief that you lead with), and that you were also wrong about just about everything. The one point I think that pretty much everyone will agree with is that Ginny was incredibly underdeveloped throughout the series, especially in the first four or five books, and that does make the Hinny relationship hard to work with. But everything else is misguided, missing context, or just flat out wrong.

And you know what? When you're writing fanfics, that's okay. Romance was a pretty minor part of the books, so any fic that wants to make romance a major part of it is going to have to make some big changes, especially if the characters are getting together earlier than in canon.

Probably because it was a slog to read through, and the only thought it provokes is "this is wrong."

#+begin_quote
  The ones who said that I made some points were immediately downvoted. The dismissal and aggravation in these comments proved that there definitely are canon shippers completely unwilling to tolerate Harmony, as well as those who support the ship.

And on the Harmony sub, the person who disagreed with some of your points was immediately downvoted and received no real response. The dismissal and aggravation there proved that there definitely are Harmony shippers completely unwilling to tolerate any disagreement. So much for being "neutral ground."

#+begin_quote
  I won't claim there aren't Harmony shippers who don't push back when attacked by comments, but there has to be a point where this behavior must be thoroughly addressed and settled.
#+end_quote

Then your essay should have been "We should all respect everyone else's shipping preferences and not harass them for it" instead of "Canon ships are trash and Harmony is better." The fact that you seem to think that the way to settle the issue is for everyone to accept Harmony as the One True Pairing is exactly what is wrong with everything you wrote.
