  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

**** Personally, I think Innocent is fantastic, but everyone has different tastes.

What it does have is Sirius doing his best, Harry getting to have some semblance of a childhood (with some upheaval, but still, from age eight onwards he has a caring parent), earlier occurrences of many good things like Weasley friendships and Remus meeting Tonks, and a disturbing-yet-plausible reason for Draco redemption.

And it doesn't have power-ups being dropped in anyone's lap; no special Black family magic that lets Sirius disown Bellatrix and annul the Malfoys' marriage, nor amulets left by James and Lily to protect Harry from every bad thing that happens in canon, nor discovery of hidden talents for wandless magic and legilimency. Harry does eventually become an Animagus, but that's entirely plausible when being raised by a Marauder, and it still takes him years.

Mostly I just love seeing Harry get an actual home.

** Oh, thats my favourite theme. Here are some of my favourites:

linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black]]) is one of the best imho; it also has a sequel. Although Harry is raised by Sirius and Lupin, the story starts from Harry's first year. Both Sirius and Remus are Hogwarts professors.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4431766/1/Harry-Black]])Harry is raised as Sirius' son in order to protect him from Voldemort and Death Eaters. James and Lily are alive, but they do not know that Harry is their son.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11986362/1/I-ll-Stay]]) is a short fic (20-30k), but definitely a must-read. The relationship between Harry and Sirius is very beautiful.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12262029/1/Heartbeat]]) is similar to the previous one (one-shot)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12312217/1/Harry-s-New-Home]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12078305/3/A-Gift-of-Love]]) Both of them seem to be abandoned, but I still think they are worth reading.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/662406/1/Of-Western-Stars]])

This one does not really fit your request, but I hope you won't mind me adding it. A one-shot about Harry's birth from Sirius' POV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243167/1/Fumbles-Up-Those-Stairs]])

If you read them, let me know what you think:)

  The bond between a Godfather and his Godson is a phenomenal one. Through the years, if there's anything that can be known with certainty, it's that Sirius Black will stay, no matter what, with his Godson. No slash, godfather-godson bonding fic. AU, Sirius doesn't die, and he raises Harry. T for slight language.

  6 year old Harry Potter has nothing but a vague memory of being loved; of a life before he had been left at the hands of the Dursleys. One person hasn't forgotten, though, and when Sirius saves Harry from his abusive relatives, can he fix the damage done, and give Harry the life James and Lily wanted for him? WARNING-ABUSIVE DURSLEYS! Sirius never in Azkaban, Genius!Powerful!Harry.
