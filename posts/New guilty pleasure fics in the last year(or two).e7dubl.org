Stories that started in 2018 or 2019.

And by guilty pleasure I mean the tropes that everyone else seems to hate. Lord Potter-Black etc and uses it to do something good like bring in family members and protect them, or just to seek protection from a manipulative Dumbledore. Bashing but not too extreme. Harry and/or Hermione time traveling to Marauders Era. Hermione being pureblood. Soulbonds. Betrothed. Black family politics. Pureblood culture and politics. Good Malfoys (think An Unexpected Malfoy).\\
Those specific tropes, not everything else :) needs to take place during Hogwarts years, not after

I'll take any pairing as long as it's not canon or really weird like Snape/Hermione or Harry, Voldemort (Tom Riddle)/Harry or Hermione. That means no Harry/Ginny and no Hermione/Ron. No Mpreg!

At least 60k wording. I've tried searching on my own both here and on ff.net and ao3 but haven't had much luck.

Thank you!

  It was the summer of love . . . er, no, not really. Left waiting for the Dursleys, Harry is found by the last person he'd expect to see. *NOW COMPLETE*

**** I'm not trying to be rude here, I'm really not, but I specified stories started in either 2018 or 2019. And stories with the tropes I listed. Your rec fits neither. But thanks :)
