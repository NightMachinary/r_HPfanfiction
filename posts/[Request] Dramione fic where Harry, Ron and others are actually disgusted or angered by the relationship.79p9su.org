I never read Dramione as I find the pairing utterly implausible. But I'm willing to give it a shot as I'm looking to expand my reading list.

But I would like to read a fic where Ron, Harry, Ginny and the Weasleys are genuinely disgusted/angered/betrayed by her dating Draco, especially Ron. Based on canon, I can't possibly envision a scenario where Ron would be accepting of this (ironic since Dramione itself is impossible), yet I have skimmed a couple of fics where he seems to come around rather quickly to the idea. Basically, I want a realistic reaction to an unrealistic event.\

Strongly prefer Harry/Ginny to remain and wouldn't mind seeing Hermione trying to get the four of them to be friends, double date, etc.

Also would like to read a fic where Draco taunts Ron about being with Hermione, or just is shown to still be the jerk he always was.


** What fics have you been reading? Cause the majority of the dramione fics I've read, albeit not that many, have had Harry and Ron not be that approving of their relationship.

*** Honestly can't remember them. It was only a couple. I figured as much that most fics would have it being an issue but not sure how many treat it as outright betrayal. IMO, this is something Ron would absolutely stop speaking with Hermione over. Ginny too and maybe Harry.

*** Exactly what I was thinking. I think I've only read a handful of fics where they /aren't/ disgusted by her relationship.
