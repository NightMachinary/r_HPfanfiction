*** So the very first chapter of Amalgum-Lockhart's Folly has Ron bashing (in front of the entire Great Hall, no less), because apparently Harry!Lockhart decides that clearly Ron is the reason young Harry was shit at fighting Voldemort. Definitely not off to a great start.

When in Doubt, Obliviate is pretty good though.

****** Yeah it had potential, if it went into the cracky territory of Seventh Horcrux it could have been good, but between the constant over the top bashing and the truly horrendous amount of stupid names for Voldemort and Dumbledore just left a terrible impression by the time I slogged through to the end.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
