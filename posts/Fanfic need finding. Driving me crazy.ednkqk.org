Essentially Astoria dies on the same night Harry collapses and he gets her heart. Eventually he starts falling in love with Draco because of it. I found it a few months back but can't find it when I really need to read it again. I do believe it was on archive though.

Thanks for the assistance if you have any.


** I have been searching online for hours but can't find it I'm sorry. :( If you do find it I'd love to read it!

*** I found it just now actually. I had it downloaded but couldn't remember the title so I had to go through all of them.

It's nobody tells you how by third eye blinking

It's locked so memberships are needed. No wonder it wouldn't pop up.
