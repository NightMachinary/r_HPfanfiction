I have been a large fan of fics that explain different spells or types of magic. Read one where harry was an apprentice of an enchanter/necromancer which had interesting magical theory's.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him.

** Reccing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] by murkybluematter with the intensity of a thousand suns. :) The following 3 sequels continue in the same vein, or at least with different approaches.

Relevant points:

- introduces how magic can/will manifest differently for each indivudual re: their mindscape and core

- how magic quantity and control might relate to blood status

- redacted spoilers

** Azoth by zeitgeistic on AO3 is really good. One of my favorite fics. Draco becomes Harry's tutor in potions, because Harry wants to get an internship with Snape to become a potions master.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285]]

Summary: "Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care".
