but it won't be finished until the Author gets done with her other Fic, Blindness.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]], linkffn(11580650): Not a good fic in any way, but meets your requirement. Extreme Grangers bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12503328/1/The-Day-the-Magic-Died][The Day the Magic Died]], linkffn(12503328): Only an one-shot that's supposed to become a dimensional travel/crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): This fic has IMO the best Muggle plan, but Muggles didn't win in the end either, and they could get their dues in the sequel.

*** Are they really bashed though in Abraxas? I agree with your assessment of the fic, but the Grangers are really just buying into the propaganda like everyone else. From their perspective, their fear is very understandable.

It's an uncomfortable reality, but human history is filled with people turning against their families or children based on emotions and lies.

It makes a nice counterpoint to the rather ridiculous level some authors go to to make the Grangers amazing parents, when in all honesty they were probably more like the way they are in Prince of Slytherin or Nightmares of Futures Past.
