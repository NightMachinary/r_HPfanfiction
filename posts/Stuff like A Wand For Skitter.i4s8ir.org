#+begin_quote
  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** In the case that you're actually asking for Taylor in Hogwarts fics, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/riding-acromantulas-and-understanding-magical-biology-harry-potter-worm.315253/][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]] has a post-GM Taylor and Amy end up in the place of Hermione and Harry. It's actually pretty well-written, but like most Wormfic is exposition-only before being abandoned.

If you're looking for something with the same degree of violence, check out Forest of Valbone, which is complete. Twelve-year-old Harry goes on a rampage through Wizarding Albania.

The Imposter Complex is updating right now, but is close to completion, and features a reincarnated diary Tom wreaking havoc on Voldemort and his minions. Highly recommended.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
