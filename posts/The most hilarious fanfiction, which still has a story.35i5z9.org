I think the title is self-explanatory, stuff like 'Where in the world is Harry Potter?' comes to mind.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/1/Inspected-By-No-13]]

I also love this one. It is hard to explain a plot summery workout giving too much away, but it is quite good.

** Sword of Gryffindor is pretty good though very smutty.

Also, it isn't Black Comedy where Harry keeps getting attributed these amazing feats in which he didn't actually do anything...is it? Like... walking across the street, followed by deatheaters, who get hit by a bus, and the story is that he lured them there and took out an entire squad without so much as a yawn.

In the story I'm thinking of, he goes by the name Mr Black (or at least, that is what all these amazing things are attributed to)

edit: more info... something about The Professor and Henchgirl...

Not only is it one of the funniest stories I've read; but it has a completed sequel and an uncompleted second sequel. Personally, I think the author's writing style comes closest to matching J.K. Rowling's.
