If a ghost is enough, could blurry vision due to tears cause someone to be Petrified rather than killed?

******** 1. The camera might have been an SLR, it's never explicitly described.

2. The things that were described by [[/u/AlmaLamaEmperorKusko][u/AlmaLamaEmperorKusko]] are all reflections, to which I replied. Then you say that by my logic (i.e. "looking at a reflection helps") Myrtle wouldn't have been affected because of her glasses. See where I'm coming from when I say "dude that's not a reflection"?

3. It might just be that ghosts have different magical properties from glasses, perhaps they retain enough aliveness to half-block the effect, perhaps it's something else, we really don't know.

AU where Colin's camera has filters that incidentally work against the basilisk's glare, anyone? It could be a Twin Lens Reflex camera if it's plot convenient to have Colin Petrified but have captured an image of the basilisk!

***** Okay.

His vision isn't distorted /negatively/ by either of those. Better vision would obviously not hinder a basilisk's killing gaze. But we do know that worsening vision /does/, hence my question: if a ghost messing with your vision is enough, why not tears?

Wait. No you're doing the thinking wrong. That's just your assumption that it doesn't kill you because of worsened vision. I'm uncertain that that is the case.

In my opinion if I wore Harry's glasses (I don't need glasses) I'd still drop dead if I looked the Basilisk in the eyes.

I think so too. Maybe I'm just not making any sense. My general thought is that, outside reflections, if something makes it so the eye isn't clearly distinguishable that it might not kill you. So that if someone with bad vision was looking at it from quite a distance, they'd only be Petrified.

******** If I had to, I would explain it like this: seeing through a ghost isn't like seeing through tears/glasses/windows etc. because what you see through them is a magical/indirect representation of what's behind them, in the vein of a Disillusionment Charm or a reflection. It isn't direct eye contact, thus the petrification.

Not exactly. Lenses adjust the position at which the image formation happens, so that it forms on the retina instead of behind the retina or in front of it. The image is not distorted in any way.

** I'm thinking no. It's not a physics-based attack, it's a magical phenomenon.

We see two things stop it in the books: Reflections and something non-living that saw the gaze before you could. But glasses don't count, apparently, because Myrtle is still wearing her ghost glasses.

In a weirdly philosophical sense, both reflections and those things which soaked up the "killingness" of the gaze can see. Ghosts obviously can see, the camera was largely unharmed but the /film/ was destroyed - and the film can obviously 'see' otherwise how could it record an image? Reflections are stretching it further, but Erised and the multitude of magic mirrors that bitch about your appearance shows us that reflections are, to some degree, things in and of themselves to wizards, so the reflected creature is the one seeing gaze and taking the killing hit. And since it's only a reflection, the full power is not used up and the petrification carries through.

** I'd say no, and here's my interpretation. The Basilisk doesn't have lasers, and nor does it fire off killing curses - yet somehow, it kills. I suggest it's terror that kills you, and that the eyes have something so unnaturally horrifying about them, magically amplified, that the brain refuses to even compute it.

Now, with a large enough distortion, or reflections, you're not getting it directly. Like skyping someone - it's not like actually being in their presence. Since the tears are right up against your eyes, I think that still counts as looking directly in its eyes.
