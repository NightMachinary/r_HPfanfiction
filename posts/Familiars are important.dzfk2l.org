i know that a lot of fics have harry get a Phoenix familiar but thats not what i want

i want a fic where familiars reflect the wizard/witch both in power and personality like dumbledore has fawkes and voldemort has nagini but it shouldn't be unique to have a familiar and familiars and pets should be different


** There was a fic i read once where kids get their familiars when theyre pre young and when they do, they have a certain colour to them (gold, silver, bronze) and depending on ones familiar u have a rank. Harry in the story has a gold snake (?) and is ranked very high, which is uncommon for a half blood. Draco has a silver dragon (?) and ron has a bronze one (cant remember what). From what i remember, it was a harry & draco friendship w slytherin harry.

Lemme know if you want to read it! Ill have to go digging aha

  AU, gen, Harry and Draco friendship. In a world where wizards and witches can sense each other's familiars but no one else can, Harry's impressive familiar makes an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy take more notice of him.

**** Yeah makes sense. Read the books if you can. They're rather nice though they go on a bit of an atheistic bend. Don't know if you'd find that offensive but I thought you ought to know what you're getting into.

** I know a handful of fics that deal with that as a concept, but frankly they are all terrible (and I'm being generous).

More specifically, I think there are reasons why this idea isn't particularly common. For one thing, there aren't 'familiars' in HP anyway. Fawkes, Nagini, Hedwig, Crookshanks, etc. are all /pets/. Their masters own them, in so far as one can 'own' a magical creature anyway (although that is admittedly somewhat nebulous with Fawkes as we do not know yet why he sticks around).

A bigger issue though is that there is already something akin to a familiar as you envision in HP: the Patronus and to a lesser extent the Animagus transformation. The Patronus form embodies an aspect (or aspects) of the caster: Harry's stag represents nobility, family and distance; Hermione's otter embodies inquisitiveness and curiosity; Ron's terrier is loyalty and sociability (read: man's best friend); Dumbledore's phoenix is distant, otherworldly and powerful. Throwing in familiars to HP adds something awkward to the world, and few authors have the breadth of planning/thought needed to work out the implications of such a change.
