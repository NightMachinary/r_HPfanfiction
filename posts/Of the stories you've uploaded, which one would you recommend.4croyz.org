** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Runs Into An Old Muggle Classmate]]

The title says it all (I hate coming up with titles). Post-Hogwarts Harry runs into someone he knew before he was a wizard while out for drinks with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. Short, sweet, funny, charming, not too dramatic, but still subtly so.

I wrote it for me because it's the type of fan fiction I want to read but couldn't find much out there that didn't totally overly dramatize Harry's childhood or make Harry super ashamed or lashing out (because he doesn't seem to really care about the Dursleys in the books, why would he care later?). In my mind, Harry doesn't give the Dursleys much thought, so he's not walking around all embarrassed about them, 'cause he's literally not thinking about them. I wanted a story about his past and post Hogwarts life converging without all the cringey drama.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] - it was writing that felt easy and natural to me, seeing as I'd imagined it so clearly for such a long time, and it was during a time of great emotional upheaval, which was terrible, but admittedly good for writing. It's very close to my heart and I can't imagine enjoying writing anything as much as I enjoyed writing this.

One of my two favorite stories, but if I had to choose one, this is it. I've been writing it for five years so the quality improves over time, but the latter third I'm very proud of--and this most recent chapter is the most difficult thing I've written. I've only got the epilogue left!

I started writing it in an era where there were very few anti-heroines in popular media, and definitely not many well-written ones in fiction, so I wrote one myself. It's incidentally the fic that has the least to do with Harry Potter on my page :p but it is a bit of a satire on fandom in general.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** *Butterfly Wings* linkffn(11767424) WIP, updates every three days.

It shows a huge improvement in my writing from my last huge fic, both in style and skill and in actually avoiding or changing the canon stations. I didn't take it so seriously as I worked--I knew I was writing for /me/, even if I planned to post it, so I didn't worry about what others would think about my vampires and over-powering Harry at some points. Some might complain that it makes the story weak in places, that some problems are solved too easily, but I don't really care because I had fun writing it. I especially enjoyed fourth year, which I've just reached on posting, because I came up with different TWT tasks and that was fun to do. Also the events of sixth year (VERY different to canon) were good fun to write.

It's a little disappointing that I don't have as many reviews/favs/follows as my last big fic despite this one being so much better, but tbh I think that's largely affected by the fact that the last one was a Harry/Draco fic while this is Harry/Theo. Pairings can be so influential.

  Lily Potter made a mistake nine months before Harry Potter was born: Severus Snape, not her husband, was Harry's father. The ripple effect of this reaches far: Snape dies young, Harry calls vampires family, and Lucius Malfoy seeks to destroy Voldemort. But one thing remains the same -- the inevitability of death.

  Harry Potter, a boy, is known as the Girl-Who-Lived with no way to prove otherwise- all because his father just couldn't resist playing the ultimate Halloween joke on Lily hours before Voldemort attacked. It probably didn't help any that Petunia always wanted a daughter.

  Climbing up the ranks of the Death Eaters is the easy part. Staying there is another story. The tale of twelve Slytherins and their ups and downs during the second war. Includes: Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Astoria Greengrass, Cassius Warrington, Graham Montague along with four Original Characters.
#+end_quote

This is currently on-going and I'm aiming for a chapter per month until it's done. Characterization is my strong suit in stories and this really just explores the various Slytherin characters and their lives during the second war. Each chapter is named after and focuses on that character, and it will eventually lead up to the last chapter which is the Battle of Hogwarts.

** linkffn (The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet by nymphxdora) - it's the sequel to The Escapades of Teddy Lupin, but I like it more than the original. I feel like this one gets going with the plot straight away, and I love some of the new characters that I get to play around with. Both have a special place in my heart though.

I'm also v v fond of linkffn (Shards by nymphxdora) because Rowena/Salazar is life and it's quite different from my usual style.

** Usually, I recommend based on personal preference, but the story I've definitely put the most time and energy and thought into is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/674219/chapters/1233745][Pieces: A Story Cycle.]]

Pieces is a series of short, inter-connected moments about the next generation. There is one chapter for each canonical Next Gen kid. I use anything JKR has released about them, and then I fill in the gaps. I'm five chapters away from finishing. I've done Teddy, Victoire, Dominique, James, Molly, Fred, Al, Rose, Scorpius, Lily, Hugo, and Lucy so far. Roxie, Louie, the Lysander twins, and one OC, Maddie Longbottom, are still in progress.

It's gotten to the point where almost everything I write for Harry Potter fits into this universe. It's either a more in-depth exploration of the Next Gen characters I've created, or it's my imagining of their parents/grandparents and how they became the characters I've written into Pieces. You don't need to have read Pieces to enjoy any of my other work, but if you /have/ read Pieces, the little connections are everywhere, and I'm very proud of that.

So yeah. That's my baby.
