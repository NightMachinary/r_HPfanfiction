** What do you mean by "light" side? Those who fought? 'Cause the Weasleys were in the house, lol, and really the only one who was without close magical family was Harry and that was for plot purposes.

*** A blanket term for the families who opposed Voldemort in any way. And let's say the DEs wiped out all the adults of said families in order to make the prompt work

** Andromeda and Ted Tonks run a group home funded by the estate of the imprisoned Lestranges. They hire Remus Lupin to help home school all the kids before Hogwarts. Bill, Charlie, Percy, and Dora Tonks, along with any of the older kids take their protective older sibling role seriously and help out a lot around the house. Bill puts the kids to bed with the best stories. He figured if he filled their minds with fun thoughts, it would help them sleep. Charlie learns to help Ted with the magical maintenance Charms and Andromeda with the cooking. Cooking helps him feel close to his Mum. Dora doesn't mind suddenly having to share her parents with a dozen more kids. She's the best at entertaining the little ones and keeping up with the twins. Percy is a precocious five-year-old, and rather than getting lost in the mix, he decides to learn as much as he can so he can make sure nobody forgot what happened or their families. He's particularly worried that his younger siblings and other younger kids (Susan, Neville) will have no memory of their parents.

Slowly the older ones go off to Hogwarts in ones and twos mainly in the same houses. Charlie, clinging desperately to the memory of his parent's stories of Gryffindor fights the hat over not going to Hufflepuff and wins. As Remus Lupin and Andromeda Tonks teach the youngsters, they don't shy away from telling them what happened to make them all Orphans. Andromeda, who had an academic interest in the Dark Arts as a teen, reminds them that magic is 90% intent and not usually a black and white subject. Remus Lupin teaches them how to find the information they need and how to see that all areas of magic are connected. The adults also chaperone trips into Muggle London. Muggle technology doesn't work inside the house as there is too much magic, but all of the kids are perfectly comfortable navigating the Muggle world.

When its Hogwarts time Percy goes to Slytherin. He still has ambitions to be someone important, but it is so he can stop something like what happened to his and the other's parents. With Andromeda as an example, he knows it will be difficult, but he thinks he can do it. Fred and George remember their parents only through stories, but they have never taken their family for granted. Following Bill's example, they're protective of Ron and Ginny. They still enjoy jokes and pranks, but they're more careful. They end up in Hufflepuff in part because they idolize Dora Tonks and in part because their pranks are mostly to get people back when they hurt others.

Susan retreated into her books when the house became too loud. She becomes a Ravenclaw. Ron becomes a Gryffindor like the older brothers he idolizes. Neville becomes one too. Ron and Neville befriend Harry on the train. Neville is a little put out at Ron's treatment of Hermione but goes along out of loyalty, and it is the four of them that end up rescuing her from the troll. Ron on the receiving end of Neville's /disappointed face/ apologizes, and the four become fast friends.

The four still go after the stone, though Ron and Neville have to write an extra summer essay for Remus and Andromeda about what they could have done differently. Lucius Malfoy still plants the Diary in Ginny's things after a row with Ted. After a Row with Neville about going off and doing another rash rescue without thinking it through, Ron and Harry head down to the Chamber. McGonagall duels Lockhart, but they are both injured (turns out he has a few dirty tricks up his sleeve still). The Basilisk is fought, and Ginny is saved.

Andromeda narrows her eyes when she hears about what happened in the chamber and with the diary. She spends the rest of her summer trying to get information from her childhood home and in desperation pulls some strings to get an audience with her cousin in Askaban. What she finds shocks her. Somehow this story revolves around freeing Sirius and Peter's activities. I'm leaning towards Scabbers never having been Ron's pet so we would leave cannon behind completely.{I have to go so, for now, I'm stopping here. Might continue later though}
