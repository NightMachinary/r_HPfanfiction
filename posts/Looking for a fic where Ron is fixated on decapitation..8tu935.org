All I remember about the fic is that in Defense class, Ron's go-to solution for any Dark creature was "cut off it's head." It may have been a Highlander crossover, I'm not sure.


** You know, when I saw the title, I wondered if you were looking for a fic where Ron is seeking his own decapitation, Face McShooty style.

To Nearly Headless Nick: "Tell me about it, I feel your pain, bro."

The beheaded house-elves in Grimmauld Place: "Sheesh, I'm jealous."

To Gilderoy Lockhart: "You know that spell for decapitating vampires? Could you teach me?"
