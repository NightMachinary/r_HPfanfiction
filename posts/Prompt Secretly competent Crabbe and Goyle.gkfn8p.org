There's lots of complaints about how Crabbe and Goyle simply can't be Slytherin because of lack and ambition and cunning. What about if instead of being really stupid they were actually geniuses--they realised that it would be beneficial to them to hide their powers and training because in Slytherin they would be surrounded by Death Eaters (or competition, depending on how you want to play their loyalties) and to show their talent would be detrimental and hiding it gave them a hidden advantage.

Also I get that this would not fit in Canon because they didn't show it in the war effort, but i just thought it would be pretty cool y'know? Like, this could either be a massive crackfick, or something incredibly unique and mysterious.


** I wrote a story where there were basically the Warner Brothers Gophers

here's their part:

It was at the door we encountered the first human defenses. Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe were outside the door, evidently avoiding Cousin Draco. Family obligations had them protecting my cousin while at school, but in all actuality, the pair hated Draco with a passion.

"Trespassers!" Gregory noted with alarm as we approached.

"Indeed old chum." Vincent agreed. "It appears to be a trio of Elves of a subspecies unfamiliar to me, accompanied by Luna Lovegood."

"Luna Lovegood of the Ottery St. Catchpole Lovegoods?" Gregory asked. "Oh good family indeed, though sadly a bit on the light side." He peered closer. "I say, she appears to be carrying an */Oryctolagus/* */cuniculus/*, or Mini Lop Rabbit."

"Indeed." Vincent agreed. "I am unfamiliar with any magical rabbit breeds, so that is probably unimportant. It is the Elves that concern me, they seem to be rather aggressive in their attitude, and logic would indicate that those devices in their hands to be some sort of weapon beyond my experience."

"I agree, though the concept of an aggressive elf is well outside my personal experience, their actions speak louder than words," Gregory noted.

By this time, the pair was surrounded by the trio of death-dealing Elves. "Miss Lovegood?" Vincent asked politely.

"Yes, Vincent? And please, call me Luna." I said.

"Thank you, fair lady. Gregory and I were just wondering if your companions were as aggressive as they appear."

"Sadly, yes they are." I sighed.

"Ah, I see." Vincent said nodding.

"Do you suppose that they might be intimidated by Vincent and I flexing our biceps and cracking our knuckles Miss Lovegood?" Gregory asked politely.

"All three are highly trained and highly experienced combat specialists Gregory," I replied. "So, no. They would not be intimidated in the slightest."

"Ah. Thank you for your candor, Luna." Vincent said before turning to Gregory. "Only one thing for it then."

"I quite agree, old chum."

Then the pair drew their wands and stunned each other.

The elves exchanged confused looks. I shrugged. "A pair of extremely intelligent young men forced into servitude to the Malfoy clan by family obligations. They spend much of their time pretending to be quite dim, as a protective behavior. They recognized that they were in an untenable position and took steps to remove themselves from the conflict with a minimum of violence."
