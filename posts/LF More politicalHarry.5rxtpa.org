I got tired of a Harry who never used his fame or connections, so I would love if people could recommend some fics where Harry uses his fame.

No slash, or fem!Harry please. Thanks!


** Pretty much every 'Lord Potter' fic does that.

"Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942), features a Harry who did not only leverage his fame and power in the magical world, but also in the muggle world. He, Hermione, and Luna had pretty megalomaniac plans for global domination.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** An accidental animagus has Harry delving more deeply into politics by year one than he did in all seven books. It's well written, but definitely has a more intelligent, mature and self disciplined Harry in it who isn't afraid to use his clout for what he believes in.

** I don't know if it counts since it's really a minor plotpoint, but Harry uses his fame in this fic: linkffn(4327485). If nothing else it's a good read.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
