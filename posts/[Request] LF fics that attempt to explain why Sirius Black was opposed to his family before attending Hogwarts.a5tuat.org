Generally when children are brought up in racist/religious environments they'll parrot the views of their parents until they are forced to actually interact with groups outside of their demographic and have their views challenged by others and maybe start see for themselves that the morals/ideas they were brought up with might be flawed. People aren't usually born with an innate sense of what is right and wrong, it tends to be something that is learnt. But in cannon we get a flashback of the first train ride with Sirius/James/Lily/Snape and even then Sirius is already antagonistic towards his family and strives to be in Gryffindor. And given the family he comes from I doubt he had many interactions with many muggles or non-pureblood wizards before attending Hogwarts.

Are there any fics that explore why this might be? What experiences and encounters he had before Hogwarts that would shift his ideology?


** I don't think he was opposed to his family BEFORE attending Hogwarts. I always thought that he was too excited to make a friend on the train and when his friend told him that Slytherins are baddies , he hurried to distance himself from Slytherin and his family in order to not lose his friendship. Later on he asked the Hat to be put in Gryffindor because he suspected James would be there too.

To sum up, I always believed that it was his friendship with James that turned him against his family, not that he was just always opposed to them.

*** Good point, I just re-read the scene and I think I realize I've been misremembering it. It's just strange that James insults Slytherin and Sirius is chill about it despite his whole family being from there but he is not openly antagonistic.

**** It's implied that Alphard was close to Sirius as he left him his money, and Alphard didn't necessarily share the rest of the Black family views and that made him a bit of a Black sheep in the Black family. Andromeda was probably already cast out of the family before he went to Hogwarts when you consider Nymphadora's age and that Harry's parents were only 20/21 when he was born. So the two family members he may like are looked down upon....

Also, I always thought it was heavily implied that the Blacks were abusive towards Regulus and Sirius---the portrait screaming that he was a waste of space, useless, etc.; the fact that the Potters took him in instead of sending him back to his family; Regulus wanting to 'please' the family (abused kids often want their parents love) and being told to join the DE at such a young age; etc.

So as far Sirius knows, his hateful, racist, abusive family is all from Slytherin (the same family that also kicked out Andromeda). While there might be a few good members of the Blacks, that's still going to turn him off Slytherin. Add in that most of the family friends of the Blacks probably have similar viewpoints, and were also Slytherin, it's not a surprise he was wary of them.

Plus, when you take away his personal experience...there's still the reputation. Even in Harry's time, you never see any Slytherin's calling out Draco or Pansy for openly using racial slurs. So add in Sirius's family issues, his family friends, and the general rep---not a surprise he was wary of Slytherin.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** I've seen a few fics where the reason Sirius turned against his family was that his parents were abusive towards him and Regulus, and Walburga in particular frequently went into insane episodes. Here are a few that touch on the idea:

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][The Reclamation of Black Magic]] - Dorea reminisces about the terrible way Sirius' parents treated him which led to him running away to live with the Potters. linkffn(12058516)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - In book 4 Sirius tells Harry about his relationship with his brother and the way they were treated by their parents. (First book in the series is "Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes") linkao3(12608820)

*** Same author as Reclamation, linkao3(The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie) This fic focuses on a trip that Hermione takes through time, but during the 154 chapter fic you get a very well painted picture of the way Sirius was treated by his family which leads to Sirius not liking his family or their views.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** I think some people are just naturally rebellious. Regulus was probably a more chill and obedient child and so maybe Sirius began to turn against his parents due to favoritism that was shown towards his brother. Maybe Sirius hung out a little too much with Andromeda lol

** Within his family, his uncle Alphard and his cousin Andromeda are the most likely to have shown Sirius an alternative to his parents' views.

Also, children are rarely completely isolated from society. I recently read an interview with a former neo-nazi who came from a neo-nazi family, and she noticed very early that her family was different from others.

** Reaper-maniac has a series of one shots, where Sirius grows up both spoiled and simultaneously abused by his mother. I can't remember the title, but there was a very dark one shot where Sirius befriended a muggle kid from the same street and his mother killed the child to teach him a "lesson".
