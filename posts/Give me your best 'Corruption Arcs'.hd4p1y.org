Any fics where an established good canon character goes bad. I don't mind AU but prefer it to be canon divergence rather than an outright re-write. Slash, gen, het all fine.

** Well, there's always the Downward Spiral series by Bolshevikmuppet99. I shan't link it because it's uh, rather, but it's definitely one big corruption arc.

*** I don't think Harry was that good to being with.

And that story just goes from "Harry is evil." to "This is disturbing." to "I think I should call the police."

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

** I don't think I've really seen that many fanfics featuring good characters falling.

I've seen a few where characters that were good in the original story became bad in the fanfic(most notably, Ron), but that's about it.
