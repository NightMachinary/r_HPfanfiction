I was a huge fan of harrypotterfanfiction.com in the past. I hadn't visited the site in a few months. But when I logged on today, I discover that there have been no updates to any of the fics since April. Was the site shut down?


** It was shut down, but I thought someone else put it back up

**** The people [[/u/FanfictionRecs][u/FanfictionRecs]] (Gwen and Ronnie) who brought it back are redoing the website, and fixing all the functions and bring it up to date. They said submitting fics should be back by late of this month. The original owners took it down in April, and they brought it back June 29.

***** Hi there! This is Ronnie :) Thanks for tagging us! You're correct, we're shooting to get at least basic story editing/writing online by the end of August/Early September.

The next update will be bringing RSS feeds and story view count functionalities back online.

****** We're striving to build a bright future for the site, and to do so, we need to update the legacy code that was over 17 years old (and literally couldn't run on modern servers!!) - though we could've technically just brought the site back online the way it was the day it shut down, that wouldn't have help us move the site forward into a new era for new readers.

Our vision is a world filled with fanfiction in our everyday's lives, and we're doing that by making fanfiction more accessible. Check out our about page for more info :)

******* I really love what you've done with the site. It's a lot nicer to view on mobile. Will you be adding a filter by reviews/views option? One of the things I thought HPFF missed out on a bit.

******** Possibly! We're definitely open to feature requests, can you elaborate?

Something that's really important to us is to start re-encouraging people to leave reviews instead of "kudos" and "upvotes" so on our horizon is making a simple button that creates random but genuine positive comments instead of "kudos" and can of course be customized per the readers choice :)

We'll definitely have sorting for that!

********* When I used to search for stories on the old site I found it quite frustrating that I couldn't filter by reviews to see which stories were generating the largest user interest. Length/update/title/author was only so useful to me. Something similar to Ao3 or FFN is what I was imagining.

For the reviews, perhaps you could have a selection of options along the lines of-great characterisation, great plot line etc. So the author gets general feedback about what people really enjoy about their story.

********* Hey can I add another request?

One of things that I like about Ffnet is the email feature when there is an update for a story that I follow or when a new story is published by the authors that I follow. Hpff.com had the RSS feed and I was using Google Reader to keep track. But they shut down Google Reader and I'd rather get an email straight to my inbox.
