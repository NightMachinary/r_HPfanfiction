Have you ever written a story that is so successful that you give yourself writers block?

I have had truly amazing and touching reviews and I'm so humbled by it all. Only it's a double edged blade. Now I'm sitting here thinking, how do I live up to that? My last 3 fics have had amazing support and I'm terrified that the next thing I post isn't going to come anywhere near that.

I feel like I'm complaining when I should be celebrating but it's a bizarre feeling.


** Positive responses are motivating, but you should always keep yourself and your own story as the number one priority when writing.

I've seen a lot of writers try to pander to their audience, either by keeping a fan favorite character hanging around so long their cameo turned into a filler arc, or re-wrting a chapter (or multiple chapters) due to a negative reader response, which ended up killing the writer's motivation to continue the story for good. The truth is that your readerbase is around 90% lurkers to 10% active reviewers, and that percentage may act as a vocal dissent when the majority of your readers are happy to read whatever you write.

So be mindful when you plan plot arcs, and consider whether you're writing a story you want to tell, or if it's a story you know your readers want to see. Also keep in mind that readers have shit taste, just look at all the requests and praise for trashy haremfics we get in this sub.

This is fairly accurate in my experience. Controversial turns will get you negative feedback. But if you take a deeper look at what they are criticising, you'll notice that most of those reviews complain that something goes against their headcanon (eg Harry not using his Wizengamot seat even though you never claimed that he had one) and not something to be concerned with.

**** Reader feedback, lol. I sometimes read the reviews after a controversial plot twist chapter, just for the salty responses. 85% of the time, people who use the term "Plot Hole" don't know what the heck a plot hole actually is. This applies to canon HP, too. ("Why didn't James' sacrifice give Lily a magical protection? Plot hole!!11!")

Information that is not revealed to the readers, because they've just read up to chapter 15 of a WIP fanfic, does not count as a plot hole!

One of my favourite quotes is - writers block is just your characters getting sick of everything you do to them and going on strike. I actually don't think that's true anymore. If anything it's my brain shutting them out because they are driving me spare!

******** Yeah, I have a certain mister whose brain basically revolves around sex and his hair. Spoiler alert: he's the biggest pain in the butt of all my characters. I think it's because he is as pretty and charming as he thinks he is, so there's really no way to curb the ego. Seriously, I think his ego is actually bigger than Jupiter.

** To answer the question, no, I've never written anything that more than a handful of people liked, I only write what I want to read and I never start posting until a fic is complete (I'm in awe of writers who can post as they go and still maintain a consistent storyline).

​

Yes I think you are complaining when you should.be celebrating. I imagine a high proportion of potentially good writers give up writing altogether because they don't get any response to their work.

** I've recently finished my first longfic (well, 42k is probably not that long by the standards of this sub, but I still count it as such), and while it wasn't that much of a success, it had some dedicated readers who were commenting on each chapter, speculating what would happen next, etc. especially towards the end. I was overjoyed to receive each and every review, but I also couldn't help my anxiety. I switched from freaking out that no one will ever read my story to freaking out about whether my readers would like new chapter, doubting if the clues I left are not enough and the reveal would read like something out of left field, or I left too much, and the real culprit would be obvious way too early. Or if I handled the relationship well. Or if... I could go on and on.

It really helped that I always had a buffer of at least 3 chapters when posting, and I although I didn't have an outline, I had a complete plot with a detailed finale in my head, so the reviews didn't actually influence my story. But next time I post something multichaptered, I'll certainly try to have at least half of the fic written beforehand.

**** I planned to wait after I finish my fic as well, but I guess I'm way too impatient for that, so I gave up and started posting it 3 chapters in. I knew exactly where I wanted the story to go, though, so posting regularly motivated me to stop procrastinating and actually sit and write it already. But also brought anxiety over reviews and stats, so I hope next time I'll be able to restrain myself with more success, haha

** I just finished my first story and the reception was much bigger and better than I had anticipated by leaps and bounds. As I got down to the final 3-4 chapters I definitely felt the pressure to "live up" to what I had built and felt a bit of that block you referenced.

I actually stepped away for about a week and then just said f@#$ it. I've made it this far, I know what I'm doing and I know what needs to be done and got on with it.

So just keep writing and if /you/ think it's shit then don't publish it. If you think it's good I can almost guarantee the people who've liked your earlier work will be on board. What's the saying? Once is a fluke, twice is a conicidence, three times is a pattern. You have a pattern of writing things that appeal to your audience and if you put in the same amount of effort I don't think that's going to go away.

Are you writing for yourself, or are you writing for them?

If you're writing for yourself, then it doesn't matter if you live up to their expectations, because they're not seeking their validation.

If you're writing for them, you're screwed.

** Yesssss, this happened to me. One of my casual projects exploded, getting two-three times as many followers as my next most popular ones, and now I'm kinda paralyzed whenever I try to work on it. I'm so worried it won't live up to it - even though I tell myself not to think about it, there's this intangible pressure to make it really good.

I actually haven't been able to get enough written so I haven't posted an update in months, it's really frustrating. I have this love/hate relationship now with my alerts. I'm so glad people are enjoying it, but I don't operate well under pressure.

If you find a solution, I'd love to hear it.
