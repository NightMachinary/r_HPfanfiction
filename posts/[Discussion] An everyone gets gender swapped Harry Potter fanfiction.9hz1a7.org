While reading a story by Evandar (sorry, forgot the title) where instead of Dudley being a boy, he becomes a girl, I had this idea of making a story were everyone's gender gets reversed. Harry Potter would become Mary Potter, Hermione becomes Leontes (the name of the husband of Hermione in the Shakespeare play where her name came from), Ronald becomes Ronalda (hahaha), etc.

As I became more serious about trying to write this though, I encountered some challenges. Like, if Lily and Petunia became guys (I named them Ash and Aspen; tree names instead of flower names), then there shouldn't be any Potters or Dursleys because their wives (Jasmine Potter and Veronica Dursley) would take the Evans' surname. I think I could make it appear that there's an ancient Pureblood rule that because Jasmine was the last Potter, her husband would have to take her surname so it wouldn't die out but that opened up a can of worms I don't want to think about right now, like the marriages of the Black brothers to Tonks, Lestrange and Malfoy.

And then there's Voldemort. I spent the morning rearranging the letters of I AM LADY VOLDEMORT to come up with a name (Amy Volta Om Riddle???) but then remembered that if everyone gets gender swapped, then that means that Merope, who is now Morfin (I just swapped their names) will be the one to give Thomasina Riddle the love potions. And that felt super creepy. When I stopped to think about it, what Merope did to Tom in the original story was wrong but it feels so much creepier when it's the guy giving the girl a love potion and getting her pregnant. So if Thomasina would be the one giving birth in an orphanage and naming Voldemort before she died, she most probably wouldn't give her daughter a weird sounding name. Anyway, with that kind of background story, Voldemort's goals would definitely change.

There's just so many things to think of and I don't have a sounding board here at home. I'm taking a break from thinking for now. My aim in trying to produce this monstrosity is to practice writing.

TLDR: I'm just posting here to start a discussion on what sort of challenges AND solutions you could think of if everyone's gender got swapped in Harry Potter.


** This is probably not any help at all but I did at some point decide that a good name for fem!Sirius would be Spica - it's another bright star, it still starts with an "S" and it's in the constellation Virgo, or the Maiden, so it seems appropriate.

Also, you may find linkao3(4817126) amusing and/or thought-provoking.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender-flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

I like a lot of your ideas here. I love that Hermione becomes Leontes instead of Herman, that's clever.

Obviously, gender-swapping every single character is going to lead to some problems, but I say go with it. What I like about this idea (YOU GET A GENDER SWAP! AND YOU GET A GENDER SWAP! EVERYONE GETS A GENDER SWAP!) is that it really shakes up the story. Your Mary *should* be Mary Evans. And hell, your Ronalda (or Rhonda, lol?) should be Ronalda Prewett (because she would take the name of her now-father, who is now suddenly a bit unnervingly abusive toward his wife, lol).

As for the Merope/love potion topic you raised, IMO it was always very creepy, anyone (man or woman) drugging anyone to have sex without consent. For years, a love potion has always been synonymous with Rohypnol in my mind. But you're right of course -- without the gender swap, at least Merope wanted her pregnancy. But if you gender swap it, now the rape victim is now suddenly also unwillingly pregnant.

But it's not like that doesn't happen in real life.

So take my earlier advice -- go with it, see where it takes your story. Maybe Morfin wouldn't stop using the love potions until after Thomasina gave birth. Then, horrified, she stumbles away and... (and go from there). Or maybe he does stop using the love potions once she's pregnant, and Thomasina tries to escape and have an abortion and... (go from there). It wouldn't surprise me if it leads to the child being raised by Morfin until... (and go from there).

But this should all be backstory, possibly sprinkled in throughout your story. There's no need to tell the story in the exact same order, with only the genders being the different element. In order to hold your readers' attention, you should start somewhere in the early middle of your gender-swapped story, and focus on the elements of the story that change or that are drastically different or have an entirely different tone because of these changes.

Maybe start with some one-shots?

** You are probably gonna have an easier time just making 75% genderbends only, also Wizards may not follow the same naming customs and simply use the name of the one with higher standing or whatever. And if we take wizard families as clans then the ones marrying into them must take the name, no matter their gender.

** Great idea for a fic. I think you should embrace all the "problems" caused by the gender swap. Don't try to make things fit neatly with canon.

If you really do want to avoid messing with Voldemort's past, you can have only characters born after a specific time be gender swapped.

** I want to add something to the whole Voldemort problem: Merope died because she gave birth. If you gender swap everyone, Tom(asina) Jr. would grow up with one living parent (her father), that wanted her. Even though he raped her mother, which is absolutely horrible and disgusting no matter which gender rapist and victim have, he would have wanted and loved his daughter and that makes all the difference in the world. JKR said in an interview that something changes in a child's brain, when it grows up the way TMR did grow up. I always saw this as a hint that Tom Riddle was not born a psychopath, but made one (I think that technically makes him a sociopath). If you give your Tomasina Jr. even one personin this world that values and loves her, that changes absolutely everything. Even if her father goes to prison for rape. Knowing that one person in this world really wants you to be there, especially if related by blood changes everything.

I would love to read a difficult gut-wrenching tale about a hyperintelligent child of rape, that loves her father, but also has to deal with her anger and questioning her right to have a place in this world as she gets older, but I do realize that this is probably not what you're going to write.

Because a guy getting raped by a woman is just "wrong".

And while we are on the subject, Romildus/Romulus Vane got himself a nice prison sentence in HBP. I mean, she deserved one either way, but justice was the one thing lacking from the last two books.

I hate shit views like this. It's horrible and doesn't help people. And yes Hellstrike, I really do want to read a story where Romalda goes to prison for what she tried to do in canon, a juvenile one for at least a year or two maybe, but I've never found any. Because of course it's dismissed and laughable when it's anything but plain male on female sexual assault or harassment. Yes /S for Sarcasm.

*** Yes, female on male rape or sexual assault is wrong. What Merope does to Tom Riddle Sr is awful and certainly made more so by the fact that, even past the magical drugging, he wouldn't have known to understand it as rape.

It's the 'getting her pregnant' part which pushes Morfin raping Thomasina to a slightly different category of awful because the consequences to the victim are that much harsher.

Essentially she would wake up one day after the love potions wore off and discover that she's pregnant. She's now an unmarried woman in a small country town who has been 'ruined' by the local tramp, which is not something that happens to Tom Riddle Sr. He may have been traumatised by his rape but the material consequences of what happened to him are negligible - he can and does go back to his previous life and what is /perceived/ as his little escapade with the local pauper girl is largely forgotten. For Thomasina Riddle it's much worse; she's now the joke of the town, her reputation and chances for marriage are in tatters, she wouldn't be welcome in her family's home even after delivering the child, she probably wouldn't be able to get an abortion and so she has to deal with carrying her rapist's baby to term while losing basically everything.

For all that Merope is an awful person and a rapist, she seems to have wanted her kid. We don't know anything about magical abortion or the attitudes to it but one assumes that if Merope was capable of brewing a love potion, she could have brewed something that would have ended her pregnancy if she so chose.

Instead Merope has hopes for her son, has obviously thought about a name and what she hoped he'd look like. True, she was likely living in poverty in London (although if 10 galleons still converted to £50 that's not a bad amount in the 1920's) but she grew up in poverty, it wouldn't have been as much of a shock to her as it would to a country squire's daughter. Thomasina Riddle's attitude toward her pregnancy and child is thus likely to be radically different. Would she even want to name the child?

And I wonder, what happens to Morfin. Since's he's not the one pregnant, he's still alive and likely to be so when his mother (Marvola?) and sister get out of prison. He may even still be alive when his daughter comes looking for the Riddles. Or who knows, he might have found another pretty woman to fixate on and assault.

**** According to Wikipedia there were 100000 abortions in the UK each year in the 1910s. While illegal, I'm pretty sure that the Riddle family, being affluent and probably well connected, could have arranged something when their daughter was raped by the strange man from the edge of the village. Hell, there was a loophole which allowed abortions if carried out during birth until 1929.

Tl;dr: Abortions would have resolved the whole Voldemort issue, permanently.

***** Mr. Riddle is a country squire. That's 'wealthy enough not to need a job' but not exceptionally wealthy nor particularly well connected. I mean he'd know the various members of local government and probably even his MP but that's not exceptionally connected, especially if Thomasina was induced to leave their area of influence.

It would also depend a lot on the timings. When she was thrown off by her family vs when the love potions stopped as to whether her parents would be willing to pay for an abortion. A lot of the early abortion laws were in place to protect women from a procedure which could be exceptionally dangerous, especially late term abortions.

Although I'm certainly inclined to say that Thomasina would probably have attempted to self-induce an abortion with the old standbys of alcohol, hot baths or an "accidental" tumble down the stairs.

And even if they agreed to pay for the abortion and it went well, then she's still considered damaged goods.

A male Tom Riddle Sr is perceived to be just another rich gentleman who decided to have his way with a girl who couldn't protest. Which doesn't make him less of a rape victim but what happened to him doesn't reflect on him as negatively as it would have on a female Tom Riddle Sr. Although I suppose at least Thomasina would be able to vocalise what happened to her as rape, even if that didn't actually change antyhing.
