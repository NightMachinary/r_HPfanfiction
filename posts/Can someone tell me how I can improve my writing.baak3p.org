** Ok, so first off, your writing is good. Very good. However, I only read about less than a quarter of the story and I think it's pretty good. But, you seem to have a problem of skipping around. Cutting off a sentence and then making the character realize something else and changing the story. Now if used properly, this can either add humor or just make the story entertaining. Here, it just annoys me. You need to focus on making the story flow more, instead of skipping around. I don't know about anyone else, but my peeve is when story authors don't know what they are writing about and just write random scenes and hope the story sounds good. What you need to do, is make sure you have a story line of the chapter. That way, you have some focus of what you are writing about instead of an idea popping in your head and you write it down. This may seem harsh, but when I was reading the story it seemed like you were just writing with no story in mind. Other than that, very good.

*** Oh, I thought cutting off mid-sentence was fine! I guess I was a bit shortsighted in thinking that interrupting characters would move the story a bit faster, but it ended up breaking the flow...

I do have a story line; I suppose I'm not that good with sideplots. I had no idea it seemed random, and it sucks that people think this way.

Thanks for the advice! I hope I can keep these in mind when I write the next chapter.
