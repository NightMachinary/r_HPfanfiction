I have been thinking of this interesting (at least imo) scenario where Draco Malfoy somehow has like 2 year younger sibling that is half (in regular ole sibling blood) and a halfblood. I saw it on Tumblr and just started thinking of how he would legitimately react to the situation. A part of thinks he would be like an actual brother but another part of me thinks he might be a little prejudice (if that is the right word?)


** The bigger impact really would be the fact that his parents aren't together, assuming that anyone knew the child was a half-blood (and if noone knows then it's irrelevant)

His upbringing would be vastly different if his parents were driven apart like that.

** Firstly, if we're talking about Draco /before/ the start of the SWW, he wouldn't believe it. He'd be in complete denial. The only way he would /actually/ believe it is if he receives DNA proof, most likely. Also, who'd be the father/the mother of the half-blood half sister? If the half sister is /younger/, that would mean that one of his parents would be guilty of infidelity in their marriage. It wouldn't really make sense for the sister to be younger unless either Lucius or Narcissa were unhappy in their marriage. I could imagine someone writing a fic about this and making Narcissa and Snape having some sort of affair (since you're suggesting that Draco's half sister be half-blood), but I don't really think Narcissa would be unfaithful.

Maybe I can write a fanfic exploring this. Who knows? This is just my opinion on the situation.

*** He wouldn't believe DNA evidence, because of it's Muggle origin. You'd have to bring in the inheritance test trope.

Looking at it from a historical standpoint (since Wizarding Society seems to be a few hundred years behind Muggle society in manners and customs), there is a precedent for acknowledging illegitimate children. But since Draco's pureblood snob parents are unlikely to acknowledge a halfblood by-blow, that wouldn't have happened. Therefore, the "proper" thing for Draco to do in that case is to utterly refuse to acknowledge the relationship, to the point of ignoring the person altogether.

For one thing, an acknowledged sibling might be entitled to part of his inheritance.

ETA: OMG, I can't believe I said it's instead of its. *Hangs head in shame.*

**** Interesting way of looking at things. I like the explanation.

** i guess it depends on when? if its like they were raised together then I assume he'd be nice-ish to her even if the parents favored him. If she shows up when hes in school that might be kinda world altering for him if he holds his parents in high regards still. He might be in denial be dickish to her to keep her away. If its post hogwarts i think the concept would bother him less. It would be awkward I think. I doubt he'd want to get very close to her just because they were related. He might though be interested in being friends if they shared common interests
