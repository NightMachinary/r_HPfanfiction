:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this story on AO3 a while that features Drarry but I think it was slow burn. And I'm pretty sure that it might have been abandoned last I heard. I remember that Harry got resorted to Slytherin after he got expelled and they found out that he had dark magic by doing some kind of ritual or something. Just wondering if anyone new the name.


** i think i read this before, did it resolve around OOTP, harry declaring dark and whatnot
