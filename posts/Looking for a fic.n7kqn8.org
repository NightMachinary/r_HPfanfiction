:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic in which Ton Riddle is the DADA teacher (i think) and there's no voldemort or dark lord. However there is Grindelwald who's still in power. Then there's Harry Potter who joins hogwarts at 16 and he's friends with vampires and stuff idk? It's a tom riddle x harry fic


** Title : Love They Haven't Thought Of Yet Snoweylily

Link : [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10642821?view_full_work=true]].

Summary : Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Defeater of Grindelwald, never received his Hogwarts Letter. Five years later, a 16-year-old Harry Potter is found on the streets of London and immediately sent to Hogwarts, where he catches the eye of one Professor Tom Riddle. When Harry is sorted into Slytherin, well... that just makes things a whole lot easier for him, doesn't it?

Hope this is the fic you are searching for....
