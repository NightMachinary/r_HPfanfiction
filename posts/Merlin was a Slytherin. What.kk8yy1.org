So. Information on Wizarding World and the wiki, and often referenced in fic, states that Merlin went to Hogwarts and was in Slytherin.

What, and if I may, the fuck? According to legend, Merlin (or Myrddin in the original Welsh legend) lived in the mid to late 500s. The 6th century. But /Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century./ The wiki says around 993 AD, and the Wizarding World website backs that up with "sometime in the tenth century."

Now I know JKR is bad at maths. But surely even she realises that someone who lived in the 570s could not have gone to school in the 990s? There's over 400 years between Merlin existing and the school being founded, so how? What? Is this just that she realised she'd basically written off a quarter of wizards as intrinsically evil (or selfish and pathetic in the case of Slughorn) and she needed a famous name to fix that? Or did she genuinely not realise when the legends of Merlin and Arthur are meant to have taken place? What do you, my fellow Potter nerds, think?

Are there any fics that deal with this- either someone (Hermione, surely) calling this out for the historically inaccurate bull it clearly is? Or something that introduces Merlin as a time travelling character who apprentices under Salazar and then goes back in time to help King Arthur? Because this, it needs fixing. How on earth can we explain that a man born before 570 was somehow at school after 993? I need a fic that gives me a reasonable explanation. The only one I've seen that bothers to correct it is the fantastic /Of A Linear Circle/ series which has Salazar apprenticed to Merlin (who is 600 years old at the time) and the history books getting it the wrong way round. But I need more acknowledgement of what an absolute travesty this claim is.


** Out of universe:

I'm pretty sure the original source for Merlin being a Slytherin was the Slytherin version of the "Welcome to your new house" message you got after being sorted in one version of Pottermore. And I'm also pretty sure those weren't actually written by Rowling, though she probably did sign off on it. I can't find a current source for that, but I didn't look very hard either. There may be other Pottermore references to Merlin's house, but I haven't seen any that actually came from Rowling. So the entire thing is only very dubiously canon to begin with.

Of course, Rowling is also very bad at math, so it is very in character for her to mess up dates that badly.

Possible in universe explanations:

- The legends of Merlin and Arthur got a bit mixed up when the Statute of Secrecy happened.

- Merlin did live in the 10th century. The stories about him in Arthur's court were self-insert fanfics that people started believing were true.

- There were two different Merlins (or a Merlin and a Myrddin) who lived 400 years apart, and their stories have gotten mixed together.

- Time travel shenanigans.

- His ghost, portrait, or something similar claimed that he would have been sorted into Slytherin, had Hogwarts existed when he was a child.

- The founders named him an Honorary Slytherin or had him as a sort of mascot for the house. (The other houses may have also had witches and wizards assigned to them who were famous historical figures at the time.)

- Slytherins have claimed him as their own, possibly because he would have fit there, or possibly to make themselves feel better for being the house of evil, racism, and very few redeeming qualities. Over time, people may have forgotten or chose to ignore the fact that he wasn't actually part of the house.

*** The obvious in-universe explanation is the same as the real-world conflation of King Arthur and Merlin (they were entirely separate legends to begin with): someone in the 13th century thought it'd be cool to write crossover fic in which they worked together. This was, of course, centuries before the invention of crossover slash shipping RPF, or they'd totally have done that too.

They also wrote it as modern AU, so there were knights and courtly love and references to being 'rightwise King Of All England' in stories about post-Roman British fighters /against/ the invading proto-English.

A few centuries later, people are assuming that the original crossover story is An Historical Document, are woefuly confused about when it's set, and just sort of assume that the wizard in it went to Hogwarts.

This was basically my point. Even if he was still alive, which I could get behind as he's meant to be the most powerful wizard to ever live, he would not have needed to go to school at the age of 600!

****** He was old and strong magically, but he might not have been fully up to date on the more technical bits of magic. Maybe he typically used a staff, so wand magic was foreign to him, and maybe he'd never really gotten around to potion making, for example.

I personally like to think that hogwarts started out more like a university, with older students, and as time went on the average age kept moving until the statute of secrecy kept Wizarding children separate from muggle children.

So, at a few hundred years old, it was more like a retiree going to college to learn more advanced or newer skills. I also think of merlin as more adventurous and relying on pure power, versus the founders as more of scholars, so even with the age difference he was at a disadvantage when it came to book smarts and a diverse skillset.

Another theory is that in order to teach, you have to have a House. It'd make sense they'd ask a very old and powerful wizard to teach, so Merlin got sorted despite not actually being a student.

******* Wizarding World website literally describes him as "a young Wizard" when he went to Hogwarts, which is impossible with the established timeline for the Merlin legend.

I guess I just feel like she's stamped all over something that's hundreds of years old and is a legend that's important to a lot of people in Britain, and that's rude. She could have just said "then after Hogwarts he invented a one off form of time travel that allowed him to go back to Arthur's time and assist the young king," then both canon stories make sense in the timelines established!

******* Sorry to poke your bubble, but the wizarding world working as a uni makes little to no sense. In this time, people would usually become of age a few years earlier than what is common today. So usually around 15 or 16 at the latest. Now, they'd probably get an education, which is something I'll revisit, before coming of age. I'd also imagine Merlin to be a scholar first and foremost, similar to Dumbledore. This is solely because he would've lived for centuries with how much power he is proclaimed to have, and would've grown tired of war, politics, etc. Revisting the topic of education, I'd also imagine Hogwarts at the time would've been similar to a modern day trade school. Years 1-5 is basic learning, but afterwards it's more focused on your future job. This could explain why Potion Master and Transfiguration Master, etc etc were and are used. Both as tradition and to signify someone who can teach the skills of the trade to the next person.

** Arthurian stuff never makes sense and never will. While it is meant to be set in the 6th century, the presence of so many castles in Arthurian stuff suggests a Norman setting.

*** I'm familiar with when the Normans came. Yeah, Arthurian legend looks and sounds Norman or even medieval because that's the time the legends were put down on paper. But it's still meant to have taken place much earlier and the original myths definitely predate that, even if stylistically that doesn't add up with the version most of us are familiar with! Plus we know definitely who all the king's from the 11th, even 10th century were for a fact and wizarding world acts as if Arthur was one of them but with no explanation for the divergence. It just winds me up because it makes no sense - placing Merlin in a time when we have codified history throws everything out because where does Arthur then fit in- when he's meant to definitely exist in JKRs canon but there's no indication Muggle monarchy has a diversion in that universe.

I just feel like she decided she wanted a famous established wizard for Slytherin and, in typical Rowling style, didn't think it through, and she's opened a bigger plot hole than anything she managed in her books. Which is quite the achievement!

** I feel it is worth noting that the Arthur and Merlin of popular lore of the modern times are so vastly different to the Myrddin and Arthur of Myth. The evidence of oral traditions dictates that Arthur and Merlin may be far older and may actually be pre-christian deities. The same happened with Cù Chulainn and Fionn MacCumhail. Christianisation efforts in Celtic Lands (Eire, Alba and Cymru primarily) intersected without clashing so pre christian deities became Mortal Kings and Culture heroes, and stories were created to fit this new Christian mentality.

That being said the origin of ‘Merlin went to Hogwarts' was Rowling, IIRC. It's likely that it was taken from codified Arthurian canon, starting with Historia Regnum Britanniae (12th Century) and ending with Le Morte d'Arthur (15th Century). Since Le Morte d'Arthur is probably the most popular and well known of the Arthurian ‘sources' them it is possible that the date of Publication may have been conflated with the time of the setting creating the paradox.

I've never seen a fic where its been called out, though as a huge fan of Arthurian Legend, I tend to drop fics that get Arthurian canon ‘wrong' so to speak. If the stories in the fic are closer than the 6th Century, that fic is deleted from my brain.

Though one of Merlin's powers is a perfect knowledge of the past and present, he is also gifted with prophecy so make of that what you will.

I know the fic Basiliskborn keeps to the proper Arthurian timeline if you want that;

Linkffn(Basilisk-born)

Edit: By which I mean not at all, but its pre- Founders, and closer in time, to the oral traditions.

Like when she included Playstation's in Goblet of Fire when writing it in 1999-2000 and then retconing it so that scene took place in the summer of 1994, six months before the console was first released.

** I think part of the problem is the difference between Myrddin the Wild of the original Welsh myth set in the 6th century and "Merlin." The legends of both King Arthur and Merlin have gone through numerous revisions, additions, canonizations, and changes over the centuries. Generally centuries apart from each other. So while yes, the earliest references to Myrddin take place prior to the founding of Hogwarts. That isn't a guarantee for Merlin.

The most likely explanation in universe is very similar to the real life evolution of these legends. There was a Myrddin in the sixth century, and there was a Merlin in the twelfth century. The twelfth century Merlin was a Slytherin and many of the real life legends of Merlin belong to this in universe slytherin.

Like if there was a 15th century European dark lord that called himself the Flight of Death and then Voldemort came around in the 20th century, and in the 22nd century someone wrote a book on dark lords and combined their stories which have passed out of history into legend. And then in the 24th century someone writes fanfiction adding to the legend of the Dark Lord Voldemort, also known as the Flight of Death because they like the story and want more of it. And then their story becomes classic literature. And then in the 26th century someone is upset about a new author saying that Flight of Death was a Slytherin which isn't possible because he never went to Hogwarts.

** It /is/ an odd move, because while JKR is bad at math, she's /good/ at literature and classics. I find it highly unlikely that she didn't know this. I suspect the /real/ answer is, "Oops, I wanted to include Merlin, but I wrote myself into a corner." She's shown she isn't above playing fast and loose with cultural history.

That said, the Merlin of Arthurian legend isn't attested until Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century (which is also the first source to describe Arthur as a king). This is after the Potterverse Merlin would have lived, and there's a lot of "secret history" going on with the wizarding world anyway, so it's not crazy if in-story, Geoffrey's account was a conflation of earlier muggle legends with the wizarding history.

*** Because Merlin may be a legend, but those legends take place at a specific time which is hundreds of years before the founding of Hogwarts. And the wizarding world website just says "Merlin himself was sorted into Slytherin when he was at Hogwarts, and the young wizard went on to become one of the most famous wizards in history" which is fair enough but it at no point mentions that he was in that universe born later. On the wiki it says he was born later around 982, but a) the wiki is trash and b) it also says he was in king Arthur's court but we /know/ who all the king's from 982 onwards and Arthur is not one. If he did exist it was much earlier. So there needs to be an explanation for the divergence.

"Why is this such a big deal"- omg it's not, /both Merlin and the Potterverse are fiction./ I just thought it was interesting that JKRs canon has overridden a legend we've had in England and Wales for 800 years without so much as a by your leave or explanation!

All it needs to make sense is one line something like "he mastered time travel and returned to ancient times to serve king Arthur with his skills" and bam, it makes sense.

But the fact she doesn't bother with that upends other people's established stories for her own ends (and unlike us fic writers she makes money off what she says and produces, so she shouldn't rip off/mess with other people's works).

Merlin (Welsh: Myrddin, Cornish: Marzhin, Breton: Merzhin) is a mythological figure prominently featured in the legend of King Arthur and best known as an enchanter or wizard. His usual depiction, based on an amalgamation of historical and legendary figures, was introduced by the 12th-century British author Geoffrey of Monmouth and the translator John of Cornwall. Both appear to have combined existing stories of Myrddin Wyllt, a North Brythonic prophet and madman with no connection to Arthur, with tales of the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus to form the composite figure called Merlinus Ambrosius (Welsh: Myrddin Emrys, Breton: Merzhin Ambroaz). Geoffrey's rendering of the character became immediately popular, especially in Wales.

There's many, many stories about Arthur and Merlin, and a lot of the aesthetics don't add up with the time period- knights and chivalry were fashions of the time they were first written down, not the time they were set in or the time they were originally conceived, but you're quite correct, whatever adventures they get up to, those adventures are, in 99% of Arthurian legend and works based around it, set post Roman retreat and just after the Saxon invasion (the 500's, to be more specific).

*** The Harry Potter wiki says he was born in the 980s. And the wizarding world website seems to back this up.

However, both sources also state that he served in King Arthur's court, which would mean a massive divergence in Muggle British history if Arthur is placed as King at a time when we have a codified history of the monarchy. And nothing in the books indicates this happened, the Muggle world is the one we all know. And I feel like a huge divergence like that is something that would have been made clear (or should have been). The whole "Merlin was a Slytherin" anecdote was shoehorned in when Pottermore springs became a thing because they needed to have something "nice" to pacify people who got Slytherin and hadn't wanted it.

It annoys me because JKR has a bloody degree in English Literature. There's no way she doesn't know when the Merlin legends were set, and I feel like she just couldn't be bothered to make up any "nice" Slytherin characters for her cash in website, and just went "ah fuck it I'll just put Merlin and no one will notice," and it's so typical of her post-publication attitude. All about money and clickbait, no integrity for either her work or other people's.

** I think the Wiki just made up the bit about him sitting at the Round Table to flesh out the article, Wizarding World/Pottermore just says was in Slytherin, was powerful and in 15AD an award in his name was created.

It seems most likely to me that JKR does know the legends but either she has adjusted them (she does this for various creatures throughout the series - inspired by muggle legend, but not) or has deliberately decided that the Merlin who was sorted into Slytherin was someone who got merged into the legends, but not the ones from the early legends.

In the latter case, this world represent a misunderstanding between what muggleborns think Merlin represents and what the Wizarding world recall. Then again, so little is known about the founders that it could all have got confused.

I can imagine it would be one of the first things Hermione looked up, but it's not relevant to the plot.

My personal approach - but it doesn't fit with JKR's writing - is that the wizarding world experiences the same sorts of merging of historical figures. The "Merlin" who was in Slytherin was another figure.

Hardly anyone knows the identities of the Grey Lady or the Bloody Baron, nobody is reliably sure who the decedents of the Founders are or - seemingly - much information about the Founders time at all. (After all, there ought to have been dozens of books Hermione wanted from the library when the chamber was opened.) You'd think that 'original pupils of the founders' ought to be a top 'Sacred 28' quality.

Thus, it seems to me that very poor records on who was there at the time have survived.

** You're being ridiculous.

There is absolutely no reason for Rowling to try and adhere to a particular interpretation of a much interpreted legend. It's almost as bad as insisting on following the "original Welsh legend" because, you know, a lot of the canonical Arthurian stories were made up by the French. And the less said about historical versions the better... indeed, I'd go as far to argue the last several decades interest in this interpretation has proved an ill foundation for the subject's enduring popularity. Let's put it this way... knights as manifest in the round table's idealised version of them didn't exist until hundreds of years after you'd have everything supposedly happen.

You might as well just go Disney's Sword in the Stone and point out that Merlin's a time traveller. This argument has no greater nor lesser merit than saying "Merlin predates Hogwarts" or "it all happens around 1312".

*** I mean, I know all that. But the legends of Arthur and Merlin /are/ set at a specific time even if the information and attitudes in them are very much of the time they were written not the time they were set. But it would be ridiculous to set Arthurian legend after the Norman conquest, as we know who all the kings are from that point on and Arthur isnt one, not even as a known pretender.

Merlin and Arthur are, more than likely, fictional characters. I know this, you know this, JKR knows this. But even fiction has its own timelines and the established time setting for Merlin as a character is way earlier than the established time setting for Hogwarts founding. I just think it was ridiculous of her to choose a character that's so famously associated with pre Norman history and stuff him into a Norman setting.

**** I would be a lot more annoyed by it if Merlin's role in her worldbuilding was more central to any of the plot points. He's really just a bit of window dressing. I agree that his name being a swear word doesn't really mesh up with the timeline of him being a student.

In my head, he time travelled back to help Arthur. Since a lot of the stories have him knowing the past and future, maybe there was some odd paradox going on where he knew he was that same Merlin who helped King Arthur, and that if he didn't manage to go back and actually do it the past would end up diverging down a more terrible path. Maybe the alternate future would have been one where wizards and magical society were just straight up wiped out, and he saved everyone by doing it.

It would have been interesting to get accounts of the feats he had done from the perspective of other wizards. For him to be so revered in Wizarding society, people using his name as a swear, the highest honors able to be bestowed on a wizard being an Order of Merlin, etc., it always seemed like the wizard side of the story would have been pretty epic.

******* Her portrayals of magical creatures get explained in canon though. I have no issue with her using Merlin, it's not the principle of it that bothers me. It's that she's whacked him into a completely different timeline to the one everyone is familiar with, whilst retaining him as a member of King Arthur's court, thus placing Arthur in a time in which we know for a fact he couldn't have been King because we know who all the Kings are from that time on (and nothing, nothing at all in HP canon suggests any kind of divergent Muggle history, the wizarding world runs parallel but doesn't change our history).

What pisses me off about it is that it's yet another example of her retconing stuff and creating unnecessary questions/plot holes. It's like she didn't even think beyond "who's a famous wizard I can use? Oh yeah, Merlin, he'll do." She couldn't be bothered to create her own characters who were "good" Slytherin's, so she took something that was, as you rightly say, public domain but by doing so created a plot hole and showed a lack of respect for the original stories and any familiarity people may have had with them.

Put it this way. The very fact that in canon people use "oh Merlin" the way people in Muggle UK use "Jesus Christ"- a mild oath- indicates that he was an ancient, more godlike figure (which adds up with Merlin in the Merlin legends timeline). By placing him in the early eleventh century, part of recorded history, she's made him "real" to canon characters, which makes the use of his name as a mild swear word daft. It would be like Muggles saying "oh, William the Conqueror" when things go wrong! So my point is that, once again, she's retconing something, she's just putting any old shit on the wizarding world website and doesn't give a shit if it makes any sense. It's been all about money for her for years, not the integrity of the stories. And as someone who's been a fan since book one came out in 1997, it's upsetting and frustrating. She cares so little, not just for the integrity of her own works but for the integrity of others.

******** No they don't. We get shown /that/ mermen are the way they are, but not /why/. There's no explanation for the differences. And they play a far greater role in the books than Merlin does. And there are plenty of things that show that Harry Potter's history is not our own, like the different Playstation release date, or Thatcher never being Prime Minister, or prominent Elizabethan Malfoys. You'd probably dismiss them as "accidental historical inaccuracies", and maybe they are, but they are nonetheless evidence of difference.

Hell, the /mere existence/ of King Arthur, Camelot and the Round Table in history would be a massive change to real world history, considering that's all fictional too. You can't have it both ways.

Have you read TH White's The Once and Future King? The source for Disney's Sword in the Stone. It's set in the 14th century. Why isn't that bothering you this much, when it's the whole setting for the book, while a tiny detail in Harry Potter's worldbuilding is so upsetting to you? Why aren't all the other inaccuracies and changes from legends in Harry Potter so upsetting to you?

Just accept that authors have control over their own works. Harry Potter may not change Muggle history extensively, but it does make huge changes to wizarding history (if inventing the whole thing from scratch can be considered a "change"). In Harry Potter, the person called Merlin lived in a later time period than you thought. It doesn't create a plot hole or an inconsistency, because it doesn't actually figure in to the story. The story makes complete sense on its own; you're just importing your assumptions from other works.

Imagine there's a book with vampires. In this book, vampires' reflections do appear in mirrors. Now, someone coming from one of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vampire_traits_in_folklore_and_fiction][numerous other works]] where vampires fundamentally cannot appear in mirrors might have the same overblown reaction you're having now, because that's their personal ideal of vampires. But there's zero reason that particular trait has to be universal. Each author can invent their own fictional world in their own way.

People swore by saints for centuries, many of whom were much more recent (and obviously less divine) than Jesus. The French would swear by Joan of Arc within a century. Even now, there are exclamations that came from recent people, like how "Great Scott" originally referred to a 19th century US general.

And why do you think wizards don't have recorded history of Merlin, even if he was from the 6th century? And why should that matter? Jesus appears in recorded history. Historians agree that he was a real person, regardless of whether he was the son of god.

Finally, it's not a retcon. To be a retcon, something would need to be canon first, and then changed. This was the first time Merlin's lifetime was mentioned in Harry Potter canon. Only if she moved him to the 6th century would it be a retcon.

The following tables compare traits given to vampires in folklore and fiction. Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) the first vampire to be killed by daylight.Although Bram Stoker's novel is the best known vampire fiction of the 19th century, it is the aristocratic figure of Lord Ruthven who is thought to have inspired the elegant and suave creature of stage and film. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula "vanish" on stage. Recent vampire fiction set in the present typically has the vampires dressed either like everyday humans, or in hyper-stylish but contemporary attire.

That's, literally my point. At the point where most Arthurian myths are set, there were multiple kingdoms on this island with a range of leaders. Arthur, or his inspiration, could have been one of them. Or the character could be based on multiple war leaders. We don't know who they all were. So it works as a myth because it's possible if improbable, but there's enough mystery and unknown around this time that figures that are similar to who we know as Arthur and Merlin /could have lived/ at this time. So yeah, as I keep saying, putting him in a setting where we have codified history /would/ change things, but the majority of Arthurian myths don't do so. Obviously the ones written down in the c12 add all the Norman frippery into it, but that's stylistic, and at no point do any of these authors claim Merlin or Arthur as Norman contemporaries, they just have people in the past living a Norman culture with Norman values, which is daft but it's also the way people wrote back then. Everything was through the prism of the authors current experience. It's the date change JKR did that annoys me.

Yes I have, and The Once and Future King /isn't explicitly set in England./ It's clearly set here, in the fourteenth century, the context makes that obvious, but the fact he refers to the land they rule as Greymere not England/Britain makes it /explicitly an alternative universe./ This therefore doesn't change history. The whole point of HP is that it doesn't take place in an alternative universe, not for the Muggle stuff. That's what's so fascinating about Harry's story - he accesses a secret community that exists in tandem with the world we all live in.

The other inaccuracies and changes don't bother me because they work with the setting. There's a fair argument amongst people who study mythology that things such as mermaids, pixies and so on are "misremembered" or made up for a good story, or only seen briefly out of the corner of someone's eye and they're actually an animal or something else with a reasonable explanation and the description we know through myth is exaggerated and romanticised. Therefore it makes sense that if these things did exist, they would be nothing like Muggles think or like our mythology states. That is kind of explained in the texts- it all exists and always has, but not quite how Muggles think. Putting Merlin and by default Arthur after the Norman Conquest changes everything, massively, because we know there was no King Arthur at this point.

It's not "upsetting to me," I'm not "upset" and anyone who gets upset by a debate about some fictional characters frankly needs to get a life. I just thought it was interesting, it occurred to me that her whacking Merlin onto Pottermore was a bit of a mistake and I thought a conversation on here about it would be more interesting than the constant "who loves or hates Harmony shipping" stuff. Sorry that someone having an opinion contrary to yours offends you.

Ok, I don't recall the Elizabethan Malfoys reference, but that also makes sense in context anyway- Elizabeth I was known to entertain court magicians, the Malfoys of the day obliged. After the statute, their names were wiped from Muggle records. That makes logical sense with what we know of how wizards do things.

The Playstation and Thatcher things are easily explained as well (I've read your other comment and realise now what you're referring to with that, cheers for clarifying)- JKR only decided at the last minute to put 1981 on James and Lily's grave. And she's said that, it was just a date pulled out of the air. Up until DH came out, everyone reading assumed the books started in roughly 1996/1997, the year they came out, as there's nothing in them until DH that states otherwise. And Dudley having a playstation made perfect sense at the time when we all thought GoF was set in 2000/2001. Same with the PM's in HBP- the assumption was that the scene was set in late 2002, thus the PM was Tony Blair and his predecessor, John Major, was indeed a he. So what annoys me about that is the same as the Merlin thing- that at the last minute she pops something in that changes the whole book series and the history goes out of whack.

It is a bit because she's unwittingly claimed that the Muggle world Harry inhabits has vastly different history from our own and at no point is that made clear in the books.

But it annoys me more that she has, and indeed continues to, constantly tinker with the world and stories she creates. And I'm not alone in the fandom on this, you can hear the collective groans worldwide when she tweets some random "fact" about how, idk, wizards just used to shit themselves where they stood until the 1800s which is a) disgusting and no one asked and b) she said this despite having a whole book with the plot point that the CoS was built into the plumbing by Salazar himself.

It's the fact she's so thoughtless about her own works, and yes, other people's works. She doesn't give a toss for anything but money these days, and it shows. JK has a degree in English literature, she knows full well when the Arthurian legends are meant to be set, and she decided "ah sod it, I'll just use Merlin no one will notice. They didn't notice when I put Playstation's in the wrong time or erased that old hag Thatcher from history"- oh we did, Jo. The fandom really did.

** The best I can say is that the Statue of secrecy messed with Muggle History so they got the date mixed up since the Merlin and Arthur stories first popped up around the 10th centuray. Another interpretation is that Merlin in regards to king Arthur's stories (as is the one JK references to) can be set in any era because Arthurian Canon is a mess and far more complicated than you might expect.

** He's considered Slytherin because he was taught directly by Salazar Slytherin and portrayed the traits of slytherin, determination, shrewdness, and ambition.

*** How can he have been taught by someone who was born hundreds years after him though? This is my point. I know that's what JKRs website says, but Merlin lived in the 6th century, Slytherin lived in the 10th. Even if Merlin did live to the time of the founders, he'd have been hundreds of years old and not needing to go to school. It is the equivalent of claiming Nicholas Flamel was taught by Snape and McGonagall- he might have still been alive when they taught at Hogwarts but he deffo doesn't need their help with knowledge.
