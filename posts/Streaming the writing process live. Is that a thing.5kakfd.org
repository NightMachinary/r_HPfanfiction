** As an author I cannot see why I would do this. So much pressure, such a high chance of sudden writers block, and people would see how much crap I write before I edit it down to something okay-ish.

*** But it could be funny to see this "crap" :)

**** Probably less funny than you're imagining and more bitterly disappointing. The difference between my first and final draft is usually vast.

***** But isn't the progression from the first draft to the final one interesting ? Okay, maybe the OP's idea would be better if it wasn't live and was instead accelerated through montage, but I still think it could be at least intriguing.

****** Probably not to be honest. The majority of my time is me deleting, rewriting, deleting again, agonising over a single word, playing candy crush, feeling guilty and trying to write again, writing myself into a corner, realising I've forgotten to mention something that should have been mentioned several chapters ago, playing candy crush again, complaining to my boyfriend about how hard it is to write ___ character...

*** Harlan Ellison used to make appearances where he would set up in a bookstore window and write a complete short story. He wanted to demonstrate that 'a writer writes' and had developed the discipline to be able to bang something out regardless of level of inspiration.

** Should be interesting. I don't know for people who don't write, but I'm always interested to see how people get to /that/ precise plot or /this/ perfect twist.

** Sometimes when I post google docs here and then continue to work on them, people can watch me write... Which is a weird thing to do. I feel like people constantly judge my work, not to mention that a lot of crap that gets deleted eventually makes me scowl myself.
