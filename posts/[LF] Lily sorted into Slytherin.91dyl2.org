****** She would probably die, before the OWLs.

We talk about the middle of the war here (it started before those characters even got their letters), where the majority of those terrorist are from Slytherin and want to prove their worth and you think they would let a mudblood spoil their precious pureblood house (even if they tolerate so halfbloods, but those at least have one worthy side)

******* I don't think she'd be dead if she can work out how to at least make herself connected to a magical family, we know Lily had sense and Evans is an extremely common surname. I don't think it's unlikely that maybe a half blood family had the surname Evans. And keeping to herself, she'd not be dead. I mean, there was a Granger dude as well, Hermione could easily tweak it so that she appears related to him.

And even if she were a Slytherin, she wouldn't let her guard down /that/ easily. It will make her more cautious. Anyway, I don't think Lily would be a Slytherin as the hat immediately placed her in Gryffindor. I think she'd be a Hufflepuff, and break the stereotype of then being untalented. I mean her traits do line up (just, hard-working, loyal, fair).

******** If anyone makes her deny her own parents and family, she is the unlikable b*tch in the story.

It just wouldn't fit at all with the canon character and that is a terrible problem I have with fanfiction, if you don't give a damn about the canon character create an OC and you can twist them like you want.

But more than anything she seemed to be brave and chivalric. She is brave to stand up for her friends.

Loyalty, I never know if that is what I would call her first. Her curiosity won out over her loyalty to her sister and she befriended the strange boy even after he attacked her sister.

He stopped being friends with him, when her loyalty would with her selfworth and morals and loyalty lost out. Following our own code of morals over anything else is a Gryffindor thing.

To me James was always more of a Hufflepuff between those characters. To him loyalty is most important. Mistrusting his friends is the worst thing. He forgave Sirius after the betrayed the others by revealing Remus' secret.

********* No, not really. She's not outright denying her heritage and family. She could just go 'oh, Mr. Evans is my great uncle' and if he went along with it, her parents are still there. After all, she's protecting herself from the people in that house so I wouldn't say she's unloyal or unlikeable, she's just trying to stay alive. If she doesn't do that, then that's pride bordering on stupidity. Unless, what, she was just extremely charming so people perceived it as intelligence? Unlikely, don't you think?

She was just nine/ten when her 'curiosity' betrayed her loyalty. And even then, what happened is that Snape accidently broke the branch on Petunia, Lily rightfully got angry and then forgave him when he told her he didn't do it on purpose. That's not betraying anything. If he did it in purpose then you'd have a point. But Petunia couldn't handle Lily having a new friend, that's her problem. And she was only ten, if that was indeed one of her flaws then it'd have gone since Lily was loyal even to the rest of the Marauders, something she didn't need to be, not really. Flaws at such a young age disappear later on in life. For example, I was very reckless and too weepy but now I can't be called either.

That's mot necessarily a Gryffindor thing. It's mot listed as one of the qualities. Slytherins Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws can have that trait. Either way, Lily in any other house would be OOC so I truly believe she wouldn't fit in any other house except Gryffindor since it only took a second to sort her. Which is why I view her as a true Gryffindor, with the flaws and all. It's called knowing your own self worth.

********** Her being in another house would be OOC, I can agree with that.

Why I called it a Gryfindor trait is because, Gryffindor stands for bravery and chivalry and at least to be that is what chivalry is at it's core. Following a moral code and being ready to go to bloody battle for it.

********** I think she mentioned it only once and said it as the the first instance of defying him, but I'm not sure. The thing is, she counted it as defying him and if it were indeed an act of defiance, Dumbledore would've mentioned it and said escaped him twice. I can't see how turion him down wouldn't act as defiance which leads me to believe she just messed up. Hagrid was a member of the Order and the Order was pretty small, so I think he'd know. However, it could go either ways.

************ Yeah, maybe they escaped him three times in the same day? Who knows, I'd like to see one where they do just that. But if he did indeed try to, maybe it was just a general thing and nothing personal, since if it was that personal about the Potters being mega talented it'd count as defying. I like to think that if it did happen, Voldemort was trying to recruit anyone from the Order and no one - except Pettigrew - accepted it because he really needed a spy. But that's just a headcanon :P

********* I agree that this conflict would need to be addressed, it would be weird if it was just glossed over. I could see this working in a fic where she proves herself to one of the older students who then helps ensure no one kills her for sport. Not Snape cause he's also just an ickle firstie at this point, but Malfoy could work as he was a 5th year prefect at this point. I've also seen some Slytherin!Hermione fics where Snape as her Head of House intervenes, or where they pretend she's a half blood.

********** And the moment a character agrees to pretend to be anything but what they are, those become cowards and unrecognizable to their original character.

You can do something like placing a muggleborn in Slytherin in Harry's time, because at least in the beginning there is no open war.

But in the Marauder time there is bloody open war going on and people die. Lots of people die and people die because they didn't seem loyal enough to Voldemort. Why would anyone risk their neck for a mudblood first year? Perseveration is one of Slytherin's big traits and one we see in every Slytherin to some degree in the books other than most other skills, and protecting a mudblood liek that would go against that

*********** But we also know that in the marauders era there was a lot of uncertainty about who was on Voldemort's side. There could be plenty of reasons for some of the Slytherins to protect her, for example to make themselves /look/ innocent in public, which would certainly work with the self preservation theme. It could be part of the plot that Lily thinks people are on her side when they're really not. Lots of different options to take this in.

************ I don't say she would die right away, but she would die within the first three years.

It can be a very interesting story, about how this affects the other characters, or even a crime mystery, but she would probably die or be clever enough to fake her death after an attempt on it and run away from the magical world.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
