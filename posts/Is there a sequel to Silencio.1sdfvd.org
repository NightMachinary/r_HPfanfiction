** Yes, Secrets, on Hawthorne and Vine as well as Granger Enchanted. It's a WIP, with not 5 chapters having been written. It hasn't been updated in a while, sadly, but those five chapters are very good. Tantalizingly so.

** Awesome news! Secrets hasn't been abandoned. AkashaTheKitty posted the [[http://akashathekitty.livejournal.com/214120.html#][next chapter]] today.

** There's in unfinished sequel and it hasn't been updated in 9 months. To be honest, I believe the author (AkashaTheKitty) might have abandoned it and writing in general. She hasn't released anything since March (no story updates, no one-shots, drabbles, etc.), which is very unlike her. If you read her personal blog (which she also seems to have stopped updating), you'll see that she has two very young children to take care of and seems to suffer from depression. I think she just doesn't have the time or energy for it anymore, which is a shame. She's one of my favorite dramione authors. If you haven't read her other stories, you should check them out.
