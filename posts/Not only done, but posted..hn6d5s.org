** A very enjoyable fic and is probably going to go up there as one of my favorite Haphne fics right up there with Importance of Intent. Good job! Now finish your Harry/Fleur fic so I can binge read it.

  The bloody war has ended at Harry's sixth-year. Though hailed a hero, he's ready for one last year at Hogwarts. One year of a normal life before becoming an Auror. While there, a simple agreement manages to challenge his identity as a hero, while still providing the normalcy he craves. Haphne AU. Post-War 7th year.

** I've read the first couple of chapters and enjoyed them. You write well and the characters are all clearly defined and unique, which is a major plus point with me. I'll finish the story and post a review but I wanted to say Well Done here before posting here became necromancy.

Not sure about having Katie turn up btw - she was a year ahead of Harry so should have graduated the year before the one that they spent horcrux hunting. Doesn't really matter though.

** Why not just call it Harry x OC? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Okey, I stop being a dick now :P Congrats on your first completed fic, I'll take a look as it's not too long.

*** My take on it is that the main background characters used on fanfic have general tropes that go with them, so while they're /basically/ OCs, it lets readers know generally what to expect and makes it ever so marginally easier on the author. Same with Susan Bones and (to a lesser extent) Fleur.

That said, I'll try to read it next too, congrats on finishing a fic!
