I just met a couple of people who couldn't even begin to THINK of the possibilities in a potential slash ship. Suddenly, they were all yelling that said characters were obviously straight, and it's "disgusting that you mistake friendship for attraction".

First of all, this is fandom. All ships are possible ships. The weirdest ships happen and people can speculate all they want. There's a lot of space in fandom, and we've imagined a whole bunch of other endings. Not being able to conceptualize someone being gay is uncreative (and homophobic). You can imagine Harry being the next Dark Lord, but you can't imagine him being gay? Hipogriffs run around in this world, but you draw the line at him being in love with Ron, his best friend without whom he utterly miserable?

I get that we don't all share the same headcanons. That's fine, but dear god, you can't even think of a rebuttal past "they're straight"? Uncreative and your homophobia is showing.

EDIT/CLARIFICATION: this post is in reference to people coming to discussions of LGBT headcanons yelling "THEY'RE STRAIGHT". They butted into a discussion that was from the get-go OBVIOUSLY not their thing and wrecked the conversation by claiming that said LGBT headcanons have no right to exist. Hopefully this context clarifies the post.

FURTHER CLARIFICATION:I'm NOT calling people who don't like most slash for whatever reason homophobic. That's their business (although they make me wary and I entreat that they have a frank conversation with themselves about why this blanket ban exists. It's always a good conversation to have with the self JUST IN CASE the prejudice still exist)

I'm calling people who BUTT INTO conversations that discuss characters from the lens of queerness, scream "THEY'RE STRAIGHT", then leave without further addition un-creative and yes, homophobic. Because the conversation was OBVIOUSLY NOT FOR THEM. And yet they act as if the conversation is absolutely pointless because apparently these characters CANNOT EVER BE GAY. Not even in someone ELSE'S imagination. Just because these people themselves CAN'T imagine these characters as gay.

I'M JUST ASKING THAT THEY LEAVE SUCH CONVERSATIONS ALONE! If it's not their cup of tea, they could just WALK AWAY. Leave us to have our discussions in peace WITHOUT SHOVING YOUR IDEAS DOWN OUR THROAT.


** Ngl, my first thought upon reading the title was that you were talking about m/f ships that get dismissed because ‚Äúhet is boring‚Äù and I was so down to seeing that analysis, that I forgot for a moment that homophobia exists

I /can/ understand not wanting romance between certain characters (being ace this applies to /all/ variations) and it does get tiring after a while, but still, you don't have to participate in discussions. You /can/ just, avoid it. Walk away. If someone else having fun making them gay is hurting you, maybe consider some introspection.

Honestly, with enough au in a fic, /every/ ship is possible and frankly I don't get the obsession with whether it is viable in canon. If I wanted to read something canon, I'd read /canon/.

** I'll be honest... As a heterosexual male, slash is not my thing, just as I would not go for gay porn for example. Personal preference, but I don't think of myself as homophobic because I do not hate gay people, nor do I think lesser of them. But I also don't care much for romance and regardless of whether the characters are gay or straight, I will skip endless paragraphs of love-dovey stuff. However if the story is good enough otherwise that I am willing to suffer through them, I would prefer the relationships to be canonical.

Also I definitely don't think Drarry would ever work because Draco and Harry are bitter rivals, horrible to one another (despite the occasional displays of mercy in Book 7) and anything that would lead to them getting together would ruin their amazing dynamic. Also they never shared a period of friendship, as Dumbledore and Grindelwald did.

***** Yer gettin pretty deep into fanfic metaphysic, but alot of the fanfics that people /really/ enjoy involve characters who deviate from cannon. If every character behaved as they behave in cannon, well, that story has been written, it's called Harry Potter. People are drawing precisely what they choose to draw from the source material, and often that involves surface level characteristics/roles, but frankly, it can be whatever they want.

Why do you read any book? If you read anything that's not fanfic, then it is just a story about OCs. If you're against pure romance, then sure, but many many stories that include romance that aren't necessarily focussed on it.

I get that, if you want to write a fic about a duck called Harry Potter more power to you. But when you post it for public review you have to accept some people are going to immediately comment that harry is NOT a DUCK. You will also have to accept that some people have zero interest in reading about Duck!HarryPotter and they are not Anatidaephobic because of it.

If you need a place where you don't have to deal with that, maybe post your fic on your local duck related board.

At which point it becomes rather odd to go to every Duck!fic and decry harry's species, considering the fact that the author and everyone reading the book are well aware of where the fic diverges from cannon, and are reading it anyways. It's not an objective flaw, is my point. It's like walking out of Avengers and getting mad that it wasn't an avant-garde art film. It wasn't supposed to be, and frankly, never really advertised itself as otherwise.

******* This is the thing I have wondered forever. Do people go into fics expecting them to be rewrites if the books/movies? I've read comments that feel the need to correct authors on unimportant HP lore... but quite frankly I've read dozens of fics that have entirely unique or altered lore but rests on the Harry Potter ‚Äúframe‚Äù so to speak. Altering and creating an original story BASED (that's a key word friend) on the original lore, is key, as it satisfies the peak amount of readers.

But I said it previously and I'll say it again, Harry Potter is the ultimate blank-slate fandom. You can create just about anything you want with ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù and assign him any name under the sun and it still has potential for being a good book while following the guidelines of using fandom characters (and I personally welcome and appreciate well designed OCs, or out of character side-characters brought into the limelight.)

The secret to enjoying FanFiction is letting go of the strict stipulations that you think need to exist. This is free form writing with familiar names at best and plagiarizing at worst, so I take what I can get.

The reason I, and many others, read FanFiction Is to further explore the world in a setting that is beyond what jk Rowling thought of. I want to see further world building and expansion and unique ideas that are presented without being lore dumps. I love and appreciate authors who create their own pure blood society with laws and all, or creature fics with their tantalizing tales and danger (and usually smut if we're honest). I love authors who create coffee shop AUs and authors who create massive fics about the new king of the magical world, ‚ÄúHadrian Augustus Emrys-Pendragon‚Äù.

It really doesn't matter. They post them to the same fic sharing platform as all of the other 500 word one-shot smut fics. In the end, it's up to you, the reader, to become adept at navigating these website to display what you want to see. What is NOT allowed is you telling people not to write fics that you don't like. You can leave with that negative energy. They can post it wherever, however they want (but please tag properly without being obscene, thanks) and you can't stop them. Deal with it.

Also, I would and have read fics of Harry Potter being in a crossover fic serving NO purpose other than being a rather smart cat. So I'm not above Duck!Harry

*********** Ah see here's where the brilliance of FANFICTION comes in. The reality is any situation is possible if an author can justify it.

As for the original comment; I was speculating. Drarry is highly unlikely in the original source material. Jk Rowling made that choice, and I respect that.

But this is FanFiction. Anything can be justified to whatever point the author deems is enough for a desired action to be made realistically by the protagonist. That could be as much as just saying ‚Äúyeah Harry is born gay.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHarry introduces himself to Draco (first)‚Äù (quite frankly, Draco knowing Harry's name rather than assuming he's a Muggleborn would have made him much nicer and probably would have driven him to being either a sucking up or showing off as much as possible). This is why I argue in favor of fanfics- because small changes can make a huge difference. Harry was disillusioned by Draco because he tried to bond over hating something- a common tactic for making friends of all ages. He was later disillusions to both Draco and Slytherin in general by Ron on the train and draco's behavior soon after. If Harry has met neither of them, he'd probably be a Slytherin, since he wouldn't have had any reason to argue against the sorting hat. This is a frequently explored direction of fanfics.

I don't give a flying fuck about the source material tbh. Jk Rowling's books aren't good. There's a reason she was rejected so many times- that first book is a rough read. But she had a unique idea and that was enough to spawn all of this. I respect the source material enough to not change established spell names and creature names and some events, but not enough to maintain anything else as ‚Äúmust-happen‚Äù. Your entire world view is just so close minded it's unbelievable.

*** While I do agree with the first paragraph, not all slash is composed or contains smut. Comparing it to gay porn is a huge stretch. There are many good stories where the slash is simply background or not explored at all. But, I agree that the random, unannounced and untagged sex scenes out of nowhere can leave many readers cautious. As a gay man, I would instantly tap out of a story if two women started scissoring while eating some toast when it was not mentioned at all. I, however, frequently read relationships with lesbian protagonists, same with straight. I think one of the best stories I ever read had a straight pairing.

However, this sub seems to be on a crusade with this topic and I have tried to avoid it. Yes, it does suck that the community is fragmented and split, but many subreddits or fandoms are. It is not a bad thing and people need to stop accusing people of being homophobic for not liking what they like. Yes, this subreddit seems to mass downvote slash for very little reason, but there is literally a subreddit for it that is linked regularly. Ugh.

But, yes, you said it best. Personal preference exists and should not be disregarded so that people do not get upset that someone is not reading about their favourite pairings. It is silly.

As for the second paragraph, huge disagree. I have experience with it. A friend of mine (no longer the case, really) was always at ends with this one guy. Instant anime arc potential. They were rivals in almost every field, different spectrums, and different social status. They would change their core beliefs to disagree and attack one another. They often fought and beat each other up, caused the other immeasurable discomfort, and even tried to ruin their careers (literally going into their workplace and setting them up to get fired). Not in a million years would I have bet on them getting together, I would put money on them moving away from each other. Yet, they are married now.

The thing is, they still act like they did in school. Everything is a competition. That same energy is there. They love to hate each other. Their relationship was obviously good, but it was twisted and weird.

With Draco and Harry, the hate and their dynamic instantly vanishes. Draco instantly stops being racist, ends up becoming a new character instantly. Or, if the ‚Äòdark' side wins, Harry changes. A good writer can make it work, just like with any character. A good writer could make Harry and Voldemort work.

Sadly, a lot of women (not a bad thing) write slash (male pairings) and that causes skewed and unrealistic relations as they tend to use yaoi as a baseline.

I have written too much, going to stop here as you get the point.

*** I'm not saying you not liking slash makes you homophobic. I definitely agree with your assessment of Drarry for example. That's okay. Preference is a thing, and I rarely read straight stuff either.

My problem comes with people barging into my essays, headcanons, and fics all yelling THEY'RE STRAIGHT!!! I made the stuff for the purpose of entertaining people like me, for people who like to speculate on the gay stuff. That comment is rude and asinine. It doesn't even contribute to the discussion. I made my points based on personality and methods of interaction. Yelling that that's impossible because the character is straight tells me that they aren't even considering the baselines of interaction that I offered.

And then there's the people who say we're disgusting for daring to imagine that these two people with so much love for each other (even as friends) could end up as romantic. It's a headcanon! It's speculation for what could happen! Hipogriffs exist! Why can't gay people?! The author already obviously agreed with them, why couldn't they let me have I bits of speculation?

Anyway, my point is that story preferences didn't make them homophobic. Their comments did. And casual homophobia is a thing. Just don't go barging into discussions in queerness with rude takes please? That's all I'm asking really!

**** AO3 is currently the most popular fanfic site, right? Something like 85% of all the HP content there is slash.

I genuinely have no idea how slash fans on here have a persecution complex when it's so widespread.

I don't like (Harry) slash because I generally like it when a character is canon up until some kind of divergence point within canon. When people try to do that by making Harry gay it ends up having a bunch of really awful explanatory prose or justifications so they can have their preferred relationship. Slash authors do this all the time.

And don't even get me started on the characterizations. I can't help but think 99% of slash fics are written by girls and young women who don't know how to write men or boys. So when they're not excuses to write explicit sex scenes involving children(Harry/draco), teachers that are pedophiles(Harry/snape), or similar degeneracy they lean on crappy television stereotypes of gay men where the stereotypes become their entire personality (Sirius/Remus). Honestly, I find a lot of slash fics to be, well, homophobic.

What you're doing here is trying to shut down fair and free discussion by suggesting anyone that disagrees with you is a bigot. You're on an open, public, forum where people may not agree with you. If you talk about how Draco and Harry are perfect for each other or some such thing that's complete and utter nonsense based on canon, then you'll probably get someone to mention that. They're not oppressing you or anyone else and they're not "butting in." If you want to have a private discussion in a censored safe space then do it over private messaging. Every one of us has an equal right to "butt in" to any thread on here to discuss the topic at hand. *By posting on this open forum you're inviting anyone to respond to you.*

This reeks of an attempt at censorship. There's plenty of reasons to discuss the negative sides of slash fics. There's also some out there I really like. I don't think this sub is a hive of homophobia. I think that it skews a bit less towards the...tumblr/ao3 demographic that you may prefer.

**** I agree with you completely even though I'm not all that interested in slash.

If I don't want to read something it seems obvious that I will not read it.

For me personally, even if it's not entirely what this discussion is about, I dislike slash simply because usually it involves completely changes a character with no reasons for it other than wanting to make certain characters be with another one.

However that same thing makes it hard for me to read so many other fanfics in general. They simply have such major changes without reason.

Or worse in my mind, which is these changes typically have no other effects on the story. Like Harry having taken care of the prophecy, knows nobody is in trouble, isn't going to try and ambush death eaters or what have you, yet he still ends up in the ministry with just the same group of people, in the same situation. Or a fic adds a person to Harry's friend group that just happens to not be on scene at any important events.

Basically what I'm saying is that for me, personally, a fic being slash isn't the main issue. Instead the main issue is that fics don't give good reason for changes, nor do they really change things enough for it to not be a reread of canon.

That said, I hate unannounced sex scenes as well.

*** My problem with Drarry is that most of the fics seem to keep him exactly as he was in the books, a racist little shit and try to come up with reasons to excuse that. Now if there were to be a fic where Lucius and Narcissa were arrested and Draco was raised by Andromeda, I might actually check that out. But at that point it feels like its changing the character too much that it might as well be a whole new character.

Don't get me wrong, we should be allowed to change the characters to suit where the fic is going, but if youre changing them so much that they no longer feel like them, what's the point?

**** Most readers haven't read canon for a long time. If they did they'll realize that lots of fanfics are filled with OOC characters compared to canon.

Like I said in another comment, many of the stories that are frequently recommended and loved by this sub are filled with OOC Harry/Hermione/Ron. Off the top of my head, famous stories like A Cadmean Victory, Emperor, A Black Comedy, HP and the Prince of Slytherin, HP and the BWL, The Sum of Their Parts, etc. all have a Harry with attributes that are OOC (and there's nothing wrong with that).

Nobody really realizes it of course. Instead the whole OOC argument is used to put down certain stories and pairings, while ignoring the fact those same criticisms can be levied at the stories they like.

I mean just today I saw someone recommend linkffn(11764057). It has 1,412 reviews and based on favs/follows it's pretty popular. However this Harry is not canon Harry at all (and again that's okay).

So Harry/McGonagall or Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Fleur is totally reasonable pairings, but Harry/Ron, Harry/Cedric or the like is completely off limits?

Also the people who ask for recommendations say that they're fine with all pairings except for slash... maybe you're not homophobic, but you're coming across as one by saying that. If you say you don't like certain slash pairings that'd be one thing, but to be against all of them? When you're perfectly fine with other pairings?

I can see you not being okay with Lucius/Harry, Snape/Harry or Draco/Harry, but there are other slash pairings out there, that could be interesting, and Harry/Ron is more believable then Harry/Fleur, especially since a lot of Harry/Fleur only happen because "he's able to withstand the Veela charm, so he's so charming to Fleur" which is overused.

When it comes to Slash, I most commonly read fics with straight pairings, but I wouldn't say thats because I am straight as well, I would say thats mostly because the majority of the Slash fics I see have Harry paired with someone he shouldn't be like Snape or Malfoy. I dont read those the same way I wouldnt read a fic where Harry was paired with McGonagall or Pansy Parkinson.

Tbh I get the feeling from the discussion on this sub on the topic over the last few days that we have a terminology issue which is causing different 'sides' to come at this issue at cross purposes. Seems to me there are some people that believe A Slash Story is /a subgenre of romance fiction/ focusing on a male/male pairing. It isn't. It's a (perhaps old hat term now?) story, /any/ story, that features a male/male pairing.

By classic standards of the term, something like Torchwood, Sense8, or Glee would be a slash story because it features gay or bisexual characters.

So, I think the difficulty in discussion comes when person A says "I have no interest in reading a slash story" (meaning: a romance-focused story following two male characters paired), and person B - who is perhaps more familiar /with/ slash stories takes that as person A saying "I have no interest in reading /any/ story that features a male/male pairing or the existence of male/male relationships".

****** You've hit the nail on the head. Until this moment, I never realized that slash meant anything else besides a /romance/ story between two same sex characters. As in, the romance is the plot. So I would've said that I don't like slash stories and never read them. But according to the second definition, I read them all the time. Admittedly, the main character is not usually part of the slash couple, but occasionally they are. They're just action/adventure/mysteries or whatever and the main character is already part of an established couple, and they just otherwise go about their normal lives, go home to their partner for dinner, or worry about them if they're missing, or whatever a non- slash couple would be doing in the same story.

There are people out there who won't read stories with male/male in at all, or make rude complaint when even a minor character is gay.

The difficulty I have is that I'm not really into romance/sex focused stories and want action/adventure/mystery like you, but the insistence of subreddits means that instead of being able to get recs for that story type in one place, I effectively have to post in multiple places.

I don't know. It's frustrating to have my sexuality treated as though it doesn't belong alongside male/female pairings. I mean, people are literally into Voldemort/fem!Harry and...

Because logically /of course/ if person A doesn't generally read romance fics then they wouldn't want to read any kind of one, but at the same time, person B hearing person A assert strongly /at any opportunity/ that they have no interest in reading /about gay characters at all/ is going to be rightfully upset and angered by that line of thought.

But the only reason they are so named is to differentiate from the het-pairing grasp on all the other genres - which again goes back to a time when homosexuality was less accepted by the mainstream.

It goes back to a time when things were categorised as for example: Adventure, Thriller, Hurt/Comfort, Romance, Gay/Lesbian. Wherein /anything/ with any gay or lesbian content would be relegated into the latter category, no matter whether it was otherwise a thriller or a romance or just a slice of life.

We aren't talking about people not liking the romance genre (which is what you're talking about). We're talking about people who dislike slash REGARDLESS of characters, genre, writing etc. The only common denominator to their dislike is slash itself.

And on my end where that's usually the lead up to a whole bunch of other nasty stuff, I have all the right to be wary. I don't like Drag Race too, but when you shut off the tv every time two men so much as hold hands or kiss, the problem is more than not liking that specific tv show.

And you are being disingenuous.

On FFN there are (rated K-T) 3200 Drarry fics, 494 Snarry and 624 Harry/Tom Riddle and Harry/Voldemort. I didn't check the fics rated M, but I have a feeling Drarry and Snarry would be the main ships there.

Compare this to the 136 Harry/Ron and the staggering 46 Harry/Cedric fics.

Now let's move on to AO3 where Drarry has... over 40000 fics. Second comes Snarry with 11600, and Harry/Riddle with 4100. Harry and Ron as a couple are featured in around 1800 fics, and Harry/Cedric in 486.

The vast majority of shashfics in this fandom are ships that I don't want to read. So my options are wading through a pile of trash on the off chance of finding a good rare pair fic or... asking for no slash. Making my life easier wins every time.

  If you say you don't like certain slash pairings that'd be one thing, but to be against all of them?

  but there are other slash pairings out there, that could be interesting
#+end_quote

Except they're still all male on male romance, and it's perfectly okay to not want to read about it, particularly when it's a significant focus of the fic.

This seems a bit like saying "You don't like red meat? But you said you were okay with any type of seafood for dinner. What about this type of red meat? Or this one? How can you like that seafood meal but not this red meat one?"

**** I'm one of the people who would probably exclude slash pairings if asking for fic because there's a lot of uncomfortable fetishization that's going on in most of them. And it is fine if they don't want to read about them. But I think there's a lot of merit to asking themselves why not.

The problem comes when it is the one and only thing you discount in a whole ocean where other problematic things exist too. You already pointed this out - they made a blanket ban on all slash ships while willing to risk weird het ships. Chances then are that it's not the weird slash ships they're worried about, it's slash itself. If it's the only exception then it's fair to wonder why and for people like me to be rightly wary. I'm not going to attack them for not wanting to read them. I'm not going to even ask them why.

But it is a red flag. Homophobia has a long history in fandom, and it is extremely prevalent even to this day. I've since learned that while false positives on homophobia exist, they are few and far in between.

**** I understand, though I love seeing how characters would react differently to me, some of my favorite types of stories (not just with fanfiction, but anything) my favorite characters tend to be the ones that are quite different then I am, in terms of personality.

I'm personally able to read a story, understand or try to understand their reasoning of why they do a certain thing, even if I don't necessarily agree with that character. I think it makes it more interesting reading stories where you don't necessarily agree with characters, but are forced to try and understand why they are doing the things that they are doing.

For instance, one of my favorite characters in the books is Severus Snape, I would hate him irl, if I didn't understand his character, but because I read the books I can understand where he is coming from, even if I still don't agree with certain things he has done.

*** Honestly I wouldn't mind reading Harry Ron or Harry Cedric fics as long as romance isn't the focus of the story. The reason I don't typically read slash is exactly as you said. Somehow Harry/blood purist female is ok but blood purist/male isn't is a bit weird.

I'm not a fan of allure immune Harry ‚Äúyou're a god harry‚Äù fics.

That said though, I think it has something to do with the type of reader. I don't mean homophobic or straight or gay or whatever someone identifies as but more if someone is like an observer of the action or someone who puts themselves into the story.

For me personally, I am an escapist type reader(self diagnosed/defined I suppose). I read and put myself into the story and so I can read straight or even femslash stories without issue because I can, I don't think understand is the right word but basically if I'm reading a story, I prefer a fic to be something that's in line with my own interests. I'm putting myself into a story with a premise I like, and going along with it. But when a story has something that doesn't go along with what I want/am like or whatever, it makes it more difficult for me to read.

Basically even if a story is exceedingly well written, if I can't immerse myself in it, I have trouble reading it with the same level of enjoyment when I have to reimmerse myself in it, if that makes sense.

There are other examples of this in the story... Why Harry reacted to Hermione going behind his back about the broom, Harry's response to Ron turning on him, and a few other things are written from the female perspective.

While it could be taken this way, I am /not/ saying gay men think like women, or that they aren't male....

That said, it's not out of the question for a man to see other men as attractive, while not being sexually aroused by them. I had mostly female friends in high school and got to listen to a lot of girl talk... I occasionally dropped my own opinions.(this will date me a bit but...) For example, I shocked the crap out of them when i said that Viggo Mortensen was more attractive then Orlando Bloom in my opinion. Bloom was a pretty /boy/, while Mortensen had the whole rugged /man/ thing going). However I can't ever recall ever being sexually attracted to men.

** I agree with most of your points. People who butt into conversations about slash like that should stay out, and in my opinion, they fundamentally misunderstand the point of fanfic. It's about changing canon and turning it into your own world. Yeah, a Harry may not have been into Ron in canon, but he also wasn't into pretty much every other pairing you put him with that isn't Ginny (or Cho).

This applies very broadly in my opinion. People constantly criticize things as non-canon, but that's often the point. Yes, I think it's good to stay rooted in the reality of the series, but it's for no other reason than because those areas are often common grounds of enjoyment for HP fanfic readers. Just because it's good to stay grounded, does not mean a writer shouldn't change stuff. If they didn't, it would be called plagiarism. The variations and surprises across fanfics are what make them entertaining.

With that said, I think the vast majority of people who don't like to read/won't read slash are not prejudiced (or at least that dislike of slash isn't a reflection of their prejudices). I don't like to read slash and so I don't read slash, but I don't think it's because of any personal bias. I'm straight and I find it difficult to relate to the stories, so I don't read them. I just don't have any interest in stories about romance between men because I don't have romantic inclinations towards men. As well, I don't even like romance in general, and slash is often the focus of a story, so I'm not gonna wanna read it. Another way to think about it is that people read stories because they are interested in the subject matter, and slash is a subject that many people aren't interested in, even if they don't take issues with it.

I know you made it clear that you don't have a problem with all people who don't like slash, but it just felt like you were imply that many of said people had malicious intent, even if they didn't all have it. I think some do, but it's a very small, but slightly more vocal, section of the group. If you weren't implying anything of the sort, I apologize.

On a side note, I think many slash pairings have issues of their own and that is what turns people off from them. From what I've seen, Harry/Draco/Snape/Voldemort are the best examples of these.

Harry and Draco can be a perfectly fine pairing in my opinion, but it requires pretty heavy personality/personal history changes to these characters which may not be done well or at all. When this happens, the readers will likely be taken out of the story and don't enjoy the fic. I've also heard that this ship come with a lot of other issues in terms of glorifying certain bad behaviors and such, but I really don't know because I don't read much slash, if any.

Harry/Voldemort/Snape is different because whatever relationship happens, assuming major Au's aren't happening to say age Snape down and stop him from being a teacher, the relationship is toxic/abusive. Harry is Snape's student so that's disgusting and in many/most people's opinion, a form of statutory rape. It may depend on when the relationship occurs and Harry's age, but so long as Harry is his student, there is a massive power imbalance. I don't think I even need to get into the Voldemort stuff. None of this means that fics can't be made with these pairings of that they can't be good, but I think the author either needs to handle these pairings with the gravity and seriousness that they come with, or do something to get rid of that stuff in the first place. If neither of these occur, the stories run a large risk of glorifying a lot of very bad stuff and turning many people away. As well, if they are done badly they can take the reader out of the story or even do the same thing as if they weren't there in the first place.

This means many people may not read slash because many of the common pairings are inherently hard pairings to write and deal which has resulted in many bad fics with said pairings.

I'm summary, I agree that people should stop trying to criticize slash fics as non-canon because that goes against what fanfic is, but I don't think that most people who don't read slash are doing/thinking anything wrong, especially considering the issues that can often occur with slash not even resulting from said slash, like the toxic pairings. That's my two cents anyway.

** Some people don't like to read slash fics... I'm ok with that. Just because they do not like to read slash fics does not make them homophobic. There are gay people out there what will only read slash fics, and I'm ok with that as well. It doesn't mean they are heterophobic. A lot of straight people (not all, but a lot) just prefer to read non-slash. There is nothing wrong about that. Myself, I'm a gay person that also tends to read stories that are not slash (with some exceptions), mainly because I find that these stories tend to make the story plot secondary to the romance. I actually prefer gen stories, where no romance is indicated, so the characters in the story can be either straight, gay, bi etc (whatever the reader wants them to be). However their sexuality is not mentioned in the story, as it has no bearing on the story itself.

** To be honest my problem with slash is not they were in straight in canon. It's more "He's a racist, terrorist wanna-be bully in canon" or "he's an abusive teacher who's old enough to be his dad" or my personal favourite "he's a deranged terrorist who killed his parents and is old enough to be his grandfather". Though to be fair I have the same problem with pairings like Harry/ Bellatrix and Hermione/ Snape and those are technically straight.

I'm just not a fan of pairing the good guys with the bad guys and even villains. And most slash seems to revolve around this idea. Sure, go ahead and make Harry gay. But why on Earth do people have to pair him with Death Eaters? Why no one ever writes Harry/ Cedric or with Seamus or Dean or Neville? Hell, even Krum. Just imagine it- Harry goes to the Quidditch World Cup and realises he has a crush on Krum and then they meet and become friends during the tournament. (You can even throw in Fleur trying to "seduce" Harry and failing miserably for fun). Maybe Krum keeps training during the tournament to keep in shape and he meets Harry in the locker room of the Quidditch pitch one day... Shit practically writes itself. But nooo, let's pair poor, innocent Harry with the fucking monster who killed his parents.

This is why people don't like slash. It's not "Eww, a boy is kissing a boy"- it's "Eww, the hero of the story is kissing the (often unredeemed or unchanged) villain".

****** Homophobes/racists have built up this image that being a bigot is equivalent to being some asshole redneck Nazi and they don't see themselves as such an asshole so when someone calls them out on things they said that are problematic they automatically assume you're calling them said stereotype.

Thing is racism/homophobia/sexism can be done by someone unknowingly. You could grab your purse when you see a black person, change the channel when you see a gay couple on screen or go to ask a male employee over a female one bc you think they would know more. Each of these examples are very common examples of "socially acceptable" bigotry and if you call someone out on it they'll get so offended over the thought of being compared to a their idea of what a bigot looks like that they'll come up with 100 reasons why what they did wasn't bigotry. "He looked shady, it wasn't because he was black that I grabbed my purse". "I don't mind gay couples but I don't want to watch a show if it has them in it" "the male worker just looked like he knew more".

Not once in this thread have I said you have to read slash fics to prove you're not a homophobe. What I have said is that

1. Slash isn't exclusively written by woman for fetishization and that we queers enjoy reading about people like us.

2. Queer representation is hard to find so in fanfiction we "change" characters sexualities so we can pair up characters we like, see how their sexualities can influence the story or read about someone who is queer in the wizarding world.

3. Not all slash is smut; it's perfectly fine if you don't like reading about 2 dudes boning but if you take issue in slash having any part of a fic, even if you like every other aspect of said fic then you may have to ask yourself why it makes you so uncomfortable.

4. Fanfiction is exactly that, fan fiction. If people want to write about how Harry is exploring his sexuality past war or how Cedric might be bi it's well within a fans right to write said story without being brigaded by people saying "but he's straight you can't write that!". Funny how no one says the same about the 100's of harem fics that have 8 girls willing to share Harry and sometimes date each other as well.

** So, I'm not really into slash. For me, reading a romance (especially with smut) is to a certain degree about feeling like you're falling in love along with the character or being seduced along with the character, and because I'm heterosexual that works best for me with heterosexual pairings.

But I've read and enjoyed well written slash, and have even written some Wolfstar on occasion just because convincingly writing an IC slash ship is as fascinating as writing a get ship that needs to bend characters OOC to work (eg Dramione). Seeing the characters' motivations and IC development to a point where they fall for someone they would never fall for in canon is just a great reading experience.

However, I do get why at a basic level you might not be into slash because you're straight, which I to an extent feel myself, but if you can't appreciate a well written fic because it's slash, has a non-canonical pairing, is heavily AU etc then I feel like you're missing the point of fanfiction to be honest.

It's very interesting reading about other people's head canons and comparing to my own.

I don't see anything wrong with considering the various possibilities of a character.

For me, I draw the line at people contending that a particular far-fetched ship ‚Äúcould totally be canon.‚Äù I prefer when people openly say that their ship/ head canon is AU but based on the original character portrayal. For example, I like reading Dramione and Drarry but don't consider them 100% realistic. Whereas with a ship like Neville/Luna, I find the pairing canonically plausible.

*** Ok so I see your points but hold up.

1. That's not what this post is saying at all. Prefering canon is cool, whatever preferences you have for pairings is fine. The issue is when people comment on slash fics or LGBT works in general that "nope this fic doesn't make sense BC I can't imagine that any of these characters could possibly be anything but straight". That's where the close mindedness comes in. You can enjoy whatever canon pairings you like but when you purposely read a slash fic and your only point of contention is that it doesn't work BC you can't imagine the characters being straight and that's why you dislike the fic I would call you homophobic.

I repeat, if you dislike a fic exclusively because the characters are not straight and that's the only reason why you go to flame the author in the reviews then your probably at least a bit homophobic. IDC what your sexual orientation is, going into a well written adventure fic which happens to be slash and dropping it because one of the characters is written as not straight is just weird. It's different if the fic has explicit smut but if you can't handle the thought of a character being attracted to someone of the same gender when it's not the central focus of the fic then you probably hold some homophobic thoughts.

1. Saying that calling someone a racist is the same as having someone being racist towards you is just...so wrong. Are you genuinely equating systemic racism and homophobia as being the same as someone accusing you of being racist or homophobic?

Ah yes this black person who has faced all sorts of obstacles in their life based solely on the colour of their skin; where they are racially profiled and discriminated against on a daily basis is the same level of prejudice as someone who is being called out for being racist.

You claim of if you don't support xx and xx you are xx is completely wrong. If someone came up to me and said [[/u/griffithdidwrong][u/griffithdidwrong]] I don't support women rights I would, rightly, call them a misogynistic asshole.

Your use of a cannonically gay character becoming straight is false equivalence at its finest. When has this hypothetical situation ever occured? If it has it's probably matched by 100 cases of people complaining that "harry isn't gay fuck off with this pairing". Again compare this with real life, yes you can be racist towards a white person but for every time that someone is racist towards a white person there are at least 100 more cases of a black person being racially profiled, discriminated against or being treated differently. Both things happen, both are bad but one happens far more commonly than the other. Saying both are equally as bad is ignoring all the context and placing both scenarios in a vacuum.

** My sister really ships Drarry and I really don't. It's not that I think it's a bad ship, I just like harmonie or Harry with a more minor character much more. My main issue with slash fics is that (with every combo m/f, m/m, w/w) it ends up being about who you can slap together or what trope you like versus who actually has chemistry. For example, shipping Hermione with Pansy just feels lazy. It feels like saying ‚Äúbecause enemies to lovers works with Harry and Draco, how about we ship Hermione with one of the girls who tormented her in school?‚Äù Enemies to lovers is ok with Draco and Harry because they were simply rivals. Pansy and Draco both very explicitly bullied Hermione, calling her a ‚Äòmudblood' multiple times, and often making fun of her. I think it also depends on what character you are changing the sexuality of. Some of the characters would probably change drastically based on their experience with their sexuality, and with other people's responses, while others would probably stay the exact same. It all comes down to opinion, writing, and characterization.

*** This opinion is fine but doesn't answer the question at all. All it does is reframe the narrative from "why can't straight people stop coming into slash fics and complaining that it's unrealistic for harry to be gay, bi or pan when they can easily read harry/Bellatrix, harry/Tonks, etc" to "actually the reason why slash fics don't make sense is BC we never see harry or other characters being gay therefore it won't make sense unless we have a fic that's set earlier."

That's a big shift in narrative tbh. Also the book is almost exclusively from Harry's perspective so how have we "been in the heads" of other characters? We've had no insight into other character's heads, how do we know Cedric is exclusively straight? So he dated one girl in canon, doesn't mean he's not bi. Hell harry could easily be written as bi straight after seventh year. You don't need to write years of backstory, as a bisexual dude who only realised I was bisexual at age 19 and who thought he was straight for those first 19 years it's very easy to not have these "gay traits and characteristics" that you seem to think we're all born with and have from a young age.

Most of the cast doesn't need background changes to have them be LGBT, you can just write them from any point as being so. Being closeted is an extremely common thing, I personally dislike Draco but you could very easily write him as a closeted gay man who didn't display any overt signs BC he's meant to marry a good pureblood woman and have an heir.

The reason why so many LGBT people write canon characters as LGBT even if, to the audience's knowledge, they are depicted as straight is BC we have no other options. Who is openly gay in Harry potter? Who's openly pan or trans or bi? No-one. So what do LGBT writers do when they want to write a story about an LGBT wizard/witch in the Harry Potter universe? They write characters as LGBT or make OCs. Thing is not many people read OC characters and it's harder to write a compelling character than to edit a canon one.

No, they don't. The whole point of fanfiction is exploring alternate possible stories within a familiar setting. Every fanfic involves divergence from canon. Character X being gay rather than straight is just one such divergence readers have to accept as a basic premise of the story being told. If that's a premise someone's not interested in reading about, fine, but authors don't need to jump through hoops to justify it.

Hell, it's like halfway through the timeline of the original series before characters start reaching an age where their sexualities even start really becoming relevant. You can also either just assume the characters' experiences prior to the beginning of the fic were slightly different (e.g. experienced attraction to different people, or no one) or that they were unaware of or in denial of their actual sexuality. Lots of non-straight people have gone through a phase where they either consciously or unconsciously tried to make themselves fit into what society considers "normal".

** I can't help but think that calling people homophobic for saying characters are straight is an overreaction. I generally don't read a lot of slash(though admittedly I greatly enjoyed the /Death Note/ slash fic, /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7217431/1/Kira-Sweetheart][Kira, Sweetheart]]/), but "They're straight." in canon just tends to be an automatic response on my part. On the other side of the equation, I find it really /really/ weird when they give Albus Dumbledore a heterosexual relationship, as my automatic response there is, "He's gay!"

And now I'm just imagining a fanfic with a very thin 4th wall, with the "Author/narrator" really really wanting a Drarry fic, but neither Harry nor Draco are having /any/ of it, and just sort of giggling.

*** Nah. It's more like you came to this post with a clear premise that the characters are gay and you must imagine that for a moment to engage with the discussion. The homophobia comes in not even attempting that much before yelling THEY'RE STRAIGHT.

I admit it's poorly worded though.

When I was looking for fics that had Harry as an animagus, I came across a criminally under-tagged fic that was this pairing. I got as far as 'Harry messed up his animagus transformation and is now stuck as a half man/half horse living near the Forbidden Forest, until one day he meets up with Firenze...' before I realized where it was going. I noped right out of there.

** One of your paragraphs said something along the lines of "you should have a frank conversation with yourself why you don't like slash/give a blanket to all those thing"

Ok, I'll be frank with you. I like girls. I don't like guys. I like reading about het romance because I like het romance. I don't like reading about slash romance, because frankly, I'm not comfortable reading about how guys Dom other guys, or sub for that matter, which appears to be 80 percent of all slash fics I've encountered.

On the other side, you should have a frank conversation why do YOU like/dont dislike slash.

*** Yes that is. That's also NOT only what slash is.

Slash can be Harry kissing Ron. Slash can be Harry making heart-eyes at Cedric. Slash can be Sirius gently kissing Remus's knuckles at the end of their date. There's a great diversity to what slash can be.

The fact that pedophilia was the first thing that came to your mind when talked about slash says a lot about you and what you think about gay people.

** I have had characters before where I didn't particularly care to read them in ships of some orientation because my read/take on the character was always pretty strongly that they were of a different orientation. But that just comes down to personal preference: saying, ‚ÄúI prefer Pansy Parkinson in lesbian ships, whenever I read her straight it just feels wrong,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEven a really well written/characterized fic where Neville is gay wouldn't work for me, he just comes off as straight in my view,‚Äù is acceptable. But telling other people what they should and should not ship has never made sense to me, for any reason.

** Unpopular opinion but people that feitshize slash are weird and tend to have issues in regards to con/non-con and of age relationships. I have found the most egregious things in Slash stories that have disgusted me for a long time, it's also not something most people care to read if they're not into romance regardless.

Brow-beating someone who doesn't like it and is just giving their opinion, is almost the same as them giving their unwanted opinion. If you can't have a discussion like a normal person, and instead resort to childish tactics such as suppression because you can't defend why the pairing would be realistic in any setting then that's on you.

The reason people like fanfiction is because it is just close enough with a clear divergence. Having a completely OOC Harry and OOC Draco and OOC Dumbledore doesn't make it an interesting read, it's practically an original trashy romance novel with all the same tropes over and over again. If you don't want to write Harry Potter and instead want to write two guys going at it, go for it, but this is Harry Potter, and fanfiction is open for the public to read and is thus available for public criticism.

Don't like it? Don't post it on FFN.

** People of all identities need to respect that other people have different (adult, consensual)* ships. Both homophobia and hyper-LQBTQ-activism are rude, unwelcoming, and unwanted in decent society. Not wanting to spend your free time reading about the exploits of certain ships is fair. Being unaccepting of OTHERS liking fanon OR canon pairings is just nasty. Equally when a fandoms gaydar goes off with the two (canon straight) leads and only femslash is accepted in the fandom and het writers get bullied away, as when a fandom is gatekeeping two (canon straight) characters and bullying the slash writers away. Unacceptable.

*I will not say people need to accept stuff like Severus/Hermione or Minerva/Hermione or Narccissa/Harry. Time travel and aging mean that it can be done in a non-creepy way, and sometimes the creepy is messed up and yet part of the premise of the story (I'm looking at you, linkffn(a slant told tale) ) in a way that doesn't romanticise it, but sometimes it's also majorly problematic.
