There was a unique Harry Potter reads the books fanfiction series That I'm trying to find.

This series was set before hogwarts, and several Harry Potter characters find themselves locked in a strange house with books details Harries life and future adventures. I can remember Hermone Granger, Harry Potter, and two other characters from the books were all in the house. They were unable to leave until all 7 books have been read.

And like I said and will repeat, this starts when the children were before going to hogwarts for the first time.

#+begin_quote
  "The title The Boy Who Lived dominated the chapter, but this meant nothing to anyone, so their eyes skipped down to just below that which was under the date 1981. Six years from now." A reading the book style fic, except much more loosely based around the characters interactions through varied locations. No actual book used, Marauders fifth year, Wolfstar and other details inside.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** It wasn't A Dramatic Reading, because that was set in year 5, the story I remember was before year 1. or at least a few months before or after Harry got the letter. and it only had only a few people reading the books.

A Dramatic Reading had the whole school reading the books so to speak.
