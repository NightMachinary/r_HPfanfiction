So, I picked up 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' recently and wouldn't you know it, it turns out Croft Manor is in Surrey! Anyway, my brain did as a brain does and now I want to read a fic featuring both Harry Potter and Lara Croft. Preferably one about a tough, gunslinging archeologist that deals with paranormal bullshit and her snarky sidekick that /is/ paranormal bullshit. Failing that, I'd appreciate any that you've come across and enjoyed in the past.


** linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5) is all about that.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
