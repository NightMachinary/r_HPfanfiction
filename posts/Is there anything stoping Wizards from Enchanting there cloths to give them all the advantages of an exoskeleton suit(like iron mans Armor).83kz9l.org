Like could an Auror be wearing a set of robes that gives them all the protections(and other advantages) as the iron mans hulkbuster Armor?


** Nothing, it's been done. The twins enchanted hats and such with Shield Charms. The effects just don't last long according to Hermione, like most enchanted objects.

** Rowling's universe wasnt designed to be held up to scrutiny. Saying that enchanted objects don't last forever is a cheap copout because there are enchanting objects that you buy from a store. Like for example there's the magical creatures book hagrid gives Harry. We know it at least stays in enchanted for a month since it's still vicious when hagrid has to show everyone how to tame it.

It's obviously not the most satisfying answer but just accept that JK Rowling is shit at creating a realistic magic system.

Imo enchantments and transfiguration should last for ever or you could just do fuck up things by transfiguring something and then waiting for it to untransfigur. You could take down a plane by transfiguring a boulder into a penny and then just putting it into a bag that's going on the plane.

*** OTOH, wizards routinely live well into their 200s so maybe they just have a different definition of "too short to be practical".

**** Depends on if you can "recharge" the item or if you have to re-enchant it and if that takes long and can't be done by the average wizard...I mean the Sorting Hat is an enchanted item and it lasted for CENTURIES, so yeah it probably really depends on the enchanter in question ;)

** It's fiction, and in this case, fan fiction. the most unrealistic part will always be what we change about the characters emotional dynamics because that was more JKR's point than creating, as ItsSpicee so eloquently puts it, "a realistic magic system". If you have a cool thought, write it.

**** I'd need to re-read it to be sure, but Hermione is open with her parents to begin with, and transfers to Beauxbatons by some point in her third year. It definitely follows the canon timeline but I don't remember how closely.

I wouldn't mind re-reading it though, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

** Imagination! :) Hermione did mention in Goblet of Fire specifically that Harry could have used magic to "give himself extra powers." :) So it is canon possible!!!

** Is there anything stopping you from making an Iron Man suit in real life? It would be a daunting project, and you probably couldn't make something quite the same, but you could get something that satisfies a limited version of the same requirements. It would just take years of study and then years of work. Plus a lot of money.

You could apply the same principle to magic, if it helped your story.

** I don't think so, hell, with runes and magic etc. they could probably even make something like an armor of liquid metal (that encases the whole body - hell, this might work against the killing curse, as it can't touch the body this way!) that hardens only if something impacts it etc.
