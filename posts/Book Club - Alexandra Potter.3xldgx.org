  Alexandra Potter. The first year is complete but I'm not happy with the story. I started a rewrite, which can be found in DLP's WBA, but mid-way through the rewrite I realised it was a half-measure so am now rewriting the rewrite. It's so significant as to almost be a completely different story. Changes include: reducing AU elements, structuring and pacing the story properly with a proper plotline instead of just drama, lightening the tone with more friendship and Hogwarts stuff and less plotting and bullying, making Alex and the other kids more likeable, spreading out the Daphne plot over several years. A strong magic focus will remain, but I will attempt to show magic in use instead of conveying it through textbook passages.
#+end_quote

You can kinda deduce what I think of the fic from that segment of my profile.

There are two criticisms of the fic I still find annoying though:

1. The depiction of children as mean and vulgar. If anything I understated it. I can understand this making people not want to read (due to lack of sympathy for the characters) but I fundamentally disagree with criticism calling it unrealistic.

2. The amount of discussion of magic. If you go through the fic as a whole, the quantity of magic discussion isn't all that great as a proportion of the total fic (though, admittedly, it is front-loaded). A far better criticism is the format of the magic sections. The textbook stuff was an experiment in authenticity but it doesn't work as a story element.

** Never looked at book club before, but assume there isn't any sort of criteria (I read it a while ago).

I for one liked it. I remember liking some of the world building and characterization of Alexandra and of Dumbledore. Hermione was no problem and felt realistic given the other changes from what I recall. It was heavy on spell theory but then that interests me, if well thought out. Anyway I remember wanting more, so it did something right.

  What did y'all think of Alexandra Potter?
#+end_quote

Not much.

It's an empty story that mostly exists to serve as a forum for the author's views on magic, makes an attempt to lessen the menacing nature of the canon pureblood ideology, and tests the reader's patience with depictions of the average level of carnal knowledge possessed by adolescents. If I wanted to suffer through such blatant author tract, I'd read HPMoR.

Normally, I'd give the author a pass on /all/ of this as it's an AU and he/she can do whatever they want, but I found the characters to be abhorrent. But this is Harry Potter fanfiction and there are a million different tastes. Even if I didn't like it, I'm confident that others will find it enjoyable.

That being said, I feel the need to say a word about the characterisations. The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable throughout the story.

I judge characters on three criteria:

1. Do their motivations adequately inform the reader of their likely course of action when presented with a choice? Does the character exhibit sufficient agency to act on their decision?

2. Do these choices gel with their motivations? With their stated or inferred values system?

3. Do the consequences of those choices make sense within the larger narrative and does the character receive sufficient praise/hostility as a result from others?

The author has done an excellent job with the first two, but the extremely uneven fallout from the protagonist's poor decisions strains credulity. As best I can tell, this is a weak attempt to engender the reader's sympathy/antipathy towards the protagonist.

I didn't recognise Hermione as bearing any resemblance to her canon counterpart and feel that her role would best be served by an original character. Gone is the girl who stopped showing off after the first Halloween, complimented Harry at the end of PS, and generally made life /easier/ for our favourite Half Blood. Instead we're left with a wench with extreme emotional fragility. She seems to only exist to be an ineffectual foil to the protagonist's academic standing. In the final chapter, the two declare a 'truce,' which is somehow supposed to excuse the bad behaviour of both the protagonist and Hermione-in-name-only through several earlier chapters.

The most obvious rebuttal to this is the cynic's claim that people aren't always saints and it's unrealistic for a protagonist to behave as selflessly as the canon Harry and Hermione do. That's certainly true, but Harry's inherent goodness and charm and Hermione's bravery and empathy are what draws readers to his story. These characters have none of those qualities and the story suffers for it.

This is my biggest beef with the story. I can sit through (or rather, skim through) ridiculously long descriptions of someone's idea of what magic is and/or how magic should behave, but if I hate the main character what the fuck is the point of me reading about them? I started - and stopped - reading AP about four times before I finally finished what was posted because of this. I'm sorry, but if I can't find one redeeming quality in a character what is the point in me reading it? It's the same problem I have with the Alexandra Quick series, actually - both Alexandra's are just AWFUL to the point where I felt like I was watching Seinfeld and it was just nothing but George Costanza being a moronic dickhead for hours and hours and hours and I just keep cringing and hoping at some point, Kramer will show up and provide some levity and let me stop being painfully embarrassed on behalf of the character.

How is that different than canon in regards to DADA? Harry outscored Hermione on his DADA O.W.L. and that didn't upset her. Even as far back as third year, he was able to complete Lupin's obstacle course final exam while Hermione - run ragged by the Time Turner - had to stop because she thought the boggart/McGonagall was real. Again, no mention of Hermione being angry because Harry was more competent than her in a subject. We also have Hermione stating at the end of PS that she values "friendship and bravery" far more than "books and cleverness." JKR cheated her own narrative in HBP by suddenly deciding that Hermione would get upset over Harry's successes with Snape's potions book.

I'd be absolutely amazed to learn that the Hermione from PS to OOtP never pestered any of the older students for old notes, studying tips, and even recollections about potential exam questions. For her to get upset at Harry for using another student's notes feels hypocritical. The entire potions incident feels like yet another hastily added source of angst reminiscent of the Firebolt in PA and Ron's jealousy in GoF. I'd much rather have had an equivalent amount of exposition on N.E.W.T. preparation, possible magical career paths, intense cramming on ways to defeat Voldemort, or a hundred other scenarios rather than 'two of the main characters are fighting a cold war because reasons.'

******* See, this is where I think she would definitely not do this. To someone like hermione, who ALWAYS seems to have the answer to everything (if she doesnt she looks it up), why would she just want answers; wouldn't she rather have all the information?

kinda rant: there are two types of smart people in this regard: those that try and spend an hour cheating on an assignment (to get it done as soon as possible) or those that take the extra time to do the material, the extended reading, and some extra just to make sure they got everything covered. Hermione comes off as the second. I feel as though Hermione is passionate about eizardry and it wouldnt make sense for her to be obsessive over what might be on the test but rather filling her own curiosity of magic. Maybe thats just me bleeding through.\\
I agree with the ron point and worldbuilding.

Sure, and this facet of her character causes Hermione's actions in HBP make even less sense. The same girl who risked a basilisk-inhabited castle to check on a hunch blindly decided on the identity of the eponymous Half Blood Prince, only deciding to discover the truth much later. In my opinion, it's another case of JKR cheating her own narrative.

It's certainly not the first time she's sacrificed consistency in her characters' personality traits in favour of holding back a secret until the final confrontation. The Firebolt incident in PoA was crafted to drive a wedge between Hermione and Harry/Ron so that her knowledge of Lupin's lycanthropy wouldn't be revealed until the scene in the Shrieking Shack. Ron's jealousy in GoF was likely made to delay knowledge of the dragons, thereby giving Harry less time to devise a strategy (Ron eventually did tell Harry, but I'd be willing to bet that Charlie told his brother about the nature of the First Task). Obviously things worked out alright with WereLupin and the Dragon, but in the process JKR confused angst with character development.

******* While I do agree that the plot with the book was ... less than well done, I think Hermione actually wouldn't pester the older students for notes.

I mean, isn't it a rather important point of her starting characterisation, that she was devouring all the books she could find for knowledge which either was caused by or did cause her to be so distanced from her peers that she didn't even try to to associate with them anymore? And after her rescue from the troll she might have, only with the house thing and with gryffindors being mostly less than stellar academically (as far as we know, the only ones serious enough to actually be a reliable source of information probably are all serious enough not to make notes in the books), she still had to rely on books.

That being said, the plot with the book might have been less annoying as far as Hermione's part in it went had we actually ever gotten any signs of her thinking that relying on information nor originally in books was cheating and that this, by default, made it very bad because cheating was “Very Bad™”; but we didn't, for all the times when a certain other character pretty much copied another character's notes and Hermione didn't really care outside of just inserting an idle comment about how they probably shouldn't be doing that. Not to mention that it happening after the events of the fifth book, where she pretty much challenged an authority figure because of a book (and the whole course too) sucking ... yeah, not the best idea.

That's quite a leap. Since the series is almost exclusively told through Harry's POV, we don't know enough about her early characterization to make that call. We know that she loves learning, is highly motivated by praise, and that she doesn't make a very good impression on Harry through her brash display of knowledge about his past on the train and her seeming omniscience in the first Potions class. Anything beyond that is speculation, but I can see where you're coming from.

At the very first Welcoming Feast, Hermione wasted no time in talking with Percy Weasley about Transfiguration. He was describing the nature of their initial lessons but our knowledge of that conversation was abruptly ended because Harry was tired from overeating. Sounds to me like she was making early inroads with another student who valued education. To say that she relied on books alone isn't accurate.

Yes, her blind faith in the authority of the book's original author seems quite strange. Despite being so highly motivated by praise, she has a rather long history of flouting authority. She lit a professor's robes on fire because she thought they /might/ be harming her friend.

Hmm, yes, that's true. On the other hand, though, I count Percy as one of those who are serious and could help her with it but also too serious to make notes on margins in books rather than take what the books say as some sort of holy truth. So not relying on books only but still doing it ... kind of.

I mean, yeah, I did phrase it poorly. What I meant to say was that I think that though Hermione wouldn't shy away from getting knowledge from other people (in addition to books) when she can, limited opportunities or not, I think with most people she would take what the book says above what they would, and with the few people who are serious enough for her to take them as bigger authorities with the subject than the books those people are way too likely to be people like Percy and her who are also the same; thus, any knowledge gained would most likely just be book knowledge but gained without reading the book. Heck, her whole thing with Lockhart was that books said stuff and thus books knew better than people.

Though, of course, I might be taking it wrong, and regardless of whether I do or not it's clear that she is becoming more rebellious with age---as you mentioned---so the sixth book's thing is inexcusable in that regard. Madame Rowling would have been better off playing a repeat of what Hermione did with the Firebolt there, with Hermione being conflicted but thinking that the situation might be dangerous and swinging between her rebelliousness (from what happened the previous year) and her faith in authority (because the book in the second year was bad and all the books in Sirius's library were so maybe that one, too, is dangerous), and with the Prince's spell being something that she'd mark for later study so as to know what it does and repeat in her mind so as not for forget and then use on Malfoy by accident rather than with Harry doing it “just because”, and with her getting angry not at Harry but at herself because she could take from the book just as Harry does but simply does not allow herself to and with every one of Harry's successes coming from the book it reminds her that she too could have but did not.

Good point, but there is some additional subtext. We know that even before the first lesson, Hermione had already outlined her DADA schedule in little hearts, so that points to a more physical crush to me. He's described as being quite handsome in the books. Even Mrs. Weasley fusses with her hair and acts a bit strangely before the family visits him in Flourish & Blotts. Also, during that first DADA class Lockhart praises Hermione extensively for her in-depth knowledge of his personal preferences and biographical minutiae. Even though Harry and Ron can tell the professor is a fraud, Hermione has just had the wizard she fancies deliver one of her primary motivators - praise. I think that played a larger role in her vitriolic defence of the fop than the fact that he was an author. But you're certainly correct that this was an important contributing factor.
