I've been looking ages. Bare with me: Prologue is Harry being sent to the past (or alt reality) where somehow he winds up in forbidden forest. I remember Harry building a fortress or something in the forest and he rules this area and all the creatures come to him eventually for an alliance... Most notably the centaur and goblins and I think werewolves? Somehow Severus gets involved and I know The Order and Dumbledore get involved. In the end Harry rules over the forest and is concerned over his authority at one point because he doesn't want it to get to his head. I do remember it's complete, it was lengthy, and I'm 99% sure it was Snarry. Harry makes a home in the forbidden forest. He builds a settlement I think in the same area where it's warded... Sry if it's vague, I remember mostly that it was an awesome read. Thank you in advance if you can help me! Hugs!!
