I can only remember enjoying it at the time and that it ends like that. If I remember right, Harry was like way more popular at the party than Dumbledore was, and he managed to make the host really like him despite the host not liking Dumbledore. Some random man Harry talked to offered him the ninja trainer, not describing her but instead saying Harry would be doing him a favor taking the trainer off his hands, and the shiekh gave him the body guard/slave girl person so as to not be shown up by anothers gift at his own party.

Does this ring a bell for anyone else?

*** Any chance you could link it? I read that thing a long time ago, so I have no hope of finding it without reading all of it again.

***** I thought it was Magicks of the Arcane, because that story would have a lot of the set-up necessary for it, but I was sad to find that not be the case.
