Instead of Ron or Hermione or Neville? It seems like if you don't get Ron you get Neville which I don't like because he's one of my least favorite characters. I've never read a fic with Harry being in Gryffindor and friends with Dean or Seamus. They're the most background characters ever. Even Theo Nott and Terry Boot get more love and they don't even have dialogue in the books!

Are there any non slash fics like this?


** Interested too, in a lot of fics i read Harry tries to get to know them better but Dean and Seamus are best friends and gay...

**** No, it's fanon but the actors like the theory and did nothing to disprove it by dancing together in the goblet of fire set.

***** Oh well that's fair. But I mean Harry and Ron are best friends and fanfics have them hate each other. It's just crazy to me that I haven't read harry befriending either of them. You can do a lot with Dean too since he knows how to draw.

*** Nothing wrong with Dean and Seamus being in a relationship, it's plausible. I like when Dean temporarily dates Luna but they both know it's not a forever thing, Dean works on magical portraits and Luna as a magizoologist. I can also see Seamus as a horrible flirt but as much as he flirts often and loudly, he prefers to be single because relationships are complicated and he just wants to enjoy the little things.
