Hey, for the first time, I posted one of my fanfics on ffn, and, I lay my humble request for feedback and criticism to the [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] community.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574493/1/Storming-Montague-Lodge]])

Any feedback would be welcome.


** Not bad! I quite liked it. There were a few minor writing errors, namely "Two death eaters screamed as they *buren't* to death" and "*it's* feathers dropped off, *it's* body becoming full of maggots." I enjoyed the story though and I hope you write more chapters/a sequel!

** I cannot give you much help in term of text (I am not much into this kind of stories), but concerning the grammar, I have found [[https://app.grammarly.com/]] and it works surprisingly well for us, not English natives.
