Is it too much to ask for a story where Harry uses kindness and acceptance to make the world a better place? A supernatural level of cinnamonrollness. Sort of like Dear Order, where everyone comes together because of common goals.


** It's pretty likely that you've read it because it only gets recommended on here /constantly/, but Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay has the absolute most cinnamon-roll-esque Harry I've ever seen in a fanfic.

Literally the closest he gets to getting angry is internally grumbling about Dolores Umbridge and not really /doing/ anything about it because she's pretty harmless in the long run (at least in this story). Most of Harry's problems are solved just by him being nice to people (him being a dragon, and thus immune to pretty much everything, helps). linkffn(13230340)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
