prior to the advancement made by the muggle world in the 20th century the magical world was almost completely Superior to the muggle world?

The reason I find this an interesting topic is that because of how long wizard live, there was probably a lot of magicals that remember when Muggles cites used to stink of horseshit. After all Albus Dumbeldore was born in 1881 so he would have been in about his third year during The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894. and Dumbledore is not even close to the oldest wizard we see in the books that being Armando Dippet who we see in Tom Riddles memory when he asked to stay at Hogwarts over the summer who lived to age 355.

** We know far too little about the magical world and the development of the quality of life to make any conclusions. We do not know when cleaning or cooking spells were developed, not how the life of a wizard or witch looked like in the 19th century. Early brooms, for example, were not exactly the pinnacle of speed either.

** Personally, I find your argument compelling and your example hilarious :')

Have you read Artemis Fowl? I've always had in the back of my mind parallels between the "Mudbloods" of HP and the "Mud Men" of AF, which follows a similar argument to the one you laid out.

*** I knew I wasn't the only one who made that connection!

Now, a meeting between a blood purist and one of the Recon faeries? I'd pay to see that.

** Uhhhh... I'm pretty sure you could've used ANY other example from 1890 to prove magical superiority. But you decided to use the great horse manure crisis...

*** The only reason I pick that one as an example was because it would be the only one that I know about that that the magical world would have been reminded of every year when going there Kings cross station to get to the Hogwarts Express.

Its also one that would make the muggles took Particularly bad to the Magical world

Edit: what would you have used as an example?

I also find the Idea of some pure-blood Aperating to kings cross only to realise they have landed in horseshit quiet funny

**** Okay, so by the end of the 20th century, muggles have been to the moon, they've created instant communication without floo powder, they created the internet, something to which the magical world has no counterpart, and they're constantly creating new and more advanced weapons that outstrip anything the wizarding world has.

***** The Wizarding World held a higher standard of living until the Industrial Revolution, which only reached the Wizarding World through osmosis, and the Wizardign World fell behind.

***** Muggles have been to the moon: While many will argue against it, it doesn't mean that the quality of life of the muggle is better. Wizard have instant communication too (Sirius' mirror). Finally, I don't think that muggles has any advanced weapons that could outstrip wizards. Muggles have the nuclear weapon, wizards have Fiendfyre. And it would be stupid for muggle to use the nuclear weapon because they would also kill other muggle.

The only "benefit" muggle have is internet but I'd choose magic over internet everyday.
