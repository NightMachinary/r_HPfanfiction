Hello everyone,\\
I'm desperately searching for some fanfictions in which Sirius has serious mental health issues after escaping Azkaban. I think I only read one fic that depicted Sirius's struggle so well and I really need more well-written third dimensional Sirius.\\
Please recommend some good fics.

Thanks!


** linkffn(13052940) goes into Sirius state of mind a bit. It's AU, where Remus travels back in time, and Sirius gets free after PoA.\\
I'd love to read the fic you mentioned, so please leave a link.

*** Thank you! I've seen this fic around but I never got around to actually read it! I don't mind that it's an AU and I love, /love/ Remus!\\
I think it in Innocent or one of the sequels! If I remember correctly Sirius escapes Azkaban when Harry was 8 and took him with him to live at Grimmauld.\\
Let me know If I was wrong though, I might be confusing myself with another ficlinkffn(Innocent by MaraudeLover7)

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.

** Sorry I don't have any recommendations but I would love to know which one you read! Sometimes its really hard finding fics that seems emotionally realistic with everything the characters have gone through.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
