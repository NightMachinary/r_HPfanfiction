:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all,

It was a fairly old fic, and from what I remember it starts on the Hogwarts Express in their last year and follows a number of characters including the Marauders, Lily, Marlene MacKinnon, etc. The students unload at Hogwarts and slowly make their way up to the Castle, ending in a big fight between James and some Junior Death Eaters in the great hall. The rest of the fic follows from that event and features James and Lily getting closer over the course of the year. To be honest the part I remember most is the description of the fic, because it says a bunch of "She was X, he was Y. She was A, he was B." in lieu of a description.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
