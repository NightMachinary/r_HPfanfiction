In a lot of stories, Magic basically boils down to "Swish and flick and SCREAM THE INCANTATION!". This can, at times, be less engaging and magical-feeling than /magic/ could be. I was hoping we could make a thread of advice for newer writers to look at which might help them write.

So, how do you make spellcasting more engaging to read? What advice would you give to someone writing a story on how to make their magic feel magical?

Do you add more rules to what exists? Do you make up new areas of magic? Do you go all in on describing the acts of spellcasting, or just the effects? Do you have any tips or tricks? Any good examples of bad examples you've seen? Do you have any ideas that aren't asked in my rambling list of random prompt questions? :D

Personally, I've been finding it fun to write how the effects of a spell interact with the environment and people - for some reason, I keep coming out with the idea that the Stupefy spell tastes like Strawberries as it flies past you and leaves a melted-sugar-like sticky residue on any surfaces it hits.


** I love to write about how magic connects with feelings. Imagine accidental magic being more than just summoning things etc. Imagine a sad child making it rain, or an angry child summoning an inferno of fire. Sure, you could scream a spell but it won't work as good as when you actually feel the magic. Look at the patronus charm for example. Thinking a happy thought won't work, you really have to feel it. I love the idea of magic being alive. Imagine hearing magic sing when you make it happy, or actually hearing it scream when you cast dark magic. I like the idea that children can't 'control' their magic like adults can because they still can hear it. People who are sensitive to it, or just powerful can feel/hear/see it too. Imagine Riddle's Horcrux that's being destroyed not only screaming because of the soul, but Magic actually screaming because it was tortured. Magic is so much more than just power, it's alive, it's energy. It's life and it's death. It's everywhere and everything. Some beings have just a bit more energy than others and that is why they can use it.

I'm not sure if I described it good enough but this is part of my magic system

**** Oh Gods, you're right. It's a lot sw like so I probably should put a disclaimer that the idea is sw based or something

** You know how cell phone companies make simple smartphones for older people who don't want to learn how to use a more complicated system? Incantations are the giant buttons on the home screen of magic. Any idiot can make things happen by swishing and flicking and screaming, but someone intelligent and creative and diligent can learn to access magic through just about any set of actions, and teach it to respond in just about any way to a particular stimulus. Potion-making the most mainstream way of accessing magic that isn't as idiot-proof as swish/flick/scream, but there's also runes and divination, and nothing stops anyone from developing their own.

As a side note, this explains why dementors are necessary in Azkaban. If you're a magical prisoner and don't have your motivation and creativity artificially suppressed, it's only a matter of time until you teach yourself a new way of accessing magic using only your body, and then you can escape when no one is looking.

***** Oooooooh. I did not make that dot connect.

I was trying to make some version of "Mixed Magical Martial Arts" work, but yours makes way more sense. :D

** I have been slowly building my magic headcanon using bits of various different fics. Taure's system is a major influence, and their â€˜Victoria Potter' has given me many ideas.

Magic in my view is inherently unquantifiable. It is binary (you have it, or don't. Strength in magic is mostly will, skill and knowledge, although one can be inherently better at certain aspects than others). Magic cares not for human rules, and is sentient to an extent.

Magic is concerned less with the physical and more with the metaphysical. Muggle science has no place in a potion, the potioneer should be more concerned with the position of the moon and stars when an ingredient is collected and whether it is associated with heat or water than with its physical properties.

I could go on, but in short I see magic as a semi-sentient concept that takes great pleasure in making absolutely no logical scientific sense, and which has many influencing variables that change how it reacts to those that seek to use it. Really it's almost like Freudian psychology in that regard (making no logical scientific sense and having many influencing variables, that is).
