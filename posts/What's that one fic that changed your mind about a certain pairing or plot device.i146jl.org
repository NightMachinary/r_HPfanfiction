  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** I've always hated the whole "Voldemort doesn't care about blood purity, he's just using blood purists as his army because they're easier to manipulate" thing that crops up now and again, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) kinda turned me around on it. It helps that the fic doesn't use it to whitewash Voldemort and make him seem somehow less evil.

* edit: it took the bot ten minutes to link the fic; I don't think I've ever seen it take that long.

This has always been the thing for me. Just because he doesn't believe in blood purity (and he really doesn't, the books pretty much present this as a lazy dogwhistle that everyone agrees with) doesn't also mean he's not an evil person. A faithful exploration of Voldemort's character does show how he doesn't really care for blood purity, but it doesn't absolve him for his crimes.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
