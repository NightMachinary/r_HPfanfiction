Neville looked at the origami bird given to him and sighed. It was always the same, origami bird after origami bird, all in the same bright yellow wrapper of the gum company. Why she liked this gum, Neville would never know. But it was all he really had of his mum, so he'd keep it with the others. Suddenly, however, the wrapper begins to glow a bright white, brighter than even the white of the hospital's walls, and Neville disappeared, not noticing the tiny smile on his mum's face.

Neville awoke to a voice, a deep baritone. “Ah, good. I was hoping she'd pass it on to you, dear Neville. You will be instrumental in our research. Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Barrington Smythe III and welcome to the Absynthe Incorporated Research Facility. Now, a question. Do you want to cure your parents?”

Neville nodded so quickly it was as though his head would fall off and the man laughed kindly. “Come then. Let us begin.”


** How it feels to chew five gum:

"Crucio!"

** If I remember correctly, that sweet wrapper name is an anagram for 'Gold bribe below St mungos'

** Plot twist: It's Voldemort, recruiting Neville to his side with the promises of bringing back his parents. It starts slowly, asking Neville a few questions about Harry. "The knowledge of what happened when he was one could be used to help your parents! One unforgivable is the same as another."

Then it starts getting worse, very insidiously. "Neville, do you mind getting me some unicorn hair from the Hogwarts' unicorns?"

"Neville, can you borrow a book from Dumbledore's studies on sacrificial magic? I really think it could help your parents."

"Neville, I need some unicorn blood. Do you mind getting some from the unicorns at Hogwarts? Look, our studies are paying off. Your mother can say Neville now, look!" (It's the imperius)

At some point, Neville gets too deep and Voldemort can reveal himself with the threat of revealing Neville's crimes and indiscretions. That or actually save Neville's parents.

Neville backstabs Harry with a spell designed to strip sacrificial protections, using knowledge that he and Voldemort stole, instead of killing Nagini.
