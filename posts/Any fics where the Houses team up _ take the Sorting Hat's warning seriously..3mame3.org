I'm basically just looking for fics where the students of Hogwarts realise that the division within the school is ridiculous, and they take the Sorting Hat seriously about the Houses working together to defeat Voldemort. I'm looking for inter-house friendships, even Harry and Draco getting over their history and sorting shit out. Anything at all that shows the students banding together.


** As you can probably tell from the title, this is the main theme of linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided), but it is to beat Goblins, not Voldemort.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** I don't think I've ever come across a fic with these themes that isn't full of terrible writing and overused cliches, especially when Slytherin is involved. Also, stories of these type usually end up feeling too naive. Hopefully someone links a good one, though!

linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement) has students banding together, though. Also sci-fi!
