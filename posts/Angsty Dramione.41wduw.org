Lookin for a bit of angst in my life, prefribly Dramione at the Malfoy Manor during DH but also maybe like a forbidden love kind of thing? Thank you ðŸ’—


** Easily the most angsty Dramione I've read so far was [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544208199][Water]]. It's a Hogwarts Era fic.

Other angsty ones that I remember are:

  Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet... 7th year AR. COMPLETE SINCE 2009 XD

  Draco and Hermione can't be together. Or can they? Takes place both at Hogwarts and Post-Hogwarts. Summary is lame. M for a reason.

** If you're looking for angsty, look no further than everythursday (author). She has several fics in various settings. Fallout's the biggie, but I just read Creatures of the Wind and spent the entire day staring in to space, wondering why someone would destroy my heart like that.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

** I have one out that might be what you're looking for? It's angsty, but also a bit dark. It does take place in Malfoy Manor during DH, though so there's that. I've got the whole fic (and its sequel) planned out, so if you wanna join me for the ride...
