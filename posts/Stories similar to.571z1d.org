I've been reading Shikatanai's "Gabriel" (third time I tried and I actually managed to read it) and found myself liking the story. As weirdly as it sound I liked the relationship between Gabriel/Harry and Fae. I liked their bond, it felt like they were on the same page and Fae was older than 11. I wanna read stories similar to this, where Harry is adopted or something else. There's just something about this story, when I actually managed to read more than a few chapters, I found myself not wanting it to end. Harry didn't have a relationship with Dumbledore, he was more or less his own man. The story didn't have all the tropes that you all seem to hate (but I love). He had a relative good relationship with Neville and Hermione, and at the same time not much of a relationship with the Weasley's.

So I'm hoping for something similar.


** Oh man, there's an awesome fic somewhere on ao3 about Harry being adopted from an orphanage along with his self-described muggle 'big brother' by a couple. Said older brother is a delinquent who gives Harry a knife to carry around at Hogwarts, and after Voldemort attacks Harry the family starts trying to flee England but Dumbledore keeps obliviating them and bringing them back until Sirius breaks out and magically vanishes their tracks.

The sibling relationship was great in it but I can't find the fic, sorry. :/ Harry and his older brother were a team. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
