So I had an idea for a fic where James and Lily come back as ghosts to watch over Harry when they're killed. I imagined scenes where after tests in school, Lily is scolding James for helping Harry cheat by giving him the answers, maybe becoming friends with a muggle-born who asks him who the two people always with him are and why no one else sees them, them getting to Hogwarts and Lily AND McGonagall yelling at James for helping Harry cheat, that kind of thing. Lily yelling at James over how offering to give Snape lessons on how to wash his hair while he's in the shower isn't "trying to make amends". Maybe James recognizes Scabbers or something.

Only problem is I start writing it and it just trails off and goes meh. So I decided maybe someone else can do it better. So there you go, enjoy the free idea.

Also, absolutely no idea what to tag this as.


** I had an idea where Ron was the oldest Weasley and Hermione was also older. Ron and Hermione would be recruited by Dumbledore after graduation. Eventually their mission would be to keep an eye on Harry and ensure his safety by returning to Hogwarts as students. Guilt, betrayal, etc.

Problem was that Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and the rest of the Weasleys would essentially be manipulating Harry. It would be easy if I was bashing the characters, but I wanted them to be sympathetic and struggle with what they were doing. Played around with the idea of Death Eaters still being active from the beginning, so that Harry would warrant the extra protection.

** This is a story idea i've mused on numerous times. I used a bit of it when harry's gramps is a ghost in my story Darkness Ascendant. I like the idea of the parents, especially if he's placed at the dursleys's and lily's the one that goes prankster, making petunia's life hell with james admiring her vindictiveness. But that's where rhe issues get fuzzy. James and lily would be PISSED at dumbledoee for placing him there and pretty sure skeeter would get many, many earfuls.

*** Yeah, I have another fic I actually do plan on doing where Lily and James are a lot more poltergeist (not peeves but the traditional one) than ghost and Harry picks up on a lot of their vindictive tactics
