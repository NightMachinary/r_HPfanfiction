:END:
I'm sure I saw it recommended on this subreddit within the last month, and it was a recently updating fic!

Memorable Scenes/Points

- Harry was an unspeakable and time travelled to the DOM in the marauders era
- Got a teaching job as the DADA instructor at Hogwarts
- Dumbledore became more and more suspicious of him throughout the fic
- Harry heard a clanging/bell tolling sound whenever he was effecting Fate too much
- Snape and Regulus Black don't become Death Eaters and I think they swear themselves to Harry who promises to protect them
- Harry saves Snape from kidnap by Voldemort
- Lucius Malfoy does join the DE's but offers to become a spy
