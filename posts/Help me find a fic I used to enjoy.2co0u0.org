I read it way back when I was in high school. It was a Snape mentors Harry fic, and Draco was involved at some point. One element of Snape's backstory involved his brother that died when they were children. I also remember something about riding horses along a cliff. I think Snape used to have horses when he was little, but then something went wrong and his father got rid of all of them. Harry ends up getting Snape a descendant of his old horse for his birthday and Draco helps him.

Does that sound familiar to anyone?

** I haven't read one like that, but perhaps you'll find what you're looking for at [[http://potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]]? It's a site devoted entirely to Snape-mentors-Harry stuff. Good luck!
