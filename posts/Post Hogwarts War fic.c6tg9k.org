:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Post Hogwarts War fic where Harry is in the great Hall, and Harry's parents just walk into the great Hall, and it turns out he had a sister this whole time. I think they hid from him to protect him but I can't remember.

Does anyone remember that fic?


** I've seen many that tried this, the only one that I remember though isn't that one. I'm linking it in case you're interested anyway :)

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.
