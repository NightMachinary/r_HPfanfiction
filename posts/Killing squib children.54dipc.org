There is a discussion thread going on right now about people's muggle born theories, it made me think of a story I read a long time ago where Draco had a squib child and instead of killing the baby he placed it with muggles and felt that he was contributing to the "muggleborn problem" I don't remember the name of it. Honestly i'm interested in any fics that delve into how squibs are treated, or wizards who are looking into to the reason for muggle borns.


** linkffn(Almost a Squib) might satisfy this. Harry's interactions with Filch and Kwikspell are interesting. It's crack though.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

*** Fantastic! I would have liked them to go into the feelings of resentment over their squib relatives not being able to come to Hogwarts a bit more, but I really enjoyed it.

** Can anyone recall the fic where all the purebloods, inc the Lestranges and Malfoys have abandonned their squib children (but stay in touch) and they have all gone on to be successful? Malfoy's squib son is some kind of adventuring hero in S America IIRC.
