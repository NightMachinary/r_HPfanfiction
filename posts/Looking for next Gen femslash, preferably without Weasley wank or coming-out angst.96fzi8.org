Any f/f pairing is fine as long as it involves at least one female next-gen character (I would take Delphi/Hermione or Lily Luna/Rose/Tonks/ time-travel if such a thing exists).

I'd prefer it if there was no big, harmonious Weasley family where everything is sunshine and roses while neither Molly, Albus S. nor any Malfoy play a significant part.
