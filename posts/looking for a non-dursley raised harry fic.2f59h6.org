This one starts out like in the book but Mcgonagal takes harry to her sister/daughter's house as they are moving out of the country. Harry lives in the USA and they have like awesome american brooms, magic schools that run during the day and are modern. I read this when I was like 12 I think. So can someone help me find it?

Found it. Thank you all for the help! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall]]
