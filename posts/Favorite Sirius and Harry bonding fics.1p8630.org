I've probably read most of the "Sirius rescues Harry from Number 4" fics that have been recommended here, so those are out. But does anyone know of any other fics (preferably canon, but AU is okay too) that focus on Sirius and Harry's relationship?

The only ones I can think of are A Black Comedy and Growing Up Black, two very good AUs. But I would love to find some nice oneshots set during GoF or OotP, or a longer fic that prominently features their relationship.


** I've been following [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]] for a while now, I really like it, is definitely worth checking out if you like the Sirius rescues Harry thing.

** Nonjons [[http://http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] is a rather long and slightly silly but enourmously enjoyable fic in which Harry and Sirius enter a slightly AU world (Harry goes through the veil by accident several years after the war). They then continue to make the world unsafe for everyone who opposes them and grow ever closer (entirely platonic uncle-relationship!) while essentialy mostly having a whole lot of fun.

*** Ha, I was about to suggest this. Not sure if it's bonding in the sense that he was asking for, but it doesn't get any better than this. :D

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915151/1/Sirius-Sets-Things-Right][Sirius Sets Things Right]] by Rorschach's blot is a silly one-shot that is a bit like this.

** This fic most closely meets your requirements:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3630769/1/After-Dinner-Discussions][After Dinner Discussions]] by Aeramus. One-shot. Takes place in the middle of OotP. Over Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place, Harry finds himself unable to keep the nature of his detentions with Umbridge as secret as he would like from the adults who care about him.

But here are some others that involve Sirius/Harry bonding:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5909491/1/A-Summer-of-Contentment][A Summer of Contentment]] by Kendra James. Harry is ill and gets the chance to experience what a loving family is like when he finds himself at The Burrow recovering from a cold. Very fluffy oneshot that may be developed furthur in the future.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][Harry Potter and the Irish Choice]] by DisobedienceWriter. With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012711/1/In-the-Arms-of-Those-Who-Care][In the Arms of Those Who Care]] by Kejfe Blintz. Harry is treated to a glimpse of the love he should have been surrounded with, had circumstances been different. SBRL

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/750576/1/Never-Alone-Never-Again][Never Alone, Never Again]] by Bored Beyond Belief. Harry's holiday reaches it's lowest point. Will Harry finally be able to have the kind of love everyone else seems to take for granted? Complete

** I liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2568176/1/Innocence][Innocence]] about Sirius being cleared and adopting Harry when he was 7. It is a several book long series.
