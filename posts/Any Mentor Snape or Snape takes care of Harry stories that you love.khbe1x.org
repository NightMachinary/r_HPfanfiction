Would rather NOT have Snape is actually Harry's biological father.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be no Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune/No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash etc.

Not even adoptive? Because while I personally always liked those fics, I was never really a fan of biological father!Severus. Mostly because it tends to include a rather disturbing past with Lily. The usual premise is basically that Lily, fed up with James' shenanigans, flees to Severus, has a night of passion only to return back to James later. It paints both Lily and James in a bad light, Lily for being unfaithful and wishy-washy and James for being bad enough to prompt someone to prefer an outright Death Eater, even if the guy is a former friend.

linkffn(The Best Revenge) is a decent fic that hasn't yet been recommended. It also doesn't have Snape as father, not even adoptive, unless that changed later on (I only read around 60% of that fic).

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** Potions and Snitches is a website centred around Severus and Harry having nonsexual relationships.

I was hoping the OP would give you the go ahead to rec Snape adopts Harry. I /LOVE/ those.

As far as Snape being biological father, I read a few where Lily is pregnant before getting with James whether she knew it or not which don't paint any of them in a bad light. Imo, the cheater tropes paint Snape in a bad light too unless she lies and says she and James broke up, which just puts her in a worse light.

**** Sure, but at that point, Snape is a Death Eater. Taking advantage of a woman you have feelings for is trivial in comparision, especially since he's still a teenager (mind you, the issue is typically him being unable to say no rather than him maliciously and deliberately exploiting a vulnerable person). Not excusable, but still, he's already horrible at that point and you can't get much worse. To be clear, I don't mean to trivialize what he does. But rather, I feel that if anything is worth addressing first, it's the fact that he became a Death Eater. Only when this has been digested fully and properly resolved/redeemed (good luck with that!), it might be worthwhile to consider his side in the Severitus debacle.

I used to lurk Potions and Snitches in the past, and while the site has a great archive of platonic Snape&Harry, I found it somewhat annoying to navigate.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

The understanding between them takes time and effort. It also is one of the few fics that allows both Harry AND Snape to grow in my opinion. Snape is NOT a well adjusted human being and can't suddenly become the perfect mentor figure for Harry. Theres a lot of stumbling and realizations that happen on both sides and the writing is absolutely superb

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  "Slytherin would do well, help you on the path to greatness," the hat seems to be coaxing him, but for something that can read his mind, it sure doesn't seem to know him very well. Harry doesn't want greatness. He doesn't need his name in lights and on everyone's lips. He wants meals, hot ones, whenever he wants, with people that he likes and that like him. Friends he can have adventures with, huddle under the blankets with at night and laugh with. People who might think... think he's worth something.  In which Harry is sorted into Slytherin, and Snape deals with the fallout.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

** The Days of the Flower ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6323959/1/The-Days-of-a-Flower):]]

Whoever thought that he, Severus Snape would be the perfect man to raise a child, was sick in the head and needed to be locked up and his brain removed and used for potions as punishment for even thinking of such a stupid thing...Lily thinks otherwise.

Four Seasons ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9239129/1/Four-Seasons):]]

Part 2 of The Days of A Flower: So, Severus survived the first year as a parent, the rest should be a walk in the park...right?

Blooming Flowers ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12183629/1/Blooming-Flowers):]]

Part 3 of Days Of A Flower: The children are now attending Hogwarts, they bring with them the usual chaos, much to Severus's mixture of exasperation and delight. While at school, the children discover more behind their Headmaster that could shed some light on the creature that attacked Harry all those years ago.

In the fanfic 'The Days of the Flower', Severus adopted Harry Potter though in the part 2 of the fanfic called 'Four Seasons', Severus blood adopted Harry. These fanfics are also slash and the Weasley's doesn't appear until the part 3 of the fanfic, 'Blooming Flowers' and they are super nice. And the Weasley's and Malfoy's also got along because of their children in that fanfic.

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: coarse and suggestive language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed and un-Britpicked.

This is a bit different from the rest because it's AU--it was started in 2005 so some post-2005 canon stuff wasn't mentioned; and the Harry that Snape needs to take care of is no longer a child. This Harry is someone who disappeared after defeating Voldemort and just recently came back to the Wizarding World because of a life threatening condition that could undo his defeat of the Dark Lord.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

**** Was mostly saying that in my own humble opinion there aren't any good fics of the type you asked for. Guess I can respect your taste although I personally rather hate it. What's good in Mentor Snape fics? Nothing really. If you really want to go for a mentor, why not Dumbledore? Have read quite a few Snape Mentor fics and have to say I really wasn't touched by them. I'm not bashing Snape, but in my opinion he's a bit pathetic. Don't get me wrong, he was a spy for the Order and everything, which was a really "good" move I guess. (Can't describe it better, English is not my native language), but he could really have been a bit less of a miserable, pathetic man. Maybe that's the appeal of these fics? Making Snape an actually likeable person? Would really like to hear your opinion.
