#+begin_quote
  . I read a fic once in which the author said that 7 hours had passed between Harry spotting the snitch
#+end_quote

To be fair, I'm pretty sure it's cannon that games can last a damned long time, maybe in that fic(s) Harry just isn't that good or has bad luck or something.

I'm pretty sure in cannon one of the Weasleys mentions a Quidditch game lasting 3 days, before watching the pro game.

--------------

As for fights... Well, it depends on a lot of things. Sure, in canon most fights were over fast, it only takes one bad dodge or counter to be out of it, but it's possible for them to last longer especially when it's two equals, and not the HP and Voldy sort of equals. Take the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort for instance, they had near the same skill level, or at least the same speed of casting/power or whatnot, and Voldy only left because everyone else showed up, who knows how long that fight could have kept going if they hadn't shown up?

*** Canon does mention quidditch games being typically quite long. If you've read quidditch through the ages (which I highly recommend, it's an amazing read) it mentions that the longest quidditch match lasted for months. Yeah. So normally you can expect professional matches to last at least a few hours.

At a school level, it wouldn't be the same, but in my opinion, the rules of quidditch only make sense with games that typically last at least a few hours at minimum, so the 150 points from catching the snitch is just a nice boost, but not the game changer.

**** JKR sucks at numbers. Always has, and has admitted it. So stuff like 3 day long quidditch matches are written as a throwaway line, a bit to add a little magical whimsy to the story, the kind that is cool on first glance, but when you spend more than a second to think on it, is kind of ridiculous.

**** Makes perfect sense really, in that wizards don't have much in the way of sense.

Really, it depends on the story I guess, I don't have a problem with authors changing or warping canon in their fics, otherwise, ya know, I wouldn't read fanfiction.

But honestly, I could see a group that decided "He survived, he's the chosen one!" or "He speaks like a snake, evil!" decide 3 day+ matches are perfectly fine.

**** Is it really that crazy? I'm sure there are potions to keep a witch or wizard awake for three days. And a professional team could have tons of different stringers so they could prolong the match.

***** There's no need for the players to stay awake for three days. Quidditch could be like cricket, with matches lasting days, but with only nine hours of gametime in a day, with plenty of breaks and timeouts. It's what makes most sense to me. Plus, if the game lasts that long, the score could easily go into the thousands.

Then, catching the snitch doesn't matter because it gives you 150 points, but because it allows you to win when you want to. If a team is winning by 250, but need to win by 330, the game can be about stopping the other player from catching the Snitch instead of the same old spot and chase the snitch.

**** u/elizabnthe:
#+begin_quote
  The three day match is one of those things really
#+end_quote

7 hours isn't that unrealistic, it happens occasionally in tennis. In Quidditch they are apparently allowed two hour timeouts (if the game extends for 12 hours) which is probably a little short for long matches, but it does seem as by the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/2014_Quidditch_World_Cup][World Cup 2014]] that similar to tennis that they don't play over consecutive days.

The longest tennis match was 11 hours played over three days, the longest in one day was seven-so not unrealistic-and seemingly not a common occurence.

** I strongly agree with the combat stuff. It happens so much... It's cool if your fight scene takes a long time to read when you describe the action in detail and from multiple perspectives, but no close quarter combat should take as long as some authors seem to think.

About the crucio: Do we have any idea how long it takes? I always imagined Bellatrix "playing" with the Longbottoms for hours.

  5 minutes would also be more than enough time for Alice to lose her sanity under the curse.
#+end_quote

I agree with what you're saying about the fighting- a close-quarter fight would not take long at all unless both opponents were equally skilled and neither could get a good opening- but we have absolutely no way of knowing how long it would take someone to lose their mind from being crucioed.

The spell isn't designed to make you lose your mind, it's designed to cause pain. How much pain one can stand- that might be up to the individual. I've seen everything in fanfics from a couple of minutes to hours and hours. Canon gives us no clue. Real life gives us a few clues (women don't go insane from childbirth, for example), from which I'm inclined to believe hours and hours might be a more likely scenario, especially since the LeStranges and Crouch were questioning the Longbottoms about where Voldemort was.

** Most people in general don't have a good sense of time.

That's not always a "I've never seen a watch" thing, but humans in general have poor sense of just how long moments happen and pass by in general. Everyone has sat in a class that seemed to have lasted hours when in reality it's only lasted maybe ten minutes. Or they've gone running and felt like they must have gone at least three miles but when they check their watch it's only been about 800 feet. Hell, when I was in the military I was in a "firefight" that felt like it lasted days but in reality was over and done with in about five minutes.

From a story telling point of view, it's very easy (and easily excusable) for characters within the story to not realize how fast, or how slow time "in the moment" is passing.

Now for things like an author never seeing a calendar and just having a poor timeline in general? That's different.

*** To the human mind, time is entirely subjective to the moment. An hour can pass in what feels like a few minutes, three minutes can drag on for hours. Humans can only perceive one dimension in time, and that perception is easily influenced.

Watch the whole thing and then think of that when you read about a 5 minute stare down between two people in the middle of a conversation like its just some casual happening while there are other people in the room watching.
