It had some consequences and that's about all I remember. I think it make have been on ffn


** I think I remember a similar story though the whole stone ends in harry's hand not shards.

If it's the one i'm thinking of the flamels show up in the hospital ward while Harry is still passed out. They look at his hand and realize that during the fight with voldemort and all the magic in the air that harry absorbed the stone into his hand. A fact they find amusing as it keeps the stone away from both Dumbledore and Voldemort.

If i remember correctly the loss of the stone doesn't actually hurt them (eg either spares or they can make a new one, etc).

Now if my laptop wasn't giving me some issues i could search for it.

*** I believe it's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summoners Stone by Lochar). A very mild final fantasy crossover that doesn't need any knowledge of that series (I didn't anyway). It's completed but the sequel was abandoned and the author posted how they wanted it to end

  A simple question from Harry during his vault visit in book 1 changes his life, as Harry accesses a family vault. And a stone there that will change his life, even more than finding out he is a wizard did.

***** I've read that one before but unfortunately it wasn't what I was thinking of. Still very good and I'm glad I got to read it again, especially now with the sequel's would-be end posted, thanks!

  Harry undergoes Maturity early, thrusting him into the adult world with no warning. H/Multi; Powerful!Political!StillATeenager!Harry; Whump!Thump!Bash!Weasleys. Expanded, much better summary inside. In response to the question: The Retired Feature Story ribbon is from Chad, the Admin of the site. He used to do Featured Stories but stopped.
