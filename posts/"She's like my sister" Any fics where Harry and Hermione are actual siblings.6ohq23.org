  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

**** Not much variations in /Philosopher's Stone/; as usual with these things, things get moving a bit more for Year 2 and Year 3. It's not terrific as a whole, but it's not /bad/ either. I'd say it's something to give a shot at when you're in a gap between stories and don't really know what ot read next. Maybe you'll get hooked, maybe not.

** There are at least a couple where the Grangers meet Harry before Hogwarts and foster/adopt him when they discover the abuse he's suffered, and it's clear early on that the two will probably become a couple when they get older.

linkffn(5178251) "30 Minutes That Changed Everything" by Radaslab comes to mind. I thought it started out interestingly, but got bogged down in the alternate education scheme the author came up with.
