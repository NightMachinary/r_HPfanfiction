** The Gaunt Ring flashed on Ron's curse-charred finger as he began to recite the last words separating Ginny from life, "The Blackest Night falls from the skies, the darkness grows as all light dies, we crave your hearts and your demise, by my black hand, the dead shall rise."

This is immediately where my mind went. I know this isn't particularly original, but it is niche, so hah!

**** Well Ron using a Black Ring to resurrect Ginny is actually original, afaik. The actual idea of "Harry Potter, but with Black Lanterns" is in a few fics, like "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187641/1/Death-s-Knight][Death's Knight]]" which, which I remember as being pretty good, it was never completed, and then it was taken over by another author, who [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11648412/1/Death-s-Knight-Revisited][also didn't finish it.]] There's also "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5273484/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blackest-Night][Harry Potter and The Blackest Night]]" which I read so long ago that I know basically nothing about it, other than the resurrection stone was a Black Lantern Ring.
