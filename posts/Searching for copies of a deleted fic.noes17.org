The fic i'm searching for, /This is not the chosen one you're looking for,/ is a /Good Omens/ crossover, wherein Harry is the Antichrist instead of Adam. I once read it on Ao3, but it has been deleted. Does anyone know where I could read it?

Some stuff I recall, if that helps:

One kid mentions he was adopted: it is heavily implied he is the original Harry Potter. Harry splits Quirrelmort into Quirrel and Voldemort, who gets his old body back. Harry then kills Voldemort. There was a sequel which crossed over with the Lucifer TV series. Lucifer mentions he never knew he had a kid.


** Tardis deleted all his online accounts. Archived posts and comments indicate that the user was strongly against the posting of reviews on goodreads, which is likely the reason. There is also the rumour that it is because people were reposting the stories, But I have not seen anything to support this possibility.

Fortunately most of their stories survive in the archive.

Chapters 1-3 of the sequel are here: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170922075438/http://archiveofourown.org/works/4748279/chapters/10853663]]

Unfortunately AO3 likes to give a lot of redirects to crawlers for some reason, and chapter 4 does not appear in the archive, and it appears that it had not yet been posted to ffnet in the last scrape before deletion.
