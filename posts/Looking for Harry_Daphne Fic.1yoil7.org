I'm trying to find a story I read last year about Harry and Daphne. I think the timeline was when everything was over (Post Voldy but is AU) but Daphne lost her memory so she's working at a cafe. She plays D&D there and doesn't remember being a wizard. Harry discovers her there and is surprised since everyone thought she was dead.

Thanks


** You're thinking of the final chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]] by TheEndless7, though I agree, the final chapter could have been its own story.

*** Ah k that's where I read it from thanks! I really enjoyed her/his work. I was mainly looking for Luna/Harry fics and stumbled onto this.

** It's never 'lack of inspiration' sometimes we just feel we told the story we wanted to tell.

It kind of was a story unto itself. Originally, the 'epilogue' served as chapter frames interspersed through the story. My betas didn't think it made sense with the serial nature of fanfiction. So I dropped them then compiled and posted them at the end in a sort of 'here's all the other crap I wrote that didn't make the cut' type way. I probably should have titled it 'extra stuff' rather than 'epilogue' but oh well.

*** I think that as an epilogue, it was a fine addition to round out how the story ended and not finish with a cliffhanger. Aside from that, the last chapter was well written, if rushed at certain points, and made the story quite enjoyable. I hope you don't see any comments as disparaging because there are very few writers these days that can write to your level. Hope to see another chapter of Vitam Paramus soon.

**** I don't find anything disparaging. Parts of Princess do feel rushed when I look back at it. But often it was more of a result of me getting to the point faster than I thought I would. There's some points I've been tempted to go back and rework. But I'll probably leave it as is for now because, as a whole, I'm happy with it.

As for VP; I'm hoping 19 is live by the end of the week. Some RL stuff has delayed it far longer than I'd have liked.

**** That's one of the things I find most annoying about working in the Harry Potter universe. You even reference it in an older post. Yes, I could have gone on and written a seventh year. But my goal was always to write one year from a different perspective and see what happened. It ended a little dark because I suspect someone that winds up in way over her head wouldn't necessarily get a happy ending.

But working in Harry Potter means there is existing material for years after where you're working, usually. I still receive comments wondering when I'll write years 5, 6, and 7 of Letters.

Everyone likes a happy ending. But not all stories have them. And I know I've always preferred something less finite in an ending myself, preferring believe whatever I want about the characters. But thanks for reading, I do appreciate it.

***** I just finished Pureblood Princess, and since you're here I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed it. I can't seem to adequately convey what I'm feeling about it (all positive thoughts, aside from my "Noooo! You can't leave me at that!" that came from the story's end) so just take an upvote and keep up the good work. I'd read Letters a few weeks ago and enjoyed that too, so I'll probably read the rest of your stuff over the next week.

****** Hey, thanks for reading, I do appreciate it. I often lurk here to see if I can pick up any tips or what not for the writing. It's rather rare that I bother to post. I've debated with a beta of trying a 'ask me anything' type thread, but it seems too much like fishing for compliments!

*** I really enjoyed the ending, it was something different, very well written and it kind of let it end on a sweet note. It also made your story more memorable.

*** Can I just say that never have I read a fanfic that left me as depressed and happy as yours did, I was happy because Daphne and Harry had each other and their child and love but I was so depressed because of all the shit that had happened to them and the fact that Daphne had lost her memories. so Congrats on that I suppose it was easily one of the best fanfics I have read in a long time.
