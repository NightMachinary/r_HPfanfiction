linkffn(What You Leave Behind) Does has a great intro to Dumbledore like magic.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) This is just badassery to the highest order.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** I like the wards in Silently Watches "Faery Heroes". With the distinction between open and closed wards. How they are made with ward stones and runes. And how the Potter's have ward picks and other family knowledge on breaking wards.

I also like the animagus ritual used in "Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar". The only change I would make is require a bit more animal related work in the month between start and finish, rather than just start the ritual and wait a month, then transform.

From that, my favorite is the one Harry does with the Horntail heart. Just feels more magical to me. And it is another one that gives actions magical meaning.

** For spells: There is one in /The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond/ that changes the density of non-living, non-magical materials. Newtonius, I think? There's something about it that just makes me smile on the inside.

For potions: That potion that Taure came up with in /The One He Feared/ that allows one to hear the enchantments placed on an area as music. The Draught of Notre Dame or something like that.

For rituals: The stuff in ihateseatbelts' /Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/ are probably the only rituals (even though they are barely/rarely mentioned) of obvious magic that I think are of any interest/balance with world building.

For other: Once again going back to /Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/ gives us wandsong. It's interesting, clever, and falls in line with some of my thoughts on wandlore.

** Bloodmagic in Cadmean Victory is really really good, as is Harry's original spell. Harry's spell is extremely... versatile especially in the way that it functions. I wont give spoilers here because it is his best weapon other than bloodmagic.

Wards are also a favorite of mine. I know they arent canon, per say. However the concept is extremely enjoyable. Especially CurseBreaker Harry Stories.
