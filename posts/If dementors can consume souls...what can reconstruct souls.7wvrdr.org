Just a strange, possibly theological question I found myself wondering last night; if dementors are capable of sucking out souls and consuming them, what would be capable of reconstituting a soul from nothing? At the very least, timeline-changing time-travel can reverse the effects of a Kiss, so does that count?

For that matter, can souls be recreated at all? If they can, if someone's soul pops back into existence when it would be destroyed, then there doesn't seem to be much point of the dementor's kiss, except as a particularly terrifying/gruesome execution method. If souls can't be restored, then wouldn't aiding and abetting a Kiss or some other method of soul destruction be, in itself, an act of supreme evil worse than murder?

...Huh, now I've thought of some story possibilities; one, the dementor's kiss can't permanently destroy souls, only separate them from the body; they're used as a method of 'execution' (since it technically leaves the victim alive) because a relatively simple ritual can restore the link between a living body and soul in case of error. That might be why the Ministry was so cavalier about stationing dementors around Hogwarts and ordering Kiss-on-Sight on Sirius Black.

Two, the dementor's kiss does destroy souls in an irreparable way, and thus even enabling it is an act of supreme evil...I'm not actually sure where to go with this, you could have someone gloat before being kissed that whoever ordered it is inevitably going down with them, or a horcrux-user-detecting spell detects most of the Wizengamot (because they'd have shattered souls, due to committing acts of supreme evil in abetting the dementor's kiss).

But yeah. Has anyone ever seen or thought of an anti-dementor that reconstitutes souls from nothing instead of eating them? That'd be funny, a white-cloaked, happiness-emitting-instead-of-eating, Un-Dementor that occasionally regurgitates souls that a regular dementor eats, black-hole->white-hole style.


** There actually are anti-dementors in canon that can create a soul from nothing.

** The idea of the Undementor is amusing, if unlikely. If you are unwilling to believe that the Kiss /can/ permanently destroy a soul, there's an interesting theory that the soul is kept trapped /within/ the Dementor's body; the Dementor thus uses it as a permanent food source. If the Dementor is ever destroyed, the soul is finally freed to move on.

*** This is giving me ideas. Older and more successful Dementors would be stronger and have a greater aura of despair. Maybe it affects their size, and there are actually various sizes of Dementors, depending on how many souls they've eaten. Maybe Azkaban is a prison not for people, but for the strongest of Dementors, deep down below the surface. Their Aura is so strong it affects the island hundreds of feet above it.

****** Ya, the fic description is useless, I think the author tended to update it with each chapter.

It's a AU post GOF, that starts in 6th year: Voldemort has laid low in Harry's 5th year - Sirius is still alive, no DoM, no prophecy, etc.* Dumbledore finds something that may be necessary to defeat Voldemort and Harry has to go find it, along with Moody and an OC, but Voldemort can't know Harry's looking for it, so there's some shenanigans to make it seem like Harry is still at Hogwarts.

The story bounces back and forth between Harry's group and Ron/Hermione/Ginny at Hogwarts, with interludes showing what Voldemort is up to and battles between the Order and Voldemort's forces.

I recommend the story whenever I can because it's wildly AU: no prophecy, no Hallows, but there's still a reason it has to be Harry vs Voldemort and the explanation for why is pretty awesome (it has my favorite "Power He Knows Not" I've come across). Magic is still magic (i.e. author doesn't get hung up on the details) but the combat is snappy and well-written. There aren't a huge number of OCs and the ones used are good additions to the story without derailing it entirely. Writing is top notch.

*Oddly enough, I don't think the author was trying to retcon Sirius being alive or ignoring the prophecy, they just started writing before OotP came out and decided their story would be better if Harry was a year older I guess.

Although generally Dark witches and wizards will not try to produce a Patronus, not having any need for one, most Dark wizards will be devoured by maggots coming from their wand and consuming the caster.

** My head cannon on Dementors is this. Souls cannot be destroyed only moved, or broken and repaired.

To cast Avada Kedavra you use something like resonance to shake someone's soul from their body, thus forcing them to pass on once there is nothing holding to the living plane. But to cast it shakes your own soul damaging it.

Dementors, at least the first one could have been created many different ways. But regardless of when or how Dementors came to be. Is that someone with a broken leaking soul, the rest having passed on, lost the ability to feel happiness. And they slowly became a Dementor, as their magic tried to fix it. Drawing happiness and memories to repair the leaking soul. Slowing losing more and more of themselves until only the broken bit of soul and body remained.

What they actually do when they kiss you is break off a piece of your own soul and swallow it to try and fix their own, but since it is not their original soul it doesn't fit and that piece passes on. Leaving gonna husk that will eventually turn into a Dementor as well.

As to reverse the process? You could perhaps cast time magic on them to make then younger and younger eventually they would turn back into a Human with a broken soul again. Perhaps you could then bathe them in Patronus Mist, not a full one because again that is a reflection of one person's soul not bits of one. Perhaps memory mist too of memories containing the original person (that stuff you use for a pensive). I always imagined the two types of magic looking like representations of a soul.

You could make them a person again, but the original person has been dead awhile. But by restoring the soul you would have given then a second chance with no memories. And have "destroyed" a Dementor.

As for a reverse Dementors? That terrifies me. A being with a broken soul that could only cause and remember happiness? Like a Black Hole that draws away Happiness, a White Hole would only allow Happiness and "good memories" but that would mean you were just as unbalanced.

I imagine something like Joker Venom or Tasha's Hideous Laughter would occur. You could watch your SO get brutally torn apart in front of you and only feel like it was the most hilarious and happy thing in the world giggling all the while an Anti-Dementor tore their body apart to ride the world of a soul with darkness of any kind inside it. The worst part would be IF you survived that. Because the memories would forever be funny to you, you could remember your love being torn limb from limb and still think it was funny.

Not to mention that Anti-Dem would necessitate a reverse Patronus spell that could be easily abused as a new unforgivable.

They let it be, like every good government should, and then in 1718~ made Azkaban into a prison.

But the Pheonix was apparently some bird that wanted his legacy to live on forever. So he asked the Sun to give him a child.

The Sun told him that the price for life is death and only through fire, could his legacy be eternal. But not any fire would do, he had to gather sacred plants from all over the world and then call the Sun with a voice of heaven.

The bird flew from east to west gathering the most sacred of woods to build its nest and filled it with Murr, Oak and Cedar creating the childs future home.

He then started singing, through day and through night, to receive the voice of heaven. The sun watched him throughout the day yet never left at night. For seeing the bird, singing for the heavens, filled him with joy.

But the bird had not yet reached his goal, his voice not yet of heaven. So the Sun gave him comfort, energy and time to last him through the ages. For five hundred years, the bird sung in place, its nest now all but sticks. The Sun was now though satisfied and spoke down to the bird.

"Through Night and Day, through Heat and Cold, you have trained your voice, so now its reached the heavens. Your wish is now, your wish is true. You shall have it granted."

The nest now burned, it fire claimed, with the Sun standing over. The bird turned ash, fell to the ground, in flaming balls of cinder. His time was trough, his time was nigh. His death brought life anew.

In exchange here's some spiritual lore I picked up in Australia from an old Aborigine who taught me how to use an atlatl. . . . Of all the spirits of the land, Mei-Mei Spirit (May may) is the most important one. The spirit of Earth and Lightning is everywhere. He has been and always will be, he watches over everything that lives upon his land silent except for when he feels words are needed.

Mei-Mei Spirit knows and came before all other spirits, from water, to sky, to animals. He calls down all Lightning and Thunder, and shakes the Earth to speak to those around him. Or simply to remind them that they live upon his domain.

When you enter a new land or travel to a new place, kneel down and take soil and rub your hands together. Give thanks for the land you walk upon, and let him know you respect it. Think on the paths you've left behind and the ways before you before you stand and continue your journey.

*************** Yeah.

Mythology doesn't really fit with the magical world, as every mythical creature exist.

How would one even convert this to fit the Harry Potter world?

The 'same place of death' is just Fauxs' ashtray? So Dumbledore just took his ashes and put them in a ashtray, and if Faux wants to live, he cannot leave?

**************** I think HP phoenix are definitely different, for after they burn they are the same creature with the same name even. And they burn way way more often than mythological ones. I always figured the mythos ones lived hundreds of years then burned and were reborn without any of their old memories.

It's an interesting point if they absolutely have to return to their burn site. Makes them sort of like vampires in that respect with soil from the place they turned in their coffin.

I always thought that Fawkes like most things Dumbledore has is simply on loan from Nicholas Flamel. Who else would have the time and patience to tame an immortal creature? Or create the Put-outer?

I'd say HP Phoenix are restricted by not much, since they can immolation teleport. What does peak my intrest is how would you create a new Phoenix in HP land...

Say one took Hedwig's still body, burned it to ash and gave the ashes to a fire magic Obscurus. Maybe potential White Phoenix for Harry?

***************** Well, there should not actually be anything stopping Harry from making Hedwig a Phoenix, If we assume you can create one by burning its body in the flames of three sacred trees.

And the colour should not be a problem either, since Phoenixes apparently can be all kinds of Purple too. (White is not a part of Purple though).

But, there is no singing from a dead owl.

So just make up another variant, where you only have to get your bird to the egg in the Sun gods palace and (many strage steps I can't bother making up) voilá! An Owl Pheonix.

The Sun Gods palace can just be a 'Place of Power' kind of thing, where you have attributes of fire and rebirth.

Like at Vesuvius at the Winter Solstice.

So go to a volcano during the longest day of the year. Find the 'Place of Power' and burn Hedwig, with three sacred woods. In the piles of ash, a tiny owl should appear.

Sure. She would probably not be a complete phoenix though. So not an immortal bird everywhere, just immortal by this pile of ash. But ashes aren't really heavy to carry, so just bring them with.

And since she isn't a complete phoenix, she is still white.

****************** Makes perfect sense, no teleporting for Hedwig if she's not a full Phoenix. But hey at least she's alive again. Place of Power has a nice ring to it as well. Hmm creating magical creatures, that quick and dirty road to becoming a Mad Magus creating odd things... actually scratch that Hagrid totally create magical creatures with a broken wand, makes me afraid for what a fully trained Hagrid is capable of.

So nothing says a reconstituted soul would result in a living person.

** Undementors descend on a town. They leave ten minutes later, having regurgitated a dozen souls into bodies. Those people have to share their time with the bodies' former owners.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
