What can it kill? Anything? We've seen it petrifie a ghost could it say, kill or at least petrifie a dementor?


** A basilisk can kill pretty much anything if the victim directly stares into its eyes. The victims only get petrified if they see the basilisk's eyes through something like in the case of Colin's camera in COS.

The above is based on JKR's story, idk about actual mythology (like if it's different or has extra mythos)

*** The actual mythology is basically what is shown in the books; a snake with a crown-like growth atop it's head (hence it being called the King of Serpents), and with deadly vision and venom. It should be noted that it was often confused with the Cockatrice in stories, due to similarly deadly abilities and methods of creation: the Basilisk is hatched by a cockerel sat atop a serpent's egg, the Cockatrice hatched by a serpent atop a cokerel's egg.

** I doubt it can petrify a Dementor, only the Patronus Charm should work on it. But it appears to be able to kill nearly anything else through nearly unstoppable Killing stare, nearly incurable poison, immense physical strength, sharp fangs, etc. However, phoenixes appear to be immune to its death stare, and they can even cure the otherwise unstoppable poison of a Basilisk.

**** it didn't kill the diary with acid though, it killed it because of metaphorical something and souls and stuff

Edit: because apparently this is not clear at all: My point is not that the diary wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, it is that I see no indication for the basilisk venom to be acidic. If JKR explicitly said that basilisk venom is an extremely strong magical acid, please tell me so.

Furthermore, I think it is pretty clear that there is a magical aspect to the destruction of a horcrux, not just a physical one. It is quite possible that basilisk venom can destroy horcruxes because it is a powerful magical venom, not because it is corrosive. The Killing Curse can destroy horcruxes because it is the Killing Curse, not because one of its side effects is that it makes stuff explode.

A stunner would not stun it but it might knock it back, setting it on fire should work at least for a short time but do it no harm, and most household spells would probably have some ridiculous and completely useless effect. Not that anyone would ever try that, because most people have better things to do when confronted by a dementor, like running away or trying to cast a patronus.

On another note, can dementors go through physical barriers? Could a wizard conjure walls around them and a ceiling above them to prevent dementors from getting to him?

And then there are spells that have physical effects. If a wall stops a dementor, then one should be able to trap it inside a cage, or drive it back by propelling debris at it, if only for a short time.

And erecting a dome around oneself and then digging a tunnle seems a viable alternative, if one is strong enough to withstand the dementors aura long enough.
