Basically Neville is Alice and Peter's son, hence the parallel between the two boys' clumsiness and meekness in earlier books and the reason why Augusta is so disappointed Neville is not like his perceived father, Frank.

Also in a parallel to Snape switching sides, Wormtail goes to Voldemort to persuade him not to harm his lover and his son (especially worried that Neville will be a more likely target because he is believed to be a pureblood) and instead offering to spy on the Order for him and convince him that the Harry is the more likely child of the prophecy.

If you know of any stories having similar premises I'd be grateful for recommendations as well.


** Could also be why Frank's wand works so terribly for Neville. Not only are they not compatible but the wand is loyal to Frank and Neville is the product of his betreyal.

This also actually gives Petigrew a somewhat believable motivation to join Voldemort. Completely misguided and wrong but at least more than we are offered in cannon

Great prompt.

Frank's wand doesn't work for Neville because it's not Neville's wand. Blood has nothing to do with it. There's a whole chapter on this in DH.

**** There is a chapter that leaves a lot of things unexplained except that Harry accidentally became the master of the Elder Wand. A bunch of people would be wandless only by attending the DA meeting where Harry taught them the Disarming Charm if that was the sole reason. Neville does a fairly decent job with his father's (and for the sake of this prompt "Frank's") wand when he learns that Bellatrix is out of prison.

The whole theory that Neville was a poor wizard because of not using a wand that chose him is pure garbage.

***** What I believe is that Neville is not a powerful guy generally. Afterall even if the wand was incompatible with him he would be better. Harry used Draco's wand in the final battle yet managed to fight properly. In many fics Neville becomes an awesome dude after getting a new wand. He becomes strong enough to defeat Bellatrix immediately and stuff. It's not really realistic. Sure his father's wand was holding him back but it doesn't make him a bad wizard. Maybe he was just not good. Even as a child he only showed magic after being dropped from a building.

And all we know about him from before that, was Dumbledore's memories and biased opinions. Because we /all/ know what Albus thought of Tom. The man almost burned down a wardrobe full of everything Tom owned! And with the whole Mrytle thing, that was an accident. He had no idea she was in a stall when he brought the basilisk out. And we don't know what he really though when petrifying "mudbloods." For all we know, they were bullying him. We never really got his side of the story. And during his earlier year's in school, people hated him for being a Slytherin and a supposed muggleborn. If the poor kid actually got some affection and love, he wouldn't be so bad, in all honestly. You'd be surprised what good parenting can do to a bad kid. So...yeah...Tom is a pretty flawed character, kind of evil and crazy, by the end. But it isn't truly his fault. At least not all of it.

Voldemort (or Tom) didn't want to only beat Avada Kedavra but he wanted to beat all three Unforgivable Curses since he saw them as the major weaknesses of human nature. My theory is that he became insane because he subjected himself to the Imperius Curse to the point he could resist it (Barty Crouch Sr became mad after he beat it) and that's why Harry can resist it, reptiles don't feel pain the same way as humans do thus he added snake DNA to his own and thus the snake-like look.

Since, by that point, he had a "red glint" in his eye when he murdered his family. Or at least that's what I remember. And his claim of Slytherin house would have been shaky, still, even if by a bit. And if it wasn't, he never would have trusted anyone to Imperio him. And his claim on Slytherin could have challenged if his experiments of literally asking to be controlled were brought to light unless he obliviated the person he asked to help him. He likely did this multiple times as well. So multiple obliviates or a secrecy oath, maybe. And that's only if he found someone. And one can't imperio themselves. So your theory doesn't hold out.
