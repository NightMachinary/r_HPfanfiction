I'm looking for fanfiction where Snape survives the Battle and is allowed to continue on as headmaster. I've read a few good pieces with this theme, but most I run across are terrible slash fics, or him with Hermione. There's one I read years ago Deviant Art before the 7th book came out, that more or less guessed the ending of the books and had Harry has the DADA professor and Snape starting to show gray in his hair and they were reminiscing and I thought it was really well done. I've never been able to find it since. Anyway, I'm rambling, Snape lives fanfiction,no slash, no Hermione pairing. Thank you for your assistance


** Seventh Horcrux has this.Its mostly crack though.
