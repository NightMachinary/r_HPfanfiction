** In the story I'm writing that's literally every shopping trip cause the main character is a bit overly paranoid. But most of the shopping trips are skipped over and summarized in a single paragraph because very little of importance happens and I don't want to spend five chapters talking about every detail of the super awesomeâ„¢ luggage with built-in five-star apartment.

*** I wish more writers were like this in more places; we don't need to hear the entire sorting hat song (especially not yearly), every single background character's house, who's dorming with whom, a description of every side character and how beautiful they are, a class-by-class breakdown of the first week, etc.

*** Thank you for that, seriously. Just say Harry threw away Dudley's old hand me downs and bought some new clothes, spent the rest of the time hanging out with his friends, and maybe got ice cream. We don't huge paragraphs describing each and every piece of clothing, or each and every magical item that won't be relevant to the actual story.
