This is a rant thread. It's here because I needed to rant. Feel free to throw in your own 2 cents. Preferably loudly and angrily.

And thus another problem was solved by the unmatched intellect mighty Lord Potter-Slytherin-Percivell-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Gaunt-Blackm (but not Huflebuff cus there icky), richest wizard in the world, who owns controlling interests in ALL THE THINGS with no help from that bumbling senile old genocidal pedo who dared to think himself a politcally savy with his mere 80 years of experience ^{^{^{so}}} ^{^{^{mote}}} ^{^{^{it}}} ^{^{^{be.}}} but don't worry, Harry's got plenty of flaws too!

Oh, look, I put my blood on the parchemnt and I'm a runes transfiguration, charms, curse, and spooky magik prodegy! Oh, and it also tells me that I'm related somehow to all these houses and for whetever reason nobody else is in the massivley inbred community that is Wizarding Britain. Seriously, that place is worse than a dogshow.


** When things get super political at Hogwarts. yes it can be interesting if well done to include a political backdrop, but having 11-14 year olds talking like politicians is just so unbelievable. "The house of Potter is indebted to the house of Longbottom." Or Draco writing home about being unable to get an alliance with the Potter Heir.

And it's like this world seems exhausting, why is literally every single move you make a political one? 12 year olds are not going to be thinking over every word they say

*** I feel like this is related to one of the most annoying misconceptions about Slytherins, too, and I've had to have this conversation with a surprising amount of people: Slytherins don't do /everything/ for political gain. Yes, they'll do a lot to get what they want, but that doesn't mean they calculate every response or only befriend/chastise people if it works for them in some way. Even in real life, with other Harry Potter fans, people have said to me, "What? You can't be Slytherin, you're so nice haw haw haw." /Bitch/ Slytherins aren't mean. There can be bubbly ones, dumb ones, horrible-at-strategizing ones... it's just a few personality traits we have in common, not a layout for our entire being! /rant

I really hate it when Dark!Harry pushes the Order of the Phoenix away. These guys are like his own personal bodyguards, if he's so smart, why would he push them instead of use them?

Also, when all Purebloods (except the Weasleys, of course) are portrayed as sophisticated, beautiful, rich and aristocratic, and able to easily cast powerful magic at age 11. The Malfoys, Blacks and Lestranges were the elite, not the norm among the Purebloods, and even they didn't own multiple castles or possessed a fleet of house-elves. There's a general Slytherin-wank in fanfiction that makes them out to be a Mary-Sue house, rather then a bunch of dumb kids like everyone else.

Issue with using them is that you have to deal with Dumbles and Moody on a regular basis, both of whom could be a danger if they notice how dark Harry's getting. If he eliminates them he's left with a fragmented group of mostly civies and a couple incompetent aurors running around like headless chickens. The only real benefit I see from keeping them is the Fideliused Grimmauld Place.

I agree with your point on the Slytherain wank though. It's kinda absurd sometimes.

I think you overdosed a bit on bad fanfiction, mate. I guess it depends on the story, but I don't see Dumbledore or Moody as danger to him, they are powerful allies, and the Order are competent and well connected enough to help him a lot. My point is: those fics usually try to portray him as intelligent and cunning and well-versed in politics, so he should be able to recognize how much he can profit from having the Order on his side.

***** Same, there was a particularly long one I read where Harry and Hermione (but obviously not Ron) find out they're like super totally amazing in some way and now can't trust anyone, and suddenly they both had the amazing ability to /know/ that there was something fishy about the lemon drops, so they stopped eating them and Dumbledore was irritated/respected them more for seeing through his devious plot of handing out candies laced with stuff. I also remember a fic a long time ago that the lemon drops were actually made by Snape for Dumbledore to contain certain bits of potion depending on who he was giving them to. I can see it being a funny crack fic, but it didn't belong in a serious one.

***** More or less. I don't even think about how intricate the plot is going to be - if someone consistently misspells every name that is repeated dozens of times per book (like the Dursleys), then I almost immediately conclude that they're just a poor author.

It's nothing personal, and I try not to mean it in a bad way, it's just that my estimation of a person's writing drops extremely quickly when spelling and grammar aren't up to snuff.

Basically, he had lemon drops that were normal for normal situations, but in cases where he had to talk to students and they were hysterical, he would offer them a lemon drop with a mild calming drought.
