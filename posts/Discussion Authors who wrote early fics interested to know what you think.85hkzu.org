I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]] and I was wondering what its authors thought of the canonical end. I tend not to look for stories that diverge that early, but generally what do authors think? Do you like where you story ended? Do you like the canonical end? After the End manages to have shocking amounts of canon-compliance for something written so early, but there are so many fundamental and structural differences.

PS: looking mainly for fic authors who wrote stories early enough, not intentionally canon-divergent stories written post DH.


** I first started writing HP fanfic between OOTP and HBP. There were so many interesting ideas floating around at the time. Seer Ron and Dumbledore being a time-traveling Ron being a couple that I remember. Harry/Hermione was in full force, but I was firmly in the Harry/Ginny camp. Harry being an Auror wasn't concrete yet and there was nothing about Ginny going pro Quidditch. Ginny becoming a healer was pretty popular at the time which is what I ended up going with. I remember reading HBP hoping that my little Potterverse would survive. All in all, it didn't do too badly!

It was definitely a fun and exciting time and I'm glad I was able to participate in it.

** I wrote a terrible story just before OotP came out. There're elements of canon i'm okay with but others didn't fit for me. Especially the canon relationships and the christ allegory in harry's death and resurrection.

** Before the Horcrux thing came out, I remember writing a story where a female OC gets saved by a mysterious middle aged wizard from something. She finds out that it's Harry and we find out that he disappeared from the Wizarding world after his final battle with Voldemort. Harry had to trap Voldemort inside himself and isolate himself from the rest of the world.

That was probably 13-14 years ago. I never got around to type and post it on FFNet. The handwritten text might still be lying around somewhere. It's funny though that even back then, the idea of Voldemort being trapped inside Harry had been floating around.

I also recall a fanfic I eventually deleted from FFNet about this OC who was the adopted daughter of the Flamels and a contemporary of the Marauders. I don't remember what the point of that story was anymore (no more notes) but it did feature Snape and Lily being friends. This fic was written approximately 15-16 years ago, way before Deathly Hallows came out.
