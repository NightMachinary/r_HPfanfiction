** I appreciate the thought, but it seems an awful lot like the "Isn't-This-Obvious" author tract that usually happens in OC heavy fics.

That being said, it is pretty funny and I can appreciate the amount of time and effort it must have take to put this together.

Thanks for sharing!

Edit: Also conjuring currency is either the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.

I am such a nerd =(

*** Conjure diamonds , if you can conjure wood why coulnd't you conjure pure carbon?

Conjure hyperpure silicon (it's worth a LOT )

The exeptions are about gold and money , i mean how does the money exeption even work? Just because some arbitrary piece of paper with arbitrary drawings on it becomes immune to magic just because people call it "money?". So letz take two people , the first obliviates the second of the fact that pounds notes are money and the second conjures them. Done.

Probably the "youcannotconjuremoney" thing is just to discourage people doing it , and probably goblins have their hands on the muggle economy and they could catch you. But since we live in a capitalistic economy where everything is sellable , expecially raw material , just put up some immagination and you will be no weasly.

**** I'm thinking it's because currency is too abstract of a concept. For you it might be money, but for someone else it might be favors owed. It might also be that because most people don't know all of the materials that a particular currency is made of, it might be deficient in some way that is detectable.

  it might be deficient in some way that is detectable. I wholeheartedly agree , i think conjurations fails on copying all the proprieties of the material conjured , or something along the lines of that. But still magic is really easy to use to produce really expensive things with relative ease. Google hyperpure silicon , it's arround 100Â£ / oz and we know that most of earth's crust is made of silicon oxide , just eat the shit up and use some transfiguration to banish the impurities , here you have a bloody easy source of income.

And it's the first thing that came up in my mind , with further thinking you can get way more ways to cash in in a legit way.

This is a good question and I was only going off of an article I saw on [[http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/the-five-principal-exceptions-to-gamps-law.html][Beyond Hogwarts]]. The other three possible Exceptions to Gamp's Law are debatable, but I thought this one made a huge amount of sense.

** Funny story. There actually /is/ a major deleted Harry Potter character.

In early drafts of GoF there was a younger sister of someone who was supposed to be the rumor monger selling info about Harry to the papers. This would have continued the pattern of introducing new, younger students to the plot and wider story world, something that we only sort of see with Luna in OotP. JKR axed the character and most of that plot line during her giant edit and rewrite of that book, and replaced it with a reporter turning into an almost ignored +MacGuffin+ bug.

Kind of sad. Would have been interesting to actually have more written about other students. Might have resulted in a healthier and less...intensely MC-focused fanfic culture, too.

Not quite, do you remember the Weasley's squib accountant cousin? It was supposed to me his daughter who had magic. He couldn't understand it so dumped her at the Burrow. I think her name was Mafalda?

#+end_quote

Found [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mafalda#Behind_the_scenes][this]]. I think it's amazing that after reading fanfic for so long I can still be surprised and learn something new.

Good catch!

Edit: For a tangent based on a quote from the Wiki article:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione would have discovered that, much to her own horror, Mafalda was her equal in many ways, and would have been caught between hating Mafalda's disregard for rules
#+end_quote

This characterization of Hermione bugs me. Hermione set a professor on *fire* in PS, cajoled Harry and Ron into brewing Polyjuice in CoS, stole the ingredients from Snape herself, and then attacked Snape in the Shrieking Shack in PA. The notion that she's either a slave to rules or authority figures is often confused with the fact that she's highly motivated by praise; more so than almost any other character in the series.

I can see why this character didn't work out as it would have been very difficult for Hermione to get into a huff about Mafalda's rulebreaking while doing the things she did.

***** Yeah, if I had a penny for every ill-conceived rule-worshiper!Hermione in a fanfic, I'd melt them down and become a copper magnate. Hermione only looks like one because (and I hate to agree with Snape on this), yes, Harry and Ron act like rules don't apply to them. Hermione, on the other hand, recognizes that most rules and regulations are a good idea most of the time, and she is happy to make exceptions if the situation warrants it. So

- /Don't break curfew and wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night:/ Good rule, not worth violating over a matter of preadolescent honor, because one might, say, run into a hungry cerebrus.

- /Don't set teaching staff on fire:/ Good rule for most situations, but OK to break if it's literally a matter of life and death.

Sounds quite sensible to me.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20120208051719/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=3][I've tracked down the source for Mafalda via the Wayback Machine]], and the relevant JKR quote is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  The best thing about Mafalda was that she was a match for Hermione. To the latter's horror, Mafalda was highly gifted and a real show-off, so that Hermione was torn between deploring the rule-breaking and longing to join in and beat her.
#+end_quote

And, I have to say, this is the best evidence for rulemonger!Hermione we have so far --- and it's not even canon. We aren't told what kind of "rule-breaking" this is, or why Hermione deplores it. But, anyway, setting up as Hermione's rival someone 3 years younger than her couldn't have worked out, I think.

That said, consider that Mafalda is basically the closest thing to being Muggleborn without actually being one (and her only blood-tie to magic world is via a "blood-traitor" family); and she's in Slytherin, Sorted just as the Death Eaters begin to make a comeback. Maybe she does what she does to try to fit in to a House that doesn't want her. What would happen to her in subsequent years?

****** You've provided several good reasons for this character's likely deletion. For the life of me I can't think of why she would have been included, but I suspect it would have gone a long way towards eliminating the trope of All-Slytherins-Are-Evil.

It's only in the last book that we see a few Slytherins stick around to help in the Battle of Hogwarts (E.G. Daphne Greengrass etc). Someone please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

It would? She's supposed to be a highly unpleasant person with very little respect for privacy of others. Remember, the character that replaced her was /Rita Skeeter/. Basically, her main redeeming trait would be that she probably has less blood prejudice than most Slytherins.

Nope. /All/ the Slytherins enrolled in Hogwarts at the time fled. The only thing we know about Daphne Greengrass is that she existed and was a Slytherin in Harry's year. We do know that Pansy Parkinson suggested handing Harry over to Voldemort to placate him.

There /might/ have been Slytherins among the reinforcements led by Slughorn from Hogsmeade, but we don't get any names (except for Slughorn, but he wasn't a current student).

Yeah, I know. It sucks.

Were banished, not fled. I am forever mad about it.

#+begin_quote
  "Thank you, Miss Parkinson," said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. "You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow."
#+end_quote

Sure, you can argue that they could have refused and stayed, but really, would /you/ refuse McGonagall? I would much preferred if she'd said anyone who agreed with Parkinson should leave, while giving the rest the same chance to fight that the other three houses got.

And god, the treatment of Slytherins by the rest of the school anyway--it's no wonder they would choose to leave rather than put up with all that bullshit--did no one ever wonder /why/ so many Slytherins became DEs in the first place given that the moment they're sorted at /11 freaking years old/ they're treated like evil incarnate just because of the colour of their tie. (I have lots of feelings about the treatment of Slytherins, but plenty of people have vocalised it way better than me.)

********* Fair enough. My apologies for misremembering. But, not one disagreed with Pansy, unless I am misremembering severely.

I blame Dumbledore and Snape for the mess. Snape for favoring Slytherin and helping them get away with things; and Dumbledore for favoring Harry Potter with the annual House Point dump. I.e., a recipe for polarization. (That came back to bite him later in other ways: if he had been impartial in that respect, he would have more credibility later if he were to defend Harry during his 4th and 5th years.)

So, when it counted, how many Slytherins had meaningful friendships and other relationships outside their House? Who would any of them have to fight for, and who would trust them to do so?

Like I said, it sucks.
