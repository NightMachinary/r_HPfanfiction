*** There is a Granger Enchanted Survivors page on Facebook and the admins have a huge amount of stories archived which they make available on request with the author's permission.

They have just begun a new page "Hunting Horcruxes" which is designed for similar content and I believe will also eventually have as much of the Granger Enchanted archive available as possible (based on obtaining permissions etc.)

** The Open Doors project on AO3 imports fanfiction archives that are no longer online/still running, and you can see a list of which archives are imported/going to be imported [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Open_Doors][here]].

** [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry_Potter]]

[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives]]

As best as I can tell almost every single live journal page, tumblr page, and mailing list, and at least 70 (iirc from checking ~2 years ago) of the archives are completely gone, and, excepting a small handful, the rest are still online but not accepting new submissions. There may be more public groups on Facebook and other social media that weren't listed on fanlore but those are generally small and mostly use ffnet or ao3 to host anyway.

** I remember I always used to go on this site called GinnyPotter as an angsty teen, it's apparently dead now. It had terrible design and the moderator was an absolute wanker.
