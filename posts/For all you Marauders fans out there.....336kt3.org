... I just finished You Want To Make A Memory by enitsirk. It was brilliant. Canon compliant but not too long winded and complete. The author does a great job with accurate character development.

If you are like me and constantly seeking tales of the Marauders than this one is for you.

** Interesting I remember being underwhelmed by the first few chapters. Back on the list, maybe

** Have yet to read a Marauders ff story, but have wanted to dive into one. Is this a good one to start the genre with?

*** I recommend The Life and Times, though it's more of a Lily/James story.

Still, best place to start the Marauders Era imo.

*** I would answer yes. It is all encompassing but complete. And tragic, of course.

** I'll ask one question, and it is a critical one: is this fic yet another one where the author more or less implies that Snape deserved everything James and Sirius did to him in order to make them out as perfect heroes?

Sirius is one of my favorite characters, but so is Snape; my problem with most Marauder-centric fics is that they make me have to choose between two of the least clean-cut characters in popular culture.

*** As a fellow 'Sirius and Snape' fan I would say no. I don't think this one is as harsh as some fics. It follows the standard Snaps v Marauders with hexing, pranks and slander but in the end Snape comes out no worse for wear than any other character.
