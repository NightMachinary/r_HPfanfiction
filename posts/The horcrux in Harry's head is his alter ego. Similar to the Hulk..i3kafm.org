** I like this.

The Voldemort in his head comes out in desperate situations and does whatever it has to in order to survive. Voldemort is selfish and only cares about his own survival, so I can see him killing anyone who threatens the safety of his host.

Bonus points if Harry's eyes turn red when Voldemort takes over.

*** I definitely have read a fic like this, I'm pretty sure in the fic whenever Harry gets a adrenaline spike (like if he's in a fight or he just gets frightened) all of Voldemort's battle hardened instincts, knowledge of spells and magic and ruthless attitude takes over Harry. Harry is still Harry but he just has access to all of these things now and whenever the adrenaline wears off all of Voldemort's knowledge goes away too.

I'm pretty sure the fic is abandoned cause it's been like a long time since it updated. If I can remember the name I'll link it.

Just remember the fic! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2837735/1/]] there's only 8 chapters and it hasn't updated since 2008 so it's safe to say it's abandoned but still a good read!

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

Is the other one i was trying to remember. It's a tad cracky with Harry being a big fire breathing multi headed dragon but it's fun never the less. It's way less explicitly plural but has a lot of the same feels and there has been quite a few moments in it that has made us go "Same!!!"

** It would be interesting if Tom could control Harry if he didn't have a tight enough grip on his emotions. So whenever Harry is upset in any way Tom can over power his mental homeostasis and therefore his body. Maybe also when Harry is sleeping because he would have less influence over his mental facilities and perhaps Tom could take over Harry's body in normal circumstances but only with an insane amount of effort that would tire him quickly. I imagine him changing Harry's entire persona, making him calm and manipulative (but still insane) like his irl counterpart.

** I woke up shivering, looking at the night sky. A few minutes passed by, before a long necked girl came into my view and picked up something from around me, read it, stared at me for what felt like hours, and then finally picked up the basket I was laying on and put me on the dining table.

Another eternity passed, during which I tried every possible means of movement I knew about, but only managed to wobble around in my basket.

I tried to force some wandless magic out of the baby hands I seemed to possess at the moment, only to stop due to the intense pain that racked my tiny body. Which was little compared to the metaphysical pain I felt, as if chainsaws were digging into my chest from every direction. Never do that again, got it.

I looked around the bland kitchen and reviewed my memories while I waited. I was still quite certain that I was Lord Voldemort. Or had been Lord Voldemort at some point.

I wasn't sure what I was right now.

I did feel like an intruder, a foreign object in this baby. Every movement I tried felt sluggish, as though I were controlling a puppet through strings instead of just waving /my/ arms around.

And sometimes the body would just move all on its own, and I could do nothing to stop those movements.

This discovery was built upon a rather terrible tragedy, as evidenced by the spoiled diaper I suddenly found myself in the possession of. Wasn't all that fun, I would rate it 3 serpents out of 5, but it did manage to annoy the girl that had finally returned, so I guess it was a win.

She, and her husband, finally decided to keep me, but when I saw their faces, I sighed. The orphanage days were back again.

The first time I saw a mirror was a nasty shock. I knew intellectually that I was a free boarder at someone's home, but that really drove it... home. Damnit, even my humor is all messed up.

Good thing Bella doesn't need jokes to laugh. Or anything even mildly amusing. Though I might not be the best source of information in that regard.

It must have been close to 5 months when I felt another presence inside the body. One, that was very innocent in the way only babies can be, but it couldn't seem to sense me, and so I decided to extend my policy of hurry up and wait.

And so I waited.
