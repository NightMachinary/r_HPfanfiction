I think I read this fic on ao3, but can't be sure. Was pretty much McGonagall observing how female characters eg Molly, Narcissa changed in their relationships with their respective male partners.


** A section of linkao3(105485) is like that - but McGonagall is only one of a few passages there, so it might not be the one you're looking for.

*** I think this is what I was thinking of, but I was remembering it as a fic of its own. Thanks!
