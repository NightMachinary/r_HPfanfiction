Inspired by this thread - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fixx0v/prompt_harry_has_been_sitting_under_the_sorting/]]

Are there any fics where music plays a significant part? Either as him playing it (a la Harry in Have Chrome, Will Travel) or as him being an actual bard and casting magic with song.

Second, I'd like to prompt a Bard's Tale-style (specifically the off-brand one that starts in Houten) fic where Harry is basically a self-interested, sardonic huckster in search of coin and cleavage that talks to a Narrator of his life (basically a fantasy-trope Deadpool). Sort of like the Denarian Rogue series, only with his angel being a Ethereal-Narrator instead of a Possessing-Entity.

eg. Harry has grown up a poet and a rogue, no friends to speak of, talking to a... a voice in his head. That voice talks about what he does, praises and nitpicks, bullies and banters, yet provides insight that Harry doesn't have. He is a loner, but finds himself drawn further and further into adventures with people he doesn't quite understand for almost entirely selfish concerns. They say "Rescue the princess, for she is a good and kind leader" and he hears "Princess = Rich, but... is she hot?"

This is the game I'm talking about, btw, and the kind of humour I'm looking for - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fZue8dFeiw]]
