** Linkffn(Realignment)

Time travel fic where a powerful adult Harry decides to kill Riddle before he gets dangerous. (Basically a variation on the "would you kill baby Hitler" idea.)

Suddenly Harry is the feared dark lord obsessed with killing a schoolkid, and Tom is getting mentored by Dumbledore in how to avoid getting killed by the dark lord.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

Tom has a voice in his head who calls himself Jerry. Jerry got a weird sense of humor and knows a bunch of things he shouldn't. He's pretty much an evil variant of the "guy who read the books dropped into the HP verse" trope.

Together, Tom & Jerry attempt to take over the world.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
