Hit Wizards

#+begin_quote
  A Hit Wizard or Hit Witch is a member of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad that are trained to deal with highly dangerous combat situations, such as high-risk arrests, riot controls and presumably, hostage situations. As such they are the Wizarding Britain's equivalent of specialist firearms officers.
#+end_quote

While Aurors are trained primarily in dealing with Dark Arts and Dark Wizards.

Basically Hit Wizards are SWAT/Military, Aurors are Investigators and Counter Terrorists.

** I'm going to give you my answer from a previous thread, at least based on what is described in canon.

#+begin_quote
  From what I can tell, it works like this:

  DMLE has the highest employment per department in the Ministry, but this is due to the fact that many of its functions deal with the non-Statute of Secrecy issues as well (not all, but many).

  There are several specialized branches depending on heirarchy of danger or threat to the public good. Aurors are the smallest and more akin to special detectives in large precincts - they operate as investigators as well as enforcement, but are often placed into specialized roles. Next is the Hit Wizards, who appear to be larger and may be organized into units or teams rather than individuals. Think of these like aurors, but less skilled and more in the role of confrontation than investigation, and are not focused exclusively on Dark Magic but rather felony-equivalent crimes. Followed by this is the patrol, which appears to handle the grunt work that you might assign to beat cops in the muggle world - everything from standing watch in particular areas to keeping crowds or riots under control. If they get in a fight, its because they were probably in the right place at the right time on their regular activities.

  Below all of them are what you would consider the purely investigative branches. For example, you have the Witch Watchers, who appear to hold a purely observational role. They provide insight and eyes where needed for the enforcers above them. Their are seemingly several branches (like say Mr. Weasley's) that focus on what you might call misdemeanor crimes, but also serve to report any observed greater crimes to the higher arms of the department (ex. murder, theft).

  If your talking about a street encounter in your fic, if dark magic isn't explicitly involved its probably going to be with Patrol or maybe Hit Wizard members. An auror will not randomly stumble onto a crime in place (unless the staff are short-handed for some reason or another I suppose). But I guess it depends on the circumstances.

** There was a thread about that recently, as it happens. Use the search bar.

Myself, I like to think that they are, secrecy aside, the CIA and FBI of the Wizarding World --- they do broadly the same thing but are under the control of two different branches of the DMLE, hate each other's guts as a master of professional pride, and are always competing with each other. During the books' time frame, the Aurors get all the interesting plot-relevant jobs while the Hit-Wizards are stuck with the rubbish assignments like looking for escaped convicts, because the current head of the DMLE is an ex-Auror.

** Aurors: Highly trained for arresting potential criminals, investigating crime scenes, tracking down dark wizards.

Hitwizards: Trained for battle, act as soldiers but spend most time as security guards protecting the Ministry and a few unlucky ones have to keep an eye on the Dementors in Azkaban.
