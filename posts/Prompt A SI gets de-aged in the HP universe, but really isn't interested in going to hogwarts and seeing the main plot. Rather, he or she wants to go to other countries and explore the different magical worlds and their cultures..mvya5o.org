I honestly wanna see something like this, kinda like Make a Wish, but it would be amusing if it was an adult reincarnated into an eleven year old using knowledge and experience from their old life to navigate the world and avoid people who would want to send them back to Hogwarts.

Like a mix between the movie Babies Day Out and Make A Wish.
