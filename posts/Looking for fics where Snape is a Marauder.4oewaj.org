Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but is there AU where Snape is sorted to Griffyndor and befriends Marauders? I mean he could be Griffyndor, he is brave and noble. Or going to Griffyndor because of Lily? I was just wondering


** Hmm... This fits, though *how* you will have to discover yourself:

** I know I read a fic once where the Marauders all got sorted into Slytherin and joined up there, but they still hated Snape. Oh well.
