  Death realizes that things went bad when Harry Potter is unable to have children after Voldemort hit him with the second killing curse. When this was realized things went very wrong and Death knew she just have to fix it. So when Harry finally dies she's there to meet him and hopefull set things right. Grey/mild dark overpowered Harry. Mild bashing to select weasley's and Dumbles.

** Not 80K+ words, and it is a one-shot, but is still pretty interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13698121/1/Hedwig-s-Choice][Hedwig's Choice]] has a Haphne pairing and is a bit of a crack fic. Doesn't exactly fit your requirements, but it still has Hedwig being adorable and more than her just being a 'fancy postman'.

  Harry Potter entrusts Hedwig with delivering a Valentines day card in sixth year. 'The prettiest girl in Hogwarts' He says. If you're a snotty snowy owl, who is the prettiest girl in Hogwarts? [HP/DG] Slightly AU 6th year, diverging.
