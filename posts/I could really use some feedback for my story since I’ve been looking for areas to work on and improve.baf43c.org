​

I was bored halfway through The Letter and probably wouldn't have gotten that far except for the request for feedback. However, I freely admit that I'm not particularly invested in spiderman, so that probably played some role in my disinterest.

I'd want to know more about this kid - especially when he's switching so young which will presumably have an impact on his development - to establish his personality and desires more up front. Who is he? Why should we be invested in his story? These can't be put off; if no one reads past chapter two, it doesn't matter how amazing chapter eight will be.

​

As it stands, to me it reads rather like a list of things happening, and as a reader I just don't care about anyone or anything taking place.

​

ETA: Coming back to it after an hour or so, I finished the chapter and continued to the end.

-Lucius's characterization seemed exaggerated and I didn't particularly like it.

-The train scene felt constrained, the dialog too close to canon. (Though I did enjoy the twist of Peter trying to convince Ron away from Harry, rather than the other way around. Easily my favourite part so far.)

-Sorting Peter into Gryffindor felt cheap and generic. Seriously, if he's been raised as a Malfoy, there's no way he wouldn't have argued the hat into Ravenclaw at least, if he couldn't have Slytherin. And we know the hat listens to the students; even if it was vehemently opposed to Slytherin, I can't imagine it would force someone into a single specific house against their will.

-Since his parents were alive, and he was switched at age five, I can't imagine why he'd know Uncle Ben's catchphrase? Much less why it would be significant to him?

Sorry, I don't think I'm even remotely the correct audience for this story.

  Young Peter Parker was enjoying a good night's sleep in his parent's house only to wake up to the Malfoy family, now apparently a wizard with super strength. Six years into the future, he realises that he hates Harry Potter. But why?
