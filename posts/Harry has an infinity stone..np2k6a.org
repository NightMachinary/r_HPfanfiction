Looking for a fic where harry has 1 or all of the 6 infinity stones from marvel and uses them. Or maybe he absorbs them or maybe he absorbs the energy off of the stones and becomemore powerful. (I already read the one where he ate the stones like a candy as a child and he is omnipotent).


** Heroes Assemble: linkao3(13054713)

Crossover, blends the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Marvel Comics-verse.\\
Harry moves to New York after a post war world-trip, and ends up getting caught up in /all/ the superhero antics.

The Resurrection Stone is the Soul Stone, so it comes up in the fic's Infinity War/Endgame arc.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** If you're familiar with mjimeyg's work, it won't be a shocker that it happens in their story Armoured Mage.
