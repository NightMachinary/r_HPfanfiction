*** It's got the right premise, but the author really over explains everything. I had to give up at chapter 3.

** Not exactly, but something similar is in linkffn(6782408). Unfortunately, really good beginning turns into Severitus. Not that bad, but still.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** Whispers in the night This fic is not for everybody between the polyamory and the insane levels of abuse The world building is great the characters are fantastic and the magic awesome It also has one of the best Harry/Tom parallels and interactions I have read. Things that we usually ignore because they are too tropey I actually like dread like the war against grindlewald family histories and magic.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
