:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember most of the story but can't remember the name. Here are the pointers:

1. Harry with Hermione, Neville, Luna travel to a different dimension
2. In the alternate dimension:

   1. Snape wears burgundy robe and his best friend is Sirius
   2. Lily is married to Remus
   3. Neville is the boy who lived

Does anyone know what fic is this? Thanks!

**** I mean, yeah, but also that's kind of the point of the story. The whole thing is basically about how Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville interact with people who have the names and faces of their friends and family, but absolutely aren't those people. They even freak out about how different everyone is in the first few chapters.

****** I'm very tired and so I can't find a way to phrase this that doesn't sound patronising to me, but that is entirely okay. No story works in the same way for everyone - people will all read different things from the same story, be it different parts of the things that are there or different parts of things that aren't. That's especially true in this fandom (look at all the different interpretations we have of everything in canon - whether those interpretations are right or wrong, people still think them all in response to the same story). So, you're in good company, at least. :)

Maybe characters who are only those characters in name and don't have the same personalities just aren't to your taste in stories? If you don't buy into that idea, then building onto the foundation with all the 'same faces, different people, that is weird' stuff won't work for you.

But anyway; yes, that's the point of the story. It'd probably become a lot clearer if you read all the way to the end, I'd say, but it's been a while since I first read that one, so my familiarity with it could just be playing tricks with me. Could be worth a reread, see if you like it with that concept added in to your previous understanding of it? Maybe you'll find in it another story that you enjoy. :)
