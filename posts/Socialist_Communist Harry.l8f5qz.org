I'm looking for something where Harry is a socialist/communist. Being raised by the Dursleys drove him to hate the world that enabled it, for example. I'd like to see large-scale magical war, but that's not necessary.

â€‹

Other things: I'm fine with MOST pairings. Anything involving Voldemort is out, and Snape/student is also out.

How would the goblins react? They're the bankers.

Another one of my fics has similar themes, though it's not very long yet.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

** The closest thing to a leftist Harry Potter fanfic you'll see that isn't crack or mean-spirited satire is probably the stuff Starfox5 writes (Democracy, Marriage Law Revolution, etc.), but even then, it's pretty mild on the economical commentary compared to the social one. Not really that close to a communist!Harry story pulled straight, sorry.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
