I'm tired of starting promising fics with interesting writing that turn into sudden fuck fests. It's okay to find someone attractive without immediately wanting to jump their bones, you know? And it's always alright to not find someone attractive until you get to know them better.

Those wilder kinds of fics have their place and time and hell yeah, I read them when I'm in the mood, but I've craved for a satisfying long burn for... well, a long time.

Does anyone know some gems that I sould definitely read?

I'm fairly new to reading Potter fanfiction so even some well known fics might have escaped my notice. One fic I absolutely loved was All life is yours to miss by Saras_Girl.


** linkffn([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

I think this wins in category slow burn. It gets updated regularly and it is probably going to be way longer than it already is.

*** Love this one. The story is great and the updates are nice and bulky (in other words, long and plot-filled) - I've been following it for about a year and have yet to be disappointed.

  Memories of the war are still fresh, which is all the excuse Decent People need to do appalling things. In this quietly waged conflict, Draco Malfoy is happy to be on the right side of things for once, and even happier to find he's not alone.

** linkffn(Rebirth)

It's like ten chapters before the romance starts but it's still a very enjoyable buildup and the plot is good. It's abandoned but it's still excellent
