So I'm thinking of writing a fic where it's dumbledore, hermione and the Weasleys (except for fred and george and maybe bill) bashing, where Harry is powerful (but of course will still have weaknesses) and where Harry allies with Voldemort to crush the Light because the Light is messed up (Voldemort's goals will be a little different here).

Also will be where Harry allows Voldemort to remain as the Dark Lord, just that Harry will be working from the shadows and the Death Eaters and Voldemort will have to submit under his decisions, because his decisions are final

​

Stuff like that

​

Good idea or no? Any suggestions for what could happen in this fic? Any ideas for the title for this fic?

​

I'm planning for Neville, Luna, Fred and George to be joining Harry, and Luna as a half Seer

​

I'm also planning for Draco, Blaise, Theo Nott and some other Slytherins to be Harry's 'Inner Circle' if that's a good idea.

​

To me this fic sounds interesting to write, though I would the updates won't be really frequent.


** How would you get Voldemort to submit to Harry's rule? Voldemort would never bow down to some one, expesually not to Harry- who defeated him. You would have to make harry super OP to get Voldemort to submit to him. Partnership would be more plausible

** Not really that thrilled by the idea (description sound very cliche) but maybe a good surprise. Some questions :

- Weasley Bashing except the twin : Why? Most of the time (in bashing fics) it's because they are funny. But whar argument will you use to justify them to not only go to the Dark Side, but to litterally betray their family? Same thing with a character like Neville.
- When will the AU start? Will it be a "different childhood Harry" where he comes to Hogwarts as a mini Riddle and go in Slytherin? Or something like a 5th year Who change his views? (timing will change rest of the story, especially relations between character).
- Inner Circle : How will Harry build it? And why will they join his inner circle (at least Malfoy and Nott are Death Eater, almost making Death Eater by default so how will you explain it?).
