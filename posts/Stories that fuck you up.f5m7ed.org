Earlier today I was reading a Harry/flier fic and it kind of suddenly got really dark, like, I'm pretty okay with dark fics (someone please finish “when a Veela cries!!!”), but it was not that dark then took a serious turn. Anyone else have this happen, where suddenly a fix turns and honestly I was out of it for a solid hour, just like “woah” and I stopped reading it.


** Grow young with me was a pretty fantastic fic that leaves you kinda just sad and empty at times and then it lifts you back up with its subtle and beautiful love story all wrapped up with the bow on top being how adorable Harrys kids are

** The Eyes kinda qualifies. Starts out dark and gets darker. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]])

Black Ink Red Rose is pretty dark. It starts out only kinda creepy, then gets really creepy. It's by the same author as linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]]) For Lack of a Bezoar is their 'lightest' work and that's still pretty dark.

The one that wins the prize has got to be /Friends/ by the psychotic house-elf on ffn. Hands down the most disturbing work I've ever read. I've read it once. Not sure if I can read it a second time.

*** The darkest one, in my opinion, is the Downward Spiral Saga he made - That was horrifying. Everything that could have gone wrong did. You don't notice how bad it is gotten until suddenly you realize how deep in the rabbit hole it's gone and no matter what happens now, it's too deep to get out now...

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** Antithesis and Lesser Evil fit this. Antithesis had a whole Harry is depressed character arch and it was written a little too well. ended up leaking into my life. bringing the act home and all that

the Lesser Evil stories are probably the most realistic dark fics i've ever read and i don't think i'll ever be able to bring myself to read them again. even though they were probably the best fics i'dever read

**** first of all i take offense second of all no hard feelings and third of all, yeah a lil bit. but i started out by reading its original version. so when i found out there was a more refined version, i was all for that shit.

where i am now and what my preferences are, i probably couldn't stand it much either. it's one of those controversial stories that some people love some people dislike.

it's a good idea to look past the first couple chapters in a story because you'll never know what you'll find (for instance: HPMoR. i hated the idea of nerd harry but i got past that and loved it [unfortunately i could never read it again becuz it was so fuckin long])

I'm not including antithesis in that category though. it holds strong throughout the story and if you don't like the first couple parts then you probably won't like some of the rest.

** Veritas Omnia Vincit is basically the last in a series of fics I read that portrayed Jily in a bad light. And I didn't even mind Jily when I started that downwards spiral, just that the fics I was reading -- several of them (unlike this fic in particular) being pro-James -- came off as being downright creepy Jily-wise. I took it to heart a bit too well, and as a result couldn't stand the ship after reading the fic at all. This fic is also the fic that made abusive relationship one of my few instadrops (the only other major theme I can think of that does the same being mpreg). Incidentally, the consistently negative light that the ship was portrayed as in the various fics I read is likely part of the reason I like LESS in first place -- the one fic that got me into the ship (/not/ this fic, it was The Peace Not Promised) was a breath of fresh air in comparision.

It's not really a badly written fic, just that the circumstances around me reading the fic wasn't... ideal.

Nowdays I don't really mind the ship as much anymore. I still don't really read it, and actively avoid it if it's the main focus of a fic, but it's no longer the near-unconditional instadrop it was after reading Veritas Omnia Vincit.
