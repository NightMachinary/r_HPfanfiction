Hi, is there any fic where the MC is an OC or an OOC existing character who is kinda evil in the beginning with ideologies like hating muggleborns and muggles, pro Voldemort and Death eater wannabe but then interacts more and more with Harry and the other main characters until his ideas starts shifting and he later becomes good or more tolerant and helps them defeating Voldemort? No slash please. Thank you!
