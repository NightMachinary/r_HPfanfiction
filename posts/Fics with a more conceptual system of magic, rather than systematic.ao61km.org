It's generally agreed upon that JKR's magic system doesn't have a whole lot of depth to it in cannon, and the details are often poorly explained or left unexplained altogether. As a result, many fanfiction authors attempt to flesh out the magic system in Harry Potter in their own fics, usually in one of two ways.

The first way is that the guts of the system remain largely the same, but more clearly defined rules are added so that a coherent system begins to take shape, rather than just "wave a wand and say some words, stuff happens." One example of this is WhiteSquirrel's /The Arithmancer/ series. Linkffn(The Arithmancer). Many people are at least familiar with this fic, so I'll give the super short version: Arithmancy is how you craft spells with mathematics, and all/most ways of using a wand can be broken down arithmantically/mathematically. The "result" of the system, like spell incantations and wand movements and what you can and can't do with magic, remain the same.

The second way is that the guts of the magic system get reworked, either a little or a lot. This can include things like "Magical Cores", "Family Magic", the "Light Arts" (none of which are cannon), or characters casually doing things that seemingly contradict the cannon magic system. There are also things like Avatar crossovers where Harry "bends" spells, which completely removes the cannon magic system and throws it into a trash can. One potential upside of this method however, is that you can add as many rules as you like to it, to make the magic system as cohesive and detailed as the author requires for their fic.

There is a (in my opinion) glaring flaw with both of these methods, however. The new magic system that gets created often doesn't resemble the cannon system, and the world can feel less like /Harry Potter/ as a result.

There are various things in cannon that, while not without their issues, are core aspects of the series and are perhaps too readily dismissed. One example is Dumbledore's /The Power of Love/^{TM} , wherein he is adamant that Love is the power that the Dark Lord knows not, and it is a very powerful thing (magically) that should be taken seriously. Many people found this rather silly when reading it, so it sprouted a slew of stories where "/insert thing here/ is the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not, not love. Dumbledore/the Prophecy must have been wrong (or the power of love was never a thing to begin with)." While I understand why some people didn't like this plot point, I think the idea that Love itself is an extremely powerful thing that can be a source of great magic is a wonderful idea that directly ties into the main themes of cannon (but that's for another post).

Similarly, there are other magical feats or occurrences in cannon that are rather conceptual in nature, or at the very least don't have any details around them. For example, TMR cursing the DADA position at Hogwarts. We never find out how he did this, or why Dumbledore was unable to remove the curse. We don't even know that he used a (traditional) spell to do so, or even a ritual a-la Little Hangleton graveyard.

Another example is the ending to PS, where only someone who wants to retrieve the Stone, but not use it, would be able to pull it out of the mirror. Again, next to no details of how Dumbledore did this, but it is consistent with cannon's interpretation of magic, at least in my view.

Voldemort placing a Taboo on his own name is in the same vein as previous examples, I think.

Regardless of specific feats, there are also various statements made by characters that possibly support the idea of a more conceptual magic system. Early in PS, the first book in the series, Harry remarks that there is a lot more to doing magic than just waving a stick and saying some fancy words. This can obviously be interpreted multiple ways, but I would argue that it implies things such as intent when using magic, rather than "here are the rules that the system follows, listed in order of importance. Be sure to follow them, or you'll get a null error when casting Wingardium Leviosa."

Another example of a character directly stating something that goes against the idea of a rigid system is Slughorn talking about Horcrux's to TMR. "Killing rips the soul apart Tom, it is a crime against nature", or something to that effect. It's not unreasonable to assume that this is a metaphor in any other context, but it is very clearly true since killing someone is a key part in creating a Horcrux.

With all of this in mind, are there any fics that deliberately use a more conceptual view of magic, rather than a rigid/systematic one? Additionally, which type of system do you prefer? Conceptual or rigid/clearly defined?

*** Taure's cannon magic document is excellent, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of other users/writers who disagree with the point (I think the cannon system is fine, depth-wise, as this post sort of alludes to).

***** Surely the very fact that a person can write 30,000+ words about it demonstrates that it has depth. If it were shallow, there wouldn't be anything to say about it. That's not even an argument about the content of the magic system, just the fact that the books contain a lot of magic in them.

****** Depth and quantity are different things. I could set a random text generator to generate ten thousand pages' worth of /words/, and with a little imagination you could write a very learned study on the significance of various phrases within it, yet it would still utterly lack depth.

I think there's a very fine argument to be made that it's the same thing with the /HP/ magic system: heaps and heaps of fundamentally meaningless data.

I greatly admire your take on the magic system, you do understand. But I see it as akin to the work of that mathematician who proposed revised laws of physics coherent with the various tenets of the Flat Earth hypothesis. You can be very clever and find a compelling self-consistent system that matches the data, yes. But you won't convince me that the original source of that data (Flat Earthers; J.K. Rowling) actually had that system in mind when they came up with said data.

******* The thing is that in the case of flat earth, some external data will disrupt your system based on a neat set of observations - which hasn't really happened with Taure's headcanon document.

If you really think that, then I'm not sure you've read or understood it, as it's rather neutral in a lot of things, and investigates the magic system not only in-universe, but also how and why it works well from a writing standpoint.

I do think that Rowling had a sort of "Depth by allusion" concept in mind, even if she didn't name it that way. It is simply too often where it happens in canon, wjere we are teased some more and deeper magic, yet never get to explore it.

I don't think that would apply here since Achille isn't saying that Taure's document is inherently wrong in any fashion. Seems to me like he's saying Taure thought it through much more than Rowling did, and he added layers of meaning and depth that she didn't mean or have in mind.

Assuming she kept things simple and didn't outright contradict herself, it wouldn't that hard to build a deeper and more involved headcanon on the magical world.

Anyways, I think the point of the specific post you responded to was that "I've written a lot about it" isn't a meaningful way of demonstrating that JK's magical system has depth.

I'm not saying it doesn't, cause I think that's up for interpretation and isn't worth fighting each other over, but that wasn't much of a defence of it.

****** Dude, I've read many of your posts over the years and can absolutely guarantee you that you've put way more thought into HP's magical system than Rowling ever did. With that kind of attitude, you can 'write 30,000+ words' about practically everything.

It's not a statement about Rowling's ingenuity and the quality of the canonical magic system, it's the statement about /your/ ingenuity and the quality of /your headcanon/.

That is to say, the magic in the original books isn't /bad/ -- it's pretty good and serves it's own purpose well. But, at least in my opinion, it's not as good as people make it out to be.

******* Sure, but it's not utter garbage the way some people make it out to be either. Part of what made Taure's magic canon document so interesting is that you see literally hundred of posts/fics basically bashing on Rowling's magic system, whether directly or indirectly, so the defense and breakdown of the canon magic system feels unique.

** There's a balance to strike, too. Canon magic is a mixture of both- you have your conceptual "Power of Love" stuff (which I also really like, it's a shame when you read fics that just scoff at the idea altogether) as well as your "Wingardium Leviosa is Swish and Flick, and make sure you're saying it correctly" and the idea that some wizards are literally more powerful than others- partially through natural ability, partially through study. So any fic that wants to delve into the Harry Potter magic system in detail needs to reconcile both aspects. I like conceptual magic, but I don't like it when it essentially turns into wishcraft- that is to say, you cannot make every single magical effect happen just because you wish hard enough that it does. And I love RPGs, but outside of stories that are pretty explicit LitRPGs, fanfiction that tries to abstract away the nuances of HP magic and purely systematize everything feels even worse.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/72wsc4yrwetp4yw/MHP%20Distribution%20Copy%20PDF%2022%20April%202018.pdf?dl=0][Taure's canon magic document]] is a great place to start, and you see their version of conceptual magic in action in Victoria Potter and in The One He Feared, linkffn(12713828) and linkffn(9778984).

HPMOR linkffn(5782108) gets a lot of flak, but it again merges the ideas. You get some "magic is controlled by levers and hard rules setup by Atlantis" like Harry/Hermione's experiments, or Horcruxes dealing with memories rather than souls. But you also get stuff like "acorns absorb sunlight to grow, so I can use them to make a potion that 'releases' that stored energy as a flash of light."

Outside of Harry Potter magic, conceptual systems are obviously very popular in general- stuff like Type Moon/FSN magic, or A Certain Magical Index. So basically any crossover/fic that lifts ideas from FSN (and there are quite a lot, of varying quality) leans Harry Potter magic in the conceptual direction as well.

There are also a ton of fics that bring up or use magic in an interesting way, many of which 'feel' decently canon compliant, when the goal isn't actually to delineate the strict rules. Magicks of the Arcane comes to mind, linkffn(8303194)
