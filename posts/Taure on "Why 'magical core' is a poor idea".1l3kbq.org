** I strongly dislike magical cores as a trope. I also wrote a story using this as an explanation for magical systems (as you can see in that thread). Why? Because it works (if treated correctly) and allows for a story to be about magic without unnecessary author fiat.

My question for everyone else who decries this trope is, what *is* the canon magic system's rules? Do you have a better set of rules? People in fact /do/ get tired doing magic in canon, so it /isn't/ unlimited. Muggles *do*, after all, run out of both physical energy and, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion][as recent science suggests]], *willpower*. Yes, willpower is a limited mental resource that is used up. Why should magic be any different?

An argument could be made for willpower running magic, but that wasn't the point being made here and that works against the poster's stated thesis.

Mechanically, if magic is "free," why don't wizards sell infinite water to Africa or the Middle East, enchant items forever for money to the point /they/ are free, or solve the energy crisis (which still exists in the magical world) in any of a thousand ways? It would only take *one* Muggle-born with a plane ticket to break the world with unlimited magic faster than anyone could cover it up. Hell, that would make a great story right there, but no one writes it.

Why? Because most people assume things that are even more fuzzy than magical cores. They assume limits, just not well expressed ones. There are limits to all things, and not putting firm limits on magic makes for "I shot you! No I shot you first!" combat and a really questionable story world, one with huge logical gaps (like canon had).

I'd like to think a story /with/ magic could also be /about/ magic, not just stereotyped character tropes everyone is familiar with in a slightly different world. So please, PLEASE, someone come up with a better idea than magical cores! So far, no one has.

Except, possibly, in MoR, which has only recently started being about magic again. Also, MoR has almost sci-fi level of details in its system, such that I assume most people don't get it, though it is very good for VERY spoiler reasons (and ones related to futurism topics), soooo...yeah. Nothing else.

At least, nothing good enough that every "magical cores" story is always instantly met with "why didn't you use X?" And don't think people wouldn't do that, if it existed. And you can't just say "it is mysterious!" Anyone with basic scientific knowledge (coughhermionecough) would tear that apart in a week. MoR /clearly/ shows that issue, any other problems it has aside.

For various reasons (like, it is DLP), I refuse to debate this post point by point, but my conclusion is that this was not a well constructed argument against this trope. Our friendly neighborhood OP linked to my fan forum (and on DLP... oh boy, thanks, I think) so I don't believe I need to say more specifically in defense of the idea.

It really is the worst magical system around. Except for almost all the others. It is also much better than no system at all.

*** Honestly people, it's been 15 years. We've done this before. There is no one single 'system' that works perfectly with HP magic because JKR didn't bloody write it that way. She's a story-teller, not a master world-builder. Just pick the system that makes the most sense to *you*.

If magical cores is your thing, more power to you.

I've always imagined magic to be rather like a muscle. One can exercise and strengthen it, sometimes exhausting oneself in the process if one pushes too hard, but there's never really a point where the muscle can't be used.

If you think about magic this way, inherited strength, skill, training, and knowledge can all come into play when determining how 'strong' a wizard is.

**** I think that is one reason people like making world-building fanfic in the HP 'verse. It is wide open. The best fanfic (in my opinion) is always "stories of the gaps," filling in things the original authors weren't interested in or didn't cover. Close second is usually pure flights of fancy into AU land.

The worst (in my opinion) are usually straight character pieces set in the strict canon rules and timeline, often ignoring magic entirely. Second worst is usually extension pieces that try to simply continue the stories ("Albus Severus Potter," /facepalm/).

Your suggested system works well, but needs strong themes and new names. It also means the more buff caster has an advantage, something that seems to be sticking point with a lot of people. But it does define areas that can be hard limits to usage. I have always liked limited magical systems, like Charles Stross' /The Family Trade/ series. Small powers, very hard limits, big effects.

*** Can you cite an example from the books when a person gets tired from casting magic?

(To preempt the most common example: Harry becoming exhausted in PoA during Dementor practice was exactly that - the effects of Dementor exposure. On all other occasions when he has cast a Patronus he has not felt any of those effects).

There are many ways to limit magic without making it quantifiable.

The most obvious is that which the books give: the other side has magic too. Why doesn't a single wizard go and create havoc in the Muggle world? Because the other wizards would stop him. And when the other wizards can't stop him, then we have Voldemort.

Another limit to magic which the books give: time and space matter in magic. A wizard can only effect his immediate surroundings, but within those surroundings he can do basically anything. A wizard can't summon the moon because it's too far away, and too big to cast a spell on all at once - not because he lacks the requisite energy.

A third limit is motivation. There are lots of things wizards could do but don't for a very simple reason: they have no reason to want to.

A fourth limit is skill. Magic is hard: the majority of Ministry workers can't competently cast the magic that you study for OWL levels. The average wizard can't do whatever he likes because he lacks the knowledge and skill. He isn't good enough at transfiguration to make his own clothes, he isn't good enough at charms to turn every room of his house into a mansion, he isn't good enough at potions to make himself handsome and youthful and thin. He probably has one or two specialist skills that he is competent at, which he does in exchange for gold in order to purchase those other services.

A final limit are the rules of magical theory like Gamp's Five Exceptions.

None of those limits require magic to be limited in quantity or amount.

**** The problem with your limits is that they aren't enough of a limit assuming protagonists not lacking in imagination and ambition.

2 and 4: being able to do anything one wants within a dozen meters of self, only limited by own "skill" would already mean that most smart magicals would be on the power levels of Green Lantern who is pretty overpowered as super-heroes go. A confrontation between a few such individuals going all out would be of earth shaking proportions.

Motivation isn't an established canon limit. First, in general, either characters have similar motivations to us, or most of us wouldn't care to read about them. It's a pretty well established fact that people mostly care about people only. No one reads about aliens unless said aliens are extremely people-like. Motivation is one of the central aspects of humanity. Second - HP canon already establishes that wizards are motivated exactly as we all are. Ambition for personal influence, power, wealth and society standing are all with plenty of examples in the books.

Your third and fourth "limits" are strongly related and while they are sort of established in books there is the problem that to most of us this makes no sense whatsoever. It's mind boggling that magicals complain about schoolwork and studying magic. The closest to "hard" disciplines we can imagine is what we have in the real world right now - hard sciences, medicine, higher levels of math, applied computer sciences... We can understand why most people don't spend their lives mastering many of these - they are not very useful practically to a single person. A ph.d in any of these will still be almost Average Joe in our society because getting practical utility out of all that knowledge usually takes combined efforts of hundreds of people and shit-tons of resources.

By contrast magic in canon establishes well that an equivalent in Ph.D knowledge in wizarding world directly translates to personal power and ability that are practical and very useful in every day situations. "They are lazy and non-motivated" doesn't cut it as explanation why a large population that can reach such powers within several decades of hard work doesn't routinely produce gods.

Finally for your first one - Just the fact that canon establishes that wizards can't easily locate each other already means that "other side has magic" is not enough of a limit. An imaginative person with the power of a localized diety can achieve a lot in a few hours of staying hidden. Also relying on potential confrontation as limits only really works if you are describing a setting in a perpetual Cold War - and that can only keep readers interested for so long without confrontations actually taking place - at which point this isn't a limit any longer.

One of the problems with HP as a setting is that canon has established such a wide variety of what magic is capable of without establishing any meaningful limits that it lends itself too easily to solutions like "and suddenly X discovered he can yyy" where 'yyy' can be thousands of epic superpowers.

If anyone could, the 'system' wouldn't be flawed and there wouldn't be any grounds for this discussion. But just because something isn't in canon, that doesn't necessarily invalidate the theory, nor does it mean it NEEDS to be invalidated.

While your loyalty to a subject matter that's riddled with holes, contradictions, and logical conundrums is admirable, it's just a little bit futile.

****** Not really. I said, perhaps overly sarcastically, that people get tired doing magic in the stories. I intended that to imply that they got tired /of doing/ magic as well, even in situations where it would be advantageous to keep using it.

Obviously all examples in canon where people really try to push themselves also have physical elements to them as well, because that was what JKR was using for dramatic effect instead of a well worked out and limited magical system.

So I'm not suggesting magical exhaustion is canon, just that for whatever reason in the stories even advanced students and adults don't use magic all the time and will dramatically taper off use of it when getting physically exhausted. Sometimes fanfic authors take this to mean (as you do) that wizards aren't very smart, or that they have limited motivation. I'm simply suggesting that they stop using it sometimes, for whatever reason. That's all that single sentence meant.

******** u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:

#+end_quote

No, I am not. I'm talking about something very specific here: that magic isn't used over and over again without limit in canon and also not in the vast majority of fanfic. This implies a limited system, whether the author consciously adopts one or not.

I'm not attempting to make a plea to canon to make this point. Exhaustion, magical or otherwise, wasn't ever one of my main points in my first post in this thread. It was instead about why strong stories /about magic/ need an actual worked out system (whether stated explicitly or not) for how magic really functions, with interesting limits included. This was poorly represented in my original post in a single sentence suggestive of something else, a flaw I clarified in the second post after that weakness was pointed out.

Any perceived backpeddling you sense is from your own interpretation of my main thesis. Your simply saying that's what's going on here doesn't make it true.

To further clarify my original point from previous material, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/127267/80220856/2/#93262829][see my own fan forum post]], where I state one of my reasons for using magical cores and my opinion of physical exhaustion as a canon interpretation. This reading of canon is something I am still unsure of and don't take a firm stance on. As I am not JKR, this is permitted by law. I said two specific things there concerning exhaustion of various sorts:

#+begin_quote
  I tried to explain magical exhaustion (another fanon thing) realistically, [and] carefully avoided magical potions that instantly restore power and other such silliness. I also made it something that can be approached by rudimentary scientific analysis.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  In canon, I think physical exhaustion is the closest thing to how limits of magical power work. Use too much magic, get tired physically.
#+end_quote

I'll restate my original point even stronger: canon doesn't show people using magic like it is unlimited and effortless. They don't cast powerful spells every waking minute, which is what any of a million lazy minmaxing CoD players or power gaming nerds would do. It /also/ doesn't say "Harry was tired from all that exhausting magic he had done all day." This is an unclear point in canon because the original stories *weren't about magic*.

That is why when writing fanfic (or original fiction) with magic as a primary focus, something needs to be added to the generic character driven plot mix. That something is a coherent magical system.

****** Magical exhaustion is never mentioned, however physical and (perhaps more importantly) mental exhaustion is mentioned. Specifically Harry doing Occlumency practice. The stress of it wears him down and makes him feel drained mentally and physically.

--------------

Making the argument of draining: the Dementors "drain" a wizard of his or her power after a long enough time, supposedly. I seem to remember the books saying that Grindelwald is unable to do magic any longer, due to his prolonged imprisonment.

However, like Occlumency, this likely has more to do with severe and prolonged mental stress than it does with any loss of magical "core" or what not.

--------------

Simply put: prolonged stress and mental strain can make it difficult to use magic.

Whether due to dementors or due to being put through the ringer by magical attack, mental strain seems to diminish magical ability. I would imagine that after a long day of hard and complex magic, one may have difficulty even levitating a chamber pot.

As you use magic, the ball depletes, leaving you drained and tired, requiring rest and not using magic for a while to 'recharge'. The larger your core, the more magically powerful you are and the longer/harder you can fight, but the greater your state of 'magical exhaustion' and the longer you have to rest when you wear yourself out.
