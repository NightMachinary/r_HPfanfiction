Romione preferred. I've read one by Zeitgeist that was really cool, and Muffiliato's Stricken Lament too, but they heavily promote the uber-awesomeness of Harry way too much for my liking.

I'm wondering if there are any out there more in favour of Ron, or at least tone down how "hot" Harry is a bit? XD. Thanks in advance.
