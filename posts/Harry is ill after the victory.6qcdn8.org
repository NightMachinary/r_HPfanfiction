It may be an uncureable disease, it may be asthma after the fire in the Room of Requirement, it may be that Harry just feels very bad (physically).

That sort of things. Have read a fic where Harry goes in hiding after the victory and it's lately discovered that he had a cancer.

Good thing it's a muggle illness and can be cured relatively easily. Never got the point of weakening and worsening Magic for a cheap plot device. I would rather Harry be haunted by his past or have a new threat on the horizon.

*** Honestly curious, but what makes you thing that cancer could be that easily dismissed in canon? Or that it couldn't be some sort of magical version of cancer, in the case our muggle version is that easily cured by magic

**** Rowling said that Magic has easier/more control over mundane. She said this in a section of Pottermore called diseases and Illnesses. Cancer is caused by rapid cell division of abnormal cells that destroy body tissue. The reason we can't cure it solely with radiation is because it would destroy normal cells as well, but Magic is based on the will of the user and the specific intent of the spell, if your intent is to get rid of those bad cells, it will get rid of those bad cells and only those.

As for 'Magical Cancer' Rowling did say that there were Magical Illnesses and Diseases that could occur, as well as there being Several Curses that have long term detrimental effects on the user, however I'm pretty sure that even those things can be cured (Madame Pomfrey is capable of regrowing MAGICALLY vanished bones).

***** Just a random idea of how there could be magical cancer. Cancer cells work by overriding the cells machinery to produce more cells and not respond to death signals. So what if the cancer could someway override the magic in a way that would prevent it from easily being vanished away. That gets into the territory of mixing magic with science and where exactly a wizards control of their magic resides.

** Yeah, I think I know the fic you are talking about. Harry has an uncurable disease, and then he takes Snape to his house to fix it. Don't remember any more details; I think I quit it after a few chapters. Hope this helps.

** if you accept crossovers here's one. linkffn(10579831)

Crossed with Katekyo Hitman Reborn. The removal of the horcrux is causing Harry's Soul to pour out.

I loved the concept but it hasn't updated in a while.
