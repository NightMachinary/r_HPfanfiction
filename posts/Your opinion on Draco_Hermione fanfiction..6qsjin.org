I seem to have a lot of issues trying to locate a decent fic; it literally takes me loads of time to find one even half-way interesting. What intrigues you about the pairing? What are your favorite themes?

I tend to really go for a serious, intelligent, moody Draco. I seem to always find fics with Draco being almost giddy and lovey dovey which seems so incredibly wrong for him. I like situations where the relationship builds over time, even if it gets lusty in the meantime, the trust and mutual respect comes later. There was an amazing website, I think Silver was in the title, anyway, I miss it terribly and I have lost all my favorite stories and have not been able to find any yet that have caught me :(

I love angsty fics, I like when authors try to really stay true to the characters while venturing into some forbidden territory.

What do you like? Are there any stories you can recommend?


** I see only two credible scenarios for them to get together:

- Complete AU where Draco grew up in a very different environment and was not that Canon racist. (A time traveling Draco doing things differently also counts)

- Years after DH, Draco did something truly EXTRAORDINARY for Hermione, while she and Ron went different ways. (Ron the abuser doesn't count)

What I really want to read is an AU Dramione teaching Canon Draco some good lessons.

** Its almost insulting if an author uses the canon characters. Draco is a terrorist sympathizer and later in the books even becomes a full-blown terrorist who has performed several terrorist acts in the wake of planning, preparing and assisting in the assassination of Dumbledore. There is just no way Hermione would even consider getting to know this person, let alone dating him.

As someone already said, there are only two ways for this to work. Either Draco is placed into the story in an entirely different way. Maybe he becomes a Gryffindor. Maybe he soon learns a lesson about the non-discriminatory way magic works.

Or he learns these lessons later, after the war.

Either way, these lessons have to completely turn around his worldview - 180 degree. They have to be hurtful, hard to swallow and leave him confused and without anchor. Then, and just then, can I see Draco be somewhat potential boyfriend material for Hermione. She would still have to forget his bullying, hate, him wishing nothing less than rape, torture and murder upon her for nothing but her origins.

I'm not sure if I ever read a story in which that even remotely worked, but I'm looking through my bookmarks. Most Draco / Hermione fics are wish-fulfillment, in which the author gets to imagine himself/herself kissing +Draco or Hermione+ Tom Felton or Emma Watson, so the pickings are really meager.

*** I'd only read a Hermione/Draco fic these days if it was /completely in-character/. That would make for a fic that is vastly more difficult to write than the ones that exist.

And you've hit the nail on the head as to why:

Basically, whoever is writing it would either have to be in the top percentile of writers period -- not just fanfic writers -- to make a genuine piece of shit magical!Nazi Youth into a sympathetic and plausible romantic lead for Hermione ...

Oooooor they'd have to be writing some incredibly disturbing dark romance that involves Stockholm and/or Lima Syndrome. (These fics actually aren't that uncommon with this pairing, and all of them are, just as it sounds, rape-filled trash that romanticizes abusive assholes.)

** The number one reason why people like Draco/Hermione is the movies and the actor/actress. Anyone who read the books will figure in less than a minute that they cannot be togther, they hate each other and are incompatible. Same for Harry/Draco btw.

Bad boy appeal is also a *huge* factor. The redeemed type is extremely popular in romance for a reason: someone being so into you that they actually change themselves for the better.

Sure, I've never read a fully believable Hermione/Draco pairing yet (they always read at least mildly OOC), but it could work. Theoretically.

**** Except that Draco isnt a bad boy... He mostly annoyed the golden trio. Granted, he tried to kill Dumbledore but only because his family was in danger.

** I really enjoy reading post DH focused Draco fics, given that there's a ton of potential for interesting character development. And Dramione can fit into that, although too often, dramione fics end up portraying him as some kind of rebellious sexy bad boy, which is just dumb.

I remember totally adoring linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation]]) but it's Neville/Hermione/Draco.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** I never shipped Dramione until I read an interview with JK Rowling where she said that once, she'd thought about pairing Draco with Hermione after redeeming him. This was a long time ago so maybe I'm wrong but this set the gears turning in my head and I couldn't get them to stop, and six years later I'm still writing fanfiction.

I've read my fair share of Dramione and a lot of it in terms of quality and in-characterness are lacking. This is just my opinion, I don't want to sound too harsh. If you're looking for recommendations I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. I've written dark Dramione before but currently am working on a redemptive fic for Draco which contains a slow build up and romance.

This is the first one, which is a set up for the sequel. It deals with canon Draco and Hermione at the height of Umbridge's control at Hogwarts.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10265085/1/Power-and-Control]]

The sequel deals with Draco now being a freshly joined Death Eater and facing his assassination of Dumbledore task, realizing he doesn't believe in Voldemort anymore, and that he can't do it. He is remorseful of what he did in the first fic and wants to apologize. Hermione is naturally suspicious and doesn't trust him, but things develop from there. Lots of angst.

*** Thank you for all the responses. Draco, to me, wasn't exactly a bad guy at all. He seemed to be a very complex character with so much more going on. My heart broke for him knowing his internal struggle. He had so much potential to be so much more which is why I like this shipping.

Both characters are brilliant, and Draco was coming to terms with his upbringing and was have reservations in the end. It's chink in his armor.

The way you describe your stories is exactly what I look for and it is so hard to find. This is my favorite shipping of all time, but I'm extremely picky about it. Thank you for introducing me to your writing. I will be following up with you and you may have a loyal follower now!

(Sorry for the super late response! Still totally new to reddit and did not know how it worked... still figuring it out)
