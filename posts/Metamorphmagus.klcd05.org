*Meta*: comprehensive, encompassing

*+ Morph*: change

+ *Magus*: magic user (plural is /magi/)

= *Metamorphmagus*

How hard is that?

I swear to the deity of your choice, every time I see "metamorphagus" I get a vision of Mister Snuffleupagus. If your story is not intended to be a crossover with Sesame Street, then you need all three parts.

(Somebody please write me a crossover with Sesame Street.)


** Oscar the Grouch teaches potions and /likes/ the smell. He deducts points from all houses equally, just because he enjoys doing it.

Bert finds the moving staircases and inadequate safety precautions (detention in the Forbidden Forest with an unknown unicorn killer and an adult who isn't allowed to use magic?) to be ridiculous to the point where it stresses him out. Ernie just giggles and rolls with it.

Abby Kadabby breaks all five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and freaks Professor McGonagall out. Professor Dumbledore just smiles and awards fifty points to Hooper's Store.

*** Every pureblood who meets Abby Cadabby for the first time freaks out with the introduction, who would name a kid after the killing curse?

People keep trying to explain to Count Von Count that he's not a real vampire.

Cookie Monster becomes great friends with the house elves. Cookies keep showing up everywhere.

Also, Hagrid and Big Bird get along great because they're both stuck in a world full of tiny creatures.

*** There's a reason the only one we know of goes solely by a name that rhymes with Honks - 'Tonks'. :D

** For some reason, I always read it in my head as “metamorphagus,” like I inexplicably read animagus as “animangus.” Once I took a second to actually look at the words, I was like oh shit, okay. I know metamorphagus doesn't actually make sense, but it just rolls off the tongue a tiny bit better.

** I can /defiantly/ understand some spelling errors but spelling terms and names wrong (especially persistently) is just indefensible.

Thank f deity of your choice, there is no one named Alliser Thorne in HP. The worst mangled name in fanfiction history by miles.

*** Thorne can't even make the top five most misspelled names in a fandom that includes any member of the Targaryen family.
