** It's a guilty pleasure of mine too.

A few of my favorites that come under powerful harry (None of these really deal too heavily into pairings other than the last which does a bit and includes both your preferences):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5234952/1/Mage-Harry][Mage harry]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010/1/The-Power][The Power]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4071961/1/4-in-1][4 in 1]]

Sharingan Harry books [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4188012/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-One-A-New-Bloodline][1]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4570456/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-Two-Dueling-Serpents][2]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5359736/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-Three-A-Grim-Life][3]] and the unfortunately incomplete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6103509/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-Four-Unexpected-Turns][4]]. While the series is incomplete and it doesn't seem likely to continue, I quite enjoyed it, though I didn't feel up to reading after book 3, so maybe it's just as well it's incomplete. Slight xover with Naruto, though the only thing from Naruto in it is Harry's eyes/powers from those eyes, which if I'm not mistaken are just like Sasku's. Also some powers may cross over with other people, especially during a tournament (Not triwizard), but used by magical means. I'm not sure on this last bit though, as I didn't read too many of the naruto mangas (nor did I watch too many of the shows). Also, unlike other super harry books, and what I really like about this series, while voldie seems as weak as usual, there are new people, enemies and allies both, at least almost as strong as super harry.

And the one I probably like the most in the super powered category, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day][DOOMDay]] - where Harry Potter relives the day that the Ministry Six went to the Department of Mysteries to rescue Sirus over and over again; repeating the day (But allowed to change things of course) for decades-centuries (As far as I remember, the author never mentions just how long it is, but it's an extremely long time), spending much of it training/learning. Obviously by the end of it he becomes almost godlike in magical power, knowledge and skill. Parings: HP and damned near every female in hogwarts near his year, but it's a small part of the overall story. As most only know him for the single day after all.

** It's not H/Hr or H/L, but one of the classic older stories of this type is Lorddwar's Harry/Tonks piece [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Harry Potter and the Summer of Change]]. It's complete, which is a plus.

If you have a lot of time to kill (and by that, I mean a /lot/--the story is 1.2M+ words and somehow feels even longer yet), then Bexis1's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter & the Fifth Element]] might be to your liking. Harry's super-ultra-mega and he pairs with Hermione (eventually). I don't remember if there's any lordship stuff (I haven't tried reading it in years), but it might be to your liking.

nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] trilogy has a ridiculously powerful Harry who hooks up with Luna, Hermione, and most everyone else. (And it happens to be one of the funniest stories I've ever encountered.)
