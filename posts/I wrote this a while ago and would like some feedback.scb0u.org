** Looks good. Didn't have time to go through the whole thing, so I can't critique content much. Some things I will nitpick:

--------------

You use em dashes and semi-colons A LOT. There is nothing wrong with using them, but I find that using them in excess tends to detract from a positive reading experience. Aesthetically, dashes break up the text further.

Semi-colons just look unattractive, especially in the amount you're using. They can easily be broken up into separate sentences. As Vonnegut puts it, "Semi-colons are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college."

--------------

#+begin_quote
  watched as the words sunk in
#+end_quote

Is vague and cliched.

#+begin_quote
  "Honestly", he added with a hint of a smirk.
#+end_quote

Comma goes inside.

#+begin_quote
  Harry narrowed his eyes at the boy beside him
#+end_quote

Seems cliched. I'm sure you can describe this in a more creative manner.

#+begin_quote
  long description of Neville's appearance
#+end_quote

This feels a bit... forced.

#+begin_quote
  The boys, ne young men,
#+end_quote

Typo.

#+begin_quote
  a branch of the -- literally -- weeping willow nearby -- the squid sure had some odd sleeping habits,
#+end_quote

These dashes... ugh.

#+begin_quote
  He turned around, his mouth opening to say just that, when Neville threw his arm around Harry's neck and hastily covered his mouth to prevent any sounds from escaping. Harry made a choking noise at the back of his throat and, thoroughly bewildered, he could only watch with wide eyes as Neville pulled him...
#+end_quote

Again, this doesn't read very naturally. It seems a bit... detached if I must say, especially for a third person narration. Making a choking noise is very passive and of much less consequence than say, describing the actual feeling from choking. There's a lot of this telling and not showing. Same goes for this "only watch" part. It makes Harry (and the reader) like an observer. There's no immersive action.

--------------

I didn't get through the whole story, but I will say the biggest thing is the tellling, which prevents reader immersion. The punctuation (dialogue comma format + semi-colon and dash usage) are secondary.
