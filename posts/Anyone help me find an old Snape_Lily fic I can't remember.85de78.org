It's a time travel fic where Snape returns to his younger self and tries to make things right. I know there's a lot of fics like that, which may be why I haven't been able to find this specific one.

In it, he makes Wolfsbane and shoves it down Lupins throat. Such kindness makes Lily suspicious so she 'tests' him by bringing Lupin nearby and when Snape flinches away slightly Snape passes the test and Lily thinks 'yeah he's changed but still definitely Severus'. Later in the fic, some of the good guys get captured by Voldemort, so Snape meets with the Dark Lord face to face, and lies to his face, bluffing his way out with his insight into Riddle. Shortly after that, there's another encounter with Voldemort, and Snape stays and fights to let the others run. Then the Ministry and Prophet say Snape is a Dark Wizard, even though he's fighting Death Eaters and Lily and the gang knows the truth.

I read this over a year ago and have spent hours through the months looking on and off through hundreds of fics and can't find it.

Does anyone know the fic I'm talking about? If so I'd be most grateful if you could clue me in. Thanks you for reading this either way.


** Would love to see that fic too. Not a big shipper of Snily, but sounds interesting.

** Your details aren't ringing any bells but this used to be my favorite fic type so I can give it a shot. Do you remember which house Severus was in? Was James Potter his friend or mercilessly bashed? Notable Snape relives his life fics are:

linkffn(the moment it began by sindie)

linkffn(second start by 8thweasleykid)

linkffn(his greatest wish by andromedamarine)

linkffn(come once again and love me)

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE
