*** The most remotely negative thing I've read of Tonks in any fanfiction was one where everyone thought Lupin was the better fighter when arguing who should stay at the Battle of Hogwarts and who should look after Teddy. An assessment I disagreed with since Lupin might have more life experience and book smarts but he wasn't a professionally trained Auror, whereas Tonks was able to earn Mad-Eye's approval despite her demeanor. Her job probably gave her just as much field experience. Tonks should be at least equal to Lupin if not stronger.

But aside from that I've only ever seen her depicted as a competent character.

**** Tonks was the better fighter but I do think it was an odd choice for her to go into battle when she was 1-month postpartum. I suppose the easy answer is that witches have come up with a way to recover quickly, but that always struck me as JKR forcing an orphan character into the next generation.

The marriage was a mistake, Remus breaking his vows was unforgivable (especially considering the fact that a seventeen year old virgin was the one who talked sense into him), but taking him back after that episode was the point which made canon Tonks an idiot.

***** I can't believe I'm defending her, but she was in love, she wanted that marriage (I agree it was far to early for them to get married), and she thought her child needed a father. Imagine Teddy is a werewolf, Remus is the one who would know what that means. Anyway, a child needs a father. In reality there are many parents who, out of spite and anger, forbid their children to see either their mother or their father. That's far worse than forgiving someone, I think. I'm not saying what Remus did was a good thing, but that whole relationship was rushed, and his actions were a consequence of this. I'd be terrified if I were him. But as I've said, that's just my opinion. I'm trying to understand both characters.

Given how Lupin treated Harry over the years, any child would be better off without him in the proximity. Not only didn't he gave a single fuck if it was in any way inconvenient, trying to shame a child with his murdered parents' memory, he was being a big hypocrite about it. That is probably one of the lowest moment in the series.

******* it's pretty obvious I completely disagree. But to each their own. Harry isn't his son, so I personally don't see why Lupin should become his father. I don't see why you say he didn't care about Harry. He didn't write to him after PoA, but knowing him, I bet he thought Harry would prefer Sirius and thus wanted to let them bond. As someone who has a strong fear of rejection, I can tell you that such people are hesitant to be the first to reach out. He should have, but he didn't. Also, he wasn't trying to hshame Harry, he was trying to make him understand how risky it was to sneek into Hogsmeade with Sirius out there. I absolutely love that scene, and remember that Harry listened to him and this was the best way to make him understand how important his safety is. You might as well say Harry had no right to yell at Lupin like that because Harry is just a teenager and Lupin isn't his brother or uncle, or that it was none of Harry's business, he could have just said no and that's all. And Lupin was completely right about Harry's actions- he risked his own safety to go to a sweet shop. Lupin also has his issues, like any other adult, but this doesn't mean he shouldn't have children. As for having a child, Tonks is also responsible here, not only Lupin. She isn't just a victim. She should hve used preventative means as wel. It isn't just a man's responsibility. I think you just really don't like Lupin,lol.

******** I'm not complaining that he told Harry about the dangers of sneaking to Hogsmeade, I'm complaining about the fact that he brought up his parents' memory to shame Harry while telling absolutely no one about Sirius animagus form or his knowledge of the secret passages, even after multiple break ins. That is, without exaggeration, the most hypocritical moment of the entire series.

Tonks obviously had no issues with having a child, even if it's the stupid thing to do during the war. Whereas Lupin obviously didn't want to father one, which leaves it sorely his fault for knocking her up. AND, any fucking marital vow includes a "in good as in bad times" part, so he not only fathered a child despite having objections, which already is an arsehole thing to do, no he took things further and broke his vows within three months of marriage. He might have crawled back, but broken trust cannot ever fully heal and fucked up the marriage either way.

********* I think the fact he didn't tell anyone about Sirius being animagus was the reason why he got so angry in that scene and brought up Harry's parents. He was angry with himself, and he admits as much, and that's more than some people in reality manage to do. As for having a child, I don't see how it's his responsibility to prevent this if he doesn't want to be a father. Then it just means they have different priorities, and can't be in a relationship at all. And broken trust can be repaired. It takes far more strength to repair what's broken than to just say it's over. Then, ten years from now, you tell your child that you broke off the relationship with his father because you were too hurt and too angry. Lupin didn't think straight when he left. He didn't think that his condition might actually be an obstacle for the trio and that they wouldn't actually take him with them for this reason. He wouldn't have acted the way he did in that scene if he had planned to leave Tonks for good. It was fear and guilt that made him leave, and I don't think it was only because of the pregnancy. It's Harry's point of view, so we don't know anything. There are men who permanently leave their wives for their mistresses or because their children have a disability, these are far worse things in my opinion, and I dispise these men, because they never come back. The fact Lupin left adds to his complex character, I think, showing he isn't just that nice teacher from Poa. He is definitely more interesting than Arthur anyway. But to each their own, I guess.

It's his sperm that gets Tonks pregnant, not some kind of miraculous conception. If he doesn't want children then it's his responsibility to ensure that he keeps his seed away from an unprotected woman. I mean, if I don't want a child, it's my job to make sure that she doesn't get pregnant, because otherwise I'm the one who has to pay child support, even if I didn't want a child.

Seriously, this might be the dumbest argument I've ever had on Reddit and I just read an argument where a person claimed that Churchill and Thatcher were in fact fascists and worse than two dictators of their choice.

*********** But if one person wants a child and another doesn't, it means they have a disagreement there. What if Tonks really wants a child? Then she should marry someone who has the same priorities. It's not about preventative measures, but about different attitude towards things. They had to agree on this before marriage, then. She doesn't have a proble with having a child in the middle of a war, he does.People discuss children when they marry. t And anyway, this was a plot device.

But if Lupin is that adamant, he should actually be consequent and ensure that he does, in fact, not knock up someone. Be it through the use of a condom, cutting the pipeline or some form of magic.

************* But the problem is that we don't actually know what he thought. He seems happy when his son is born, which suggests leaving Tonks was a desperate action caused by something we don't know, likely a combination of things. He even says he regrets marrying her, even though he wanted this. H is at the end of his tether. He is scared, and even those who aren't in his situation are often terrified at the prospect of being a parent, but it passes. He pulls himself together eventually. I just never saw forgiveness as weakness of a character. If anything, this series proves it's a strength. But you obviously have a different view. All characters in that series make mistakes, like real people.

******* She can freely alter the tissue of her nose. The ability to freely alter body tissue by adding layers of bone or cartilage is just the logical conclusion. It basically gives her the potential to create biological spaced armour or reinforce an area of her body where receiving hits is likely. It wouldn't do much against dark magic, but in a bar brawl or melee combat it would give her a distinctive edge.

And given that she can rearrange tissue, there should be improvements to self healing since she should be able to regrow new tissue underneath the damaged layers.

******** I'm not so sure. If transfiguration was able to heal that effectively, you'd think you'd be able to transfigure yourself into a younger version of yourself and have eternal youth. That clearly is not the case, so there appears to be a limit to the use of transfiguration to rejuvenate. That said, we're also told that healers use transfiguration, so transfiguration /can/ be used to heal. It's just that we don't know where the limit is.

** My headcanon is that her clumsiness is a side-effect of her metamorphmagus abilities. It comes down to proprioception---the awareness of where one's own body parts are and how to move them. Normally, it's instinctive, but for a metamorphagus, it requires some amount of conscious attention. So, for example, she can run just fine, but if she tries running while casting spells, she is liable to trip over her own feet.

The good news is that most adult wizard combat doesn't actually involve things like running while casting, so it's not a major liability most of the time. (See, for example, the duel between Molly and Bellatrix.) Between her metamorphmagus ability and her magical skill, Tonks had no trouble making auror.
