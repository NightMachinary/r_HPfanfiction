** Good luck with that - the vast majority of fics have Harry criticise Dumbledore for /not/ turning him into a child soldier. Only one I'm aware of that meets your request is:

**** And yet by following Dumbedore's instructions to a T, Harry was able to survive. Funny, that...

#+begin_quote
  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

  “And you knew this? You knew -- all along?”

  “I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.

Exactly. He'd been planning around Harry having to die for at least a year or two, but more likely for over a decade. That particular scene shows that he didn't /want/ Harry to die, but believed it was necessary to save the world from Riddle.

** I've been getting really into the ‘Of a Linear Circle' series by flamethrower. It's very long and very well-written. It's more in the vein of someone being upset that Dumbledore is setting Harry up to be sacrificed for ‘the greater good' and deciding to do something about it than any sort of post-DH PTSD though.

** THANK YOU! Even in canon, Harry brushes off Quirrell's face melting under his hands pretty fucking easily for being 11-goddamn-years-old. I doubt that even as an adult I'd be able to get past something like that without quite a bit of therapy, but everyone's like "Way to go, Harry! Now back to your abusive home, see you in September!"

I ring that bell pretty often in my fic, including this very on-the-nose passage -

#+begin_quote
  The truth was, Sam was beginning to work through his grief. The rage and the utter hatred he felt for Norm and Diane's murderers was as strong as ever, no doubt. But his fear and powerlessness diminished with the increased distance from London, from Great Britain, and that made the actual real-life repercussions of what he and Harry were going to do hard to ignore.

  '/I'm basically crafting and molding Harry into a child soldier,'/ he thought, not for the first time. A despicable thing, that he used to see documentary specials about on the BBC and condemn. '/What would Norm and Diane say if they were here?'/

  "Norm would call me an unfeeling bastard, and Diane would murder me with her bare hands," he said aloud, a rueful smile on his lips. They weren't here, though, they were dead. The way his friends had been killed was unforgivable. But if the only path to vengeance lies in forcing a damaged 13-year old to graduate from 'victim of unfortunate circumstance' to 'intentional mass murderer', perhaps revenge may not be the answer.
#+end_quote

Context being that Harry's adoptive parents are murdered after his 2nd year, and their best friend essentially grooms him into being a murder-machine to take revenge; naturally, this has all the predictable consequences you might imagine (in that it fucks Harry up immensely).

The ending is a bit abrupt, and doesnt cover much of the aftermath, but I think you might still enjoy it.
