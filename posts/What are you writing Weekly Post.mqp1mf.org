** I'm working on the start of a series of one shots involving Harry taking different girls to the Yule Ball, which in canon, is probably Harry and Ron at their absolute worst.

I don't like Ron bashing so it's nice to have a Yule Ball fic where he doesn't end up a tremendous prat.

Still needs a lot of work but I'm liking the mannerisms I have so far.

** I'm working on an outline for a long fic set just after the first task, where everyone is looking for dates for the Yule ball. Frustrated Harry asks Ron to go with him. They actually have a lot of fun together. The year goes on in as they hang out. After the term Harry asks Ron if he'd like to see a movie, and they manage to convince Arthur to accompany them as protection. During the movie Ron's hand slowly grabs Harry's and Harry magic goes nuts. After the situation is resolved Arthur talks to Harry about what happened. Plenty more happens after this.

Basically Harry is bisexual but has no concept of what he's feeling because of his upbringing by Dursley's. He just has feelings for Ron he doesn't understand is romantic/sexual. So when Ron places his hand in Harry's (because Ron is bi as well) he panics and his magic lashes out. Arthur clearly knows what going on because he isn't stupid and he talks to Harry personally to see if he can help Harry work it out. He helps Harry realize what he's feeling and it's like the light is finally on in his head. Harry/Ron romance ensues.

I want Snape to be more friendly with Harry as another mentor. I also want more queer characters and pairings just to have some fun. Gay/bi/trans and so on. I have a lot more plans and ideas for this fic, but this is what I can describe right now.

It will be called Decisions: A Harry Potter Story.

** A prequel to my crack fic, it's called Bored Outer God: Through the Ages. And it's about what the titular Bored Outer God has been up to from 180 A.D. To October 31st 1981. It's a Harry Potter/Cthulhu Mythos crossover.

** I finally updated another chapter of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23957842/chapters/57621055][The Might of the Architect]], my founders era adventure fic focusing on two original students at Hogwarts a few decades after it's founding. This week, Peeves is... Born? Created? Arrives?

Updates for that have been slowing down, because I've finally decided to write a sequel to what's probably my better known fic here, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19475812/chapters/46359493][This Calls For A Toast So Pour The Champagne]]. The original is a Dudley Dursley/Cho Chang fic, featuring a chance encounter at Harry's wedding leading to an accidental pregnancy and a lot of soul searching on Dudley's part. The sequel (s? I'm tentatively thinking it may be a trilogy) are shorter, lighter, and take place after the epilogue as the characters are creeping into their thirties. It's been a lot of fun to get back to the same characters again after so many years!

** Not that I'm really getting anywhere (writer's block is a bitch and so is my muse for striking while at work but leaving as soon as I boot up the ol' laptop!) But I'm working on a story where Harry has the attention of the Morrigan. The old Celtic Goddess of War and Death, as the aura of death follows Harry wherever he goes.

Throughout his childhood he is accompanied by a Raven that, no matter what Vernon tries, sticks with him and often brings him magical trinkets and books from an unknkown friend.

By the time he reaches eleven, Harry is well aware of his magical side and has the Raven (which he named Ingram) bonded to him as a Familliar with a small blessing of the Morrigan allowing the Corvid to move in and out of shadows as well as speak somewhat.

I'm planning on making Harry a bit on the grey side, not edgy or anything but definitely a little less... forgiving than Dumbledore would like towards his later years. His wand would be an Ebony wand with a Thestral tail hair, creating a bit of an odd wand. Very suitable for transfigurations as well as combative magic, but very much on the temperamental side, only really working with Harry and quite literally hurting anyone else trying to cast a spell with it

** I never thought I would write fan fiction, but i like reading it so i thought I would give it a go.. I have posted a series of illustrated (by me) Vikmione mini-fics on AO3 (same nickname). I will probably post one more story but I am open to suggestions. I normally first draw and then make up a story to go with it. Feel free to check it out (even if you don't like the pairing).

** I've started posting what will become a massive series mostly focused on Sirius and Regulus Black. It starts out gen and canon-compliant, following Sirius' challenging childhood with glimpses of Regulus', but it will eventually have Remus/Sirius and swerve into the AU as Kreacher realizes Regulus isn't planning on surviving the Horcrux hunt and recruits Sirius for help.

This is gonna be a long ride, but I'd say it's about 70% written. I'll be posting the shorter stories and one-shots as they're ready.

The first one, /"Muggle" isn't a Dirty Word/, deals with Sirius' first realization that maybe his family doesn't know what they're talking about when it comes to good and bad people.

  It's 1966, and six-year-old Sirius Black (almost seven!) wants a new broomstick. When his mummy won't buy it for him, he'll go get it himself!Except he runs the wrong way out of the Leaky Cauldron and ends up lost in Muggle London.When the muggles don't actually eat him the way he fears, Sirius does some investigating and learns more about the world than what his parents taught him. Unfortunately, only one person is willing to listen to his discoveries.(This is setting up for a much longer series)

** I'm working on an outline of a Horcrux Hunt AU where Dumbledore ate some humble pie in 6th year and lived up to his "I've always seen you as my son" attitude towards Harry. So instead of giving up and assuming Harry has to die to end this, he enlists Hermione's help by giving her access to his copy of Secrets Of The Darkest Arts, to see if having an extra mind working on it would help see something he missed. Hermione focuses on the fact that a Horcrux is canonically the exact opposite of a person. They're a photographic negative, an anti-human copy of their creator. Hermione theorizes that this means the creation of a Horcrux could theoretically be countered by a ritual that involves creating humans: magic based on anti-humanity collides with magic based on humanity. They could build a ritual that can cleanse Horcruxes that involves pregnancy. Or in other words: Harry can save himself from having to die if he knocks witches up in a magic circle.

So when Ron runs off because he's had enough in book 7, Hermione has a Plan B all ready to go. The problem lies in convincing Harry to do it.

  The Mark of Magic is an original story with an original cast of characters, set in an original Wizarding America. When Rachel turns 18, she receives a magical Mark, and with it comes a lot of danger. Road-Trip style fanfic, first in the "Of Soul and Desolation" series.

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

** For anyone who is into Severitus (Snape as Harry's guardian/parent), I'm currently writing a fic (it's over 120K so far) wherein Harry has run away after his first year, is gone for many months, and eventually gets rescued by Snape, but he can only continue his magical studies if he becomes his apprentice. Snape becomes his guardian/mentor and shenanigans ensue. It's called The Gifted Apprentice linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28676370/chapters/70301172]]).

It's got a lot of Mentor!Snape, hurt/comfort, and some good fluff, but it also has some occasional CP/discipline.

On another note, if you're into Severitus (Snape mentor--->parental role), and you enjoyed The Learning Experience (by Margot 11- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12906599/1/A-Learning-Experience]]) wherein Harry gets sorted/resorted into Slytherin and there's the Harry - Snape as a strict but ultimately nurturing HouseMaster, then check out this new fic called The House of the Misunderstood linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30769244/chapters/75946739]]).

  After running away in the summer after 1st year, Harry is rescued by Snape. His enrollment at Hogwarts has been revoked, and he can only stay and continue his magical training if he agrees to become Snape's apprentice. Neither of them are thrilled with this arrangement, but Snape is determined to give Harry the stability and guidance he needs to work through his past and teach him everything he needs to learn to be a great wizard. Lots of angst, some occasional fluff. Mentor/guardian fic

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)
