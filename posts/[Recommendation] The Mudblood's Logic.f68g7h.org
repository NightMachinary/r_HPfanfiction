A amazing take on what would have happened if Hermione tool the lead and was no longer a side character to throw away. I do not normally read fanfiction where Hermione is the main character but this story captured my interest with the world and character development with what I could compare to the pureblood pretense(linkffn(7613196)

If your looking for a fanfic that has action, intrigue, navigating the world of politics and exploring magic, I suggest you give it a read

This story is incomplete but is still being updated(the last being a week ago).

Pairing after 26 chapters is not developed greatly but Cedric is what it's forming up to be.


** How is it past the first chapter? Because I read it and it's both unrealistic and cringe.

*** The initial reaction from Harry and Ron was very cringne but that was the worse of the story

  Hermione Granger was a a plain mudblood. At least until one rash action leads to her battling Voldemort first year and miraculously surviving. Stuck in a whirlwind of political ploys, fame, wealth and power along with assassination attempts Hermione has a rather difficult path. But what is that saying, "The ends justify the means," and she will do whatever it takes...

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** My impressions so far (through Chapter 8). TL;DR: strong opening, then goes off the deep end and unironically goes through every Independent!Political!Poweful!Lord!Harry and Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche, except with Hermione in Harry's place.

More details:

- The technicals are pretty good. The most glaring problem is that there are frequent malapropisms.
- I found the opening to be compelling and elegant: at the end of PS, Hermione decides that since Harry is the Designated Hero of the story, he is too valuable to risk, whereas she is expendable, so she drinks the "forward" potion and goes to confront Quirrelmort. But, of course, that kind of self-sacrificing agency is exactly the sort that makes one the hero of a story, and so through that action, she takes the mantle of the protagonist for herself.
- I like Genius!Hermione as much as the next reader, but the opening implied a single point of divergence, and having 1st-year Hermione suddenly pull out beyond-4th-year spells and use them effectively in a fight was too much of a good thing. The saving grace is that she is still defeated by Quirrelmort. She does eventually turn the tables, killing Quirrelmort by stabbing him in the eye with her wand, breaking her wand in process, and then fighting off Voldemort's shade's possession attempt---mostly.

  - She is used by Quirrlemort to obtain the Stone as Harry was in canon. I feel that this is a missed opportunity, since it would have been much more interesting had Hermione /not/ been able to get the Stone, because she actually wanted it to be used.

- Once Hermione becomes famous as a result of killing Quirrelmort, her implied-alcoholic paternal grandmother turns out to be an ubercompetent SuperSlytherin witch (whose husband divorced her and whose family disowned her after she gave birth to a Squib---Hermione's father). This grandma begins to coach her aggressively, including a makeover, new wand, a French Diagon Alley (better than English!) shopping scene, a new wand without a Trace (because that's totally how the Trace works), a Gringotts visit, and a legal proceeding to claim her inheritance of the estate from which grandma was disowned.
- Manipulative!Dumbledore shows up periodically, making vain attempts to obstruct her progress, trying to keep Hermione from her legacy, all for no clear reason. At first, I thought that all that was the grandma poisoning Hermione against Dumbledore for her own reasons, combined with lingering possession of Voldemort, but given the actual dialogue when Dumbledore does appear, I don't think that's the case.
- Oh, and, apparently, despite having a magical grandma, Hermione is still considered a Muggleborn, and nominally faces all the stigma associated therewith.

** It's a curious choice of title, given that that's a word so foul that Ron's first reaction was to curse someone for saying it. Though it seems like it later becomes commonplace.
