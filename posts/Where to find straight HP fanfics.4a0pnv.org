** fanfiction.net has plenty of straight stories. Just filter for the characters you want (and filter out the ones you don't). For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&len=40&c1=11&_c1=6&_c2=9&s=2&p=2][Ginny, no Draco or Snape]]

** For fanfiction.net, you're better off searching for a pairing and using the two 'not' slots to exclude frequent interlopers. F'rinstance char 1=Harry P., char2 = N.Tonks, not char1=Remus L., not char2=Sirius B.

As for other sites, there's a reduced slash load on [[http://www.ficwad.com/category/19][ficwad.com]] and for [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com][hpfanficarchive]], posting stories that include Male/Male relations is considered a hanging offense.

*** Hpfanfictionarchive has a a lot of sexual stories. But there are some really good ones on there that aren't even popular or sexual that aren't posted anywhere else. It's really odd.

Although someone requests giant squid tentacle smut from time to time, most of the pairings offered here is conventional hetero.

** I can totally understand that anyone would want to read some straight stories, however, I disagree with your statement that it would be the same as watching gay porn. Reading a fictional story about two persons who are in a relationship and happen to share the same sex is not the same as watching two or more people having sex. Reading about someone's sexuality is not the same as looking at porn. Sexuality is more than just sex and homosexuals are just as normal as straight people. For myself, I am a lesbian, and reading heterosexual (fan)fiction is really very normal, whilst I really don't like straight porn.\\
This may sound a bit harsh and defensive, but truly, once you give it a try, reading things from a different perspective might be very nice!

*** Legit - when I first got into reading fic, I was really wary of slash pairings, just because it seemed strange to me at the time (granted, I was about ten and thought that /all/ sexualities were weird). But now I find that half my OTPs are gay, because I got over the genders of the characters and instead looked at the feelings/stories behind the shipping.

... that sounds insanely cheesy, but you know what I mean.

** On AO3, add this to the "Search Within Results" box and then hit the "Sort and Filter" button to filter out m/m:

-23

It won't get rid of /all/ the m/m, because not everybody tags for it, but should take care of the vast majority.

**** All tags on AO3 are assigned ID numbers, so 23 is just the tag ID for M/M. I like using the numbers instead of the tags, but you could just as easily do -"m/m" in the Search Within Results box instead.

Here's a tutorial that goes into more detail about AO3's filtering system: [[http://filter-me-ao3.tumblr.com/post/94752459096/hi-i-cant-figure-out-how-to-filter]]

**** Haha, no, it's definitely more slash-heavy than FFN, but not /that/ bad.

As of a minute ago, there are 93570 Harry Potter fics on AO3, and applying this filter leaves you 43408. 3 out of 20 on the first page of results have m/m pairings that didn't get properly tagged, 1 has an m/m/f threesome, and 1 is a genderswap fic with a pairing that would be m/m in canon. So say another 1/4 are things OP probably doesn't want to read, and that still leaves over 30,000 het, gen, and femslash fics to keep him busy.

*** Even if Harry is an adult?

Most of what I've seen get recommended with this ship, on here or on recommendation blogs, he's at least an /adult/ in their world.

Age gap may be a personal 'nope' to some people, but as long as there isn't some kind of coercion going on, or one having a position of authority over the other, it's no way comparable to /child molestation./

**** If Snape and Harry are engaged in any sort of intimate relationship while Harry is still a student, then I'd still consider it abuse. Even if Harry were 17 and an adult in the government's eyes, if Snape is his instructor, a Head of House, employed in any fashion by Hogwarts while Harry is a student, then it's a relationship ripe for abuse and has at least the appearance of impropriety and Snape should be adult enough to avoid it.

(Not that Snape showed himself to be very "adult" during the 6 years that he taught Harry, but...)

***** That's why I included this line:

Everything you just listed falls under that. I'm not for the student/teacher stuff, but that's often times not what gets recommended with Snape/Harry.

***** I always saw it more as an extension of the idea that the guys in Hermione's year never really seem to match her intellectually. It's why you also have a fair amount of Hermione/Remus fics around.
