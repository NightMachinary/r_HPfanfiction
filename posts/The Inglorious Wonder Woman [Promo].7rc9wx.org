** I enjoyed it a lot, subscribed. I did find some parts confusing though, it's a bit disjointed. The jump from the sea witch to the trial was particularly confusing. Also, I completely missed her mother going to land the first two times I read it. So maybe a little bit more elaboration? Otherwise, I like the direction your friend is going and look forward to more!
