** For clarity, when you say silent, does that mean the portrait would never have dialogue?

I think it'd be hard to keep Voldemort true to character in this, given that I can't fathom a reason he'd keep a portrait of anyone with him to begin with that keeps him in character. I would read this, though, if it were well enough done.

*** Yes. The plan is for the portrait to never have dialogue. As for Voldemort, I've played around with the idea of a powerful-powerless thing a little bit. How the most powerful of the wizards used to be less powerful than the most powerless of magical objects mere years ago, and that makes him feel oddly sympathetic for a small moment. There are a couple of other ideas too that I'll experiment with if I end up writing it.

**** Would Voldemort have discovered the portrait when he was at Hogwarts? Because from the way that you've worded things there, it sounds like he might have. That could work very well -- maybe he would have had something in common with the subject, somehow, and decided to keep it around.

Regardless of how you go about it, though, it sounds like a very neat little idea. I hope that you decide to go for it someday.

** I would be interested in reading that, if you end up writing it can you pm me the link?

** The ending sounds like it could be absolutely heartwrenching, and I really want to read an exploration of Magical Portraits' perspective on things anyway.
