So I maybe accidentally on purpose wrote most of a HP/WC crossover while trying to get over some writers block I was experiencing for one of my other stories. The basic premise of the crossover is that Harry and co end up in the Warcraft universe at the end of year 1 because Medivh and Dumbledore agreed they needed training because Ner'zhul recruited Voldemort to be his new host after Arthas kicked Ner'zhul out of the club house. I am looking for:

- Someone who has a basic knowledge of Warcraft and Harry Potter and can help with any lore screwups on my part (though I have made some changes like Vanessa Vancleef training Ginny to be a pirate in Booty Bay instead of being a boring farmhand in Westfall).

- Someone who is good at grammar and spelling and can help me with that because I am terrible with english despite only speaking that and spacegoat.

- Someone who is OK with the fact that I don't particularly like the Horde. Even Green Jesus, who died for Garrosh's sins. And also so we could get that sick artifact weapon. Tauren are pretty cool though.

- Someone insane enough to think this entire thing is a good idea.

** I'd be willing to help. if you want my qualifications:

- I can be pretty obsessive about warcraft lore, being a roleplayer. And I have a decent knowledge of HP canon.
- My grammar and spelling isn't perfect, but I can usually pick out mistakes.
- I cried when Varian died. I cheered when Vol'jin died.
- I've never been burdened with an overabundance of sanity.
- Armoury: [[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/emerald-dream/s%C3%A6lorable][SÃ¦lorable]] (Yes, I know it's horde, my friends suck!)
- Best achievement: [[http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=424/why-because-its-red][Why? Because It's Red]] (although, my truly best achievement was most likely deleting gearscore at the end of Wrath of the Litch King)

  Due to a shift in turian and quarian patrols, first contact for humanity is friendly; Rael'Zorah and Hannah Shepard become friends, as do their species. But the galaxy is not a safe place, and schisms develop when the Council steps in. As humanity finds new allies among the stars, something darker stirs. The Meek must beware, for it is nearly harvest time. AU, lots of worldbuilding
