And, I'm not wanting things like Dumbledore bashing, or perfect Harry/Hermione, or Ron having the mental equivalent of Elevator noises going about in his cavern of a skull. I am looking for a good story with no bashing, no Mary Sues, characters that learn and grow, where they must struggle and learn with the help of their friends and teachers.

Where Ron is still just as important to Harry as Hermione is, just in a different, not kissing way. Or where Dumbledore still teaches and helps them learn as he did in canon, but doesn't just make Harry into a super-wizard over the course of a summer because Harry needs to get serious. (And I don't mean in a weird, Godfather-ish way.)

Does such a story exist? I've found a couple oneshots or shorter stories over my travels, but nothing of significance in any longer length. Does anyone else know of some good stories where it's all balanced and enjoyable, and is put together well enough that it won't give me a headache via horrific grammar?


** Blindness is pretty good. It has a bit of an OP Harry but other than that it is a good fic.

** linkffn(11764303) is 13k words (a shorter story), but other than that...

linkffn(6243892) is light on capital-R romance, but otherwise might be to your liking. 36k words (still a /bit/ on the short side).

linkffn(2527087) is also pretty light on romance.

linkffn(7062528) might work for you?

linkffn(10914042) probably doesn't portray a Dumbledore to your liking, but at least it takes an interesting and different approach, rather than the typical incompetent mustache-twirling.
