A couple of weeks ago I read a fan fic where the students are transported to a new reality and end up creating Atlantis. I was wondering if there are any fics out there in the same vein. Something where the people of Harry's generation start a new society. It doesn't have to be a time change or parallel universe, just something that has some decent world building.

It is called Island of Fire. It is a bunch of people from the triwizard tournament who get sent to an alternate reality thanks to a portkey malfunctioning after being exposed to dragon fire.

**** That's that For the Love of Magic one where Harry turns into a raging bigot.

Edit: I think he also fucks the island itself to grow life or something.

**** linkffn(on an island in the sun)

It is still not the greatest story in the world and naturally Harry is incredibly powerful and has a harem of women but Harry does build an island and lives on it
