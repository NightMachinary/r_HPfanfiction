Damn.

This one is god-tier too though. The setting still has Tom as a kid, but Dumbledore is in his prime and the war with Grindelwald is raging. There is also a third incredibly powerful wizard whose identity should be clear soon enough. linkffn(12331839)

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
