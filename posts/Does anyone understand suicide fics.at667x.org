** When people can't write genuinely gripping drama they settle for just making everything as angsty and depressing as possible to compensate.

It's why like 50% of fics have rape in them these days. If people don't have anything interesting to write they just use drugs, suicide and sexual assault as a crutch

**** I was exaggerating, but sometimes it does feel that way. It's beyond frustrating when I look up certain pairings and the page loads up flooded with rape/non-con warnings.

Naturally, I just filter them out, but a massive chunk of stories disappear when I do.

***** It's so hard to find good fics, and good CNC for certain pairings. It's all Dub-con or non-con/rape that's either there for drama because of lazy writing or glorified as CNC when it's actually firmly in the area of rape.

  Hermione Granger is a mess and everyone knows it. She hasn't been sober in more than a year, she's cut ties with her best friends and she spends her nights partying with everyone's favourite ex-Slytherins. Draco Malfoy has been abroad since graduating Hogwarts, studying muggle and magical healing. Upon his return, their paths intertwine and Draco can't seem to stay away.

** I don't know. The awfulness of shit fics like "Dearest Hermione" doesn't really have anything to do with suicide fics in a general sense.

"Survivor" for example is pretty good. Also there's Canon, where the protagonist just suicides himself and some people claim that's good too.

Not perfect by any means, (edgy af at the beginning, although somewhat believably so) and does a good job of working through what comes after.

** I think it's absolutely fine if writers handle the entire situation well and with the respect it needs. But some people...just don't. It's clearly used as a way to just create drama, vilify certain characters, or get two characters together(this happens a lot in fics where a character is raped. In all fandoms, basically).

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Not trying to self promote too much here, but I wrote a Teddy death one last year. It's called Burdens and it's posted on HPFT under my username BlackPixie. I have another almost-suicide one, but I've kinda abandoned that. Burdens is just a one-shot.
