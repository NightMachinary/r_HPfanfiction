I made a request for this a few months ago, but I'm curious if anyone has any other ideas.

I don't particularly care if he's Dark/Neutral/Light but he should obviously be pushing for some kind of cause which could /spark/ that kind of violent/fanatical following.

Similar to linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen) but preferably a less crack-ish setting.

I don't mind any pairings, slash, whatever. Would /prefer/ not Harry/Multi or Harem, but please don't let that stop you if you have something which otherwise fits well.

Many thanks, guys. <3

*** I've read Broken Chains and Emperor. Fantastic suggestions, and I recommend them, as well. :)

I'll take a look at the other two, much appreciated. :)

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
