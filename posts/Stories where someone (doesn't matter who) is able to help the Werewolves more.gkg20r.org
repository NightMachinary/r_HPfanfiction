Either by coming up with a better cure, helping them financially, medical help, or anything else similar.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et Cetra) Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry. If Harry is "Lord" I don't want him being Draco Malfoy 2.0, I still want him helping people.

Would rather NOT have character bashing, if at all possible.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.


** This means war has harry helping the werewolves near the end. Not a major plot point but it happens

A time-traveling Hermione makes Wolfsbane available in 1927. It's a neat subplot early on in the fic. I haven't finished it yet, so I can't say how it goes for her.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** There's a fair bit done for werewolves in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). Harry might seem a bit OP at first, but by year five it turns out he really isn't.

Also in linkffn(Blindness) he's able to heal lycanthropy infections if he gets to them quickly.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
