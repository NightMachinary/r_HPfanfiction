I just rediscovered HP/DC xover, especially with a Harry/Kara pairing for me and wondered what r ur favourite stories with that. The longer the better, preferably complete or not dead. And please no Megamatt09. Those who know his stories probably know why not.üòÖ


** There's Terminal Justice, half-way through the story, but at this point it's more an OC with Harry's name/face than actually Harry being Harry.

The quality also degrades as the story goes on, since it looks like the author was running out of ideas/a plot-direction.

There are also a few 'lost' chapters that were never uploaded to the FFn fork, but they were lost once Yahoo Groups were closed (they were on CA).

But, yeah, definitely agree with you on Megamatt09's stuff. /Jesus Christ./

*** That one I don't remember. I'll check it out.

I know right. His early works are, despite the repetitive and less then stellar smut scenes, not a bad read. They had at least a interesting plot. But the rest? Copy paste with bit different filling.

**** Terminal Justice is the follow-up to the Mr Black stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][The Hunt For Harry Potter]], in which Harry is "just a man on vacation".

The collected Mr Black stories (by various authors) can be found at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Black-INK/71873/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Black Ink]].

As for Meg9, I've read a few of his stories and... yeah. Copy-paste is a good way of describing it.

** Why do get the feeling that mm09 scared the people away from the whole Harry/Kara ship to the point that u could say it's a too rare pairing?üòÖ

** I've been looking for a good Harry and Supergirl(CW) fic . There are not a lot there. I think this pairing should really pic up some steam. This a a pretty good power couple. There is some story .....search ‚Äúsilver speedster‚Äù on ffnet. I think that is the only decent story I know. It's kinda over the top. But you take what you get.
