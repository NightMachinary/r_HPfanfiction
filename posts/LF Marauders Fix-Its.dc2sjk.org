Looking for purely Marauders fics of any length in which things happen differently. Preferably taking place entirely before the events of HP.

I recently read linkao3(The Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) and really enjoyed how the fix wasn't simple and easy. The lack of trust between Sirius and Remus was fun. I also really enjoyed the interaction between Regulus and Sirius - god I love those boys.

Please share your favourites! Whether they involve discovery of Peter's betrayal before Halloween, a Peter redemption arc, Sirius breaking out/being acquitted earlier, Sirius not going after Peter, I want to read it all. Bonus points for Regulus and/or Sirius/Remus.

Notable exception - I detest time travel as a fix-it trope, especially when it's Harry that's gone back in time to Marauders Era.


** So, this one's a WIP that's been updating very, very slowly, but the writing is so spectacular that I can't bring myself to give up on it. - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15086759][made weak by time and fate, but strong in will]] - linkao3(15086759)

  (It all starts with Peter Pettigrew dying twice. First, Peter kills Wormtail (discreetly), and then Sirius kills him (less discreetly).It's never easy losing a friend, even in a war, but it's far worse when it means you lose the last of your childish hopes.)War is a complicated, messy thing. The Marauders have their fucked up shit to deal with, but they also have each other. It's not all that easy, though.

  James and Lily had a back-up plan that they didn't share with anyone else. They survived Voldemort's attack but everyone still thought they died, and Sirius was still found guilty of murder, accused of being a spy, and sentenced to Azkaban. When the war is won, James, Lily, and Harry come back, but will it be too late for Sirius? And how will Remus react? This is a story of reconnection, comfort, and healing. And while it might not sound like it, this story is all about Sirius Black.

** I recommend this same fic a lot but it does fit your description. It's long and recently completed and it is sort of a fix-it although not everyone is ok at the end of it. The first chapters are a bit short but the plot picks up pace quickly and it's a wild ride all the way to the end.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
