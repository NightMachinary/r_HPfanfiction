I am looking for time travel fics, where Harry Potter travels back in time (any era, but preferably just before/during his parent's era).

The key thing though is that Harry Potter is never known as a time traveler and is never discovered, suspected, believed to BE Harry Potter, and never tells anyone he's Harry Potter.

Basically, he creates a new life and lives it. He can decide to do whatever he wants with his life, hell he could kill Voldemort as a baby if he went back far enough, or date his mother or a Black sister if he chooses. He can go to Hogwarts or go to Bauxbatons, never coming back to Britain. He lives his own life how he wishes and leaves "Harry Potter" behind.

The more mature the story the better in my view. I do prefer there be romance in the story, as I prefer stories with pairings. I don't mind how smutty it does or does not get. No slash as the main pairing, however, side pairings are free game.


** The closest that I found is linkffn(8821847) where Harry goes back in time (as an 18ish year old) to around the time he was born and fixes everything. He does eventually reveal himself as a time traveler but its long after the war ends and everyone is living peacefully.

*** That seems like an awful lot to get done in a story that's only 26k words long and rated T. I will take a look but its limited length concerns me.

**** The first chapter is exposition vomit. No showing at all. I do not know if it gets better.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Kathryn518 wrote a story called “What's a Little Death between friends?” that's pretty close to what you're looking for.

Updates are very infrequent though.

*** Infrequent is a very kind way to put it, once a year if that these days. Her chapters are ridiculously long. The SW/HP started out updating every 2-3 months and the chapters were a good length, no idea why all her stories seem to head towards long waits for huge chapters, I end up having to reread the whole story to remember it. There comes a point where people just aren't going to bother doing that.

*** I don't know enough about The Lone Traveller to know if they fit, and the description on the one you linked is too basic to glean any clues from.

I will take a look but at first glance, it looks to be a no go. Thanks.
