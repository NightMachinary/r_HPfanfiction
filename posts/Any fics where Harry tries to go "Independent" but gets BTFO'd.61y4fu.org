You know the tropes --- diagonal alley shopping trip, Lord of a million houses, new trunk, Dumbles/Moldyshorts, order of the chicken, big ass speech comparing Dumbledore to Hitler, that sort of thing.

Is there a fic where Harry tries to do what Harries in those fics do, but ends up antagonising everyone and ruining everything? After all, it stands to reason experienced war veterans would know more about strategy than a 15 year old. Amelia Bones is also far more likely to trust Dumbledore than she is Harry Potter.

It would be even better if the tropes were explicitly subverted. Like Harry inherits half the noble titles in the land but all that those houses have is a load of debt (that's why nobody had claimed them until now).


** Oh it would be such a train wreck. I cringe by just imagining a super Harry falling from his high horse, so embarrassing.

** I'd like to see a fic in which indy!Harry went off on his own and got quickly killed as a result. Dumbledore had no choice but to step up his own game. He finally dropped his pretense of being 'nice', staged a coup with Amelia Bones, knocked off Death Eaters and their sympathizers in the Ministry, and declared 'total war' on Voldemort.

Every captured Death Eater got supreme Veritaserum and Legilimency treatments, before being executed. Voldemort's horcruxes were quickly reduced to the Snake, after they seized most Death Eater vaults. The Ring claimed several curse breakers, but the Stone was now safely sitting on Dumbledore's desk.

A furious Voldemort lashed out by stepping up his terror attacks. Losses were high on both sides, but with numbers on Dumbledore's side, Voldmort was slowly losing. Fearing for his immortality, Voldemort made one more horcrux, resulting in more lost wits and decision making skills. Eventually, he fell for a trap and was captured. After pushing him through the most grueling interrogation, Dumbledore oblivated Voldemort to his infancy and put him under Draught of Living Death. When the final horcrux was destroyed, they executed him.

'The Power He Knows Not' turned out to be an angry and ruthless Dumbledore.

**** There is something similar. In this fic, indy!Harry ran away with Sirius, Hermione, and the Grangers. They got lots of help from the Delacours and the French, who were more than happy to stick it up to the British Ministry. [[/spoiler][Fudge administration fell quickly, Amelia took over, she and Dumbledore finished off Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The losses in Britain were heavy, but kids were mostly unscathed. Harry got rid of his scars through some Australian tribal magic.]]

It's overall a credible, enjoyable, and light-hearted story:

** I'd settle for one where he has actual obstacles. So many of these fics once he claims his inheritance or what ever he just pretty much wins. Dumbledore is a master manipulator, holds several high offices, and has been plotting and controlling Harry for 15 years but he has no contingency for Harry getting a letter from his bank.

His only real task is to pick which girl he is going to marry, or deal with a marriage contract (usually by giving in without much more than a half hearted complaint. You would think someone so determined to take control of their life would have more of an issue with being told who to marry.)

  Hermione was not at all happy with his newfound anti-goblin views, calling him bigoted and racist. When Harry explained what had happened, she hmmed and asked to borrow his Invisibility Cloak. The next day, Gringotts mysteriously exploded.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
