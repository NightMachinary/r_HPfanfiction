I mean, think about it: If repairing things keeps them usable for far longer, then old stuff might never be replaced. As a result, the old stuff would make up the /vast majority/ of stuff.

Not to mention, old stuff being around 24/7 would directly influence the design of new stuff - instead of looking at your existing made-in-the-last-50-years $thing and designing a slightly better version (repeat every 50 years for guaranteed progress), you look at a $thing that was made shortly after $thing was first /invented/, and /maybe/ make some improvements on its' design. Or maybe just make the exact same thing, then enchant it to be better.


** I don't think that the Reparo spell is flawless, if it was the Weasleys' clothes wouldn't look so "used".

*** Well the thought process there could be just be, used clothes aren't 'broken', they are just used.

Even if they understand that a shirt becomes less than it was because the fabric became frayed and worn away, they could see that more of just age and death. I think they would very much compare the age of an object to the age of creatures, and inherently understand that at a certain point, an object has lived it's life, and 'death' can't be repaired.

** I wouldn't say its specifically the Reparo spell that causes this, but I would say that the wizarding world has no NEED for technology for the most part when they already have ways to go about doing it. Stuff like laundry machines arne't necessary when you can just use Scourgify. Obviously some oddities like not having an instantaneous form of communication like cellphones/email/etc. is odd to me. But in general, wizards have a stunted development that just seems to get worse over time because they progressed to a path of self sufficiency and seclusion from the muggle world while simultaneously having most/all needs met by magic based stuff, at least generally.

** Between that and the long life expectancy of wizards who therefore might be reluctant to throw their trusty old things away, I think you're onto something.

** I think this is genius. They don't have a disposable culture and this is probably a big reason why.

** I enjoy living in the headcanon that Reparo is a small object repairing charm. Canon may show signs of disagreeing with it, but it makes this a bit more consistent all around in terms of Magic and the limits of Students.
