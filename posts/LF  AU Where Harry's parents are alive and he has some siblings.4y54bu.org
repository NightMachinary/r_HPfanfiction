I remember reading a fanfic a while back set in an AU where both of Harry's parents were alive. He attended hogwarts and I believe he had some siblings aswell. Harry was arrogant and sarcastic mirroring his father. It was a Harry/Hermione fic where at first Hermione did not like Harry due to his arrogance and such. I believe I read it on Portkey but I can't be 100% sure.

If anyone has any idea of the fic that I'm talking about please comment below.


** Sounds interesting, I'd love to read it! Sadly I can't help you narrow down what it is though.

*** Just found it! It's called 'Like Father Like Son' on Portkey. There is a bit of Weasley bashing, which I'm not a fan of, but it's really not that much. It's a fun read!
