I find it hard to get into a fanfic if it doesn't sound like JKR has written it (I even find stuff like Hogwarts Houses Divided and the Noah Phantom series a little bit difficult to read, and they're my favourites by far!)

I know this is probably quite vague and down to interpretation, but I'm quite new to HP fanfic and would love to know if you have any suggestions. Thanks!


** I found the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com][James Potter series]] to be pretty true to JKR style. The first two ones at least, haven't read further than that yet!

*** Yeah, I did give this a go a while ago, but I found it quite Americanised which I think put me off... I felt like the author made two or three of the main characters American so that he could feel comfortable with the way they spoke etc. (just a completely baseless guess on my part!) and (as a Brit) it made the story feel non-Harry-Potter-like - thanks for the suggestion, though! :)

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
