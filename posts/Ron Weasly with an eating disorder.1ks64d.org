So I was wondering am I the only one that thinks Ron Weasly would be a great character to write an eating disorder fic about? In the books and movies he's kinda emotionally unstable sometimes and he's always stuffing his face. He grows up with lots of brothers in a poor family so it makes sense that he might worry about food and that leads him to his binge eating. His feelings of inadequacy about having better brothers and Harry Potter as a best friend might spur these feelings in him. Does anyone know of any fanfiction about this?


** I would love to see eating disorder fic of any of the trio members actually, all three have potential for it.

Hermione is controlling and a perfectionist, and also the stress level she must have to keep up those perfect grades might take a toll on her (thus a restrictive type - maybe purgative too?).

Harry grew up in an abusive household where food was used as punishment and a luxury for him (binge-restriction cycles, and a very odd relationship with how he perceives meals and food).

Ron's money status (binging/hoarding food, followed by periods of not eating due to guilt?).

Unfortunately, most of the eating disorder fic i've seen was awfully corny and cheesy, and glorified the illness, I bet most of it came written from those who never had an e.d. themselves, knew nobody with it, or did poor research.

*** I've read Harry and Hermione eating disorder fics that fall into those traps but I've literally found no Ron fics of that type at all.

**** I feel like for any fics like that to be done well it would have to be horribly depressing.
