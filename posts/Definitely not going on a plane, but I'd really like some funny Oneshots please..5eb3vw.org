  Rose says that I am an oblivious moron, but would an oblivious moron have such a deep and sensitive diary? I don't think so. No one knows how I suffer in this ridiculous family. Written for SIYE's The Burrow Secret Challenge 2016, and inspired by Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole.

  Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth.
