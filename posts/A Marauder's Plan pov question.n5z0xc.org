Is the perspective mostly from Sirius black or does it have perspectives from Harry and Hermione too in this fanfic? And while I'm at it, how much romance is there in it?


** No pairing for Sirius, Harry starts dating Hermione towards the end of the fic. But overall, not much romance from what I remember.

It is mostly Sirius' and Harry's pov, sometimes others' (hermione, snape)
