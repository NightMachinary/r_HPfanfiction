Doesn't make them evil, to kill bad guys, especially if those bad guys are killing and torturing innocent people, I don't want a Evil Harry or anything, just characters more willing to kill the bad guys.

And it doesn't even have to be Harry doing the killing, it can be the adults around him. Like the Order of the Phoenix or something who does the killings.

They don't have to kill all the time, they can stun and stuff like that, but when they have no other choice, killing bad guys is crucial.

Harry MUST still be on the Light Side, not on Voldemort's side.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would also rather NOT have Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing, if possible, if not that's fine, I'm just not a fan of the bashing. As long as it makes sense, that's fine.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
