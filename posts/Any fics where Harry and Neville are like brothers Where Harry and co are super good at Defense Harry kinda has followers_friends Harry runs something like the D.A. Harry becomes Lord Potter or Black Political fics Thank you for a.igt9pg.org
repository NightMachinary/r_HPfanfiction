Just for those who are confused, I'm not looking for fics that fill all of the requests! There can be fics that only meet one but don't fill the others. Thank you!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** linkao3(24410095) This is my new favorite of Harry and Neville dynamic after Sum of Their Parts. Set on GOF when Ron wasn't talking to Harry and Hermione and they both get closer to Neville. Not quite brother, not yet, and yet their friendship is nonetheless precious here. WIP but last updated mere days ago and the author churned out 20 chapters in three months so I'm optimist.

** Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts linkffn(4079609)

Harry and Neville defeat Voldemort and return to Hogwarts for 7th year as the conquering champions. They're best friends. A bit of politics. Heavy Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. The DUmbledore bashing is quite entertaining though.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

** OH OH BOY! YOURE GONNA LOVE "HARRY CROW" Goblin raised harry, goblons are more warrior like culture with deep honor ties and a mary sue type of harry for the 1st year but the writing gets better as the story goes along. Harry doesn't take shit and actually uses rules and laws to his advantage as well actually bonding with Neville as a Brother/cousin. Warrior trained harry as well with Hogwarts literally loving Harry as a sort of school mascot for the castle.
