I was thinking of all the things that could change if Harry obeyed the rules and did what he was told.

I thought of a timeline (not at all supposed to be an actual serious one :)

First year I see Hermione dead, second year Ginny dead/possessed (especially with Hermione gone, so no helpful clues). 3rd year Sirius dies (let's say because Harry never broke school rules to investigate and someone eventually gets Sirius to the Dementors ). 4th year Harry competes to win, because he is told to give it his best, and saves Cedric life by beating him to the cup. 5th year Voldemort sets the trap at the DOM by giving him the false vision of a someone getting tortured, but Harry won't leave the school and no one dies. 6th year he doesn't use the Prince's potions book notes, so he never fires sectum sempra at Draco, after Draco fires the crucio, and Draco gets put in Azkaban for life for using an unforgivable. Lastly, 7th year, the whole dark army blocks the Hogwarts Express and, willing to do anything to keep his perfect attendance, Harry fights through all the Death Eaters and defeats Voldemort to get to his last Welcoming Feast on time. lol.

​

What funny, or ironic, things could happen, in your opinion, if Harry was a stickler for school rules?

Also, anything similar to this exist? (Harry following the rules only to lead to different outcomes)

​

Thanks!


** I think that the changes to canon would have too much of a butterfly effect if things started changing in book 1, for events from later books to even happen.

For example, I find it very unlikely that Harry would happen upon a crying Draco in the bathroom in book 6. In fact I don't believe he would've been tasked by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore in the first place.

Too much would've changed, for one thing you have a living 16 year old Tom Riddle from the chamber, Dumbledore might not even be headmaster anymore, Lucius is not being punished by Voldemort for having lost his horcrux. In fact the actions of the young Tom Riddle alone will have drastic changes to canon. Would he help ghost-Voldemort to resurrect earlier, or strike out on his own?

So many possibilities abound for the butterfly effect to change canon into unrecognizable territory, I think it is lazy of authors who go the route of sticking to canon despite changes.

**** Young-Voldemort would probably be a lot more sane and dangerous then his older self. Sure, Old-Voldemort had knowledge and experience, but the act of splitting his soul so many times caused him to be come less then human, and insane to the point where he was irrational and prone to violence.

A younger Voldemort would think things through, plan accordingly and probably be able to take over the Wizarding World via political means rather than terrorist means.

If Diary-Voldemort WERE to seek out the main soul and merge, it would more likely ABSORB the main soul. It's very very unlikely that the main soul would even be able to replace the diary-soul.

******* That's only true if the making of a horcruxe divides ones soul evenly in half. Could be that each piece is 1 percent or less and merely acts as tether keeping the spirit from achieving true death. Voldemort being driven insane by all his horcruxes also seems more fanon then canon. If anything has affected his mental state I'd think it'd be all those years as an incorporeal ghost like creature. Or parasite/baby homunculus. I mean think about all the crazy shit he went through before getting a body( something else which might be effecting his sanity, not like he tested that shit out on anyone first) He possessed animals and Quirrell. He might be cursed for being temporarily a part of a body that drank unicorns blood. He was completely dependent for years on incompetent or disloyal followers who were supposed to find him and assist his return but fled and now he's having to start all over after being on the precipice of victory. He's probably got a few regular mental breakdowns under his belt and who knows what weird magic shit completely unrelated to horcruxes could be going on. They probably don't help though 🤣

*** Agreed. Butterfly effect makes things drastically different.

If Harry doesn't go after the stone, does Voldemort rise or is he stopped at the mirror?

The only thing that might still be the same is the TriWiz. Such an event might take a long time to plan, how long? Is early planning going on in 1st year? It'd be scrapped if Voldemort is active again, but what if he's laying low like in OotP? We could have a nearly canon 4th year with the same goal, get Harry out of Dumbledore's protection.

** If Harry follows rules completely, Year 1 results will be completely different:

1. He's not going to enter that pissing contest against Draco Malfoy and get on the Quidditch team
2. He's not going to accept a duel with Draco Malfoy, sneak out in the middle of night, end up meeting Fluffy, and have a fallout with Hermione
3. Without the above episode, Hermione is not likely to cry in that bathroom alone, and the rule abiding Harry is not going to run off alone to save a damsel in distress. Anyway, the canon Trio will not be formed.
4. Nobody is going to challenge Quirrellmort for the PS, so he either makes off with it and Voldmort comes back early, or he gets stuck there long enough and neutralized by Dumbledore.

--------------

Suppose Voldemort is neutralized by Dumbledore in Year 1, Year 2 events should repeat until Ginny throws away the Diary. The rule abiding Harry is not going to hang out in that bathroom, and the Diary could get stuck in an U-bend for years, if not decades.

Year 3 will see Sirius successfully killing Wormtail and going on the run.

Then without Wormtail around:

- Bertha Jorkins will not be captured and TWT can proceed normally
- Moody will not be captured and impersonated
- Barty Jr breaks free at Quidditch World Cup, but without a Trio messing around, he will not be recaptured by his dad. He should go on the run and try to find Voldemort.

At this point, the plot will be driven by two characters:

- Sirius Black who is determined to prove his innocence and be together with Harry
- Barty Crouch Jr who is determined to find Voldemort and exact revenge on Wizarding Britain

** Think Rowling's message throughout the books is that it's okay to circumvent the rules, that adults don't always know best, and don't always trust the government. Also that school is much more than memorizing a textbook (see: the D.A.).

If Harry was a total rule follower it wouldn't be very interesting to read with him as the main character, would it? But I do wonder what would happen if he actually practiced Occlumency and also if he chose to not go to the ministry when he saw the vision of Sirius (or a loved one).

And for the 7th year you described, even if he had followed so many of the rules, he would have probably been wanted by Voldemort so there's no way he could either get to Hogwarts or stay there for very long.

  Thank you for your rude response! I interpreted the question as 'suppose everything stays roughly the same (in canon)except Harry follows the rules strictly' and gave an answer based on that. Of course people can be imaginative and invent their own AUs. Harry breaking the rules and going on adventures is foundational to the series, and fanfic writers are welcome to explore other possibilities.

***** They were rude, but that doesn't change the fact that you're trying to dictate what a fanfiction writer can write. Anyone can change the story however they want even if it means breaking down foundational elements. You should try not to see it as an insult to the source material, but rather an exploration of how the story would differ if Rowling had different ideas in mind.

** If you use canon as a guide, it certainly would have massive bad repercussions (since early canon is based around kids' book logic - IE, adults are useless and the protagonist kid and his friends are the only ones who can save the day.)

I think if you're going for 'Harry as the perfect student', Hermione wouldn't die - because Harry would befriend her over Ron in that situation, and she wouldn't have been on her own/crying in the bathroom on Halloween. However, that doesn't mean things go well overall.

Book 1, Quirrell would go unopposed at the end. It's debatable whether or not he gets the stone - if you want things to go truly to shit, then having Voldemort get the stone would have big repercussions from the start, obviously. You could even have two versions of him running around (with the Diary and the real deal).

However, it's impossible to say what would happen then, obviously. Once year 1 or 2 goes to shit, none of the next years would truly follow canon - so that's where we'd need to get into AU versions, unless jumping through contrived hoops to keep things similar.

Alternatively, this could make for a great crack fic from the perspective of Dumbledore - who is trying to make Harry into a hero by encouraging him to break the rules and grow stronger, while constantly getting frustrated in it and having to go solve the issues himself.

** Okay, here's my go.

First year: Hermione's probably safe. I'd reckon Harry tells a teacher, the teacher would probably keep Hermine safe. Also worth noting, most schools (anecdotally) also have rules prohibiting bullying and talking bad about other people, thus it's possible that Harry and Ron fall out and Harry becomes friends with someone like Hermione. This is something I'm electing to ignore though.

Second Year: I also don't really see much changing. Harry did the rule abiding thing here, he went and got a teacher (one whom in theory was most suited to deal with the issue), unfortunately for him that teacher was Lockhart. He was then trapped with a Basilisk. Overall, no changes.

Third Year: Someone definitely dies, but I doubt it Sirius. Firstly, Harry was the reason Sirius was discovered in the first place, so I'd say Sirius probably remains undiscovered. That being said, Harry also talked Sirius away from killing Petegrew, whom dies die in this scenario.

Fourth Year (Realistic): honestly the most realistic way I see this going is nothing happens. Petegrew was the one that got Voldemort to the point he was at, he was the one that resurrected Voldemort, thus the reason Voldemort rigged the TWT. None of that happens.

Fifth-Seventh Years (Realistic): Umbridge isn't planted in fifth year because Harry never makes any claims, the ministry doesn't try to slander Harry, and no dementor. While Slughorn may return, it doesn't really matter. Seventh is also completely different as Voldemort isn't around to take over the ministry. That being said, this is all boring so let's go back with an assumption.

Forth Year (replacement): Let's say somehow Voldemort gets a Petegrew replacement. I actually agree that Cedric probably lives as Harry wins the tournament. However, there is probably much more of an investigation into how Harry was put in as he's never broken any rules before.

Fifth Year (replacement): Harry listens to Umbridge and never gets detention with her (likely infuriating her to no end). The most important thing that happens in this year is that the DA never forms. This means that there isn't a pre-United front against Voldemort when he takes over the school, and quite a few students likely don't end up at NEWT level DADA.

Sixth Year (the Book): (as you can probably tell, there will be another divergence here) I actually disagree with you here. I think that Harry uses the book. This is rule obeying, not textbook worshipping. Harry would recognize that notes are corrections and use them, the difference is that this Harry would share it. Harry would use the corrections, but wouldn't hide it like in canon, he'd probably straight give all the corrections to anyone who bothered to ask. The reasoning for this is simple, keeping it a secret would be an unfair advantage, ie cheating. I don't doubt that he'd also learn the spells as well, though he'd probably practice and figure out what they did prior to attempting them on a person. That said, there are some differences. I doubt Harry finds Malfoy in the bathroom, and I don't believe Harry would be around for Dumbledore's death.

Seventh Year (the Book): Harry leaves. Honestly, I doubt Harry sticks around, he obeys all the rules, once Voldemort takes over and labels him an outlaw it makes sense he just leaves. If this Harry really cares about schooling he'd probably enroll in Beauxbatons (Durmstrang is farther). That being said, there is another decently likely scenario.

Sixth Year (Quidditch): Rule obeying Harry may decide that being moved into Slughorn's class the way he was, was equivalent to being cheated in (which to be fair, it kind of was). Thus Harry decides to not join. Harry still needs to get into the Slugclub (request from Dumbledore), so he looks to his other skill that allows it, quidditch. This time Harry goes nuts, he takes his already prodigious skill and increases it. He pulls off something crazy and goes undefeated. As the leader and seeker of the team, Slughorn ‘collects' Harry. Slughorn (being Slughorn) probably also mentions this to other quidditch players he knows (I'm assuming he did, I seem to recall him knowing some) and Harry starts to be scouted. Same differences as the other sixth year time line so I'll skip them.

Seventh Year (Quidditch): Harry is legally an adult in the Wizarding World, so Harry, being scouted by professional quidditch teams, takes the job opportunity. As a result of Voldemort taking over most counties would probably try to distance themselves from Wizarding Britain and the quidditch teams would probably also move out (at least temporarily). All this to say, he still leaves.

**** 2nd year: I always assumed this is a possessed (to some extent) Ginny that did that though, barring the book being in Dumbledore's office I do see her getting it back.

Third year: I didn't really address this as Buckbeak isn't incredibly important and I have a mixed opinion. I'll start by saying it's certainly possible that Buckbeak dies. However, what makes it a toss up for me is that 1) Dumbledore is the person that suggests it, thus Harry might still do it, and 2) even if /Harry/ doesn't do it, Hermione is the one with the timeturner and she might do it.

Fifth year: I did address this in the realistic timeline. Overall, if he does end up making the statement, I believe the ministry would slander Harry. While I mentioned a larger investigation into how Harry was entered (because of his rule following nature), I don't particularly believe the ministry would care about that if the other option would be deal with the panic that would certainly ensue if they acknowledged the possibility of Voldemort's return. Harry is still only one kid after all.

** The big question is how was the Mirror supposed to work? By general agreement through fanon, it's meant to have trapped Voldemort on some level, and we at least know that he wouldn't be able to get the stone. Maybe Dumbledore would manage to trap his spirit because Voldemort would be there significantly longer failing to get the Stone. At the very least I don't think he'd be coming back in first year. In second year the only reason Ginny went to get the Diary from Harry, was because Harry, specifically, had it. She was worried that Tom told Harry her secrets, nobody goes in that bathroom, which was specifically why she threw it in there. Without Harry(or his friends) to pick it up, it wouldn't ever get back to Ginny as she thinks she got rid of it.

**** Your theory on Quirrel is interesting, but we know that it didn't work as Quirrel very clearly couldn't get the stone. As for second year, I'm just going off what we know for sure, that being that she went after the Diary in the dorms because she was scared of having her secrets revealed. She very specifically got rid of it in a place where no one goes. It was only the very specific power of the writer which put Harry in that bathroom. If not for Harry finding it that same day, it's much more likely that she would have been away from the diary's influence enough to actually tell a teacher. She wasn't addicted enough to give it up and then go back for it barring the extenuating circumstances of someone actually finding it.

** But Harry was the perfect student. He was not like the marauders who broke rules for fun, Harry was not interested in pranks or fun, he did not break rules for personal gain or to harm anyone. He did whatever he did because it was the right thing to do. So technically he bent the rules not break them. Harry's life was so dark that he did not care for a lot of things. He enjoyed flying and that's pretty much it. He desires a low key life, but life thrust him into limelight. He detests his celebrity status.

Your scenario sounds more like what would happen if Harry was a coward. I guess in that scenario Neville will have to be the brave one. That's how prophecies work. Also would Harry be a Griffindor if he was a coward?
