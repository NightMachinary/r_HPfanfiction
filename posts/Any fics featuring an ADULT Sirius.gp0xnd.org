So I've always had a thing for Sirius Black. But I rarely find fics with him as an ADULT. He's always depicted as when he was young and handsome and hanging out with the rest of the Marauders. And I feel like people are intentionally portraying him in that way because apparently no one finds adult Sirius good-looking.

So I'd really really like some good fic recommendations featuring adult Sirius paired up with someone, ideally an OC or Lupin. But please for the love of good don't give me Sirius/Harry.


** I just recommended this one a couple days ago, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][/Promises Unbroken/]]. It centers around an AU where Sirius was the secret keeper for the Potters instead of Pettigrew. It's part one of a 600k word trilogy of fanfics.

It's complete, but I don't recall any shipping in the story(I haven't read it in quite a long time)

Also, despite the funeral at the beginning, just bear in mind they never found the body.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** Sirius breaks out early and offers eight-year-old Harry another home in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7). Cue uproar over the "kidnapping", a manhunt that brings Remus and Tonks into contact early, Snape learning about Pettigrew's treachery, and Harry having a flawed-but-caring parental figure. Sirius doesn't feel up to the job of raising James' child, but he gives it his all anyway; how could he do less?

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] by TheDivineComedian) takes place towards the end of the first war, with Sirius as a young adult. It really reflects the marauder's mental states as people at war as adults.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13095258][Pot, Kettle, Black]] by TheDivineComedian) is Sirius's perspective in the middle of the first war.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) is an AU post second war with both Remus and Sirius surviving, and while it's Remus's perspective, the Sirius in it is a great complex character.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
