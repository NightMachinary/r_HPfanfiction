Did anyone here participate in any of the livejournal HP fandom communities back in the day? I was browsing through some of the fanfic communities and it's just a desert now. Some communities are still up and you can browse through them like a time capsule, but it sucks when when you click a link to an interesting sounding piece and the journal has been deleted or purged.

I've been trying to save some of my favorite fics from the wreckage of that place, since many of the existing authors profiles have gone dark for a few years, and it's only a matter of time before they the website "purges" them.

LJ had fics of the finest quality in the fandom. I think it's because it was community of like-minded literature and writing nerds. I remember the comment ficathons where people were encouraged to prompt and answer. The creative outpouring was incredible to witness, and there really isn't anything like it anymore. Just the closeness of the community felt so genuine.

Anyone, does anyone else remember LJ in the heyday? What and where did you post on there?


** I was more on LJ to keep up with the daily lives of friends I made on The Sugar Quill (an HP message board) . I'm still friends with some of them on FB. it's kind of wild actually

***** Awesome! I miss the curated nature of CM. I still work with the beta I hooked up with on there! After a 12 year hiatus, I started writing again and post as jenorama on AO3 and FFN. Some old, some new.

Did we interact on CM? Do you remember your username?

****** Probably not as I wasn't really in the forums on CH like I was on SQ. My username there as on AO3 is bando2. I'm friends with my SQ beta and she actually beta's read a grad school paper for me when I first went back to school since that is essentially her professional job. I also got to meet up wit her a few years ago. I really miss the community from sites like SQ and CH sometimes. Also CH had so many unique stories you can't find elsewhere. At least the Quill is still up.

** Oh man. I was a member of so many communities. I participated constantly in a big sorting and Hogwarts houses community. I followed SO many authors. I remember reading fics ON livejournal which is crazy. I remember when the Snarry Olympics got in trouble with the actual Olympics, lol. I visited Sugarquill all the time. There was another community, or set of them - they had differently colored banners? One was the Astronomy tower? I can't remember.. I participated on those boards all the time.

*** I followed mostly authors I think. There were some authors that I absolutely idealized and hung on to every word they wrote. Some those ladies I followed were pretty incredible, and I always if any of them went into writing as a career afterward.

** I miss the LJ days of fandom a lot. Pretty pictures notwithstanding, I never liked Tumblr as a platform as much as LJ, and Twitter is even worse. I have managed to find a lovely community on Discord, but that was largely via sheer dumb luck as it's not really my preferred format either - I'm not a chatty person by nature. Thank goodness for AO3, so at least we have a better and more searchable fic archive now, but the social side of fandom was at its best in the LJ days, imo.

I tended to follow individual authors' journals on LJ more than fic posting communities, but I really miss the reccing communities like [[https://crack-broom.livejournal.com/][crack_broom]] and [[https://crack-van.livejournal.com/][crack_van]] and the fandom newsletters like the [[https://daily-snitch.livejournal.com/][Daily Snitch]], the [[https://quibbler-report.livejournal.com/][Quibbler Report]], and [[https://rs-prophet.livejournal.com/][The R/S Prophet]]. Stuff like [[https://ship-manifesto.livejournal.com/][ship_manifesto]] and [[https://metafandom.livejournal.com/][metafandom]] were also great - Tumblr was never as conducive to those sorts of long-form meta posts as LJ was, and can you even imagine the horror of trying to post serious meta on Twitter?

*** The whole format of LJ was so much more conducive to genuine community and discussion for fandoms. I miss all the communities, I definitely went on crack_broom all the time.

You're lucky to find a discord group! It's not easy to find online fandom groups anymore.

** Those were good times! So many amazing writers and vibrant communities. Ship_manifesto was amazing. I had this Harry/Ron community on rss feed so I could devour any and all fics posted.

Just FYI for those who may not know, quite a few of these OG writers have archived their work on AO3, so if you can remember fic titles or usernames try using the search bar to see if they're there. I was pleasantly surprised to find mad_martha and astolat still posting fics on AO3.
