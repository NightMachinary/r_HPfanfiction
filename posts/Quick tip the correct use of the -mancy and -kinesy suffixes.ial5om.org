In general terms the suffix -mancy denotes to the practice of divination. This means that when words are used that end with this particular suffix they aren't about controlling something, but using Said thing as a way of obtaining information supernaturally.

Thus technically necromancy (the most often used case) denotes to the ability of being able to divine information using the dead. The methods limits or otherwise though are really dependent on the source material or you take from or your imagination, it could mean calling the souls back for questioning, using body parts to get answers...

The -kynesis suffix on the other hand means movement. Yes, it may seem limited to moving objects around at first glance, but in truth it would be much more than that.

Movement in it's boarder sense can mean anything from moving an object around, to directing energy of any kind (heat, electricity, even entropy or more metaphysic forces like luck or life as we are talking about a magical world) in a chosen direction with a given speed, down to manipulating the atoms themselves (opening the possibilities of changing the elements of the target or even play around with atomic fission and fusion) up to outright potentially even crushing down mass in a space small enough to create a black-hole on the surface of earth depending on what kind of limits the author chooses.

P.S.: to clarify, resurrecting the dead probably wouldn't be covered by either of the terms, necromancy would be divining by using the dead while necrokynesis would be moving around death (which would actually be better classified as vitakynesis as death is the absence of life instead of a force by itself-same with heat and cold), which could potentially be closer to the intent depending on the story mechanics but not necessarily.


** I think this is one of those cases where language takes on a new dimension beyond its formal, dictionary, etymologically-implied definition. Necromancy as the "industry standard" for describing raising the dead is very popular and widespread. It's not merely fanfiction writers that use it. Dresden uses it as well, many fantasy video games, etc. Nor is it limited to writing - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy]] - the wikipedia page describes necromancy as bringing people back to life, not merely communicating with them.

*** Yeah, by what I heard it is something that began around the release of D&D games, though it still gets annoying sometimes when the protagonist (not only in this fandom) calls the ability to shape fire ‘pyromancy' instead of ‘pyrokynisis' or just plain fire-manipulation.

** So, could we call forensic medical examiners necromancers? Since they, too, obtain information from the dead... I wonder if murder investigators could be necromancers too?

*** Depends on how far you are willing to stretch the concept of divination, normally it's regarded as something to do with magic, but if you define it as just obtaining information of the corpse... incidentally if aurors/detectives used necromancy to help solve crimes it could have a whole new dimension to the wizarding world abilities to hide and discover crimes.
