The theory I heard was the teachers didn't think the snake was a basilisk because it was petrifying people not killing them. Myrtle being the anomaly.


** I would assume all the part snake creatures/beings can speak parseltongue, likely many of their desendants would as well.

Honestly a Gorgon makes perfect sense as a suspect

*** That's what I was thinking, but another commentor explained perfectly why they might not as well, depending which legend you go with. You should look at it, it's a well written piece of advice.

** There were only three Gorgons if my memory is correct, though there are other creatures than Medusa and her two sisters that have been called that. Depending on the legend in question, she was the only one with Snakes for hair, her two sisters could still kill with a look, but didn't have that particular feature. In some legends, they had scaled skin that could turn almost any blade (Bronze age) claws, wings, and tusks. In some they appeared as beautiful women, in others they were hideous.

Another interesting tidbit, Medusa was Mortal, her sisters could not be killed and would not die of age.

So, depending on how you want to interpret Gorgons in respect to Harry Potter mythology, it is quite possible they could speak with snakes. Though you should make it a point to describe them well, and perhaps give some back story. Perhaps they are akin to Veela?

*** So far the reference to Gorgons is: ""Nagas are demigods, right? Could Salazar Slytherin's wife have been one and she's still around? That would explain her being lonely. A widow for going on a thousand years. Maybe it's their anniversary or something," Reg suggested. "Heart sick, insane with grief."

"Not inane enough for her to speak gibberish though," Solveig added.

"We'll ask her when we find her, but I want to know what she might be before looking for her. I want to know how she petrified Mrs Norris... you know, I only assume Gorgons speak Parseltongue, but do they?" Severus asked, adding that to his list of research questions.

"If Medusa could talk to her own hair then it would be infinitely unfair," Reg commented, tugging on Solveig's wild locks.

Reg is Regulus Black and Solveig is a shape shifter type fey. I might include descriptions of the research at some point, but this fic started in 1976 when Lily refused Snape's apology and I'm /sooo/ close to the end! We're killing the Dark Lord when he attacks Harry and Cedric after the Triwizard Tournament.

Edit: no, you're right, I'm going to have to describe them unless I find another culprit that fits better.

** If you want something that could be confused with a basilisk, consider looking at the cockatrice, they myths surrounding the two of them get quite mixed up in real life. If you give your cockatrice the tail of a snake (some versions are more draconic) then it could very well speak parseltounge. Also consider in evidence against the basilisk that the canon voice says things like 'rip' and 'tear', despite all snakes I think swallowing their prey whole.

*** Exactly, you're a doll! I'd forgotten the bit about a cockatrice being part reptile. I included Occamies as feathered serpents when they were focused on the Parseltongue aspect, but obviously it was disregarded immediately during the actual researching.

**** The old depictions of basilisks in medieval pictures range from snake to cockatrice. I could see making cockatrices into a relative of basilisks, perhaps a byproduct of the magical experimentation that makes basilisks.

****** In my opinion, that could especially make srnse since a lot of descriptions of cockatrices have them with a rooster's head and basilisks are born when a chicken egg is sat on by a toad, you could maybe make a cockatrice be some sort of hybrid breeding creature similar to Hagrid's skrewts made from chickens and snakes with some sort of random thing giving them a petrifying stare.

******* Like, at first Herpo had been trying to do hybrid breeding until he came up with the toad on a chicken egg that produces a basilisk.

******* I read somewhere today a cockatrice is hatched from a chicken egg incubated by a snake, maybe the first snakes used were basilisks and the magic remained for all consequential hatchings.

*** Cockatrices are also part rooster in some myths, and roosters are notoriously territorial. So Hagrid's Roosters being killed could be another piece of "evidence".
