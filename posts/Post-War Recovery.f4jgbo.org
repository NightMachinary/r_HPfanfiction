Looking for stories, preferably completed, that address the recovery process of characters post-war while trying to move forward with life/work/studying.

Nightmares or trouble sleeping, trouble eating normal due to deprivation while on the run or in the ROR, panic attacks/depression/anxitey/PTSD.

Pairing isn't too important but I do lean towards Hermoine with anyone who isn't Ron or Harry, so Draco, Theo, Neville, other Weasley bros, Oliver.

​

Thanks in advance.

** There are two I can think of, though one does pair Hermione with Harry:

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.

  Eighth Year Golden Trio returns. Yes, all three. Characters as close to canon as I can write. Re-building Hogwarts, the Quiddich pitch. Veterans returning, PTSD, rotten privileged PureBloods. Need plural wives? Arrgh! Very slow burn. HP/HG/DG eventually. Will include every cliché, and trope I can remember. Not epilogue or HPCC compliant. Dumbles bashing. M for language.
