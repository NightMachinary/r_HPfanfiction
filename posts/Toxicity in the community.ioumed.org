Im sure everyone have seen toxic people in fanfic comments pushing writers some smile and brave through it others are heavily affected by it even causing some of them to stop writing completely or go on extended periods of break in order to not deal with the undeserved hate . This brings me to the statement “dont like dont read” I know this statement is kind of a joke in the fanfic community but really if people hate certain fanfic so much why do they continue reading and commenting shit like “dropping it”(used only to torment and not give effective criticism) or being rude to the writers if you dont like it move on no one needs to know unless you are giving genuine feedback respectfully. Additionally the comment can hurt the writers who genuinely trying and it just shows how simple minded some people are, and I believe anyone who can think will understand this so why are people pushing authors as if they are not people with emotions. I thinks it's important to realise that writers are people some of them are some of them are bad we all are allowed to criticise works but we shouldn't do it non-respectfully


** Can i suggest going back and formatting your post? it's borderline unreadable. Loads of run on sentences and a complete lack of line breaks makes a long post like this a struggle, at best. You've also got quite a few malformed/unfinished sentences, so while the general idea of your post is clear, it's hard to understand your greater meaning (other than 'be nice!'). I'd suggest a proofread and editing a few sections.

As for the content, my best advice is that people on the internet, are, quite frankly, usually assholes. And while it would be nice if they weren't, that just isn't a fact of life. And when you put yourself out there, in any community, not just this one, There are going to be people who are just plain dickish. all you can really do is have a thicker skin and try to take what use you can even from the more negative comments.

** It sounds like you've had a negative experience and I'm sorry to hear it :( i agree that people should treat others respectfully and supportively, this is a creative space that none of us financially benefit from and are here donating lots of time making fics for fun.

I'd encourage you, if you're getting this kind of treatment, to think about how you can get some space between you and these comments. Whether that's only checking your comments together at the same time/ all at once then closing out, or having a friend mod your comments. I've written a darker fic as a survivor so I have someone else mod those comments because I don't feel resilient to negative feedback on that one.

Whatever you do decide to do, try to protect your positive experience with fics. Even if that's stepping away for a bit or having someone to vent to when you get feedback that's negative. We can't control the wider Internet at large so sometimes it's a matter of protecting yourself. Sorry again you're having trouble aye

** This community, in particular, is very toxic, I agree, but there are plenty of other places to get feedback for your writing. Discord has lots of HP fanfic communities that are well moderated and overwhelmingly helpful and positive.

As for feedback you get to your story directly, criticism comes in two types: people who don't like it and will tell you why, and people who don't like it and troll you. I value the former and ignore the latter.

I can recall one reader that reviewed every single update I made, for 11 chapters telling me how my story was boring and that I wasn't a good writer. Eventually i had to laugh - if my fic is so boring, why was he devouring every chapter I wrote? That's what i mean by a troll.

However, if someone says "I'm not going to continue reading for reasons XYZ", i absolutely take note of what they say and use it to try and better my fic. Even if they are rude about it, it can still be constructive.

In short, if you are looking for feedback in this community, you're wasting your time. Most of the repliers here only want fics where Snape molests students, or just generic canon-rehash. Go on discord. Ironically, even /this community's/ discord server is 1,000x less toxic than its reddit sub. Go figure!

** I'm sorry to say that, but I feel like your post in a bit useless. I don't think the "toxic people" you are complaining about are using this sub, and even if they do, it's not like they will have a change of heart after reading this.

Now, I feel like this fandom is a pretty "mature" one, especially compared to other it is best to not name, and while you can sometimes see some assholes comments under fics (especially on FFN, who let you comment Anonymously), this is the risks on Internet and nothing can really be done about them (except maybe kill the Net Anonymity like some government wish they could, but I don't think it's worth it).

The only thing you can truly do is ignore them and move one. There will always be assholes, and it's impossible to satisfy them all (I have seen 2 "Anonymous" complaining about Harry "acting like a bitch" and "being too hard" on the same chapter).

** Please take comments with a grain of salt. It's something every creator has to deal with.. to create means making yourself vulnerable. While it might be hard, I am happy to say it does get easier.
