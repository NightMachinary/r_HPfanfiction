Generally, the majority of fanfictions I've read do a poor job of showing me what is happening. Often, I feel like I'm reading "And then character A did activity B," making it feel like a grocery list. This is unfortunate, because a lot of decent story ideas can be lost this way. What authors/stories do a good job showing detail and why does it work?


** For those who don't understand this: showing vs telling is a (slightly misunderstood) concept within writing, about whether you want to directly tell your reader what's going on/what's wrong or you want to imply something without directly telling so.

Telling would be, for example: "the man is dangerous"

Showing would be: "the man drew his gun, and, with a deranged smile, shot the woman dead."

Both ways of writing have their strengths. In general, showing gives you more detail, allows you to paint a picture in your head about how the scene looks. It makes your characters more lifelike, too.

Telling can be used when you want to inform your readers about things. In general, it fits within passages that are written by the novelist, and not from the point of view of the character, or in passages that cover a lot of time, a description of someone's life in a very short time. Like:

"Harry truly felt happy here. He gradually felt his stress ebb away, and he felt less like an outcast, a fugitive, to be hunted down for the rest of his life, and more like how he should feel: like a thirteen year old boy."

Lot's of telling, no detailed descriptions of his actions and thoughts, and you cover a lot of ground.

Now, back to the discussion: I think fanfiction is too different from conventional literature for the same rules to apply here as in literature. Small, bite-sized paragraphs, the publishing form is more like a story in a magazine rather than a book and most of fanfictions are wish-fulfillment in text-form rather than a book.

My favourite stories, which include [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] and Backward with a Purpose ( linkffn(4101650) ) have a lot more 'telling' than the books I read, yet they're still really good.

In short: don't use 'showing vs telling' as an indication of how good the story is. If the writer can use both in the right context, then it does make the story better, true, but there's so much more to a story that makes it good or bad.

*** Agreed, while showing rather than telling is often preferable, some fanfic authors take it way too far and it doesn't always fit. A healthy balance of both is always preferable to one or the other.

**** Yeah, the best fanfics are where you don't notice the whole showing vs telling thing (unless you purposely watch out for it). It's just harder reading from a screen, so you miss a lot more fine details while reading fanfic.

*** I agree, fanfiction is one of the few forms of media where telling is much more acceptable. After all, we /already/ know that 'the man is dangerous', we've read the canon which showed us his actions. But there is a line, where bad fanfiction moves into an almost script like form, where nothing is described at all.

** I am generally on the side of "showing", with one important exception that applies specifically to fanfic: if you're going to rehash a canon scene or dialogue without changes, just reference it. We've already read it one hundred and one times (once in canon, and a hundred in other fanfic that rehashed it).

For example, among good fic, linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) is, IMO, a big offender on this front.

*** This is something I really struggled with in my own fic, simply because I couldn't find ways of telling without disrupting the flow. Ultimately I think I did end up doing a rehash, but hopefully it's in so few chapters it doesn't hurt the story too much. It's really easy to do, and so difficult to make it different enough to keep it interesting.

** I think a balance between both is necessary for a good story. Showing everything that happens makes it long-winded, while telling everything happening is, as you said, making it feel like a grocery list.
