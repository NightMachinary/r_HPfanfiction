"Just a childhood friend of your aunt's."


** Not the same person, but surprisingly similar in effect to “Petunia's Letter” by mzzbee linkao3(11676102) and its sequels. Really well written, highly recommended. Still one of the best Petunia-turns-the-corner stories I know about.

*** Snape apparates in the Dursleys' master bedroom. At the exact moment Petunia enters while stroking a leather whip.

"Sev, you naughty boy, you've been snooping through my room again?"

"N-no."

"Maybe I should tell Lily what kind of friends she has."

"No. Please. I'll do anything."

"Then I guess a punishment for a naughty boy is in order."
