Just like the title says. I notice stories within my specifications are staying on the front page much longer than they used to.


** New stories that I follow is getting less updated as well. I would guess it is the old story of getting back to school and work, and then suddenly there isn't enough time to write. When they have settled into a new habit the stories will return.

** Think FFN as a whole is dying off as writers move to other communities. When I was still writing, I personally dropped FFN entirely and moved to SB/SV because those sites provide actual /critique,/ and I know that more than a few people have done the same.

*** What are SB and SV? I use FFN and AO3, more FFN as I find it is easier to search for stories on that site.

some people in the starwars thread I consider quite toxic, and I am sure they consider me the same

*** The younger members (around the 2016 join date and above range) on SB are toxic as fuck these days. There's hardly any substance in their posts and they all try to out alpha nerd people who post actually knowledgeable replies but, for some reason, percieved as unpopular in the forum. It's a gorramn echo chamber of massive proportion these days and not really conducive to nurture a truly creative environment. I suggest writers to not post any stories there. You'll just stunt your growth as a writer.

**** I agree that it's a toxic clusterfuck, but I still see a few voices giving genuine writing advice. It certainly has more of that than I've ever seen from ffn or ao3, which are both hugboxes of legendary proportions.

***** Yeah but AO3 and FF.net's purpose is to publish works, not for feedbacks like SBs creative writing forum so they're naturally going to be thin when it comes to writing advice.

I suggest you join a genuine writing forum instead or a creative writing group irl if you're actually serious about getting better at writing.

****** I would second this. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/scifiwriting/comments/df279x/how_are_you_guys_not_bitter_as_hell/][In this thread on /r/scifiwriting]] I argue that internet strangers are generally NOT good for budding writers to improve their craft. It is a banshee's wail of low-effort criticism, because large groups of people are good at /finding problems/ and not solutions.

**** Well... AO3 really started 10 years ago, and has since taken over FF.net as the most popular fanfiction website. Basically, I think authors are splintering more these days and not cross-posting as much.

There's also less activity because HP is not strictly a fandom for an "active" source anymore. Fandoms all eventually quiet down.

****** By sheer volume, yeah, but it's also been around twice as long so it's had more time to have stories submitted. In terms of web traffic, AO3 is more popular.

I have no idea if either site has stats about how many stories are CURRENTLY being submitted, though.

** I would say so. I remember when it hit 750k and that was years and years ago. Sure, fics get removed/deleted but the number hasn't really increased. Fandom has been stagnant since 2012/2013
