I am looking for a specific Founders' Heir Story that I believe is a H/HR Story. The biggest thing I remember was that there is a Portal to a room of the founders, (where the Heirs speak to the portraits) in the Entrance Hall (possibly?) that only the Heirs can see. I THINK Peeves is also very important in the story.

  A more mature, knowledgeable and motivated Harry Potter goes to school. His fated encounter with Hermione Granger comes sooner as they share a compartment aboard the Hogwarts' Express during their first journey to school. With greater self-confidence, the muggle-born and halfblood will start the long needed reformation of the magical world, hand in hand. HP/HG/DG/LL/OC
