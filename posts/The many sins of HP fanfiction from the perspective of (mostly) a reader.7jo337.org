So I started reading HP fics... somewhere between two and one and a half year ago when tired with difficulty of finding decent Persona fics I've decided to check something that has more fics. And yes, I've found much more good fics, but also much more disappointment. Now after quite a few fics read, some beta-ing and one fic that I'll probably finally stop planning and actually start writing I decided to put some of my feelings in regard to HP fics into a nice ran.

Harry Potter is a series ideal for fanfiction. There is an interesting world outlined, but not very detailed. The original plotting leaves a lot to be desired and we learn about many characters that aren't detailed in books. So much potential... unused.

*Sin 1: Fanfiction basing itself in fanfiction*

Because unfortunately, instead of using what is good in canon, fixing what is bad, and building on things that were only hinted upon we get endless copying of ideas from other fics. Very often I have a feeling that authors didn't even read the main series in years, not even mentioning additional material. Thus tropes repeated, reused and rehashed. That's how we end with "you can't use magic on electronic" despite deluminator appearing in the very first chapter of the series. This is the root of many others and something that hurts fics that otherwise have potential, that's why it takes this honorary first place.

*Sin 2: Exaggerations and generalization of canon elements*

And while some of those tropes were once a new creation, some are a weird mangling of canon elements that get copied time and time again. One of the main forms it represents itself in is an exaggeration. Dursleys' abuse of Harry become much heavier and more physical, one-time joke about Gred and Forge that made sense in context gets beaten to death, one of many sweets that Dumbledore likes - sherbet lemons is made into his giant addiction that he tries to force on everybody. That's caricatural and works only well in comedy. Even not remembering canon a writer should know this.

The other side of the coin is a generalization. One of the Voldemort's aliases was Dark Lord - which like his main one came from the fact that he never outgrew his chuuni phase. Yet in fanfiction all-powerful dark wizards get called Dark Lord and against them fight - of course - Light Lords. Now, that term can be used well - with masses (as much as masses exist in the wizarding society) calling Dumbledore or Harry that because they oppose Voldemort (Now, that I think about it Bright Lord Harry running around and mindraping goblins into his army could also be cool). There was this cool special communication technique that members of the Order of the Phoenix used - having patronus tell a message. Well, in fanfiction everybody who can cast a patronus use it. Also suddenly there are many legilimens and thus everybody has to learn occlumency from the age of four. It seems that for those writers uniqueness is clearly bad and it's better to make everything bland and the same.

*Sin 3: Lack of logic and consequence in introducing changes*

But you know who tends to have unique things? Harry. Because you know, you can get a special cool power from your ancestors if you do special ritual after learning about what powers you can claim from a blood test at Gringotts. I maight've wrote that in a slightly mocking way, but it is not a bad idea in itself. You know what is bad? That Harry is the only character to do that. Instead of fun setting where everybody can throw a cool wild card power at our protagonist, we only have an additional weapon in Harry's arsenal. Many examples of this sub-problem include obscure laws and legal loopholes that only Harry's allies know (but somehow never used them for themselves) and tell him, everyday use magical oaths that only Harry uses to confirm his truthfulness, etc. etc.

I write sub-problem because this is a part of something wider. The changes are introduced but aren't thought through and their consequences aren't fully applied. Magic is now based on math instead of concepts, but spells stay the same, wizarding Britain is ruled in some weird pseudo-feudal system, but there is no basis for why it was created and why it still exists. There are dark magic detectors in Diagon Alley, but they only flared when it was convenient for the plot. Epitome of this are fics which start in the sixt year or so in a setting that got pretty heavily changed from canon one, and yet we are supposed to accept that all the plot so far went exactly like in books (except Hermione was Harry's closest friend, and Ron was tag-along that they didn't tell to go and screw himself because they are nice like that)

*Sin 4: Rehashing*

With the last bit in brackets, you might've thought I will write about bashing now. But let's leave that for later. Keeping the plot the same is a more pressing matter. It's incredible how in absolutely ignoring good parts of the books the worst one - story is often either left alone or made worse. It's incredible how heavily story can get railroaded to get canon results despite all the changes. Harry has people who he knows will believe him? He still won't tell them about hearing voices in pipes. You can detect dark magic? It will never be used to discover Voldemort's possession, Sirius is long free? Pettigrew will escape causing dementors to be deployed. Because surely everybody wants to read same shit again.

*Sin 5: Bashing, whitewashing and blandising*

I promised bashing, you get bashing. Among most helpful things authors provide in the description is the list of bashed characters. It makes it immediately obvious that the fic isn't worth reading. It nicely shows author's childishness - instead of doing something interesting with the character they don't like in a fic, they will forever harp on about his real or perceived flaws. Some of this comes from plot problems - Rowling's story relies heavily on everybody being incompetent (even those characters that should be competent), for example making Dumbledore seem either incompetent or evil. Though somehow bashing authors almost always go "why not both?". Then we have movies to fault - Ron got heavily screwed over there because of Hermione being director's waifu. And of course Sin 1 strikes again, people write bashfics because they've read bashfics.

On the other hand, we have whitewashing. Sometimes it's connected to bashing - if Dumbledore is actually evil, then Voldemort may not be that bad. But largely to blame here are movies. Cut content and good looking actors are very much a reason for all those "Snape/Draco did nothing wrong" fics. Of course, Sin 1 also factors here.

Then we have blandising for "making bland". Remember how in canon Harry had a tendency to backtalk? How Hermione was incredibly annoying and socially awkward at the beginning, etc? Because fic authors clearly don't. The protagonist and his entourage often tend to lose their defining characteristics only to have them replaced by... nothing. Thus bland, uninteresting, empty characters.

*Sin 6: Boring magic*

Well, I've mentioned bland characters, a bland story was a part of a lot of earlier Sins, I also mentioned bland setting, but I want to focus on one of its aspects that personally grates me heavily - magic. Potterverse has a pretty nice concept-based system of magic. Nothing revolutionary, there are some balance problems, but it has potential and a lot of space to fill. And then we have fics where everything is based on magical energy, we have fics where spells are based in math. Where you have millions of shield spells. What a bore. This actually goes back to the Sin 1 heavily - because concept-based magic is nothing new, yet some writers seem to not even get how it could possibly work. Are Harry Potter fics the only fantasy they've read?

I mean, just before I started writing this I had a discussion about Marvel villains - and one of the points was a matter of problems with Doom. So I posted a semi-recent scene of well done Dr Doom in Loki: Agent of Asgard. Here, take a look at it: [[http://i.imgur.com/OIKaynq.jpg][1]] [[https://i.imgur.com/u8Thar4.jpg][2]]

Or let's go crazier. From A Certain Magical Index: New Testament

#+begin_quote
  This is the right person. Luca uses a special form of combat linked to the Voodoo found in the Caribbean where pirates once ruled. To perform a great variety of ceremonies on the limited space of a ship, she is a magician who follows Legba Atibon, the god of the gate who manages all ceremonies. Legba Atibon indirectly appears in all Voodoo ceremonies, so he does not just exist on a specific ceremonial day and he is defined as existing at all times. Luca has used this to achieve control of subjective time, allowing her to freely change the age of her external appearance and to prepare magic that would normally be a once-in-a-decade event in only a second.
#+end_quote

Alternatively, you could always do research.

*Sin 7: Lack of basic research*

For example, so many writers have no idea what to do with arithmancy (and yet they feel the pressing need to include it), despite that they could simply read some of more known books on the subject of numerology and get educated. Here, let's take a look at Agrippa's Second Book of Occult Philosophy.

#+begin_quote
  Numbers, therefore, are endowed with great and sublime vertues. For it is no wonder, seeing there are so many, and so great occult vertues in naturall things, although of manifest openations, that there should be in numbers much greater, and more occult, and also more wonderfull, and efficacious, for as much as they are more formall, more perfect, and naturally in the celestialls, not mixt with separated substances; and lastly, having the greatest, and most simple commixtion with the Idea's in the mind of God, from which they receive their proper, and most efficacious vertues: wherefore also they are of more force, and conduce most to the obtaining of spirituall, and divine gifts, as in naturall things, elementary qualities are powerfull in the transmuting of any elementary thing. Again, all things that are, and are made, subsist by, and receive their vertue from numbers. For time consists of number, and all motion, and action, and all things which are subject to time, and motion.
#+end_quote

Later follows an explanation of meanings of numbers, their connections and everything you need to get inspired to write some good arithmancy.

Worth noting is that in this text there is also a certain word - "God". Another thing that completely flies over the head of most writers is how religion and occult were connected or occult and science for that matter. Of course, the problem is wider and very visible with stuff like historical elements.

*Sin 8: Bad writing*

Now, now. I know all of this could be chalked up to bad writing. But I mean more general things - bad pacing (in so many fics it takes forever for anything to happen), lack of stakes (because curbstomping and power fantasies), ideal insta-romances (more fantasies), dull writing, bad attempts at purple prose etc. etc. Of course, that's the one hardest to escape. But writers can improve - there's just one problem.

*Sin 9: Ignoring feedback*

Well, I actually can understand why some people may ignore my feedback, I tend to give it harsh and unfiltered, and tend to write very sarcastically if the fic is really bad. Still, I've seen people who first directly ask for feedback and then completely ignore all problems pointed to them by people much more polite than me. Really, the first step to improve is actually wanting to improve. Being convinced of the perfectness of your work is contrary to that.

And that ends my rant (at least this one), I complained and now I can feel better. Probably you've encountered those and just nodded along, maybe you are guilty of those and now you'll set upon to change your ways, maybe you think those are no problems at all or maybe you agree only partially. Maybe, just maybe, if you have an opinion it's a good idea to share it.


** I think that these "sins" are often just the mark of a novice writer- someone who is writing for a particular reason but hasn't written anything before or hasn't written much before. They don't usually have a beta or editor. They don't go through a lengthy publishing process that weeds out their errors and inconsistancies (or all out bad stories). What you're generally seeing in most fanfiction stories is a first draft.

And I think that's awesome.

Hear me out. Obviously, there are plenty of stories that you look at wonder just WHAT the writer was thinking. But that writer might be eleven years old and just starting out. They might be writing through a personal crisis. They might just be posting it up on the internet because they fell into fandom and they want to make something too.

To me, it's like shitting all over a five year old for drawing a smiley face. Is it great art? No. But it's art, and they made it and wanted to share it with you.

If you go over to /r/ books, you'll hear stories about publishers who have to go through all manner of dreck and it's mostly original fiction. And who can forget "she breasted boobily" in that satire about how men write about women?

Most of these sins are born of a few important details about the writer:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    1) Sin 1: Fanfiction basing itself in fanfiction
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Because AU's exist, and sometimes we like to play with characters in a different sandbox. Everyone has their headcanons.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 2: Exaggerations and generalization of canon elements
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Crackfic is an explanation for some of this, but some of this comes from not being very good at writing characters or having a different priority for the story. For example, maybe you want to write a love story between two main characters, so you need background characters to fill the story out a bit or to show up for whatever reason to advance the plot. Sometimes going with a stereotypical portrayal is like shorthand for "here's this character, you know them and how to expect them to behave."

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 3: Lack of logic and consequence in introducing changes
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

This is usually because most fic writers who write a longer story end up writing it in short bursts. They change something and then the plot goes somewhere else and they forget about the thing they introduced earlier unless it's central to the plot. This would normally be caught in the editing process, but most fanfics are not edited after they are finished.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 4: Rehashing
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

This seems boring and stupid, but it also establishes just how much is being pulled from canon and how much is being changed. If you're adding a bunch of headcanons or canon distortions, you'll need to explain what /didn't/ change at least a little bit or it will confuse the reader. Less experienced writers will infodump instead of sprinkling information through dialogue and narrative.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 5: Bashing, whitewashing and blandising
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

This is a problem, but it's largely a problem of trying to introduce other characters that aren't important to the main story that the writer wants to write and then trying to stay on track. If you're writing a romance, the villain is usually used as a plot device to bring the lovers together. How lame he or she turns out to be doesn't always matter if the drama of the romance is realized. Bashing characters can also be shorthand for "I have a different OTP so I have to break up Canon Relationships first so my OTP can happen."

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 6: Boring magic
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

As I mentioned before, a lot of fanfic isn't about what it seems to be about. It's playing in the HP sandbox and making two characters make out with each other, so the usage of magic once again just becomes a plot device for the main idea of the story (usually romance). There are fanfics that specifically explore magic and how to use it in creative ways. But many just have an endgame of describing Draco and Harry kissing.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 7: Lack of basic research
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I would argue that fanfic is the modern day pulp fiction. People write similar stories with similar themes with minimal research because it's fun and it's for their own gratification and it's not really about being a detective or a spy or a wizard. It's about people feeling Big Feelings and having Intense Experiences. Which is not necessarily going to require you to do extensive research on the French Reformation. Obviously, if you're going to write your own story for hopeful publishing, you want to do some research, but most fanfic is written for fun or as a way to decompress, so it's not usually going to be the norm and that's fine.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 8: Bad writing
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

See above- most fanfic writers are teenagers or just starting out writing and are VERY intimidated. I've helped a couple writers who were TERRIFIED to post their first stories to start writing, and they really have grown just by getting the content MADE. It is said that you have to write at least a million words before you become a halfway decent writer, and honestly, that's kind of true. But it doesn't mean that anyone has the right to be a gatekeeper to the fanfic community.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Sin 9: Ignoring feedback
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

If someone ignores your feedback, it's because you both misunderstood what "feedback" meant and meant different things. Maybe they meant "I want to know if it made you feel deeply about the thing I was writing about" and you meant "this needs to be edited a lot and it needs an overhaul of the overall plot, and though I liked some of the dialogue, I feel that these characters were very out of character." So they end up being upset because they thought you were saying "this is utter shit never write again." and you get frustrated because you thought that they wanted to know all of the details they can use to improve.

I know I don't write for criticism. I've taken constructive criticism in the past, but I also reserve the right to disagree with it. But when someone asks for comments/feedback, most of the time, they want to know what you enjoyed. They want to know the moment in their chapter that stuck out to you and made you think about it. They want to know what you want to know more about. They usually don't want to know you're having a Bad Time and think that they need to change a good 50% or more of what they've done.

Just my two cents, though. As a fanfic writer who's written over a hundred stories and more than two million words, I've found that the most important thing is that you have to keep writing. Even if it's hard. Even if you don't want to. Even if it's utter shit when you look at it. Because when you make it, you're taking a step forward and you're getting a bit better.

You can only get better if you keep writing.

So keep sinning, y'all. It's good for you.

I can count on one hand the number of people I know in real life that know I write Harry Potter fan fiction. It took me forever to even tell my husband because I was afraid that he would think my writing was utter shit. I have a lot of admiration for kids that put their writing out there for others to see--it's sharing a very personal part of oneself.

*** I disagree with 7.

You can write an entire story without doing any research. But if you start include real life stuff then a quick Google/Wikipedia search should be mandatory. Want to include video games? Do a quick search what was available back then and which platforms were used. Want to include figher jets for some reason? Look up what was used during your story timeline. I'm not expecting accurate weather every day but if you claim that a winter is the coldest in living memory better back up than claim or give an explanation for the anomaly (dark ritual gone wrong for example).

**** I started an original story not too long ago that was set in Long Island, NY. In my story, the young dad was fond of baseball and I looked online (via Google) to see which team the New York Mets were playing, who was pitching, what was the final score, who were the players on each time, and the weather for that particular night (thunderstorms gathered after the Mets beat the Tigers, 3-2 at Shea Stadium). For some reason, I like doing research when writing either Harry Potter FF or an original of mine. But I agree, one can write a story without conducting an ounce of research.

Many of the examples I gave (because almost all are from actual fanfiction) come from authors for whom it's not the first fic. But that's a digression. While some stuff mentioned here (particularly bad writing) clearly comes from inexperience, other stuff isn't in any way tied to writer's skill level. You really should know original if you write *fan*fiction, it's not some great enlightenment that comes from writing thousands of words - it's common logic.

#+begin_quote

I completely don't see how this relates to what I wrote. Also, I don't understand what your definition of headcanon is.

Yeah, what you write here doesn't make sense at all, because it completely doesn't account for railroading.

Actually, I got bored to reply to every point here because it largely boils to one thing - you explaining why those problems happen. And it doesn't matter why they happen, what matters is that they shouldn't.

#+begin_quote

I wrote "feedback" here, but in many cases, authors directly used such words as "constructive criticism".

And that's a root of our disagreement. You believe that writing alone will lead to improvement. I don't think that's true. You have to realise what are you doing wrong to become better. And it's always the hardest to realise your own mistakes. That's exactly why in professional world there are editors and why fanfiction writers use beta-readers. That's why critical reviews are needed.

I wrote this post because I was annoyed with how I couldn't find anything decent to read recently, but I also hope that some people who write or who plan to write will see it and avoid falling into pitfalls mentioned there.

**** Wow. So basically you're saying that a sort of writing that people do for fun and for no compensation whatsoever needs to cater to your needs and be canon compliant and professional novel quality or else they shouldn't even bother trying to write.

That's not entitled* at all.*

I would, however, like to ask you this: exactly how many stories have you written? Have you done the research and spent the time writing and revising a novel?

The point of fanfic is that anyone can write it and anyone can write whatever they want. It doesn't have to be your otp or the story you want to read.

When you start trying to act like a gatekeeper, you sound like a stuck up jerk. Don't like something? Don't read it.

As someone who's written over two million words of original works and fanfic, you do get better just by writing.

So if you're not this chucklehead and you're reading this, /please/ keep writing. You will get better.

You can complain all you like about what you think ought to be, but you honestly cannot suggest that everyone but the best writers (arbitrarily decided by who, exactly?) of fanfiction (which is free to read and written for free) stop posting fanfic and just magically wait until they're good at writing? That's absurd.

If you want to read properly vetted stories, why not look at artist approved stories in the universe such as The Cursed Child or the James Potter series?

I've heard the same tired arguments for why deviating from canon is a mortal sin. Or portraying characters as gay. Or writing Time Turner nonsense. I wrote a funny story about Snape being covered in glitter because it was amusing for me and my friends. I didn't write it to have some hipster snob tell me that I didn't explain every detail well enough or go into the history of glitter and therefore I should just shut up.

I mean, I'm a pretty non confrontational sort. If you leave a shitty review on my story, I'll just delete it. But if you think for one second that I'm going to listen to your long winded armchair philosophizing tirade about how my writing is not what you wanted and that I need to cow-tow to your demands, I hope that writing it was gratifying for you because it sure as hell is going to get ignored or deleted by most authors and rightly so.

I don't feel entitled to readers. Why should readers feel entitled to force authors to write what they want for free?

Maybe you should consider writing it yourself if it's so easy.

Clearly, you either intentionally misrepresent what I write, or can't comprehend what you read. If this is the former - then stop doing that, if it's the latter then learn to. Then we can discuss things.

  This actually goes back to the Sin 1 heavily - because concept-based magic is nothing new, yet some writers seem to not even get how it could possibly work. Are Harry Potter fics the only fantasy they've read?
#+end_quote

Honestly, the answer is probably yes. They are the type that read YA fiction, which covers a wide number of story types, and usually use such magics as plot devices, rather than stories in and of themselves /exactly like JK Rowling did/. Your average YA reader is not going to delve into theoretical conceptual magic any more than they will theoretical quantum physics. They don't care, and quite frankly I don't blame them.

Then there's the fact that Harry Potter features a bunch of children running around like their heads are cut off. Children who are new to magic and uneducated in its subtleties. Have you ever seen a fight between novices in just about anything? It's a glorified slapfight. Most magical adults are not much better; they learn what they need to and are done with the lot. The only time you get competent, thoughtful use of magic is among people like Dumbledore and Voldemort, the first being a highly intelligent and widely studied scholar, and the other being a magical prodigy. The academics and the naturally talented. So it's really no surprise that a series that focuses on children, fights at a child's level.

The problem is when they start writing magic and detailing it ending up with stuff like "he has a three times bigger magical core with two times bigger mana output".

As I mentioned, Rowling's system may not be perfect, and definitely not detailed as that wasn't her priority, but at its core, there is a nice and elastic system. And yet some people clearly fail to get it. And I don't just mean fanfiction. A lot of people here and or [[/r/harrypotter]] instantly try to apply rules of physics to it when discussion arises.

Re: Sin 8

IF YOU ARE WRITING A FIRST PERSON STORY, ONLY ONE CHARACTER SHOULD BE IN FIRST PERSON, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE STORY SHOULD BE FROM THAT PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER CHARACTER'S PERSPECTIVE, SWITCH TO THIRD PERSON. OR SECOND PERSON, IF YOU WANT TO BE EXPERIMENTAL.

Also easily done utilizing third person, and frankly, part of the point of first person is that we understand all the events /as the one person who is essentially narrating the story to us perceives them/.

They're not just preferences, they are /justified preferences/ by reference to moderately universal values. For example, if you value originality then the argument behind #1 is sound.

When making something based on the success of a larger work there is a desire to over use the existing IP as much as possible. The example that comes to mind is the Firefly Board Game, which let's you recruit every character, major and minor, to fly on your ship. Like that universe is so small that you are likely to run into the exact same people and no one new. Course there components all use images from the show, why spend the money to create new assets? (Decent game btw, but if Firefly felt like a window into another world, the game feels like I am exploring that window, not exploring that world)

You see this a lot, books based on movies, fanfiction, even sequels sometimes. Often they expand something from the original work (not a bad thing), but try to avoid taking any risks of introducing new concepts that might turn off fans. The result is the original work giving the impression of being a small part of a larger world, while the derived work feels constrained.

- Edit, Universal Issue as in it appears a lot in all types of derivative works, not that it is in every derivative work. Also, my phone thinks derivative is not a word :|

** OP from your points it's pretty clear that you like fanfic based in reality with clear, sensible ground rules and characters who aren't dumb. In other words, stuff that the majority of people in this site don't lile.

I think your be better off trying to get into Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, and the entire concept of rational fiction from there. Its not for everyone, but I think your enjoy the fact that the author takes time and effort to make the story internally and logically consistent.

*** I don't know what was the exact way of thinking that led you to believe that I look for something like HPMoR, but it was clearly a wrong one.

Methods of Rationality were my first Harry Potter fic and I rate them 4/10.

**** You clearly have a very high standard for your fanfics, and rational fics are the only thing that even come close to approaching the conditions you've set out.

fanfics in general don't care about having internally consistent magic systems, or long-term character development, theyre focused on one or two things that the author cares about.

Most rational fics aren't like HPMOR, that was just an example (would like to know why you didnt like it though). I'd check out [[/r/rational]] to get a better idea of what I mean, and in particular I'd recommend a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APracticalGuideToEvil][Practical Guide to Evil]] (TV Tropes Link) and see if you like it. It's not HP fanfiction, but That's a more typical idea of what rational fiction is like. I think you'd like it!

My previous experience with them says otherwise. They always seem to be more focused on showcasing writer's opinions than presenting a good story.

Unless, you know, they are good. Of course, there are not many of those (and that's why I wrote this post), but they exist and somehow all the ones I've encountered so far weren't rationalfics.

- Author wanking his philosophy all throughout with a great example being Harry getting super-powerful in a space on one year because he "thinks rationally" (and yes, I know how this is explained, his powering is still bullshit).
- Poor pacing, there are many unneeded scenes that bloat the fic incredibly and most do nothing to build either the characters (despite being this long, basically only five characters are given any personality) or to move the plot forward.
- Said plot lacked in any real conflicts until the end.
- "Let me explain all my plans to you" speech.
- Incredibly unsatisfying ending that relies on even bigger deus ex machinas than those employed by Rowling.

Thanks for the recommendation, I've heard of it and had it somewhere far along my plan to read, but I'll trust you and move it forward.

** I always hate the marriage law trope; It makes zero sense from a math perspective. Usually the wizard govt. in these fics make a law to force a baby-boom after the war, because the population is so low. Yet instead of forcing magic users to marry /each other/, they should /encourage/ magic users to marry muggles, because if 2 magic people get married and have 3 kids, that's three new wizards, but if they both married muggles and had 3 kids, that's 6 new magical children.

ETA. I haven't bashed the OP at all. I do feel that they seem to be attaching a disproportionate amount of importance to fanfiction when there are more important things to worry about. And I warned them that they were likely to get into an argument. That's all.

Yeah no. This is textbook bashing the OP, and the insulting thing is it totally dismisses his opinion without offering anything relevant to the discussion. At least the top comments explained why they disagreed. You? Your advice is literally "talk shit get hit". Domt pretend otherwise.

**** I used to think that way- there's value in criticism, after all. However, remember that most fanfic is published by young authors, giving them a realm to make mistakes. The way that you phrase your argument still comes across as condescending. The issues that you see aren't new issues- people have brought them up countless times when addressing the issues they have with fics.
