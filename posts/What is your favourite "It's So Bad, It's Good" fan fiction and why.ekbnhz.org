My favourite would have to be either "Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles" or "My Immortal". HSOPAM because its just so funny and so unrealistic. I mean, I'm 100% sure it's a troll pic, but it's done really well. I read it for the first time with commentary ([[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj3oseYpezmAhWLYcAKHUbgDJsQFjAIegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbnest.wordpress.com%2F2015%2F05%2F26%2Fhogwarts-school-of-prayer-and-miracles-chapter-1-with-commentary%2F&usg=AOvVaw1WmbRpbAVfRGnomAt-F7pG]]), and it was just so fucking funny, I died. Anther thing I like about it, and fits like it is the fact that though this is undoubtedly a troll, there are actual people like this, who believe in these ideals. Also, I just fucking love the fact that in this fic, God does the chores. And Grace Ann has great A/Ns.

My Immortal is so fucking bad, and so badly written; I just started to laugh when I read it. It was clearly written by an angsty 15 year old (though who am I to comment, I'm writing a reddit post about Harry Potter fanfics) who knows exactly what she's doing wrong, but fuck it, she's gonna do it anyway, cuz she gets to express her emotions through this horrible Mary Sue, and she gets to make people laugh. My Immortal, I believe, all has a lot hidden away. Read this article after reading the pic, and you might think differently: [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiWgq_wpuzmAhWNN8AKHT4RAQUQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2017%2Fsep%2F12%2Fmy-immortal-why-the-famously-awful-harry-potter-fanfiction-isnt-bad-at-all&usg=AOvVaw3VM9En8sJ3K31tGnjNt1Qi]]

Anyway, I've told you mine, now tell me yours. PLEASE. desperate here.
