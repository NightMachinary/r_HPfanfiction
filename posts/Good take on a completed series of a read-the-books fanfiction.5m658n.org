By completed I mean the 7 books.

Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5i6m67/serious_take_on_the_readthebooks_trope/]] , I found Hogwarts Read (A series of them that's completed until year 4) which I enjoyed, however it is not completed.

So, I need fanfictions that have the 7 books completed and is similar as possible to Hogwarts Reads in terms of plot and characters ( Sirius gets saved , Umbridge, Bones, Dumbledore, Lupin , hogwarts 4 houses all included in the readings)


** I've never really approved of these. They just push a lot of wrong buttons for me. But this is a sub that helps people find fics, so I'll point you in the right direction. If there is a 7 years completed Reading fic, then this FFN community will probably have it.
