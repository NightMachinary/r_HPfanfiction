From what I remember Susan and Harry were together but had split at the beginning, Harry was the headmaster at Hogwarts (I think) and it started to be a Harry/Hermione until Susan came back to bring back the triwizard tournament and reeled Harry back in with possibly fake miscarriage causing her to run off so they get back together but he's miserable because Susan's a bit nuts and it ends with being Harry/Hermione again If anyone knows the fic from that rambling you're a better person than I Thanks
