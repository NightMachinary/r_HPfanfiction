Should include horcrux-making scenes (and some spellfight), and it'd be great if it kinda reads like a horror fiction.


** I've always wanted this as well. have been thinking about writing some fanfic recently, maybe I'll write it myself!

â€‹

Do you reckon it should be from Voldemort's perspective, or just narrating his life, just as the HP books narrate Harry's?

** The thing that comes to the closest is Tom Riddle's Schooldays, but it looks kinda abandoned now.

** I've been thinking of writing one, through his POV.

But adding a little bit of a twist, try to make him as unreliable as possible, and it starts after the creation of his 1st Horcrux.

So to the reader they could infer that he has lost the plot and is unreliable, or maybe he is telling the truth on why he is Voldemor a little inspiration from Joker.

Or I would wrote a Brroklyn 99 style fic with the Death Eaters.

  In the end, it didn't really matter what road he took. Tom Riddle's destiny was, is and will always be in the form of Lord Voldemort.
