:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Snape travels back in time ( I think). He arrives just before Harry turns 11.

He gets over his hatred of Harry and intercepts Harry and Hagrid in Diagon Alley, and takes Harry around instead. Or maybe Hagrid isn't even a part of it.

I might be thinking of two fics amalgamated.

Snape mentors Harry and comes to actually care for him.

If he does time travel, he tells Harry about the time travelling on the 18th bday or smt like that.

Thanks for any help finding this.

** Is it a fic where Harry gets a pet coral snake, goes into Hufflepuff, and cures lycanthropy?
