Don't comment an OC that you plan on writing into a fanfic later on, just in case someone comes along and steals it. Comment anything and everything about them you'd like (name, gender, era, allies, friends, S/O, sexuality, blood status, family, quirks, skills, hobbies, etc).


** I've always hoped to find a story with an OC who is muggle born and is willing to destroy magic in order to either protect his/her family or to retaliate against death eaters. I don't write fanfic but I love to imagine a story where the OC is researching why some people can do magic and some can't, figures it out and is tempted to use that knowledge as a weapon. This is roughly how it goes in my head; OC gets a Hogwarts letter at age 11 and doesn't want to go (for some reason, maybe not wanting to leave friends/family or because of some ambition in the muggle world) but finds out its not really optional. He or she gets through the Hogwarts years somewhat smoothly but somewhere along the way starts to develop radical views- that muggles should move to control magic and magical people/ creatures. She has an internal line in the sand where she will do nothing up to a point but once the line is crossed (by Voldemort and followers) she is all in on destroying the magical world. I'll never write it but I would love to read it. Also, as an aside, is OC other cannon or original character?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** My dream OC is a muggleborn raised in an orphanage (parents are dead). He runs away from the orphanage and live on the strets begging, His life is pretty bad and his only scape from the bad enviroment are some old superhero comics that he finds on the trash. When his first accidental magic happens he doesn´t know it´s magic and he thinks it´s a superpower, he thinks he is a superhero (orphan + abilities). He learns that his "powers" appear mostly in dangerous situations so he starts putting himself in danger to do heroic things. His stunts are perceived by the ministry and when he is captured he realizes that he isn´t unique or a superhero and he hates it. He is send to live in a foster home of sorts for magical children and there he learns about the history of the wizard world, specially about the recent war against Voldemort and the savior, Harry Potter. He suddenly realizes that the Hero spot of this world is filled and that he was never meant to be a Hero, he decides then to become the worst villain that this world has ever seen. (This could be told as a background history or downright played as a fic from his POV). I was watching Unbreakable (the M.Night movie) and thought of this plot.

ps: This is my first post here in this subreddit and I hope my english is clear enough for you guys to understand it ^{^}

EDIT: Forgot to actually describe the character LOL. Anyway he would be a male, named Brian. Intelligent, smart, hard working but full of desire for power and to prove himself. His physical appearence is common, brown hair and eyes, normal height.

**** Thank you! Yeah, I kind like this plot but I don´t write any fic in years honestly and I don´t think I ever wrote any HP fic... I´m usually a one-shot kind of writer, so I guess if anyone want to try this plot bunny, be free to try it xD

** I want a humanist OC who wants to use magic for the betterment of all people. Hagrid supported the Statute of Secrecy so mages don't have to be bothered to help others; this OC would view it as a duty and a privilege to help everyone possible.

The /Aguamenti/ charm would be of immense interest -- clean running water anywhere you want! Enchanting an ewer of endless water would be handy, but it would be much more useful to enchant a golem that can create ewers of endless water.

She'd want to look into how the magical world produces food, how it deals with trash, space enhancement charms, and medicine. It's a good way to get into a lot of the mechanics of magic and its limitations.

** I've wanted to write about a girl who doesn't quite possess the gifts of her peers. She's the only child born to a pureblood family, but not one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. In the beginning, the parents are excited, wondering when her first accidental magic would surface, what her House would be, the subjects she likes, etc. But her magic never seems to manifest. As time passes, people go from mentioning that a late start can make a stronger witch to quit inquiring all together. You see them pull back from their family and friends.

They're overjoyed when the Hogwarts letter arrives, but their hopes are dashed when a wand never matches her or reacts in any way. Ollivander attempts to custom make a wand to her, but is unsuccessful. They send her to Hogwarts with her great-grandmother's wand. Despite her efforts, she can't seem to do any wanded magic or produce any sort of response from her wand. She has consultations with Madam Pomfrey and then St Mungo's, but no one knows the issue, cause, or cure. She struggles socially with her difference. If she's present when the Chamber is opened, that's another source of stress.

For her second year, Dumbledore pulls her from Charms, Transfiguration, and Defence and starts her early in the elective classes. From an educational standpoint, it's sensible, but it also highlights the difference between her and her classmates. She finds it hard to keep up with the older students in class and cannot seem to find her place or friends. She spends more time with professors, ghosts, books, and House-elves than students.

At some point, she begins to gain her feet. Finds out she has a small talent in Divination, finds workarounds to succeed despite her limitations in Herbology, Potions, etc. Her parents have another child and it soon shows signs off accidental magic. Her world seems to unravel and she feels lost again. The war is beginning and she fears her place in it as a not-quite-Squib.

That's as far as I've gotten. Garth Nix's Lirael started the idea off, but I definitely don't want her to become a powerful badass. Just an average girl who doesn't quite fit. Maybe an opportunity to explore other areas of magic
