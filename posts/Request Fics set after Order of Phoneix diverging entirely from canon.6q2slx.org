I just re read the God of the Lost by Gravidy and honestly it is superb. It just keeps the atmosphere introduced by Rowling and diverges entirely from canon. The only fics which do the same is Becoming Neville and Harry Potter and the Strange Disappearance of Sally Ann Perks. Another question: Which fanfic website was the most popular when Harry Potter was written like I am talking in the era of 2002-2007 ? . Honestly I would like to read the guessing what the next book would be kind of fics


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge) When Harry fought of Voldemort's possession, he infected the Horcrux with parts of his personality, most importantly, his empathy (also his sense of humor, considering the banter between the two.) He uses the threat of an invisibility cloaked Moody to keep the Dursley's in line during summer. (It's a bluff, but it works, and gives Harry an out when he becomes too expressive while talking to Tom.)

  When Harry returns home to Privet Drive after the fiasco at the Department of Mysteries, he finds that Voldemort's possession released the Horcrux inside of him. In addition to the companionship of "Tom", Harry has his knowledge, and must learn to use it
