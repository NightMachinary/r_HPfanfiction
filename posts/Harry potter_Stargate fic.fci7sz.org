:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a stargate xover and I can't find it anymore, Harry finds a stargate somewhere and a ship, then he goes and gets a city ship and makes like nine of the power crystal things.

apparently wizards are aliens?

Harry has his first girlfriend (fleur) as a hologram thing that test flies all the ships and gives him knowledge and helps with stuff

Oh and Harry starts dating a 10000 year old goddess or something, might've been another fic though.

Please help me find this I loved that fic and I wanna love it again

*** I remember trying to read it but the constant escalation of power Harry wielded made me nope out of it. The writing is also quite bad, don't recommend it.
