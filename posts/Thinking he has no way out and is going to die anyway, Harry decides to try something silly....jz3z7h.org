And it works, because of the Magic and Intent thing.

"Any last words Potter?" mocked Voldemort. "Just one" decided Harry, cupping his hands. "Kamehameha" Harry then blinked as Voldemort was consumed by a blue beam of energy. "Huh, Magic is weird"


** "Okaaay... Magic?" Harry calmly asked Narcissa Malfoy, the nearest Death Eater. She nodded quietly, as did Bellatrix. "Intent and will. I told you in the Ministry." she reminded him absently, eyes wide in disbelieving shock. "Yeah. Yeah, I remember. So, if I intend and will to do THIS..." Harry focused. With a war cry of "IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!", the small teenager was replaced by a large, rock-like monster that proceeded to begin smashing the living hell out of Nagini's protective cage. The first overhead hammer blow caused the orb-like shield to spiderweb, and the second destroyed it completely. A kick caught a panicking Nagini in the head, throwing her into a tree with enough force to shake the ground; she landed on the forest floor with her head at an unnatural angle, obviously dead.

"Alright then." Harry said, shrinking back down to his normal size. Hagrid was eying him with awe. Some of the younger Death Eaters had read that comic book as an act of teenage rebellion, and looked terrified; if Potter could do that, what else could he do? Thinking of the Horcrux in his head, he asked a cowering Lucius to Transfigure a silver crucifix for him. Lucius looked at him oddly, but used a borrowed wand to do so. Taking it in his hand, he turned it towards himself. "I cast thee out, unclean spirit!"

An unbelievable agony tore through his head, more intense than anything he could remember. As he fought to stay conscious, an unnaturally black ooze begin to seep from the lightning bolt scar. The ooze pooled on the ground. As the cut sealed over, the oily substance formed into a screaming face that was quickly absorbed into the ground. "And so ends the tale of Dark Lord Voldemort." Harry smiled.

** Harry Potter as the Turtle sage would be a hilarious post-Hogwarts thing to write. Ron starts the mad scientist fad when he accidentally sells an expansion charmed object to Papa Briefs, Hermione fucks up so hard researching werewolves she accidentally creates dinosaurs and animal people, Luna launches the Red Ribbon charity for muggleborn which gets suborned by a Dark Lord etc. 50 years later, Dragon Ball begins.

This would actually be rad as hell.

  Harry kept circling Voldemort, in preparation for their final Duel ... their final showdown. But seriously? How could he, an average at best STUDENT take out the most powerful Dark Wizard of All Time?

  It was Dudley, really. Who had half jokingly suggested. At the time Harry had completely discounted the idea. It sounded preposterous. But, if he was going to die anyway? Might as well go out with a bang, as they say!

  Pointing his wand at Voldemort, who still monologued on, as Villains oft do, Harry sneaked his free hand into his pocket. There was something round, metallic, and yeah ... the clip! Harry pulled it off. Counting seconds ...

  "Hey Voldie!" Harry shouted, pointing his wand to the side, behind Voldemort, rattling debris on the floor, distracting Dark Lord for just a split second,

  "Catch!" Harry shouted, tossing the grenade at him and threw himself to the ground, casting strongest shield charm he could manage ...

  KABOOOM

  When Harry looked up, Voldemort was ... blown up. Peaces of him raining down, blood splattered everywhere, shocked silence followed ...

  "Bloody Hell," Harry mumbled in disbelief.
