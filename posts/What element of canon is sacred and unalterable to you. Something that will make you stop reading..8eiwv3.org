For me, I am inexplicably protective of James and Lily. For instance, in To Reach Without presents their union as a loveless arranged marriage and I couldn't keep reading.

In The Rune Stone Path, Their marriage was on the rocks right before their deaths and if I remember correctly, Lily is Bi for some reason and wasn't really into guys, she just wanted a baby.

I don't know why, but I cannot stand to see that element changed in any form.

Not to mention HPMOR's author literally takes the primary villain and antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort, who is presented as irredeemably evil by Rowling at the end of /Deathly Hallows/, and says, "well, maybe /Voldemort/ was the right one".

It's not just HPMOR that bothers me with this behavior, however. If I see other HP fanfiction authors utterly deviate from the internal messages of the original /Harry Potter/ books, twist, misrepresent, or Flanderize them (or the characters), it makes me immediately drop the story. Especially true if it's the author doing so in order to use their fanfiction as a political soapbox, or for the sole purpose of not liking Rowling's views.

I feel like you went on an entirely unrelated rant to my comment here, but okay.

Uhm, do you think the underlying message of Rowling's books is that Voldemort is evil because he opposed death? I don't agree with this at all. Though Rowling may agree with Dumbledore's approach towards death (embrace it, next big adventure).

Sure, Yudkowsky opposes Dumbledore's view that death has to be embraced, but I don't see that at all as integral to the Harry Potter series. He IMHO makes some good points that defeating death might be a universal moral good and that it's a bit ridiculous to be happy that everyone has to die eventually.

Voldemort is still the main antagonist in HPMOR and he's evil. Yudkowsky just points out that it is not "trying to overcome death" that makes him evil.

How is chiming in to your post, with a relevant example, "going on an entirely unrelated rant"? Adding to a discussion in a calm manner, last I checked, is not a "rant". Please don't try to portray or call it such, even if you happen to disagree.

This is literally what you posted:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I was pointing out how HPMOR is an example of this, because the message, in regards to Death, is "power conquers all". Not to mention HPMOR's author literally killed off Hermione, one of Harry's best friends, later in the story, and makes it out like Harry /not/ having friends before Hogwarts - something which is a cornerstone of Harry's character in the original books, and emphasized by Rowling - was only bringing Harry down.

Because, without friends, HPMOR makes it out like Harry would be much more intelligent and knowledgeable. To me, the message is, "Who needs friends when you have books?". Now, in the original /Harry Potter/ books, J.K. Rowling actually adresses this with Hermione, not Harry, who is depicted as miserable before she befriends Ron and Harry.

Notice how Rowling's message is basically the opposite of what HPMOR's author actually decided to write:

#+begin_quote
  "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!" (16.288-89)
#+end_quote

To me, it's like HPMOR's author (who also admitted to not actually reading most of the original /Harry Potter/ series when he was writing HPMOR) took one look at Rowling's messages and morals, went "that's stupid, Harry would be so much better if he were more like Hermione", and then wrote precisely that.

Well, considering that Rowling is the one who wrote in the message "Voldemort is evil because he opposed death" in the first place...yeah, to deny that it's a major point of the books is to miss her point. It's literally one of the biggest themes of /Deathly Hallows/.

In Rowling's lore, Horcruxes, which tie a witch or wizard's soul to the mortal plane, are depicted as one of the most vile, Dark, and evil pieces of magic there is, but how it's unnatural, and twists the practicioner into a "monstrous" being, which Voldemort is depicted as.

#+end_quote

Rowling quite clearly calls Death an "old friend" and an "equal". Not an "enemy" that needs to be defeated, as HPMOR's author claims it is. Therefore, his view is completely different and opposite to Rowling's message.

You see, that is (/to me/) the beauty of Fanfiction. You can take the basic framework of a story and do whatever you want with it.

MOR's Harry is different from Canon!Harry because he had a completely different life. Those of us who grew up with a parent that was way smarter than the other can probably relate a little to him. And without Dudley to antagonize him he wouldn't go to school starved for friends.

It's not bad, but the literal title of the thread is: *"What element of canon is sacred and unalterable to you. Something that will make you stop reading."*

My post as in-line with not only OP's comment, but also the whole point of this thread. I was pointing out /why/ these elements of HPMOR "made me stop reading".

Yet, somehow, because I did exactly what the thread asked (share my opinion), people somehow are up-in-arms about it...even though that's the whole purpose, to share one's opinion.

And you say this:

#+begin_quote
  You see, that is (to me) the beauty of Fanfiction. You can take the basic framework of a story and do whatever you want with it.
#+end_quote

But to me, HPMOR doesn't just "take the basic framework of the story", it completely changes it so it's not /Harry Potter/ anymore. That's what I was pointing out. Likewise, just because one /can/ "do whatever they want with a story" doesn't mean that everyone can, or should, /like/ the resulting product.

#+begin_quote
  And without Dudley to antagonize him he wouldn't go to school starved for friends.
#+end_quote

This would be a valid point if HPMOR's Harry actually /had/ any important Muggle friends that he made before Hogwarts, and proceeded to keep after he started going to Hogwarts. (But this doesn't happen.)

Also, I have to say, as a bookworm myself, I find it much more realistic and believable - especially since HPMOR's Harry is /far/ more like Hermione - if Harry, having a professor for a stepfather, would have /less/ social skills. This is because scientists and PhDs [[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/its-a-fact-scientists-more-likely-to-be-socially-inept/152421.article][have been proven to be more likely to be socially inept]].

Also, apparently, HPMOR's author based an 11-year-old Harry off of...his 18-year-old self, at the time. Due to this, Harry is depicted as some sort of super-intelligent, Sherlock Holmes-level prodigy, when in reality, an 18-year-old is at a completely different stage of mental and psychological development than an 11-year-old. It's not only unrealistic for Harry to be /that/ intelligent (and, as pointed out, in the original HP books, Hermione is literally written as a "largely exaggerated" cariacture of this trope), but his stepfather, being a professor, probably wouldn't even have /time/ to teach Harry.

...and I haven't even gotten into how modern, standard psychology has proven that personality and traits are largely genetic (i.e. "nature"), not "nurture" (as you claim). This is [[https://www.verywellmind.com/are-personality-traits-caused-by-genes-or-environment-4120707][due to twin studies showing a large genetic component]] in personality development. Therefore, this makes it even /less/ likely for "super-intelligent, super-studious" Harry to be realistic, or for his character in HPMOR to retain [[https://www.verywellmind.com/are-personality-traits-caused-by-genes-or-environment-4120707][suspension of disblief]].

#+begin_quote
  There will always be someone writing something, and there is always someone willing to read that something.
#+end_quote

Yes, and there is always someone /unwilling/ to read that something (which is what this thread is all about). My lack of respect for HPMOR's author, and the juvenile and condescending way he regards and treats others who disagree with him, is also a big factor in why I dislike HPMOR.

It completely amazes me that people miss the point of HPMOR so hard. Harry in HPMOR is a giant egomaniac and it's clearly presented as one of his biggest flaws. He tries to use his book knowledge to convert Draco and he fails. He fails in a lot of other ways too, because he's borderline sociopathic and can't think of others.

The roles between Harry and Hermione are a bit reversed in HPMOR, but Harry, who is much "smarter" than Hermione completely adores and idolizes her. The whole unicorn symbolism at the end of the story isn't exactly subtle.

I highly doubt that. Nicholas Flamel and his Wife aren't presented as evil and they both fought against death much much longer than Voldemort. Voldemort is evil because he uses an evil ritual that damages your soul to achieve this (oh, and he's a murdering, torturing psychopath).

**** How does he misinterpret Rowling's messages? From what I see, he interprets them quite correctly --- he just /disagrees/ with some of them. No, courage is not more important than intelligence in a wizard, though it may be more admirable. No, death is not something to just be calmly accepted^{*1*}. Etc. You may not agree, but you're doing Yudkowsky a disservice by saying he /doesn't understand/ the original messages.

(*1*): Now to be fair to Rowling, it's reasonable for in-universe characters to think that, because /they have pretty certain evidence of the afterlife/. But we don't. As far as me and other atheists/agnosticists are concerned, while it'd be cool if it turned out otherwise, we probably live in a godless, magicless universe where souls aren't a thing; and as a result making up a fantasy world where liking death is okay, and presenting that to kids who won't fully understand the moral ramifications of meeting a ghost, is misleading and arguably /subversive/.

Actually any drastic change to any character can set me off.

There were lots of moments in books where he was screaming and behaving like a madman, so why do people make him next Christian Grey? And his background. That he's half blood with poor childhood suits him better than some heir of a great family with manors, house elves and old ancient rites in a garden.

And pairings... Snape/Harry or Ron! Or even Dumbledore.

He's a great character as long as he stays as this grey character when you can't tell if he was good or bad. That makes him very real.

Hermione went from presumably one side of the pitch to the other, so even if she was fretting, there was still potential time to go over her options, time to think, while not in direct immediate danger, outside of "losing Harry". She attempted to burn someone (be it alive or only mildly) instead of, say, spraying water in their face, or throwing something onto their head.

Now granted, in some depictions of Harry's killing of his first rogue professor, he could have escaped after getting rid of his hands, but instead went for the kill by going for the face and throat.

And I agree. I don't care if they are friends, pseudo siblings or a loving couple, Harry and Hermione would fight Hell and high water together. Stories that have her betray him (typically to Dumbledore as his spy) are hard to read. I get some of their background reasoning for it, but it's usually only in crossover fics, to cut ties, that I can stand it. It otherwise makes no bloody sense to me.

It's a part of why I like /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ so much: the very personality traits that Hermione has had to suppress in order to get along with Gryffindors were the exact ones that she has to develop in order to maintain status among Slytherins.

I am not sure about her having the potential to be the next Voldemort. It's not fair, but raw talent (however defined) matters, and all the indications seem to indicate that Hermione isn't up there with Voldemort and Dumbledore---but then, neither is anyone else in her or her parents' generation.

Ultimately, yes: if I had to choose between having Harry be out to kill me or having Hermione be out to kill me, it's not a difficult decision.

i mean, he'd already amassed a horde of loyal doormats when he was a teen at Hogwarts, and they weren't there because he was such a talented wizard or the top student or whatever. they were there because he was a people magnet. he had ideas and looked like the kind of person who is more than just talk.

obviously, it's easier for a dark wizard to manipulate and/or intimidate his supporters into staying loyal if he can occasionally pull off some incredible magical feats, but i really feel like about 80% of his success was due to his personality and ruthlessness.

****** [[/u/Obversa]] specifically wrote about Hermione being a hypothetical Dark sorceress, which to me read like he or she was talking about her magical potential.

On the substance of your post, I think that Voldemort's magical abilities were critical to his success. Pureblood supremacists were a small and shrinking minority in the wizarding society, though perhaps disproportionately wealthy; and Dumbledore---an uberwizard who could defeat virtually any number of lesser opponents---was firmly set against them.

So, without an uberwizard of their own, Death Eaters would have been little more than a nuisance. Since Death Eaters tend to come from Slytherin---not a group known for selfless sacrifice and fighting on despite the odds---they would probably settle for living out their lives in comfort and luxury, waiting for Dumbledore to finally die of old age. This would have also been their fate had Riddle been merely charismatic and manipulative. However, he was a wizard who could match Dumbledore spell-for-spell. That changed things, and made a military victory feasible.

***** I only downvoted because you complained ahead of time about downvotes...

I think there is a large difference between bashing and writing the character in a different way that makes them an evil person/bad guy/dark witch or wizard. Especially if they follow canon up to a point, they have to remember that the reader is remembering everything about that character up to the AU point of divergence. If we're to believe that Ron was the way he was for the first three books, but in his AU Goblet of Fire he's actually a dark lord spy who enchanted the Cup, I'm going to need some background and explanation on why this character has an about-face.

What would that mean? That the purer the parents the stronger the magic of the child? You'd have to write a whole huge AU for that. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are half-bloods...

  History isn't written by the victor. This is one of my least favorite historiographic blanket statements, because it introduces the problems of bias by replacing one monolithic interpretation (history is correct) with another (history is written by the victors). Genghis Khan is the greatest conquers of all time, yet he does not get a good press in the histories.

  History is written by /writers/. It reflects the biases of the literate class, and the needs of the patrons. And yes, it frequently happens that writers are from the civilizations that come out on top. But just thinking "successful country gets good press, unsuccessful country gets bad press" is just as bad as ignoring bias altogether.

*** my idea for magical cores is that they do nothing. nobody is really sure what they are and you don't need one to use a wand.

you can give your core away to someone and it doesn't affect you in any way that anyone can determine.

purebloods use them to determine who is pure of blood because the child of two core-having people will usually have a core.

there's also a variant of the Lumos spell that requires a core to cast. it was a pain in the ass to invent, is basically the Lumos spell with a bit of glitter, and the incantation is a whole sentence. pureblood families spent a lot of effort to create a spell that requires a core and ended up with something inefficient but pretty.

when a pureblood child is born without a core they secretly pay a muggleborn off for theirs.

my behind the scenes thoughts on it are that magical cores are used for a completely different system of magic. something like D&D or Fate/Stay magic which requires years of study to do anything with. zero chance of accidental activation. since nobody has used that magic there is nothing to study so it's a bit of a catch 22.

technically speaking there would also be muggles with magical cores but nobody knows to check for that.

Ginny. I cannot stand fics that make her weepy, money-hungry, in pursuit of fame (via Harry), or unfaithful. Even if she's not in a fic but the author uses a few lines just to insult her, I'm out. Actually, apply this to Ron as well because that too pisses me off.

Sirius loves Harry. Don't give me crap where he only loves a James-clone or will abandon Harry if he feels disappointed.

Harry is tough and capable as-is. This belief makes me picky with fic for two reasons. One is that some fics turn him into a fragile mess or a naive sweetheart. Two is that some believe they need to rewrite him to make him tough and capable. I usually don't like the OP genius, too-edgy brat, aspiring bookworm, or Lord of Everything.

I have not forgotten that Dumbledore compares James and Snape to Harry and Draco or that, even with Harry not in sight, people still had reason to speak of school-aged James fondly. I gather from canon that James could be an arrogant ass but he was an overall decent person who befriended a werewolf, a kid from a dark and prejudiced family, and a twitchy little rat. He saved his enemy's life and matured enough to gain the love of a girl who was once disgusted by his behavior.

The other thing for me is the abstract, philosophical nature of magic. Things like the room of love in the DoM and “to the well organised mind, Death is but the next great adventure.” The power of sacrifice and the “Master of Death” not being precisely literal.

I really hate bashing in general. I think its probably the worst writing tool regularly used. Ron is kind of narrow minded, a bit rude and sometimes gets his priorities wrong. He can be a jealous git and can even drop friends if it comes to it. However, he is not 'friends with harry to get at his money.'

Also, 'manipulative' Dumbles. Dumbledore did a lot of shit wrong. I don't think he intended to sacrifice Harry at the beginning, but he did at the end. But this whole 'I am actually a huge conceited douchebag underneath this grandfatherly face' trope is awful. Also, every fic I read of manipulative dumbles has him basically be some giant idiot that is incredibly obvious, which says poor things about everyone involved.

TLDR I hate bash portrayals. Keep characters similar to their originals unless you go wildly au. They can have character growth if you want them to change but there should reasons for the characters being different.

****** Unpublished excerpt that may not make it into a story:

Harry exclaimed, "I just had a great idea!"

"No you didn't," said Holly.

"Sure. We'll use Veritaserum... and Legilimency. That'll separate the ones who really were afraid or under enchantment from the willing ones. That'll assure that the right people go to prison this time."

"Will you go first?"

"Why would I?" Harry protested, "I'm not a criminal."

"So say we all," said Holly. "Imagine that, in order to get this change in policy approved, you volunteered to go first. You are now compelled to tell the truth, and the inquisitor is reading your mind to detect evasions and follow interesting lines of questioning."

"Uh-oh."

"Mr. Potter, tell us- with whom have you had sex? When did that begin? So young! And did you interfere with the possible birth of a witch or wizard when doing so?"

"I don't know if the law even prohibits that."

"The questions and answers will be publicly circulated, Harry. The inquisitor wouldn't be one of your friends, or else your opponents will accuse you of pre-arranging the whole thing. Instead your interrogator will be an unsympathetic rival with a good reputation, which means someone who is savvy enough to have survived all this. Narcissa Malfoy, maybe."

"Still... I'll confess my sex life if it'll weed out corruption."

"List please, all the people that you've assaulted. All the people that you've killed. You seem to be guilty of the planned stalking and murder of another citizen, one Tom Marvolo Riddle. Are you or were you an agent of the Ministry at the time or was this an act of lawless vigilantism? How early was it that you first decided to kill Mr. Riddle? Can you tell us what may have happened to Professor Quirinus Quirrel? Oh dear! Why was no one told? Are you saying that the Headmaster lied to cover up the murder you'd committed, and you said nothing?"

"Not so great an idea, then. But how do we root out the corruption without condemning the innocent and still have a functioning society?"

Yeah those are good points. There are obviously a lot of obstacles here in terms civil liberties and protection of universal rights.

I still think it is a viable option to undergo such a process *voluntarily* in order to prove innocence in some regard. Of course there should still be lots of laws and regulations that for example limit the questions being asked to be relevant to the accused crime, etc.

I'm not even saying that it would be easy, I just hate the /shrug, nothing we can do/-attitude when you have literally Magic at your disposal. As if everyone is just lazy and doing what is right might be too hard and complicated.

Even the Unbreakable Vow has a limiting factor- the binder must be a third person. My interpretation of that is that Snape wouldn't die immediately for not doing 'all he could' to aid Draco; it's impractical. Instead, the vow puts his life in Bellatrix' hands- if she decides that he broke his vow, he'd die.

Okay, I have to disect this a little bit, bear with me please: I totally agere with you on principle that not having something unbreakable as Veritaserum in your story makes for a better story. If I ever find the discipline and motivation to write something longer it would almost certainly be some kind of AU where maybe Veritaserum doesn't even exist. The thing is that I value internal consistency higher than that. It doesn't make sense to me that Veritaserum is as useless as some (or even Rowling in her post-hoc rationalisations) make it out to be.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

We probably need [[/u/Taure]] on this... from my grasp of HP magic this almost certainly is not the case. Magic seems to be able to make such determinations on its own. The whole GoF participation of Harry hinges on this... but of course you could argue that the GoF binding works differently than that of the unbreakable vow. Again, internal consistency would be more important to me.

Furthermore Bellatrix is perfectly capable to kill Snape on her own and I doubt she would have any trouble AKing him in the back if he displeases her. The whole point of such a Vow seems to me that the person you're making the Vow with is untrustworthy and you have no way to verify... so you ask Magic to help you out. Your version of the vow would be no much better than a Muggle vow, if it requires you to still have do all the leg work, figuring out whether the other person is actually adhering to it.

Oh and also, why would anyone ever be stupid enough to make such a vow? If the other person is an asshole they can just kill you by deciding that you are not keeping up your side of the bargain.

********** I don't think Veritaserum is internally inconsistent though. The key is that it (and everything else people come up with for great perfect magical societies) isn't the silver bullet for all problems, which why while it's usefully for collecting intel (e.g. for the order) it cannot be the standard upon which you build society.

If you want to think of it logically, Veritaserum (and Unbreakables) have very powerful effects or compulsions or nuances that makes them useful in specific situations. But given an sort of elevation to being the tool for public decision making means that the tricky bits and corner cases really come to life and exploited (probably by the rich / powerful).

re Vow: I think you're again sticking too to an interpretation. We don't know what complex bits of magic involve, and what the components and small detailed effects are. A simple example that could be consistently with both you and the person that you're replying to (and we don't know any of this, because it's not actually important to the story and that's how magic is treated in HP) is that Vows are created and enforced by a magic will composed from shared understandings of all participants. Different Vows from different bonders won't behave exactly the same, but that's determined by a much different magic force (or encoded in some abstract way in the initial magic of the Vow).

That may not be possible, but we don't know what are the max consequences for a hexed magical contract. What I was going for is the fact that Hermione didn't have any specific will about what kind of betrayals would be punished (AFAIK Edgecombs circumstances were pretty complex) or any knowledge of betrayals. She just wrote a magical contract that punishes betrayals and Magic took care of that.

#+begin_quote
  Veritaserum works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it. Barty Crouch had been attacked before the potion was given to him and was still very groggy, otherwise he could have employed a range of measures against the Potion - he might have sealed his own throat and faked a declaration of innocence, transformed the Potion into something else before it touched his lips, or employed Occlumency against its effects. In other words, just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible. As some wizards can prevent themselves being affected, and others cannot, it is an unfair and unreliable tool to use at a trial.

That's a bad comparison. The only reason veritaserum would be admitted as evidence is if it was totally reliable. If you can lie under it, it's totally useless. Searching someone's house not finding evidence is not proof that it doesn't exist (like with veritaserum), you can always give it a try. What is the point of giving veritaserum a try? You'd have to verify it anyway (since they could be lying), but at that point why even use it?

I thought he was proven guilty because a lot of bystanders saw him do it. That's sufficient evidence.

Overall I agree it was a huge plot hole though, with magic it could be proven that his wand didn't cast the curse as well I believe since he surrendered right afterwards so it would be his last act. I think the takeaway is that wizards in general are not rational people 99% of the time.

This sounds intellectually dishonest and I don't think you actually believe this: There's no reason not to try Veritaserum even if you can't be sure that it works. You can ask them anything you want! "Where did you hide your wand?" Go and look, if it isn't there then he's lying and not affected by veritaserum. "Who has the Dark Mark?" You can go and check the arms of these people. There's a bunch of things you could ask as starting points for an investigation. It's the same fucking deal you would be doing in a normal investigation without Veritaserum anyway. In the worst case you just waste your time, but then you also now know that they can lie under Veritaserum. If you're smart about it you can probably come up with a system or a series of questions to prove whether someone is affected by Veritaserum: Maybe allow the (strictly regulated) use of imperius during criminal trials.

I really can't wrap my head around this logic: Normal criminals in the muggle world can also lie about everything, because there isn't even Veritaserum. They are still being questioned though?! Why even bother?

There isn't a lot about what the state of the evidence was in the books. Some subsequently-obliviated muggle witnesses, explosion debris and casualties and one fragment of Pettigrew's remains at the scene, plus the circumstantial evidence of the widely-believed status of Black as the secret-keeper and, most importantly, /his confession at the scene of his arrest/. Now, none of those is beyond a good trial lawyer - I'm not a criminal defense lawyer at all and I could work up reasonable doubt on that evidence. There's a great deal of evidence missing from the case, not least /priori incantatem/ on the suspect's wand and a proper post-arrest interview, and /none/ of the evidence properly corroborates the confession evidence - "it's my fault" only narrowly, technically counts.

I'm rambling, but basically what I'm saying here is that Mr. Black has a defence that doesn't require him to give evidence, but apparently Ms. Rowling either had no idea how criminal process actually works or wanted to portray that wizarding Britain's incompetence extends to matters forensic as well...

No wand, no access to antidotes, any Occlumency would be severely damaged by the Dementors. Bellatrix Lestrange, who knew enough Occlumency to teach it to Draco, seems to have still been vulnerable to the Dementor's effects.

Plus there's Sirius' statement that his knowledge of his innocence wasn't a happy thought that the Dementors could suck out but that it helped keep him sane.

Then stun them, transport them to the trial, wake them up and administer Veritaserum first thing. It's brutal but probably effective. Just make sure that anyone then found innocent gets psychological help.

Occlumency is clearing your mind of all emotions. Dementors would make that a lot harder. Not to mention that you have to sleep, they don't. They can wear you down.

shutting down your emotions is a ability of Occlumency not a requirement. we know that when using it its enough to shut down only those emotions that would contradict a lie.

correction there are few characters we see use wandless magic, not that only those are able to, or that its some kind of special skill. I mean we see charachters use it on occasions where they cant seem to be bothered to draw their wand. Like Remus when he wakes up to light a light, or Tom at the leaky cauldron snapping his fingers to ignite a fire place.

And if you include pottermore you see that wandless magic just isn't common in europe because of wands, but that its not extraordinary hard because children in Africa use it mostly. So we know its just uncommon not a hard skill to learn.

It had nothing to do with wand ownership or defeating Voldemort. you're confusing different things. Voldemort died because he attempted to kill Harry with the Elder Wand while it belonged to Harry and Harry defended himself, Dumbledore had nothing to do with that, he actually intended for the Elder wand not to belong to anyone after his death.

Harry also only had to find out that he is a horcrux, to choose to sacrifice himself, and Dumbledore tasked Snape with informing Harry, Snape informing Harry last second was certainly not part of the plan. But we know that Dumbledores Portraits always could have informed somebody else.

*** This, but /Alexandra Quick/ for me. The first installment read much more like an original novel than a /Harry Potter/ fanfiction to me. Even TV Tropes acknowledges as much:

#+begin_quote
  /Alexandra Quick/ is the main character in a series of fan fictions written by Inverarity (currently on the fifth book out of seven) that is set in the /Harry Potter/ universe, but is almost completely unrelated otherwise. Quick is a young witch who, much like Potter, was raised as a Muggle in the United States, and much like Harry, she is whisked away to Charmbridge Academy at age eleven to learn how to control her magical talents. Unlike Harry, she has a fascination with Dark Magic and is generally ostracized by her peers for it. Worse yet, someone appears to be trying to kill her...

  The series is notable for being Darker and Edgier while still managing to capture the same feeling as Harry Potter, as well as exploring magic beyond that the students are taught in schools. With one of the most realistic and coherent portrayals of Magical America, Alexandra Quick is a lot more than fanfiction, it's closer to the Star Wars novels set in earlier eras with less Lucas guidance.
#+end_quote

Who the hell writes /seven/ books' worth of story and content that's "amost completely unrelated to /Harry Potter/" and posts it online as /Harry Potter/ fanfiction, and yet doesn't publish it as a series of original novels? Inverarity could easily make a name for themselves in the YA genre by doing the latter.

eg. say you want to redeem Pettigrew in some way, perhaps make him a man who's terrified of being under the eye of Riddle and changes back to the light pre-Halloween. not some magically brave character indistinguishable from all the other stereotypical Gryffindors in the series

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** The Malfoys are shitty people. Even if Draco has a slight chance to turn around after the war, Lucius and Narcissa are commuted blood purists, I have zero sympathy for them.

The Wizarding Government isn't a pureblood aristocracy, it's just extremely incompetent and corrupt. There's nothing in canon to suggest that Wizengamot seats are inherited and that legislation revolves around ancient magical families and their pacts.

The Weasleys wouldn't start irrationally hating Harry if his relationship with Ginny didn't work out. They don't want Harry's money. They didn't arrange Harry meeting Ron in an evil devious plot. Harry could have become friends with other people, Ginny wouldn't rape him with magic.

Hermione is a smart girl, but not Spock. She has insecurities and does silly girl things like having crushes on incompetent idiots or crying in a toilet because people call her names. She has a strong sense of justice and fairness but values friends more than principles. I like her character a lot, but I can't stand fics which portray her as a dispassionate genius when she's 12.

I can't make my mind about Dumbledore completely, to be honest, but bashing him is one of the most annoying tropes. I don't think Dumbledore has a master plan about every aspect of Harry's personality, or would totally lose his mind if Harry turned out differently from canon. Harry could have been a Slytherin without becoming his eternal enemy, he would probably alter his approach somewhat and do his best to give him a fighting chance, even while making mistakes. Dumbledore still gives Harry a lot of breathing room to become his own person, the way authors portray him as a neurotic mess is not interesting.

** I agree with you, I can't get behind a story that's anti-Jily. Even if Lily only dates someone else because James is dead. I'm not into it.

I'm also very particular about Remus Lupin. So many fics fall into this lazy pattern of turning him into a bookish, goody goody, uptight, know-it-all stereotype, and I can't deal with it (I'm looking at you, the life and times...).

I have a pretty low threshold for angst as well. If it exists, it had better be either very well written, or fleeting.

I pretty much exclusively read marauders era fics.. This'll probably be an unpopular opinion on a fan fiction sub, but I just feel so familiar with JKR's versions of the main Harry Potter cast, I tend to find other versions of the characters a bit jarring. There is a lot more room for interpretation with the marauder era.

*** I'm interested to know, since I read very little of marauder era, how much do you think Lupin would change after 81? In Harry's era Lupin is drowning in self pity, reluctant to let himself be happy. I'd expect he'd be happier and more confident with the friends that had proven they'd do anything for him. Them turning on each other, two of them 'dying' and the other in Azkaban much have taken away any stability he had in his life. Also do you drop stories that have Remus date Lily even briefly? For me Remus would see it as betraying James who'd give up so much for him and would never do it both out of loyalty to James and fear that James and co would leave him, but it seemed like a common idea in the few I browsed.

just my 2 cents: Marauder fics that put Lily in such a role are mostly stupid. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me that Lily would be close friends with any of the other Marauders (before overcoming her dislike of James), much less date any of them. It just wouldn't work: The Marauders are a close-knit group, hang out all the time, planning pranks, studying, etc. Lily can't *stand* James... she wouldn't be able to hang out with her friends or boyfriend at all.

I always thought that Lily interacted with the Marauders as much as Harry with Lavender - at least until James got his act together.

***** See, I like fics where Lily and Lupin are friendly. I could see them, especially once both prefects, getting on quite well.

And I had a small sized class at school, with only 20 of us, and it's /so hard/ to stay clear of people you don't like. So you end up being forced into a group where you try to be civil and ignore them.

That's what I always pictured for Lily - especially as her explosion at James by the lake after the OWLs was supposed to be a ‘big moment', I just don't see them having fought like cat and dog the way many fics make them.

**** Theoretically I wouldn't outright drop a series that had Lily and Lupin date (if it didn't last long and was handled well), but tbh I avoid that style of long running teen soap opera marauder fics anyway. It's just not my thing, I tend to go for fics that start at least in 7th year, if not after hogwarts.

I think young Lupin was less reserved and more cheeky. He was /occasionally/ a little insecure (eg. Failing to stand up to James and Sirius), but, being a teenage boy and all, he hid his insecurities well. I think a lot of authors fail to capture his sense of humor, and he just ends up looking dull and humourless compared to James and Sirius.
