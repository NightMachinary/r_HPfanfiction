** I don't think this is the one you're looking for as it's a combination of Harry's genes and the basilisk bite that causes him to change. But, it has a half-snake Harry who is sold to and ends up with Voldemort, so you might enjoy it.

#+begin_quote
  The bite of the basilisk, together with Fawkes tears changed something in Harry.Starting from the summer before his 3rd year at Hogwarts, he finds out things that will make him think about the wizarding world in a whole other setting.When his muggle relatives sell him in the summer after 4th year to one who is supposed to be his worst enemy, the questions remains if this will be his death, or his freedom.
