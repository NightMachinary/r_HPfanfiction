Just thought it'd be interesting idea, would rather NOT have Weasley and Dumbledore Bashing.

For pairings: (If any) am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual.

Can be ANY length, anyone can be the main character, can be on ANY site. Can be as Canon or as AU as possible.

Doesn't have to be the main part of the story.

Edit: Doesn't even have to be because of the prophet or anything like that specifically.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
