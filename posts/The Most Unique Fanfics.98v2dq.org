1. The song of the trees is incomplete and likely abandoned. It is however, very different from the norm as far as I can remember.

2. The untitled tome has a good following, and from what I have read, it is pretty unique. I personally couldn't finish it, but perhaps you will have better luck.

3. Ectomancer is probably one of my favourites. Again though, unfinished and likely abandoned. Heavily reccomend giving it a whirl if you have the time or inclination.

That is all I have right now. Apologies for reccomending fics that are abandoned, but a lot of the good unique ones usually are. If I think of anymore, I will edit the post.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

*** D'you know I used to ruminate on why I liked The Song of the Trees so much, beyond the author being competent at writing, and the conclusion I reached is, it's because Tinn Tam is french. There's just something so refreshing about a story that's well written and yet very different in style from the thousand of stories I've read from native english speakers.

** For a few fics that go in completely different directions from canon...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] and the sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11842318/1/Traveller][Traveller]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]], all by The Wayland Smith. - The story picks up one hundred years after the long war between Harry and Voldemort was ended in a stalemate sealed by a magically binding oath. The adventure of these two age-old enemies (turned reluctant allies) eventually crosses multiple dimentions and timelines. I think of these fics as "Harry Potter in the style of Neil Gaiman", very reminiscent of the /Sandman/ series, /Stardust/, or /American Gods/.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/40/October][October]] by Carnivorous Muffin - This fic starts with Harry, as Death personified, meeting Tom Riddle on the train to Hogwarts in 1938. Their interactions change the course of the future, eventually leading Tom to an unforeseen immortality and a brand new nation on Mars. I think of this fic as "Harry Potter in the style of Kurt Vonnegut" with strong influence from /Slaughterhouse 5/ or the weirder stories of Philip K Dick.

**** Yes. The "Pilgrim" in The Lord in the Mist is the same Voldemort as in the previous two fics. He still has the card he was given in Traveller, though it seems he has passed through some other adventures in between the two stories. "Pilgrim" seems to have some underlying motive for his actions which he is still playing close to his chest. I think it might have something to do with his parting words to Harry at the end of Traveller.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. The war ended over a hundred years ago. Harry Potter and Voldemort are old, out of practice, and politely ignoring each other. However, as tensions rise across Europe the Ministry persuades them to join forces to try and end a series of disappearances in the Black Forest. No pairings.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy.

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth. Complete.

** Good Sir or Madam,

Please resist from uttering, or being made known through your hand, the phrase "most unique" in any context whatsoever. The reason? No comparative syntax should be used alongside unique because unique is a Boolean concept, something either is or is not unique, there are no degrees to uniqueness.

Also check out the author enembee if you haven't already, his work is unique, super unique.
