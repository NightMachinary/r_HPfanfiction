Title pretty much says it all but I like this pairing quite a bit and was wondering if anyone had any good recommendations. Bonus points if it doesn't feature the words 'ice queen' anywhere :p Thanks


** While some of them do mention Ice Queen, there was an excellent thread about a year ago. It's pretty extensive.

So it won't include any newer released fics but you'll have options for things you haven't read yet.

**** True, unfortunately. But at least it's being updated (relatively) often.

*** Sure:

Daphne Greengrass is a Slytherin girl in the same year as Harry. She is a pure blood, and has a sister, Astoria Greengrass, who marries Draco Malfoy after the series.

In fanfiction, she is generally regarded as an "ice queen", a cold-hearted /bitch/, who had no emotions and completely independent for everyone. She is said to be calculating, always having a plan in mind. She is friends with Tracy Davis.

Keep in mind, this is off the top of my head, and I'm generalizing based off of the numerous amount of fanfic about her^{don't hate me D:}.

**** Interesting, so she was just a less-than-minor char who became a sort of canon characterization in FF world? How really interesting! What was the turning-point FF, if any?

***** She was mentioned once, maybe twice in canon. But I think Jeconais had the first major success with her in Perfect Situations (and its sequel, both still quite enjoyable). Her personality there was copied (poorly) and spiraled out of control into the ice queen label.

A lot of people claim Daphne is great because she's a blank slate in Slytherin so she can be that gorgeous forbidden type character, but rarely does anyone expand beyond ice queen being a mask. It is now a norm and a very frustrating one for me at least to read. Blank slate my ass.

Hell, even I wrote those two awful words back in 2008. The regret...

****** I do think when done well she has great potential as an 'almost' OC character as virtually nothing about her is mentioned in canon at all, other than the little bit mentioned above. After awhile the whole ice queen thing gets to be a bit much but some fics do avoid that trap and can be especially enjoyable.

While I love Daphnr/Harry stories. Using a canon character that is a blank slate like Daphne, Tracy, Blaise etc. seems no different than creating an oc. It's basically tricking the people who don't like reading original characters. The only true canon facts about Daphne are she is female and slytherin and in Harry's year. The ice queen personality is kinda overdone. Just because she isn't outgoing explaining her not showing up in canon a lot. Doesn't mean she is docile or an ice bitch. Maybe she doesn't give a fuck about the war and is just living the shitty life she was given. Very few wizards and witches have any personality in canon outside of gryffindors. I hated that Harry didn't end up with anyone in slytherin or a muggle. It would've been nice to know for sure that all slytherins from Harry's generation were not evil instead of just assuming. The only slytherins that have redeeming qualities are from older generations. Like Sanpe or Narcissa. It would've been nice to see Harry be a little like dumbedore and reach out to the other side.

This one was pretty good from what I remember. First person from Daphne's perspective and starts at the end of book 5.

** There's a pretty recent 6th-year "Haphne" story that I'm enjoying immensely, despite it being the first story of its author; he did have some minor problems with grammar and spelling at first, but it has become considerably better since he found a decent beta.

The story is quite good and more than a little promising so far, the characterization is notably well done and has some nice fresh twists and turns, plus it doesn't contain the Ice queen clichÃ© - in fact, as someone who has read like 90+% of the Harry/Daphne stories out there, I can say that the Daphne in this story is probably my absolute favorite. Harry is more open-minded (both about Slytherin and the whole light/dark thing in general), confident, hard-working, doesn't take sh*t from just anyone and considerably less whiny and simply more likeable than canon Harry.

Doesn't contain any adventure/war/battle scenes as of yet, but that will change eventually as Harry is actively preparing for the war.

Updates are consistent and fairly frequent. Anyway, long story short lol -> [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11022385/1/Cage-and-Key][Cage and Key]]

** I was on a bit of a Haphne binge earlier this year.

Unmentioned thus far are Duality by andafaith; and A Different Sort of Bond by Balder.

Both can be found on ficwad; also they're fairly smutty (but definitely solid and interesting plots too).
