** I've got no rec for you off the top of my head but I remember reading a couple where Hermione grew up severely emotionally neglected and one where she had been emotionally abused. It wasn't a major plot point in any of them, more just an author's inclusion as to why they think Hermione had such a thirst to prove herself to the adults in her life and such a strong respect for authority. She was always trying to prove herself good enough to earn her parents attention and approval and was always pushed to do more, resulting in escalation to things like memorizing textbooks. As it wasn't something really explored by the authors nothing else stands out to connect to the stories enough to remember what they were.
