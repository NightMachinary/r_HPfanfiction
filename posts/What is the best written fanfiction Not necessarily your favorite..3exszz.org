** Unatoned, Hogwarts Houses Divided, The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks, and Phantom Limb are all extremely solidly written.

Lack of errors isn't good writing. That's like saying "yeah the restaurant had good food, there were almost zero flies on it when it came out."

Pace, tone, word choice, dynamic dialogue, flowing prose, apt metaphors, whatever mix you want to call it, good writing = "I buy your voice as a storyteller." It's kinda rare.

Those four stories have it.

*** Speaking of /The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks/, has anyone read the author's other works? Most of the summaries sound stupid, so I never bothered with any of them.

Phantom Limb is genuinely underrated. I second it. It is frustrating through, the story seems to be on the cusp of greatness, and it is only the author's pigheadedness with the incompetent Dumbledore trope that keeps the story from achieving it.

Unatoned and Hogwarts Houses Divided are relatively well known.

I will also put in any of Arabella's works. Both /The Very Secret Diary/ and /After the End/ are very well written.

A case can be made for /Circular Reasoning/. Not my favorite work, but I cannot deny the brilliance of the writing.

Lady Altair's stories deserve a mention, especially /Cauterize/. They are rather blatant in what they try to do, but what they try to do they do very well.

Yeah that's exactly how I feel about Phantom Limb. The actual writing is brilliant, especially the imagery and metaphors. Really, really good prose. And it's actually kind of an interesting story as well, but the Dumbledore stuff is just bad. Stemming from that, Harry wanders too far into "Mary Sue walks in and solves everybody's problems with unique perspective and speeches."

But yeah, underrated.

#+end_quote

Hmmm. I wouldn't call Harry a Mary Sue in that story. Harry does have his flaws (there are several moments of stupidity on his part), but it seems the only one who can call him out on it is Ginny. Everyone else he seems to destroy in verbal lashing, and while I did take some amusement in the first time he did it to Hermione, it does get somewhat repetitive, and the time he did it to Molly (and the several times to Dumbledore) was certainly distasteful.

Its funny, I do think both Harry and Ginny are flawed characters in this, but the only ones who are allowed to call Harry and Ginny on their faults are Harry and Ginny themselves. So, yeah, Harry and Ginny have pretty good chemistry, and they do serve as good foils for each other, but the author neutered the rest of the characters to achieve this, and that is both sad and unnecessary.

Also, this problem can probably be remedied to some extent by a long, detailed review to the author, which I will write if he starts updating again. The incompetent Dumbledore thing will probably fall on deaf ears -- I doubt you can change anyone's perception of a character with a few conversations.

Still, really intriguing story. I had no idea where the author was going with the prophecy and Harry still being a Horcrux, and the slow revelation of past details was really well done. Unique, intriguing and brilliantly written, and well worth a read despite its flaws. Wish it would update.

*** The author of Phantom Limb is still active and was prompt in replying to my PM. For what it's worth, the author says :

#+begin_quote
  This Dumbledore is not specifically incompetent. That would be too easy. It may look that way at first, but there are other things going on with him.

  I wanted a good reason for him to be how he is, and I think I have arrived at one, but we are not there yet. It's better (to me, anyway) for the reader to begin to take issue with how Deasil acts and wonder if it's justified. No one ever said the narrator is always right.
#+end_quote

/Shrugs/. It doesn't make the Dumbledore stuff any less distasteful, but the author thinks he's justified and that more information will be revealed in coming chapters. The author is receptive towards criticism, so I would suggest taking up issues with the story via PM. You can probably put things in much better than I can.

**** That's interesting. Cool to see the author's still kicking things around. I actually haven't finished the fic yet - it's been on the back burner since the CoS / vision / Dumbledore stuff kind of soured me on it. I plan to finish it at some point and necro the DLP thread or something. Maybe I'll send the author a PM as well, nice catch.

** Spellcaster by SGCBearcub [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster]]

Brilliant exploration of why Harry and Co spend so much time learning spells in early books and then basically point and shoot as it goes on; a ruthlessly determined, brilliant Hermione who has lost her parents; pureblood culture, an amoral but not immoral Ministry....

Edit: Also "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Elyse [[http://redhen-publications.com/pimpernel.html]]

Literary references, gripping plot actually about the Voldemort war that explores the lacunae in cannon, exploration of secondary characters, and well performed magic that satisfies the reader.
