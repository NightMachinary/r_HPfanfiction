:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So i've been scrolling Hp recommendation threads on different forums and i found that story and i soo want to read it.Just a small little problem. The link is dead. The author profile empty. So i check the wy back machine and low and behold the first chapter is there. Except there's just the first chapter. So does anyone know where i can find the fic: friends of yours? (criminal minds/harry potter).

Here's the dead link to the story : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8796881/1/friends-of-yours]]
