Im looking for fics where Harry is using lawyers to various purposes, such as; sueing for the potter books, toys, and illegal uses of his name, Getting out the trial following the dementor attack, and other such uses. Dont have to focus on it, as long as it is a fun/interresting point of the fic. No slash for Harry. Thanks


** Well, anyone with the knowledge to do this - like me, retired lawyer - also knows why it wouldn't work. Y'see, Magical Britain is a small community with archaic laws run like a dictatorship by a plutocracy.

However, assume that civil justice isn't just 'whoever pays the biggest bribe wins'. The legal profession runs about 1 in 2000 of the population in the UK, at an all-time historical high - it used to be a /lot/ lower - so with a wizarding population estimated between 3,000 (low end) and 15,000 (high end) there are between one and a half and seven, maybe eight practising lawyers. If the 'muggles outnumber us a thousand to one' figure is right then there's maybe thirty wizarding lawyers.

That's not a legal profession, that's a /drinking club./

Most of those will work for the ministry or as clerk to the wizengamot, of course.

The absolute clincher, though, is that that legal profession is working on the same qualification standards we used to have in the UK: you only got to be a lawyer by serving as a clerk to a practising lawyer. First he had to decide you were the 'right sort' to be a professional lawyer. Right social class, suitably clubbable, from a good family. Then you paid him a premium for your training about the value of a medium-sized house, then you worked unpaid for five to seven years (mummy and daddy had better be willing to support you).

The kicker is that first step: any lawyer you hire in Magical Britain is going to be from one of the old pureblood families. Harry is /not/ going to get a good reception there, however genially they phrase it. They're the same gin-soaked old scoundrels who ran the Imperius defence, who advised Barty Crouch how to push through an imprisonment without trial so it would get overlooked, who walked Fudge through the legislation that let him put Dolores Umbridge in Hogwarts...

*** Actually, it's so archaic that this system isn't even in place.

Dumbledore was allowed to just walk in a courtroom and represent Harry when he was little more than a headmaster of a school. That means there is no legal requirement lawyers have to pass like in the muggle world. So anyone could become a lawyer without needing to do any of these steps above and thus they aren't filtered out. There would totally be muggleborn lawyers.

******* I think you are confusing two very distinct statements here:

- Was Dumbledore a smart, well-spoken wizard who knows the law and is therefore able to assist Harry in a simple underage magic case? Yes.

- Was Dumbledore an actual lawyer? No.

In the real world you have to actually be a licensed lawyer to represent someone else in court. A layman can show up to defend himself, but not to defend other people. Even if they personally know said people and their clients explicitly know they aren't really a lawyer. You are not legally allowed to do that.

In the wizarding world there is no such rule, see the trial at the start of book 5. Therefore being a lawyer is not a protected occupation and anyone could make a living representing other people.

******** Sounds like you're confused. All I said was that he's more than a school headmaster.

You said: "there is no legal requirement lawyers have to pass like in the muggle world"

I'm not disagreeing with this.

But one would absolutely rather have Dumbledore - former/disgraced Chief Warlock - backing you than Dedalus Diggle (probably. maybe Diggle is a lawyer in canon. I don't know and frankly I don't wanna know).

Furthermore, as he's well known as the only wizard who could go toe to toe with two of the most powerful Dark Lords in history, if you need to make a break for it it couldn't hurt to have him in your corner in case it comes to that. 199

So a bit more than a school headmaster yeah?

**** Sure, any muggleborn could represent. But would that be in the best interest of the client? Having a muggleborn lawyer pointing out legal precedents and conventions to a pureblood wizengamot may hinder the case. I can see the scenario of the OP bekng better served by self representation. Perhaps muggleborn courtroom coaches, who help prepare documents and how to approach the wizengamot.

** Harry getting a lawyer seems to be a fairly common trope in manipulative!Dumbledore fics. For example:

Harry gets a team of lawyers mid way through his 4th year at Hogwarts in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/30/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]]. The lawyers help him sue the Daily Prophet for libel and to build a case against Dumbledore. linkffn(8163784)

Harry and Sirius both hire a lawyer at the end of book 3 of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]]. The lawyer argues each of their cases against Dumbledore and James Potter in front of the Wizengamot, and she continues to help out in other ways later on. Book one is called "Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes". The trial scene happens later on in book 4. linkao3(12608820)
