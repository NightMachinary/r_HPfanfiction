just finished reading Inheritance by megamatt09 and now I'm really in the mood for some harry/lily evans fics, but unfortunately, after searching the web, I couldn't find many. Any sugestions? Also, I know that this is a wtf pairing, but, what can I say, after going trough all the strange pairings lately, I'll go trough this one also, but the peaking are a bit thin on this one, so, here I am, asking for some suggestions! Thanks in advance!


** Wow, you managed to actually read inheritance? That takes some fortitude for sure. The first and second chapter are pure cancer.

There's also 'The Future Remapped' by Shezza88, which was taken down a long time ago.

  What if Voldemort complied with Snape's wish on Halloween 1981? What if the Harry we know used the Resurrection Stone at the same time as a heart broken Lily? Two different eras, two different realities...Post DH
