** - If you decide to unite the worlds, it must be done well. A prime example is Browncoat, Green Eyes - perfectly executed.

If you do a HP/X-Men crossover where mutants live, then why doesn't the ministry of magic deal with them?

In Avengers, how would MACUSA react to the chitauri-army? And shield? And vice-versa?

Unfortunately there are way to many stories where this isn't done well.

My other big gripe is when HP characters don't use magic for whatever reason, it's really annoying me - even when it's the lack of a wand for a lot of the story.

And the third is slash. Since so much crossovers are just shitty slash, I simply skip all crossover-slash, even if I might risk some good stories with it.

** Power levels should be close, unless you want curb stomp fics.

More than one characters going to or coming from the other universe. I generally don't enjoy â€˜lone traveler' type fics. My preference is to see at least 2 travelers.

No canon rehashes in either universes.

*** So many Avengers crossovers have the story go the exact same way as the movies, it's maddening.

**** I have some examples if you are interested:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/Failsafe][Failsafe]] is a very enjoyable, but unfortunately abandoned crossover with LOTR. I find LOTR surprisingly balanced vs HP. Although HP magic could slaughter orc and goblin armies easily (Fiendfyre), I doubt it would be very effective vs non-human bosses such as the Balrog, Smaug, Saruman, and Sauron. The One Ring was basically a different implementation of the Horcrux, and the line between good and evil was very cleanly drawn.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]] is a really good crossover with Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis. Harry and Hermione were involved. and canon plot rails were shot in all universes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]] is not officially listed as a crossover, but really is one with [[https://www.google.com/search?q=kantai+fleet+girl&oq=kantai+fleet+girl&aqs=chrome..69i57.6752j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][Kantai Fleetgirls]]. Here, a lost Voldemort's Horcrux corrupted the spirit of the sunken Bismarck, and from the depth rose the zombie battleship BismarckMort. Fortunately, HMS Hood was also called to defend Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]] has Jedi quitter Ahsoka Tano raising Harry. Other Star Wars characters will make their appearances later. It's a generally enjoyable fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]] is a most unlikely crossover with "The Deadliest Catch", in which Harry fled the Wizarding world after the War and became a fishing boat captain. Despite being only an one-shot, this fic is an excellent read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]] is a Stargate crossover, but its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] is a Star Wars one. Harry, Hermione, and Luna all had Force and Magical powers, but still faced an uphill battle against Goa'ulds and Ori, who had numbers, millennia of entrenched power base, and their own unique powers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]] is a nice crossover with BtVS. Several BtVS characters played important roles in defeating Voldemort, without appearing overpowered. HP canon plot was derailed, but BtVS not much.

***** when youre recommending crossovers with other fandoms/media maybe it would be helpful to write the whole name and not cryptic abbreviations...

****** LotR -> Lord of the Rings

HP -> Harry Potter

BtVS -> Buffy: the Vampire Slayer

That's all the abbreviations. I did not know the last one and it took me just entering the phrase into Google. And both LotR and HP should be very obvious.

** Work on the worlds before starting, don't walk into a Harry/Buffy story and then 18 chapters in realize that Buffy also has witches and you put everything in the same world. Figure out how magic works around and with each other, how the abilities and powers that are included in the Crossover effect the Potter world and how Potter Magic effects the new World.

A place for everyone and everyone in their place, all to often crossovers will have Harry discover that every Sidekick of the Avengers are ALL Wizards and witches that every magic school and government just so happens to miss u til they're 13-18. Why no one knows but the plot demands it. It's better to make sure that Harry or who ever the wizard is has a Distinct role separate from everyone else. He also shouldn't be notable character plus magic eg: Wolverine down to the Claws plus magic, or Han Solo plus Magic. It just makes the Wizard irrelevant

People can be friends and work together without being related, Avoid at all cost the daddy from left field that makes Harry HAVE to go work with the Avengers. Out of all the possible reasons, Harry is in New York, Harry being recruited by Shield, Harry is Brainwashed by Loki. Any one of those things can go a million ways but the Constant X is Harry's True father all go one way that's Canon without actually tackling the different parentage, ya know like Harry not getting any of that sweet Potter or Black gold we love giving Harry, or the hard fact of coming around to a new family member. Or how about looking at his mother differently as she basically cheats on the man who gave his life for Harry, the man who IS the Stag of Harry's patronus the subconscious Guardian of Harry Potter.

Canon is but a rough guide, Canon doesn't have to happen the exact way it did on TV or the Big screen or the page. People love 'making slight changes' to Harrys Hogwarts years. Why must we follow the other sides Stations of Canon when we don't follow Harry's own. If you have the space you can slip Harry off into his own adventures. Imagine Harry in Star Wars with a bunch of OCs playing Bounty Hunter over there and on occasion bumping into Obi-Wan and Anakin. Or Harry In the Marvel movies, but instead of him being their for EVERY movie, he runs off alone and fights Vampires and werewolves and the giant Xemu. How about Harry in Buffy, he and a redeemed Faith are off hunting Vampires and Dark Wizards and shit as team.

** There is this gaping empty hole in HP / Marvel crossovers in which it seems like no-one ever thinks about the HP institutions as part of the Marvel world.

Here's one: "The MACUSA decided to defend New York against the Chitauri. The Statute is irrevocably broken."

I've never read something like this and it's maddening.

And thats not it. Never do I see authors explore the implications. I mean, suddenly there are these new big organisations in open play. The Ministries, the ICW and maybe even completely different political structures. How would wizards and witches deal with sorcerers - basically muggles who learned to do magic by sheer power of will?

Here's a story i'd like to see: Harry, as Auror (or ICW Enforcer, I don't care... something detective-y) partners up with Jessica Jones to bring down some Hydra plot in New York involving dark wizards (Harry's part) and one or more crime syndicates (Jessica's part). Since it's Hydra and not The Hand, the Avengers come into play as well and we have the whole troop together (whole meaning every character I like...).

** When you put the characters count alot as well. Is it before Hogwarts, during or after?\\
If before you're more open to a more magical crossover.\\
For example for before, Approaching Disaster linkeffn(11353630) a fate/zero crossover. Harry doesn't know about magic so the rules can be ignored slightly to get story important upgrades (learning Japanese by Legilimency).

*** yes, this! Potterverse has a lot of common elements with Urban Fantasy. Because of this, there are lot of universes where the xover works with only a little AU world building. My favs have been some of the Buffy and Dresden xovers.
