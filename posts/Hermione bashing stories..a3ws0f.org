Any stories that bash Hermione. I'm reading a story that just makes me hate Hermione(rise of the wizards), so any stories that bash Hermione would be great. I don't care if there is bashing on others, nor if it's an OP, weak, or somewhere in the middle MC. Just want to see some good old Hermione bashing. Some ironic karma would be best though, since just desserts are the sweetest of desserts.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

"/Rise of the Wizards/ is an imbecilic story, and Teufel1987 is a moron who couldn't write in character even if Rowling herself volunteered to be his beta reader," pronounced Hermione. "And, everything [[/u/VD909]] listed is bad, and he or she should feel bad for recommending it."

All good, I haven't read some of those fics in a while, quite a few years in a couple of cases so I went back and read them. Well, tried to anyway. Holy mother of satan, what on this earth was I taking?!?!? There was a couple I couldn't even make it through the first couple of chapters let alone finish them.\\
There was a couple of all right ones there though, so uh, guess my judgement was partially sound?

**** Well, it was mostly a grammar joke: the OP meant "Hermione-bashing stories"---stories that bash Hermione, not "Hermione bashing stories", which would be Hermione bashing some stories she'd read. You were just the next post down, though I know many of those fics, and they are, in fact, bad.

In any case, welcome to the club. Tastes evolve, usually towards more discernment and less tolerance for crap. I know I used to be far more tolerant of Ron-bashing than I am now, for example.

The OP specifically requested bashfics, so, by definition, much crap is to be found in them, especially since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/96i42t/hermione_critical_fanfiction/e419p97/?context=3][Hermione is a character whose canon flaws are actually very difficult to write well]], or at least harder to write, say, Harry's or Ron's. (Not that there are many that write Harry's and Ron's well, either.)

***** Yeah, I went through a bit of a stage a few years ago where I pretty much read only bashing/independent Harry fics for about 2 months. In other words, I read the exact same story just by different authors for two months and enjoyed them all.\\
I still enjoy bashing fics when they're done well but it annoys me that there is so few well written ones.

I noticed the grammar as well but my brain was definitely not awake enough to make any sort of joke. I think I've spent so long on the internet that my brain just automatically translates things into proper English half the time.

** So, most of these I haven't read in a while so I can't be 100% certain that they have what you're looking for but these are the ones that I vaguely remember having either Hermione bashing or something similar..

There are others but I can't remember them right now, if I do I will post a comment with those links. There's a couple on AO3 I'm trying to remember.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) has some interesting criticism of Hermione, where she studies something forbidden and obviously a bad idea, but ignores the warnings because she thinks she knows better and can avoid the pitfalls. Her decision making isn't really well-thought out and falls apart a bit imo, but I thought it was a legitimate take on her character

  COMPLETE: An AU Fifth Year fic written pre-OotP. Sword fights, apocalyptic battles, new kinds of magic. Love, betrayal, angst. Doing the right thing, doing the wrong thing, and doing it in style. This is epic. This is dark. *This* is TTK:Reloaded.
