Because seriously; giving a student, even such a high-achieving one as Hermione Granger, a device to let her turn back time with all the potential timeline distortions and risks it entails, just so she can take more classes, is ridiculous.

So...who knows a fic where Hermione was given the time-turner for a more serious purpose, with 'you can use it for getting to all your classes' as just a cover? Does she use it and Harry's invisibility cloak to witness serious crimes in the halls of Hogwarts? Did Dumbledore have prophetic knowledge that a time turner would be needed by someone close to Harry to avert catastrophe? Does she need it to alter the timeline and save students from the Dementor's Kiss when they sneak out to Hogsmeade?


** My headcanon is not as serious as that, though: I view it as an experiment, and Hermione was the guinea pig.

Basically, Dumbledore has contacts in the DoM, and they were looking into implementing Time Turners to increase availability of ministry personnel during more busy times of the day, without having to hire more people. Around the time Dumbledore caught wind of it, McGonagall happened to mention a student who had signed up for way too many elective classes... And the rest is history.

Also, a teacher or an older, much more competent student would have handled that 'secret objective' much better than the fourteen year old overworked over-achiever.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** My interpretation of the timeturner thing is that Dumbledore knew that she'd be responsible for keeping the chosen one alive at some point and wanted to get her as prepared as humanly possible. The fact that she was a huge nerd who WANTED to take that many classes just played into his hands nicely.

** According to the Wiki's page on Time-Turners, Hogwarts students may be issued with a Time-Turner in order to complete excessive workloads.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts students can apply for such a Time-Turner in order to take more classes, but they must undergo a large amount of screening process and must follow the most stringent set of rules, such as not abusing its powers nor let any outsiders know about it.

This would fit some theories I've seen where other students noted to have taken all subjects (Crouch Jnr and Percy, I think?) were also provided with Time-Turners. That section lacks a citation though, so I'd take it with a pinch of salt.

*** Thing is: How can you apply for something you don't know about? If the previous students were sworn to secrecy, how do the next students down the line find out?

Or is signing up for more electives than normal the application (because they conflict with each other on purpose?)?
