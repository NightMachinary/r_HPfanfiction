I only remember one scene. They had been captured by death eaters and escaped. The order was looking for them as well. They were running through this forest and were stuck out there lost for days. It started raining at one point and Harry got really sick. I think Draco might have killed a death eater with a rock as well. I searched but that was all I had to go on and couldn't really find anything. Thanks for the help!

Edit: Some more details: I think Harry could sense magic which is how they were able to avoid both the death eaters and the order. (they didn't know the order was searching for them, they were just assuming it was more death eaters.) Harry was very weak and I think Draco had to carry him at one point. When it started raining on them Draco cuddled Harry, who was burning up at this point. I can't remember anything else from the story sadly.

*** No that's not it, unfortunately. It was a long multi-chaptered story. I might give this one a read though.

*** I thumbed through that one, and that's not it either sadly. I'll add more details up above if I can remember them.

***** No, I don't remember any werewolves. It's usually not this hard to find a story I have read! I'm trying to remember more of it, but I'm just stuck on that one scene. I think it may have been a story where the neglect from Harry's relatives is a factor into why he was so week in the forest or something... I have no idea anymore. No matter what I'm getting good recommendations!
