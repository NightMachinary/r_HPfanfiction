I am trying to find a story I read a few years back that I want to reread but can't find it. The spoilers below are from the first chapter.

SPOILERS Basically after the war Harry is abducted and is forced to work in a mining facility that is used to create the death star.

It was a completed work with the entire story arch. And had Harry, Thrawn, Darth Vader and the Emporer. Anyone know what I am talking about

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.
