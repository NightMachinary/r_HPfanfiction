#+TITLE: LF fic where it’s pointed out that Ginny Weasley has ptsd from the Chamber and Ron’s eating habits are a result of a much bigger problem that’s killing him. I think they eventually get it fixed while Ron is hospitalized?

*** Well it was just a small portion of a bigger story. I remember Ron getting really sick and it turning out it was like his magic or something was slowly disappearing and he ate a ton of food unknowingly for his body to compensate. I think he was in the hospital for a while.

Then I remember Ginny being tended to. Not sure how it came about but maybe she was wigging out or something. Then at one point Harry offered to pay for psychiatric treatments for the Weasleys.

**** Was it where Ron lied to everyone that he was having an internship at a medical hospital, but instead he was just the patient? And it was a byproduct of the encounter with the brains in 5th year?

**** Wait, that sounds somewhat familiar. I know I've read a couple fics where Ginny gets help with her PTSD, and I think one or two where he pays or offers to pay. The Ron thing is ringing a bell, but I don't remember the specifics. I'd like to read it again if you find out.

***** Sadly I don't have much else extra to offer.

I think I've narrowed it down with the help of other redditors to time travel and Ron having a parasite. If that's the case Harry would've been the one to time travel. It easily could've been H/Hr. And in that case it could've been both of them who traveled back into their younger selves.

There could've been a part in it where Harry or his company was disparaging towards the twins at one point for always playing pranks on Ron at a young age giving him a complex but I can't really remember much of that bit.

** I don't know this fic... but I would like clarification..

I don't think Canon!Ron's eating is even that bad. It's slightly excessive - hyperbolized by the movies... further hyperbolized by fanon lol

But in every fic I read, Ron is a total slob.

He'll get a mountain of food, spray food everywhere when he talks and chews with his mouth open, talk mostly about lazing about and eating food. lol

** I think i remember the fic you're talking about but for the life of me I cant remember the name. Molly doesn't want Ginny to get any kind of counseling and constantly denies she even needs it until Harry forces the issue because of something ginny did. Ron's thing was because of him eating one of the twins experiments when he was much younger and it essentially turning his stomach into a black hole.

** Was Ron magically exhausted? Something about trying to break into Harry's trunk? In one fic he tried to get the map or cloak, but Harry locked and warded his trunk. Ron tried to get in, used too much magic. He gorged himself in the great hall to help replenish his magic and passed out.

​

Harry and Sirius paying for Ginny's treatment is in a few fics. Was this a Harry/Hermione fic?

There is something that just came to mind now that I'm thinking H/Hr. It could easily have also been a time travel back into earlier bodies fic for Harry and Hermione....but it also might not be.

** I seem to remember such a fic. It might be linkffn(9277019), by jjslll54. It has, iirc, things like immortal!HHr, op!HHr, spaceships and time travel, and is honestly a nice uber-crackfic to read once. Seems to be a rewrite of the "Harry potter and the magic of the Elders of the universe" series, by the same author, with some more elements and a bit nicer style.
