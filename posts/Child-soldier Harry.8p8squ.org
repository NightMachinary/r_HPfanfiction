Are there any fics where Harry is a muggle child soldier? (such as those who are conscripted since the age of 8 in third world countries.) He has to be doing it the muggle way not some Dumbledore makes him bull.


** linkffn(12212363)

Also if the child part isn't too strict he starts training at 16 in linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). The military aspect is also a major part of the story

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Also by the author of Emperor, the Dark Wars series

linkffn(3561444)

Just an FYI, they're not exactly on the level of Emperor at all, but they do fill the child soldier aspect - not as young as 8, but I think like 14/16

  17 years have passed since Voldemort's fall and the Potters vanished. Now, as part of the revitalized British Empire's elite, the Potters return in the midst of a new Dark insurgency. However, their orders quickly come to head with Dumbledore's plans. AU.

** This isn't exactly trained by muggles but linkffn(Learning to Breathe).

Short version is that Sirius trained Harry using both muggle and magical means to turn him into a super-soldier to battle Voldemort. Even after winning, Harry swims around the lake and runs like 5 km in the morning just as a warm up. You ever see the anime Full Metal Panic!? This story is that in HP fantasy setting and without mecha. Harry is also emotionally obtuse, much like the Spartans are depicted in the Haloverse. It also has one of my favorite scenes in the fandom, where Harry uses his animagus form to defeat a magical beast (seriously its awesome).

  Harry Potter is 16 years old. He already defeated Voldemort, with the help of his Godfather Sirius Black. Now he is in for the biggest challenge of his life: attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
