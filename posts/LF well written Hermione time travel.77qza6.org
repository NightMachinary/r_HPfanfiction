  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

** Hmm well it's not strictly a time travel fic vs a 'time travel happens once and that changes the course of history' fic but I've gotta suggest this one. For anything SSHG the works of Ms Figg were my go-to.

  Hermione Granger goes back in time to try and convince a young Severus Snape not to aid Tom Riddle. Of course, Severus doesn't make it easy. Life at Hogwarts is now VERY different. Alternate Universe, Violence. OOC, Drama, Romance, Humor, Lemons and more.

** Best Snape/Hermione time-travel I've read is linkffn(Fade to Grey by marianne le fey). It's got a different take from the usual time-travel fics.

  Unable to catch hold of anything in order to save herself, her mind clung to the one fact it knew to be unassailably true: something was terribly, terribly wrong.

** Why do you enjoy those pairings, though? They're all at least 20 years older than her. I guess if Hermione is time traveling it pulls the age gap down a bit, but that's just the same justification as "it's not pedophilia if it's a 6000 year old dragon in the body of a 10 year old girl."

*** May/December relationships as they're known aren't dreadfully ghastly things or anything... Some people like older men. Particularly some fanfic writers. (On a sub like this it's pretty obvious that many, many parings are gratuitous, despite an enjoyment of them.)

As for why Hermione? Many people feel that she'd be interested in someone more mature than her peers. And as far as Snape is concerned (a character who's past is frequently glossed or mellows somewhat after the war) he's got a few similar interests and values. Fanfiction will always like exploring that.

The thing with age differences in many fics is that romance seems to blossom despite the younger partner's age, never because of it. Which people have been divided over for years with either side (those who accept that entirely and those who violently oppose) being very aggressive on their stance either way.

Some couples are going to occupy that grey area. Especially student-teacher relationships, but that's the nature of the beast there. Some people like that dynamic (it's very popular in and out of fanfics) and many will be written as a relationship of equal footing despite what real life might tell us otherwise.
