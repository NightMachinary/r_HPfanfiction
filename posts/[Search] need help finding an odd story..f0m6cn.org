First time posting here so I apologize if I posted wrongly. This is a rather obscure request. I may be remembering Two different stories but I will try none the less. I am searching for a Harry/Hermione story; where during the wedding, the church is attacked by rockets, fired Merc's hired by Lord Greengrass. Another part that I may be mis-remembering is near the end, Hermione gives a potion to an old bully from before Hogwarts that cures her cancer.

** A sequel to the Arithmancer has Hermione bringing a muggle treatment to one of the Greengrass sisters in the form of gene therapy, but that doesn't sound like what you're looking for...
