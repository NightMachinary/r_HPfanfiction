I remember reading a harry potter fan written book 8, this was just before when the cursed child was available for pre-order. It was how Harry/Ron/Hermonie go on an adventure to find hermonie's parents in Australia. Does anyone have a link to it now? Or know it's name? It was something like "Harry Potter Fan Written Book 8"


** There's literally thousands of fan written book 8s. You need to be more specific.
