I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]] and enjoyed it a lot. Its the only soulbond fic I've actually read despite seeing the concept mentioned a lot.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] by ShayaLonnie is an amazing story, though it may be a bit lengthy depending on your preferences. It's my personal favorite fanfiction. It touches on multiple types of bonds, but also soul bonds.

Edit: fixed the link

*** I recommend this as well, I thought the bonds in it were rather well done.

*** Cool, I'm gonna give this a read next I think. I really don't like the Hermione/Adult pairing that is getting recommended a lot. Is that a common theme?

**** Hermione/adult fics are actually fairly common, particularly Snape/Remus/Sirius. A good chunk of the Remus or Sirius stories involve time travel though, so it isn't actually 18 year old with nearly forty year old. Most with the age gap stuff that I see recommended normally wait until she's at least of age or out of school, but I can definitely see why that would put someone off.

***** Yeah, time-turner fics are popular, but I've been seeing a lot of marriage law ones, too, mostly with Remus or Sirius. Odd at first, but she's almost always of age in the marriage law ones.

** I have a couple i have enjoyed reading, and some are a "bit" original. Is it important which pairing the fanfics are? Do they have to be completed?

*** As I've only read one story originality isn't a problem. I'd prefer completed stories, or at least ones that are long enough to leave me satisfied. I hate kid/adult pairings, and any of the trio/Draco is a no go. Other than that I'm not picky.

**** Good. Most of the soulbond fanfics i enjoy are between Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermoine. There are others Harry/(Fleur or Gabrielle) or Harry/Tonks, but those are fewer then the Ginny or Hermoine fanfics. Some links for stories below:

Harry/Hermoine: A kiss can save the world: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357909/1/A-Kiss-Can-Save-The-World]]

H J Potter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter]]

Knowledge is Power: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]

Harry Potter: Duke of Gryffindor: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7036397/1/Harry-Potter-Duke-of-Gryffindor]]

This is also a nice list to go through for Harry/Hermoine stories: [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=5155]]

These are some I enjoy, but i have some more for other characters, and some not so serious or not finished with others. Just ask if you want any more.

***** Any recommendations for Harry/Hermione that don't have excessive bashing? I don't mind a bit, especially if its the canon stuff. Dumbledore withholding information/not trusting anyone but himself. Or Ron being a jealous insensitive git. Molly treating everyone like a kid and such.

***** I checked out HJ Potter and HP: Duke of Gryffindor, but stopped reading both when they started talking about guns. Aren't there any HG/HP soulbond stories without firearms being used by them?

** If you don't mind multiple pairings, you can try "Heart and Soul" (Harry+Fleur+Hermione) or "Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble" (Harry+Hermione+Fleur+Gabrielle). I like these stories because both manage to present the harem trope in a (for me anyway) non-skeevy way. I apologize for not being able to link 'coz I'm on mobile, but both are on ffnet.

** Strange and Beautiful: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3701224/1/]]

I haven't gotten very far into this one, so I don't know how good it is. Hermione/Cedric with the two of them bound in some way.

#+begin_quote
  An eight year-old Harry Potter comes across Acquila Black, a girl at his school, only to realise that he shares a strange connection with her. And when Sirius Blacks escapes Azkaban, how will he help his godson and daughter in defeating the darkest wizard of all times? (Year three in progress) (Chapters 12-20 under revision)
#+end_quote

It is one of my favourite fics to date. It went on hiatus for a month but it's scheduled to return this month. It's also the best 'Sirius's daughter' fic that I know of.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] might be worth reading (once you've read the others) as a deconstruction of the trope.
