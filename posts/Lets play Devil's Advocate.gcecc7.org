What made people support Voldemort? What, besides blood purity, encouraged wealthy, influencial families to support a half-blood with grand ideas and powerful enemies? We all know that Tom Riddle was smart, charismatic, and cunning, but is that enough to start a war? Did Voldemort hold propaganda campaigns like Hitler? What did he promise his followers if he were to win? Just how many wizards and witches supported his cause without being a Death Eater?

What would Wizarding Britain be if Voldemort succeeded and killed Harry Potter, in 1981 or 1998? If Voldemort succeeded and became an absolute ruler? What was Voldemort's goal for the Wizarding World, and did blood purity truly matter to him in the end?

I want to write a story with a Pro-Voldemort ideology, maybe even letting him win in the end, but why would my character support him?


** Death Eaters wanted power, Voldemort wanted complete subjugation.

That he could take on Albus Dumbledore was the reason they followed him. Being Slytherin's heir played a part, especially during his Hogwarts years, but, as we see in DH, Dumbledore was the linchpin that held everything together and, as we see in OotP/DH, someone they all feared.

There were probably more sympathizers than Death Eaters.

*** This. Additionally, the only actual people who would have known his status as a half blood were his school “peers”, people who he would have gotten to follow him through guile, charm, and a “private” confession and proving of his status as the heir of Slytherin. These people would be just as bigoted as we see in the books, and fanatically loyal to him as the heir of Slytherin (who was charming, cunning, and able to prove himself time and again), on top of his alleged intent to give them everything they want. To everyone not in this true inner circle (think the parents of the death eaters seen in the books, grandparents of the students), he would have been perfect: powerful, smart, dangerous, and presumably pure blooded. From there, it was simple to lead them by the nose, giving them the carrot of what they want and the stick of enduring suffering or outright death. The only people who would t follow him at this point wouldn't agree with his professed ‘talking points' or methods. Those opposed to his methods would sympathize with his cause, those who opposed his ‘talking points' would be normal, well adjusted (as much as witches and wizards could be) individuals. That was the danger of him- his followers and sympathizers were /HIGHLY/ placed in government, while the majority of his foes would be to low class to effectively mount an opposition. We're it not for Dumbledore and the order of the Phoenix, Voldoe likely would have taken over in the sixties or seventies. As it was, he was mostly winning until he ran afoul of a mother's love.

** I think it was very similar to Hitler and also Grindelwald. I love how in Crimes of Grindelwald he gives his speech and he actually sounds like a good guy, showing that his followers were regular, good people (like Queenie) and not born psychopaths as the media often represents eg Germans during WWII. He didn't just sound like a good guy, but like the good guy. He doesn't mind muggles, but they have brought war to this world and invented the atomic bomb, and it's only a matter of time before they turn it on them. And then the “Aurors“ come and kill one of his supporters and that's just how WWII started. He's the good guy. It's the others that are violent.

Nazis weren't born evil and neither were the followers of Voldemort or Grindelwald. And no one, no racist, no sexist, no one, thinks they are the bad guy. Hitler and co sounded like the good guys at first. Hitler promised jobs and hospitals and streets at a time when people were poor and desperate. And he delivered. And it was slow, a kind of slippery slope, that started seemingly innocent but ended with the deaths of thousands upon thousands of innocent people. It's easy to stir hatred when people are unhappy. They need someone they can blame. I'm not even a hundred percent sure if Hitler and co hated Jews/muggles/muggle borns as much as they claimed to, or if they just recognized that you can unify people against a common enemy. And that people become blind in their fear and hatred. Just look at what happened when Corona was at its worst - approval ratings of governments around the world skyrocketed. Now that things are getting back to normal (at least where I live) this is changing again and people start to question. But at a time of crisis, everyone stood together against this outside force.

I'm sure Voldemort was very clever and charismatic. A dangerous combination. I'm sure gathering his followers took time. Lots of time. I doubt his followers started out willing to kill, just like I doubt many people in Germany and Austria would have agreed to kill Jewish people early on. I doubt they started out following someone who tortured them. He surely started out sounding like a good guy. And I'm sure he made them all feel like victims. Suppressed by muggles and muggle borns. Why would they have to give up their freedom? Why should they live in hiding? Why can they not criticize muggle borns who are intolerant of their culture? Why are muggle borns allowed to criticize them at every point? Why do Slytherins get shunned just for being ambitious and cunning? And slowly they would turn more radical and many of them would be in too deep before they realized what was going on.

*** So the Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers thought they were the good guys, maybe even after they realized they may be wrong, but the Ministry and the "Light" side (Dumbledore, OotP, ect) painted them as the bad guys after they lost. History is written by the victors, after all, and it would be the other way around if Voldemort won. I don't agree with genocide, obviously, but I love writing and thinking like the villain.

** To put it into perspective, the Wizarding 'War' (either the original or the second one in the books) is not really a war - it's probably more analogous to terrorist campaigns, or guerilla campaigns or the like.

The reason it started is because Voldemort's and his followers' goal was to take over the country - and to do it this way, through seizing power and showing off how powerful they were, to prevent people from opposing them. This type of armed overthrowing of a government is not something that's uncommon - though the additional terror elements of it might be.

Of course, that's after he's already gotten his core of followers. Why would they follow him, then? Well, an easy answer is that Voldemort was smart enough to see what appealed to them. For instance, I don't think that blood purity was too important to Voldemort personally - however, being able to denigrate and point to an 'other' is a very powerful tool for a fascist, and Voldemort's movement falls into that idea pretty well. I imagine it as very similar to Nazi rhetoric - except, instead of blaming the Jews, it'd be blaming the Muggleborn.

So his tactics were to round up some impressionable youth from powerful families, tie them to him politically and personally, and then use them - and their rage directed towards the muggleborn - to get into power by attacking/terrorizing everyone into line. What then?

Well, we don't really know! Voldemort might have wanted power itself - and so we could have seen him centralizing everything around himself, attacking other countries, etc. Alternatively, maybe he was more after the potential afforded by the position - and we'd see him settle down, use his power to reform society to what he sees as acceptable, and use the resources of the state to assist with his magical experiments.

For your character, you have a few options. You could write your character as racist, which is not very appealing TBH. You could write them as ambitious and opportunist, desiring power above everything else. You could write them as scared, not wanting to be attacked or their family attacked by death eaters.

** I shall take a canon compliant perspective.

Voldemort was powerful enough that he didn't need anyone else. I think Dumbledore makes the point that he's never felt a need for anyone else's help and the reality is that this is never really shown to be false. I mean, sure, he loses in the end but from a certain point of view he loses because he trusted other people. He asked Slughorn about Horcruxes. He gave the Diary to Lucius. He trusted Snape (although this, at least, was partially due to his confidence in his legilimency).

So... in this context, why did he have supporters at all? Two interpretations. One, the Death Eaters were some kind of sleight of hand... a method Voldemort devised to keep Dumbledore's attention focussed elsewhere, freeing him to pursue his own goal of immortality. Two, Voldemort really was a pure blood supremacist. Three, Voldemort always knew he'd need loyal followers to construct a new body for him. The problem with the first argument is that Voldemort trusts the Horcruxes: his goal of immortality is achieved before there were ever any Death Eaters, so why the need for the sleight of hand? Thus, I think it's a combination of two and three. After all, Voldemort was charismatic... he could have found people who weren't supremacists to be his Death Eaters, right?

The question, to my mind, is therefore "why did a muggle raised individual become a pure blood supremacist?" And while it might be tempting to say "because of the orphanage" I think it starts with the notion that muggles aren't special. From there, Voldemort is sorted into Slytherin and he learns two things. Firstly, that pure blood ideology exists. Secondly, that he, himself, is extra-special since he's a descendant of Slytherin... the house he's been sorted in. Thus, specialness is now wrapped up in the pre-existing dressings of pure blood ideology and Voldemort's own self myths (recalling that, like Harry, he was initially obsessed with his father... but in a different fashion). It's not quite the same as blood purity but it's close.

Which leaves the question of what Voldemort's society would look like... I'm thinking it would be paranoid and totalitarian. Voldemort would always be on the look out for another destined champion, I think. His own ideas about specialness would certainly drift towards experimentation on muggle borns and probably Umbridge's "half breeds" too.

Voldemort himself doesn't seem /that/ obsessed with pure bloods given he seems to tolerate the notion of Snape/Lily whilst indicating a preference for better matches. To my mind, this suggests that a lot of the fics which posit a breeding programme aren't too far off base. The thing is, Voldemort's followers do care about blood purity and I think they'd be left with the actual business of running Britain. Thus, I imagine the Death Eaters would position themselves as corrupt party members, with first pick of everything they want and chief among those wishes would be an absence of mudbloods, right?

In the meantime, Voldemort's own efforts would be dedicated to four objectives:

- ensuring there's another Barty Crouch jr, i.e. someone free and fanatical to restore his body if required (hence, Delphini)
- finding some alternative to the horcruxes so that he's not consigned to being a wraith for however long
- the pursuit of knowledge about magical talent (this would be as much to ensure he remains the most powerful wizard as an academic interest)
- the subjugation of the muggle world

Hence, I believe a prospective follower would see:

- an opportunity to live in a blood supremacist society
- an opportunity to curry favour with the new regime
- an opportunity to shape society
- an opportunity to eventually not have to live in secret (sort of a lebensraum type idea)
- an opportunity to be near power

Death Eaters may also have been promised immortality but I suspect this was more in the form of "your names will be legend" than actual immortality.

*** So maybe a character, with somewhat similar origins to Tom Riddle (e.g. raised by muggles, aware of their magic, retaliates against bullying) would follow Voldemort because they have a "the strong rule over the weak" mindset, and consider themselves strong?

Once the statute of secrecy falls? Nuked. Or invaded by the ICW to prevent the fall of the statute of secrecy. Some government could develop a plague that targets magicals.

Because let's face it, magic is powerful and can be used in tons of ways. But it can not withstand the full brunt of the military of the world.

ANYWHO~ The magical world would either get roflstomped out of hand, and then some unnamed country will try to take advantage of the situation and make a power play. This would cause World War Magic to become World War 3. Another possibility is the Death Eater and magical communities pulling attacks off and causes countries to pull the mutually assured destruction card.

TL;DR: Nobody would win. Apocalypse.
