Wanted to do more than one today, but I was busy with a seminar. And last-minute farming on FGO, shouldn't have procrastinated the event until the last day. I'll have more time tomorrow, probably, so I'll try to make more than a chapter then.

Now, let's see what kind of fresh torture I'm getting into.

Starting with the usual review - Hermione is ruminating whether Harry likes her, and thinking about the Life Debt she owes him for the troll and how generous he was for accepting her as a friend. Also how Ron is a leech. She convinces herself to try being more girly. Back with Harry, we see him at breakfast (unclear whether it's the same day or the next, leaning towards the latter), as he takes potions to mend the abuse to his body, and even make him mildly superhuman apparently. He thinks about how Dumbledore is literally worse than Voldemort for a while, then thanks Luna for the article she wrote and gives her his notes on his Ministry escapades. Classes finally start, and we have Divination to start the day - Trelawney prophesizes Harry's death, he legilimences her to see that she's faking it, and finds the rest of the prophecy in there (despite her not remembering it). Class ends, and Harry proclaims he's going to fondle Hermione as an excuse for them to be alone so that they can time travel - he then proposes that they pose as boyfriend and girlfriend so that they have an excuse to sneak off when needed. He flirts a bit, kisses her, proposes actually getting in a relationship, she doth protests but agrees to fake it. They travel back two hours to make up for lost time, and they talk a bit more about their plan - Harry convinces her to use the time turner more, at least doubling each day, and they make plans for eating and sleeping (in the room of requirement).

Oof, I already feel like I'm dying. Let's see if I can give my commentary in a more chronological order this time.

Hermione apparently owes Harry a Life Debt, but Ron doesn't because he was the one to put her in that situation. She has also never informed Harry of this, ever. Another detail is that she doesn't consider Ron a friend - the only reason she tolerates him is that he and Harry are a package deal. This won't last long, for sure.

She also had a crush on Harry based on what she read before meeting him - one that she 'got over' when she saw how wimpy normal Harry was. More of the canon Harry/PL!Harry dichotomy here.

Hermione has also been quite huggy the past few chapters - I had chalked that up to mild flanderization of her character, but apparently there was a reason for it. Here we see that she was testing the waters in regards to both her sexuality, and her relationship with Harry. It's a surprisingly competent move on PL's part - I would even go so far as to say this is good writing, if the rest of the fic didn't exist. It's like the shiny reflection on a turd.

We have a pretty good accounting here of the Dursley's abuse towards Harry, just so that we can have a clear picture of it. They beat him, starved him, made him work too much, Marge's dogs bit him, and he has scars from Vernon. One thing he says I found kind of laughable

  If he'd eaten well all that time, he'd have been a solid mass of muscle under those too-large clothes
#+end_quote

It reminds me of Core Threads, and Handsome Squidward!Harry. Good times.

Speaking of which, those potions must really be something else. They will cure his malnutrition, his scars, give him all the muscles he should have had, even his eyes will get better. There is this part I found pretty strange - PL assumes that curing Harry of his canon 'problems' is enough to make him the best of his year at, well, everything. He'll go from the worst physically (despite being one of like 2 people in his year that does any kind of sports) to being the best, and when he stops emulating Ron's lazy behavior he becomes equal if not better than Hermione. His Harry-shaped self insert can't be anything less than the absolute best at everything.

What else... As I said in the summary, Harry straight up believes Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort, and that is obviously the case because the separation between Harry and PL is so thin it's basically transparent.

One last thing to talk about is the prophecy, because PL apparently can't conceive anything that isn't logically consistent. He's really hung up on the 'neither can live while the other survives' part of it, so much that he decided to change the 'live' part with 'die'. His take on the prophecy, by his own words, means that both Harry and Voldemort are protected by plot armor that can only be defeated by each other. He also says that, since his version is obviously closer to how events unfolded in the story, /obviously/ Dumbledore told Harry a fake prophecy to manipulate him. Because he's evil.

I literally can't even right now, I'm going to sleep and think more on this tomorrow before I post the next part.


** Harry was apparently strong enough to knock a flying cannonball away from himself to prevent it from crushing his face in. And that was when he was 11. I don't know where this idea that he's weak comes from.
