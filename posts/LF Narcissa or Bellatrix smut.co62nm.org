** This one's like, an actual story with the smut. Hermione and Andromeda, then Hermione and Narcissa, then Hermione and Bellatrix. It's really good, I swear, if you're up for a whole 270k words. +The second time I read it, I skimmed to the fun parts.+ linkao3(13657767)

#+begin_quote
  In another world, Hermione Granger never attended Hogwarts. Orphaned at age three, she grew up supporting a low-income adoptive family without the means to pay for her education. Post-war desperation and a chance encounter lead her into the employ of the three Black sisters. She finds herself caught in their deadly web, helplessly waiting to see who will reach her first.
