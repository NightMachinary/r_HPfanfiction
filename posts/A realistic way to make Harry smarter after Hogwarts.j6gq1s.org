**** I think the premise is used more for fics in which the horcrux is somehow removed early, and then Harry becomes more powerful while still in school.

Off the top of my head, I can't think of a story where this consequence is only used post Hogwarts. Though there are plenty of stories where Harry is a powerful auror, I just can't think of any which use horcrux removal as a reason

** Why do you consider Harry dumb? This is a legit question by the way. Harry (and Ron) might be teenage boys and hence prone to not taking work seriously but all indications place him above average.

He's not Hermione, I admit but then nobody is Hermione. Harry masters the Patronus as a 13 year old and as a 14 year old learns a dozen spells through self study for the triwizard tournament. He's also clever enough to adapt and get solutions based on his skills (first task).

Look at his marks for the OWLS, if you ignore History of Magic (where he seized) or Astronomy (which he spent looking at Hagrid's hut) the only bad grade he got was Divination and I mean - it's Divination.

He gets an EE in both potions and transfigurations, both terribly hard subjects and a Brilliant in DADA, something even Hermione can't get.

Harry is not "the brightest of his year" but he (and Ron) are very much above par.

**** I think that pinning Sirius' death on Harry is a bit unfair. First of, as soon as Sirius gave him the mirror he vowed to never use it, and did his best to forget about it. As for occlumency Snape (and Dumbledore) are as much at fault here as Harry is. Doesn't Dumbledore straight up admit it by saying that he never thought Snape's hatred for James would lead into him refusing to teach Harry?

Umbridge? "“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.” it's the same thing as with Mad eye moody's Eye, Harry has NEVER been able to see injustice in front of him and not act. That's what makes him a hero. Could he slowly bind his time and come up with a plan? Sure, but then Harry's always willing to help the weak - He would have shown himself by releasing the ones on trial anyway.

Much due to bagman's bet he's actually rewarded for helping Gabrielle so that's not a sign of "dumbness" but rather "nobility".

And he didn't go to Lockhart for support, reassurance or even somenoe to have his back. At that point Harry was as sick of Lockhart as the teachers who just five minutes ago he saw mock him and try to push him into risking his life. It was revenge, not safekeeping.

As for Philosopher's Stone given that no one knows Voldemort has achieved flight until DH it's perfectly feasible that there is something to stop their path. Not that he could possibly know, I admit, but it wouldn't just be Harry that'd hit the stone, it'd be any non full body Voldemort and Snape wizard...

But then if you really want to paint the actions of a teenage, traumatised kid standing up for what's right - sacrificing his safety for others as stupid instead of noble I don't know what to tell you.

***** I mean I would argue that the biggest true reason he's a bit stupid is that he's the imperfect narrator whose perspective needs to be super limited so the plot will unroll at the pacing Rowling wishes for. But there are definitely responses and decisions he makes that are wack. I much prefer it when a writer actually gives a reason for that like trauma, or having him as neurodivergent (which is another reason for taking a clue like that at face value)

Because Harry is pretty clueless in the books. Not stupid, but like, only quick when it moves the plot forwards, rather than being consistent or natural

Excuse me, Harry taking the poem at face value was actually intelligent. He's in a tournament. That was canceled for legitimate reasons. Made for *of age* magicals. Against his will.

There is absolutely no reason for /anyone/ to believe that the hostages are /not in danger./ They were under a lake. There were no wizards around who could help them if anything went wrong. And unlike the other three champions, Harry has /personal/ experience with things going wrong and people nearly dying inside Hogwarts.

People always point at Dumbledore, saying that he'd ensured that the hostages would be safe. Yes, sure, just like he'd secured the Goblet of Fire so no one underage would be entered right? Like he'd turned up in time to save Hermione from the troll? Or Ginny from the basilisk? It's almost as if people believe him to be infallible.

That was Ron and Hermione there. He was /right/ not to leave them behind. Any radical merperson who was disgruntled with wizards could've stabbed them.

Of the spells he knows, very few are considered difficult, really only the patronus is. DADA is just as I said it is, charms and Care, the reason that he beat Hermione (by only one grade mark) is the practical application and the opportunities that he has had to train the practical application.

** During his school years, he was mostly focused on things other than school. There was always something going on, and he was always busy investigating it. Not to mention, that he was probably constantly stressed (competing in a deadly tournament, being fortunate by crazy dada prof, escaped convict on the run etc.), so he did not really have an opportunity to stop worrying and focus on his studies. Moreover, he found out about the prophecy during his fifth year. Did he know for sure that he is going to survive the battle with Voldemort? Probably not. He did not have much reason to aspire to become a healer, unspeakable etc., because he does not know if he will live to see that future. What he is focusing on is surviving. And he does survive. So, in a sense, he does achieve something.

There is also the fact that he spent most of his summers at Dursley's doing chores, which is not the most brain stimulating environment.

So, I think it is possible that after going back to school to complete 7th year, he would start studying harder, and maybe even find some hidden talent in arithmace or something.

I think that most people think this because they're not in Harry's position. They have the reader's practically omniscient perspective. You can easily remember that Sirius gave Harry a wrapped package in book 5 because it happened a few hours ago for you. For Harry? It was several months between Christmas holidays and the end of OWLS. And he'd already resolved to never use it and put it out of his mind.

Imagine a black student being called a N***r by their professor on a regular basis. They'd lose their shit. As they should.

As for behaviour - making decisions is a matter of experience, not intelligence. Go back to book 1 and see how Hermione reacts to the devil's snare for an easy example. To get into some academic career requiring intelligence and vast knowledge you needn't be an omniscient, always right kind of person - you just need to be capable of learning the material. Which I'm pretty sure Harry would be, going by his graded in Owls (EE in potions after 6 years with Snape who had a hateboner for him to the point where he didn't really care about the subject?

  You could say that for that level of activity, the horcrux needed to use a part of Harry's mind, leaving him unable to use it. (Like a heavy, CPU intensive program running in the background.)
#+end_quote

I would personally not present it so technically. I'd say that having someone else's soul in you is just overall detrimental to your well being. Similar to how Quirrel was doomed by Voldemort possessing him. Harry had less Voldemort, so it was less than lethal. There's also the whole Lily protection that you'd really think would have had some interaction with the horcrux.

I'd be interested in reading fics with this premise, but it's absolutely bait for shitty super Harry fics.

I'm a bit of a fan of the idea of Harry basically absorbing the bit of soul as a powerup. That also fits with the whole "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal" thing and it fits the theme of the prophecy being self-fulfilling. Haven't found a fic that does it right in my eyes though.

  I'm a bit of a fan of the idea of Harry basically absorbing the bit of soul as a powerup. That also fits with the whole "the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal" thing and it fits the theme of the prophecy being self-fulfilling. Haven't found a fic that does it right in my eyes though.

Fits the greek style prophecy vibe really well.

** The soul part is interesting, but I always thought that Voldemort's soul actually made him stronger. He has two different souls, compared to rest of the humans, and his spells tend to have immense power behind them (in Astronomy Tower battle, his Impediment Jinx /lifted/ someone up rather than just slow them down, I'm sure you'll find more of such examples) which is really uncommon. Not only this but Voldemort's soul also grants him Parseltongue which is another ability that he otherwise wouldn't have. It sounds weird but I would imagine his magic would be slightly weaker than powerful once the second soul is gone.

The most realistic way is that Harry spent the Horcrux hunt reading books, which he didn't do in school.

You could also make him study by realising his mistake of not properly arming himself, given the amount of enemies he has, and after Voldemort, he doesn't want to get caught off-guard ever again so he tries to become the best wizard he could be.

There's also the Elder Wand, if he uses that wand then he could become powerful without even learning too much, or you could simply upgrade his Phoenix wand - I've read many stories where by reparing the Phoenix wand with Elder Wand, it somehow becomes more powerful than before.

*** Maybe it is not a deliberate choice? He spent a lot of time locked up inside the tent and Grimmauld Place, with many books around and DE out for his head, if you are willing to up a little his stress levels (maybe having Ron and Hermione also extremely stressed and reacting to it in ways that put all three at odds with each other) you could reasonably make it so he turns into a stress-reader, making it so he /has/ to go back to Hogwarts for his seventh year and having deep traumatic reactions at seeing his home so damaged and the spots where he saw so many students dying (with an unhealthy side dose of guilt), making Ron and Hermione start to hang more among themselves (not as in not wanting to hang with Harry, but as them wanting some time alone now that they are dating), making him uncomfortable with the increased fame and then having him start using the stone to learn more magic (maybe he calls Dumbledore's ghost to ask for advice -either in life or academics- and it snowballs from there), having Ginny either get into a relationship with someone else during the war, putting great effort in her Quidditch career (talent alone only goes so far, training is very important and it could also become her coping mechanism eventually) or just plain dying (which could also have repercussions into Ron's interactions with Harry)... he would be pretty screwed up in the head by midway point, but he /would/ get to the genius level.

** Harry is not a bookworm like Hermione but he is by no means stupid. We see him during his years of formation so he is still learning stuff but he has a good head on his shoulders. Other than the DoM fiasco he always puts two and two together. He is far superior in defensive magic even to students older than him. Despite being a child, he stands toe to toe with adults. He is in a way like Hermione because he knows his shit but he is emotional. Unlike Hermione though he also keeps his cool in critical situations. Sure, he might not be a prodigy like Dumbledore, Voldemort or Snape but they are in a league of their own. And maybe he would have been too if his mind wasn't always focused on survival unlike the other three. He is also very capable to catch things on the fly unlike Hermione. He is not a potion genius but he reacts well when Ron is poisoned. He sucks at summoning charms but when it becomes critical that he masters it, he does so quickly.

** as someone who had considerable issues with mind fog due to severe disabling chronic pain and other physical and mental issues, I honestly had this as my head canon already, as I know what it feels like when you feel like something is draining your very soul from your body. Thinking just doesn't work the same, responses to environmental stimuli and situations can be weird (I have a bad habit of grabbing mice or insects that I see in the middle of the night in a weird flinch reaction, so a snitch might be similar) and those basic things like executive function and motivation are really difficult.

It also effects things like that very healthy thing we have where our brain says ‘if you do that it's going to hurt a lot', or ‘you might die'. That impulse is sort of deadened or delayed because the process is muddled up and things like burning pain can seem like not as big a thing when you're already hurting in twelve places on your body and you need the cookies out of the oven.

Trauma and depression also affect pretty much everything I mentioned as well.

I hope that made sense, as I'm pretty foggy today; but mostly I'm just saying an emphatic yes. I'm not a scientist but as someone who has considerable drains on my faculties on the daily I feel like my experience leads me to think there is no possible way having a cursed shard of soul attached to you, onto top of the traumas he suffered as a baby and then growing up, that it wouldn't affect everything from his ability to process, things like ambition and self preservation, as well as physically and whatever it would have done to his magic and his soul.

** Harry was dumber in the books than his genetics would seem to suggest, but remember that he was abused (at least verbally) and he also grew up malnourished. Perhaps there was lead paint in the cupboard? In any case, his lousy upbringing more than explains the discrepancy.

** I'd be wary of it being an overpowered Harry. You seem to think that Harry is stupid, but there's stupid and then there's stupid you know? Harry lacks pragmaticism, not brain cells. He goes off due to his moral code/emotions, which Hermione calls his 'saving people thing' which won't be fixed by an increase in IQ.

** Get him therapy. His upbringing, while not the uber abuse that fanon sometimes portrays, was still in an abusive environment that undermined his intellectual development. He learned to not expect much for himself and likely internalized some form of 'I'm not worth putting more effort in.' Being an auror was more about connecting to his dad and spiting Umbridge. It had nothing to do with what he believed he could actually achieve.

** You could use it for power as well.

“Mr Potter, Madam Pomfrey has informed me that due to Tom Riddle's soul no longer straining your magic-you may find you have a certain increase in magical power. She has asked I ensure we know the full scale of this increase as to properly guide you in the future.”

Harry blinked, with all that had happened he was still reeling from the battle and his rather unstable mental state wasn't sure what information to be shocked by anymore.

“Oh”

Professor McGonagall just raised a brow before sighing and continuing.

“I suppose this was a bad time to bring it up but i do need to be sure-”

“I promise I'm no danger to anyone Professor” Harry cut her off, something the more stable Harry would have never dared do. However she didn't seem massively bothered, probably in the same tired boat as Harry.

“...But if anything does come up I'll be certain to-ACHOO!”

Upon sneezing, a blast of magic washed over the room-in a split second McGonagall was standing with her wand out. Harry immediately held up his snot covered hands in a defensive gesture.

“I-I didn't mean“

“THIS is exactly what I'm worried about Mr potter-let us hope nothing has come of a mere sneeze-“

For the second time that day Professor McGonagall was was cut off mid sentence, this time By Oliver Wood slamming her door (Which had been warded shut) open with enough force to send it crashing into the wall behind. The man looked a mixture of terrified and furious, ash coated his face and tears streamed from his eyes.

** This thinking of Harry should be smart because his parents are smart is bunked right? I mean that's just ignoring that nurture > nature right?

James was a pureblood who was spoiled, bullied kids at school and sexually harassed a girl until she said yes after 7 years of badgering her to go out with him. You know he was messing around with other girls with Sirius.

Lily was a first generation witch. What evidence do we have that she was just a genius prodigy? Slughorn said she was one of his favorites but lets be fair hes kinda a pervert and Lily probably looked great in a skirt bent over. Also she was great at charms and flitwick loved her but its not like she had any post hogwarts schooling like a mastery, or 1 on 1 master/apprentice work. She got preggo and was forced to stay away in a house to play mom.

Harry was brought up in a really messed up abusive environment. Its cannon that he ends up a semi normal kid even though his upbringing was terrible but no kid would honestly come out of that a functioning adult.

I think there is way more proof hes a messed up or should be messed up more than he should. His parents should mean nothing to him he didn't even know they existed. You don't get super powers passed down from your parents cause they scored a 0 on their charms owl exam. Dudley was a dumb box of rocks and harry was a physically/emotionally/under fed starved kid.

*** A bit blunt, but I agree. I don't understand this obsession with making Harry some sort of a genius. He had a messed up childhood and survived a year on the run and a civil war at 17. I'd say he came up on top. No one cares about your grades or how smart you are once you leave school.
