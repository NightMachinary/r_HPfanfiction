So glad this has been returned! One of the better Harry/Daphne stories that slowly builds up and is a twist on the marriage contract bullshit. It is a bit wordy at times and drags on, but overall is a well written story.


** This story is way too long for how much content there actually is. It would actually be better if it was 1/4 as long, since there's just so much filler.

*** I feel this is pretty subjective a point since I personally really enjoyed how long it took for anything to develop concretely, but I feel that is mostly due to how rushed fanfics in general are.

*** I love the note at the bottom about not wanting to pad the story out.

** You've made my day. It's one of the best Hapne stories I even wrote a fic rec here after I finished it. I'm glad that you posted this because if not it would have taken a very long time before I bothered to check for updates.

Thank you
