I need to lose myself in this story and think about it every moment of my life until I finish reading it. I need to get my mind off some stuff. Any genre works, just needs to be good.


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Takes a little while to really get going, but extremely long and very immersive. An AU where Voldemort won the first war and built a sort of wizard society that tends to work surprisingly well (even if is somewhat morally questionnable at times). Voldemort is definitely still psychopathic, but is also strangely charming, interesting, knowledgeable and sane.

Unlike the summary implies, someone does not die or gets maimed every chapter. The violence is mild most of the time and it is actually often fairly lighthearted with lots of humour, great dialogue, good characters and wordbuilding. Harry is good (although still sassy and bit rebellious at times) and has a sort of mentor reluctant student thing going on with Voldemort.

******* It's not too terrible if you stop of end or book 6, although the cliff hanger where it stops in the beginning of book 7 is pretty bad. The fic itself is super long and is kind of like a super long epic/adventure so there are tons of intersecting plot lines, storylines and a lot of things going on. In the end, a lot of main and side storylines do get resolved, although a few major and some side ones don't. I thought it was worth it even if it's incomplete, too bad though since it's such a good fic.

** If you don't mind slash, try out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave's]] Harry Potter epic called "Sacrifice" starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]. The series is 7 parts long. The first one is only 81k+, but the parts get longer and longer that one of the parts is turned up to be 700k+ words. I love that it's god damn freaking *DARK*. I just lost my mind reading it. And if you don't like slash, just skip the parts. It was easy enough for me (I'm never really one for slash either).
