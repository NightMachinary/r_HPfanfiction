There is a younger student named Alex whose parents are killed in an attack. Harry and his little group sort of adopt him and treat him as a little brother until he is injured and can no longer speak.

In an attempt to speak again, he under goes a risky magical surgery which ends up killing him.

It wasn't the main plot of the story, in fact I want to say it was one of those, "Harry goes dark/grey/does things his own way and starts to gather like minded people who want to shape the new world in their image" sort of fic. But I could be wrong about that


** This is a time travel fic, Harry goes back in time to the marauders. It's also a slash pairing, Harry/Sirius. I can't remember the name of it, but I read it a couple times. I was looking for it awhile back, and someone on this subreddit told me the name of it. Feel free to look through my stuff, it's there somewhere.

*** That definitely sounds like that's the one!

I took a look through but couldn't find anything :/
