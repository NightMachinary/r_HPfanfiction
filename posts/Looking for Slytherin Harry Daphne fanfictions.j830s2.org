** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497/chapters/45627454][to refuse the givens]] - “Daphne Greengrass makes a tidy sum selling contraband at Hogwarts, and a nihilistic Harry Potter wants to buy cigarettes.” The best Haphne fic on the market in my opinion.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13698498/1/Cat-got-your-tongue][Cat got your tongue?]] - “Harry successfully manages his animagus transformation. And that's about all he's able to manage. Daphne's insistent attention seems entirely unmanageable for him and his poor heart.” This one's a oneshot, but it's fantastically hilarious.

** “Three Black Birds” on fanfiction.net is great! It's unfinished and is a “Harry is the bwl but his yonger sibling is incorrectly deemed the boy who lived” fic, and James and Lilly live and neglect Harry( not horrifically, it actually adds a lot of character development and plot line). Harry and Daphne are friends and grow close through the course of the fic. It's really great, I highly recommend it.
