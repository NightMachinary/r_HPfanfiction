** We know which did partake, the most notable being the Malfoys, Crabbes, Goyles, Mulcibers, Carrows, Rosiers, Lestrange, Notts, and presumably the Parkinsons given Pansy's actions during the last book. The rest of the "Slytherin families" (there's always the possibility a whole family isn't all Slytherin, but a blend of houses, such as the Tonks, where Nymphadora is a Hufflepuff and her mother a Slytherin, her husband a Gryffindor, and her son a Hufflepuff like herself) are pretty much up for interpretation and debate.

** The vast majority of them fought -- against Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries

  [...]

  And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of Hogsmeade.

To be read in conjunction with:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: A part of the final battle that made me smile was Slughorn galloping back with Slytherins, (SU: Yes!) (JN: laughs) but they'd gone off to get reinforcements first, you know what I'm saying? But yes, they came back, they came back to fight, so I mean- but I'm sure that many people would say “Well, that's common sense, isn't it? Isn't that smart, to get out, get more people and come back with them?”

***** Most we get to know are actually Death Eaters, since with the exception of Pettigrew, all canon Death Eaters are from Slytherin and/or are sympathetic towards Voldemort's cause.

From the top of my head:

- Snape

- Malfoy

- Slytherin (through Voldemort himself)

- Lestrange

- Black

- Nott

- Avery

- Carrow

- Rookwood

- Parkinson (at least Pansy is a supporter)

- Crouch

****** Slytherin might have been the viction of a historical narrative. Is it confirmed that Rookwood and Crouch were Slytherins ?

i think the zabini and greengrass family might be neutral

******* Rowling confirmed that at some point. She might not have intended for Slytherin to be the house of evil, but that's what she has written. Literally the only decent Slytherin is Andromeda Tonks, who certainly isn't the typical Slytherin.
