:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry goes to get a haircut and finds out that the Potters are not his family. His real family is alive and searching for him. I started this story and didn't get to finish it. I need to find the name of the story.


** How does he find out his parents are not potters from a haircut?

*** I remember the women who cut his hair tested it and it turns out they were related in someway. I read this story a while ago.
