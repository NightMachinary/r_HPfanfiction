****** Yeah, the SI will believe that Dumbledore and Voldy actually panned the whole Light vs. Dark stuff only to boost their reputation, etc., manipulate people by acting as the leaders of both sides - but in secret, they are actually allies.

The SI's paranoia will now soar through the roof and he goes to free Grindelwald, thinking that he was actually a good guy since Dumbledore is obviously the bod one.

Dumbledore sees the freeing of Grindelwald as an omen for another World War.

Voldemort sees that as an even bigger threat to his position since his evil twin seemingly wants to make Grindelwald a follower.

Grindelwald will misinterpret the situation and makes the SI his protege, teaching him arcane secrets.

Dumbledore and Voldemort are horrified and ignore each other to stop the SI.

The SI is now 100% confident that Dumbledore and Voldemort are a team.

Grindelwald is confused, but the paranoia of the SI starts affecting him, and he thinks Dumbledore finally realized that to change the world, you need to force change.

Grindelwald goes to meet Dumbledore, thinking that he can make an alliance with his former lover - since he thinks that Dumbles is a Dark Lord and that he is finally willing to support his version of the Greater Good.

Dumbledore is conflicted, but after hearing the words of his former lover, he kills Grindelwald because he thinks that the SI corrupted him beyond salvation.

The SI is now absolutely sure that Dumbledore is a Dark Lord and starts making contact with the former allies of Grindelwald, telling them how Dumbledore fooled them all.\\
He gathers people and forms his own group, etc. Becoming a powerhouse.

The same goes for, Dumbledore and Voldy, they are now sure beyond doubt that the SI must be some evil clone of Voldemort, more malicious, corrupting, and manipulative beyond humanly possible.

Eventually, Dumbledore thinks that the SI turned into a demon.

Voldemort gets told that by Snape, and is terrified out of his mind after he realized that demons devour souls. He goes to check on his Horcruxes...\\
...but they are already taken care of by the SI.\\
Only Nagini is left.

Fearing for his life, Voldemort goes to meed the SI. He makes an oath that essentially renders him to a servant/follower under the condition that the SI doesn't devour his remaining Horcrux, and lets him live.\\
Voldemort thinks that he simply can't win against a better, more evil version of himself, and decided that he might as well become an ally of... himself.

When Dumbledores hears of this - that Voldy allied himself with the SI, who he thinks is a Super!Voldy - he suffers from a stroke and dies.

The SI exhales a breath of relief and uses his newly found power to better the magical world.

** When I tried writing an SI!Harry fic I had him hospitalised during the welcoming feast because it looks like he's got a neurological problem. He would stumble and slur words because he doesn't hear himself properly (you need to hear yourself while speaking, which is why you can't speak fluently if there's a delayed echo [glares at Zoom], and he can't hear *himself*, he can instead hear a squeaky child), he stumbles and trips and can't pick things up reliably because all the distances are wrong, and he completely misjudges his strength.

It was really good fun writing all the pratfalls. Unfortunately there was no real story there.

*** Well.... they'd try to fix it with magic, wouldn't they? Perhaps potions?

So then after a year, probably your SI has adjusted and is able to start again, only in Ginny's year. And she /really/ likes that diary, and has the Bat Bogey Hex and reflexes that aren't only a year old.

If you go Omniscient, each major adult figure in Harry's life has thoughts and conversations about Harry turning up as an adorable little drunkard. They might have Plans to Help.

Draco is going to be even more of a pill.

New gang!

Harry's now in Luna's year too and your SI might care about that? Especially as it's canon that Ginny's year (presumably second year and up), Gryffindor share Herbology with Ravenclaw rather than Hufflepuff (I have no idea about who they share with in Potions, it's never mentioned.)

*** I don't remember the name of it. But there was a self insert or as the Japanese like to call it isekai of this type already written. Well except for the Voldemort/ Dumbledore POV part. The character's name was Alex Fortescue son of the ice cream man.

From what I remember it ran parallel to Cannon. And while the main character interacted with Harry & Company he was very much separate and did his own thing. Mostly learning all sorts of crazy Magic well above his level. And also trying to deal with some of the cannon problems.

I don't believe it had an ending. But I do recall it being a rather enjoyable read none the less.

***** Yes that's the one.

Western versions of Isekai tend to have the character die of natural causes or just randomly reincarnate in a favorite story. They also come in the form of taking the place of a main or side character.

Most Japanese isekai usually involve a violent death via truck before being reincarnated. I'd say less than 10% go the natural causes or Gods mistake route.

Most of the isekai that I've read that involve novels or visual novels which is to say video games. Actually tend to involve women as the main protagonist. The woman usually is inserted into a favorite otome game where the main objective is to secure marriage with a prince or something.

That isn't to say that most SI stories are the same as isekai. It's been my experience that the two genres are very similar. The ones that are very similar usually are described as self-insertion fanfiction. Character from our world dies and is reincarnated or randomly wakes up in the World of Harry Potter. Realizing where they are they go off to either have fun with magic or try and save people's lives with the knowledge that they have.

But there's also the self insertion via original character. I think those get called Mary Sue Style fanfics. Mostly because the character doesn't have any memory of having read Harry Potter. It's just an excuse to go mucking about with magic and interfere with the plot. But the main events of Cannon generally don't change no matter what they do. Also the main character tends to be overpowered. So they become less of a character in that world that they want to explore and more of a self-indulgent Power Trip.

All styles of a story, if done Well enough, can be entertaining.

That's provided that said dark objects somehow magically radiate that fact, of which I'm fairly certain there's no concrete proof either for or against. While yes, there is such a thing as a Dark Detector in canon, given the nature of magic in the books, I would not be surprised in the slightest if what it actually did was just detect the presence of shadows, because they're literally the embodiment of "darkness".

***** Perhaps, but don't forget that sometimes evil might take active steps to avoid detection, and was Dumbledore directly handling, or even directly observing, the Diary while it was an active Horcrux (in contrast to the ex-Horcrux Harry presents at the end of the book)? I think not. Also canon never depicted any spell capable of detecting the presence of a Horcrux.

For a trope example from a different fandom, all that Jedi talk about the Dark Side clouding their senses or whatever comes to mind.

In a different direction, I've been toying with the idea of a self-insert where I land in Gabrielle Delacour as she hits the surface of the Black Lake, and I somehow instinctively know I've got a time limit before I'm out and Gabrielle will remember nothing so I have to go shock and awe with the secrets to get everyone to listen to me ("We need to talk! I know about Sirius, and Riddle! When we get to shore, collect Hermione and Snuffles, I'll get Dumbledore!" "Dumbledore, they are not Ariana. Tom Riddle is not Grindelwald. Harry never even had a childhood, just Legilimens his memories of the Dursleys and you'll see that they never loved him. Get your head out of your ass and trust Harry and friends already!") and just trust that the Dumbledore I've landed with isn't evil. Dunno if I'll actually write it or not tho...
