This year, a true Christmas miracle has occurred.

I managed to avoid procrastinating endlessly on my Christmas posting plans, and I've actually gone through with them (well, most of them, anyway).

I don't usually do self-promotion, but with so many people likely to be a little lonely this Christmas, I wanted to invite you into a few of my worlds to maybe abide a while with me.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

#+begin_quote
  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  When a high profile robbery is foiled by Superman, and it is revealed that a witch may be involved in the attack, Harry must get to the bottom of it lest the secrecy of his world be put in danger. Sequel to Kicking Gotham, which can be found on my author's page.

It's not much, but I hope it helps, even if just a little.

Merry Christmas to everyone!


** I'm a huge dan of your DC crossovers, as they are pretty much the only well written ones I've encountered. That Harry is one of the best I've seen characterized. And Padma is the GOAT.

Shadow of Angmar looses me from time to time but I love it nevertheless.

Thank you for this present and pleasant days to you aswell!

*** Thanks! I'm really glad you enjoyed the HP/DC stories. I really enjoyed writing them. I do agree that Shadow of Angmar can be a bit of a slog to get through at times (for reader and writer both) but in happy to hear that you enjoyed it regardless!

** Yess, I read all of your new chapters before heading to sleep!

If I could ask for a piece of advice? Even for your less "serious" series, like Elves Most Fabulous, how do you keep writing such long chapters? Or is it like a frame of mind? Typically whenever I try to write chapters it feels like I'm slogging through the process right around the 1500 word count. I'd /like/ to write more and get more of the plot into each chapter, but maybe that's the problem and I should slow down and describe more?

I'm currently working on a purely Harry Potter fic and a Bleach/Naruto crossover fic, if that gives you any insight.

Shadow of Angmar is my absolute favorite Harry Potter fic, hands down! Thank you for all of your insane story build, Tolkien was really a madman with his "background" characters.

*** That's a tough one. Personally, I find it relatively easy to write a 4k word chapter, but it takes me as long to write the last 1000 words as it did the first 4k. For Shadow of Angmar this is problematic, as I have a minium length there of 5k per chapter. I've tried lots of different methods of getting those chapters written.

1. Just force my way through it. Still, a frequent strategy, but it's dangerous as it tends to sap my will to keep going. In a pinch, if a scene is really fighting you, wrap it up, and start a new one.
2. Pre-plan and outline it and keep 'filling it out' until I reach the word count. This can work well, if you like non-chronological writing. I don't really, and it can also result in forcing scenes to be longer than they need to be.
3. Don't write in chapters at all. In my HP/DC stories, which were all pre-written before posting, I simply wrote it as one huge thing, not worrying about the chapters so much until I was done writing. This works well for me, but you really need an enthusiasm for the story to be able to keep at it for 100k words without feedback.

Really, I'm not sure there's an answer out there that applies to everyone. All I can recommend is experimenting with different approaches and seeing which seems to work best.

Hope that helps! Thank you so much for reading my stories!

**** Thank you so much for the response!

I'm not sure I could do the 3rd method, since my stories aren't fully fleshed out yet, but the 1st method is what I'm currently doing. It would really help to outline what I want to do more, since I'm mostly going chapter by chapter, so it looks like the 2nd method is the way to go, especially since my Harry Potter fic will be non chronological to start at least :D

Thanks for writing great stories!

*** For a silly little story started only because I wanted to poke fun at the dominant HP/LotR trope at the time, it is far more popular than I ever would have imagined. I'm glad you enjoy it when new chapters do appear.

** I'm a huge lord of the rings fan, have been for most of my life, and your writing in Shadow of Angmar always manages to replicate the feeling of Tolkien's. As usual it's wonderful to read, and I continue to love how you throw in the little specific details (like the rohirric name for Lothlorien) in ways that manage to flesh out Middle Earth in the same fashion that Tolkien did. I always look forward to your updates, and your story manages to fit perfectly into a middle earth while remaining original and fresh. Keep up the good work, and have a happy holiday!

*** Thank you! I'm so glad you enjoyed it. When I read my own writing back, I only tend to see the issues, so it's really great to know that people familiar with Tolkien, and who share my love for his stories appreciate my effort to keep things consistent with his world. Merry Christmas!

**** If you don't mind a question, why did you decide on the time you did? The mini-monologue of Harry imagining the glories of the First Age made me wonder if you had considered him landing in Arda back then? I personally think that the Third Age is optimal for a xover bc the Silmarillion is much less popular, but I'm curious as to how you see your Harry changing the events of the First Age.

***** Honestly, I've come up with fics set in many different time frames of Tolkien's Legendarium. I ended up going for the one I did because it allowed me to spend time with characters most would recognise (later in the story, anyway) or at least have a frame of reference with regards to them without constraining me strongly to the events of the Lord of the Rings (or any other already written story). Reusing historical events that are only mentioned in passing gives me much more latitude than I'd have in the First Age, for example.

I do have an idea for a story set at the end of the Second Age, around the fall of Numenor (with Harry striking up a friendship with Ar Pharazon before he usurped and married Tar Miriel) that would have a much more... Game of Thronesy kind of feel. And I've been playing with it for years. If LotR on Prime is disappointing, it might well get turned into a story.

I guess I just like the freedom of a time period in which we know the shape of events without really knowing exactly what happened. It makes the urge to follow the stations of canon much less likely to result in a boring, derivative plot.

#+begin_quote
  Autumn arrives, and with it, it brings news that could change Fleur Delacour's life. The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts, and it could be her lifeline; her escape from the stifling expectations of French magical society. She need only recognise, and grasp, the opportunities it brings. One-shot, Harry/Fleur, 'Pre-Romance'.
