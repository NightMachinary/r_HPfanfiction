#+TITLE: Hermione’s mother Helen Wasn’t always a Granger .Her maiden name happened to be Winchester. That’s enough to explain why Hermione’s parents never freaked out and pulled her out of school. They expected Apocalyptic levels of crazy to follow their kid around. It’s a family tradition after all.

The only thing about the Winchester Side of the family that mildly disturb the Grangers, Was that Both Helen's husband and older brother had the first name John.

Helen had had to Threaten to shoot Bobby If he didn't stop laughing When she brought her boyfriend John Granger to meet her family for the first time.

Hermione's first bout of accidental magic had made family gathering Awkward for a couple of years, Everyone knew the three-year-old hadn't made a blood sacrifice , So the family of hunters was rather lost and confused. Until they found out about hoodoo.

The reassurance that Hermione wasn't a demon or an evil witch still didn't stop her mother from using Consecrated holy water When she gave her bubble bath until she was 4

The Christmas just After Dean turned seven Still lived on in family legend , As Hermione and Sam both wanted the last croissant The two children had a Telekinetic Tug-of-war For it In the air Over the kitchen table. They ended up ripping The croissant and a half with their powers Each piece ricocheting off the wall and hitting Dean in the head.

Needless to say, Both Johns needed therapy after that.


** This is delightful, and I'd happily read 100,000 words of this.

** So, I never watched Supernatural after a certain point, but I think the Hunter part actually came from the boys mom, not dad.

*** Correct statement hunters line comes from mom's side of family. Their father only started 'hunting' after she was killed by the demon with yellow eyes, as a way to find/kill the one responsible.

**** But to be fair John's dad was a Men of Letters aka the hunters that considered themselves as superior to the hunters so really it comes from both sides of the family

*** John's dad was Men of Letters and Mary's parents were hunters. Sam and Dean are basically Hunter royalty even though John never knew his dad to be Men of Letters and that is only discovered once he is dead and the boys find the MoL bunker.
