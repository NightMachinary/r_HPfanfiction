Like alot of these Harry/Tom squick stories people like to write or read don't take into account that Tom was a fucking Sociopath who literally could not understand love.

I don't understand why anyone can ship Tom with anyone even before he became Voldemort because he always had these tendencies even when he was a child, this is a kid who hung rabbits and tortured his fellow kids even the ones who weren't picking on him.


** Keep in mind the only way we know Tom Riddle was a psychopath/sociopath before the horcruxes in canon is the memory that Dumbledore showed Harry. If we take that memory completely without context, it would look like Tom was a cruel boy who tormented his fellow orphans for no other reason than that it pleased him to do so. This is the interpretation that JKR intended, I guess.

However, fanfic authors often like to consider events in the books in relation to what would happen in our own reality. In real life there have been numerous cases of institutionalized abuse at orphanages in the UK during the period of Tom Riddle's childhood. Studies have shown that children who experience abuse/neglect at a young age are much more likely to develop psychological problems, such as attachment disorder or sociopathy.

Thus, Tom's behavior might not be a sign that he was incapable of love at a young age, but rather he was acting out due to poor coping mechanisms learned in response to abuse by his peers/caregivers. With the right guidance and help, children who grow up like Tom /do/ learn healthier ways to interact with their peers. They frequently do overcome their early violent tendencies and can be just as well adjusted as any average adult.

tl;dr There are plenty of ways a fanfic author could explain Tom's childhood behavior that still leave room for him to learn to be a better person. The 'he was just born evil' interpretation doesn't hold any water if we think of him in terms of real life people.

*** I never said he was born evil...

I do think most fanfic writers have Harry go back in time and become friends with 10 year old Tom so everything becomes sunshine and rainbows is stupid though...

The best story i read with Harry trying to help Tom was him going back in time preventing Toms mother from dying and basically becoming toms dad.

He still has to deal with ingrained mental issues but Harry helps him deal with them

**** Sorry, I didn't mean to imply those were your words. I meant it as an example of how people sometimes take the "could not understand love" interpretation to the extreme.

I agree that most of the 'Harry befriends young Tom Riddle fics' are not well written, and thus aren't very plausible. However, I've read some that give Tom an arc of realistic gradual character development and handled the idea very well.

He'd probably never end up as a 'nice' person due to his narcissism and an instinct to lash out at opposition, but he doesn't have to be a sadistic megalomaniac like in canon either. In real life many people diagnosed with psychopathy live healthy productive lives without being a danger to the people around them.

Start out as a suave and charming chameleon skilled at manipulation, but who's also a giant narcissistic who has clear visions on what is wrong in the world based on personal prejudice. In the middle forms a God complex to rival the worst of them, amassing followers and worshippers by shoving all problems onto a scapegoat, and keeping a girl whose obsessed with him and who would do anything for him even though he doesn't care by his side as a tool. Kills a Jesus archetype (ish) character hero (ish) that eventually leads to his downfall. Ends as a grotesque sick being, brought lower than anyone else and all his weakness revealed for everyone to see his nemisis, only to die a pitiful human death from an unexpected/underestimated means.

And it's implied in the early part of death note, iirc, that part of lights hatred for criminals comes from the toll its taken on his family life, such as keeping his dad away from home. Plus the other implication that his parents have exceedingly high expectations for him, and don't show enough actual TCL.

****** I agree with your idea of Tom probably never having a romantic partner. A fic with Harry as his [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners][platonic life-partner]] would be hilarious and great.

But then again, fanfic is often about putting characters in extreme situations where the implausible becomes more plausible. For example, many Harry/Tom fics have them grow closer to eachother emotionally because the horcrux connection lets Tom tap into the empathy that he normally lacks.

In other cases Tom doesn't have romantic feelings but he might commit to a relationship because he wants to cement his ties to someone he sees as a worthy foil. In my opinion, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] is an excellent example of that. In that fic a sociopathic Tom Riddle turns out rational and less violent due to Hermione's influence starting at a young age.

Voldemort is an attention whore, and in an AU where he didn't go full terrorist leader, I can imagine him wanting a partner to provide the same level of constant attention and validation. But I can't imagine him dumping this person "just because". In the books, Voldemort only ever tortured and belittled his Death Eaters when they failed him, like when none of them looked for him in the 10 years he lost his body, when Lucius lost the prophecy orb, or when they let Harry escape for the umpteenth time.

It updates sporadically but reads episodically so you're not left with any especially torturous cliffhangers whenever the author posts another chapter and it's quite, quite good.

People who have been diagnosed with psychopathy (i.e. Antisocial Personality Disorder) in some cases reason differently than other people because their brains are different. They are predisposed to some actions that normal people aren't. Historically, many infamous criminals have been psychopaths, but not all psychopaths are criminally inclined.

Also, keep in mind that children do not get diagnosed with ASPD. Instead they get a diagnosis of "conduct disorder", because their minds are still plastic and they can be guided away from forming the harmful personality traits of full blown ASPD. Compared to the general population, children with conduct disorder are more likely to grow up to have other personality disorders, but it's not a guarantee. Here's a research article summarizing the statistical trends if you're interested: [[https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/adhd/exploring-link-between-conduct-disorder-adolescence-and-personality-disorders-adulthood]]

This suggests that you think people with APD are somehow automatically evil, which is obviously not the case - there are non-evil people with APD as well as evil people without APD. It is, as you now said, possibly a good predictor, but that is not the same.

Additionally, while I cannot claim to fully understand even the abstract of the study you linked, I am highly skeptical about the 67% you pulled from it. The only place I could find that number in the abstract was as the "heritability of the convergent latent factor" (whatever that is) of BPD. I suspect that you meant 69% which is the respective number for APD. But while I do not know much about APD I am fairly certain that 67% is a way too high number for BPD heritability.

  The gradual descent into madness, accelerated by horcrux creation
#+end_quote

The idea of horcruxes turning someone insane is pure fanon, from authors who tried to come up with a reasonable explanation as to why Voldemort was so irrational at the end of DH, when we've been repeatedly told that Tom Riddle was the most brilliant Hogwarts student in the past century.

.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, "So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?"

  "Yes, I think so," said Dumbledore. "Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that *while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical power remain intact."*
#+end_quote

If Voldemort was "mad", then it was because of his upbringing and genetics ("the Gaunts, a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability"), not because he messed with soul magic. He always had mental issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean he /had/ to be a lunatic or terrorist. Using the creation of horcruxes to justify his mental instability, a trope that happens a lot in fics about "redeeming" Voldemort, feels cheap because it's a roundabout way of deferring responsibility for his evilness. And it goes against the "It's your choices that matter" theme that is a big part of the books' message.

The weird behavior had nothing to do with his horcruxes, insanity, or deteriorating mental state. It was always a facet of his narcissistic personality, and I find it off-putting for fanfic to try explain that Tom Riddle was a nice guy all along, just made some bad choices that turned him into a big mean bully.

It really doesn't make sense for Tom, cunning, practical, fundamentally knife-in-throat-body-in-dumpster Tom would be willing to partake in large-scale theatrics and one-v-one duels. If Tom was still the Tom we have vague impressions of from his time at Hogwarts, he should've put an AK into Harry's head the moment he got out of that awful cauldron for the sake of brevity.

That doesn't make for a great story, admittedly, but just because you don't go with it doesn't mean it has to be a plothole, though this sentiment hasn't stopped JK Rowling /before/, so...

Alot of writers like to pretend that sending Harry back in time and having him make friends with Tom instantly fixes the kid when Tom had issues that would take YEARS of mental help to fix.

** The media has sociopaths (and psychopaths) wrong in almost every regard. Honestly, it is almost as bad as the current generation speaking about autism.

However, I do not want to categorise and label things, knowing that every person is different and handles the condition differently. No two humans are the same and no two people who are diagnosed sociopaths are the same.

On a base standard, a sociopath /can/ understand love and has the ability to fall in love. Also, love as itself is not just limited to human interaction. Someone can love, for example, themselves or an object. Also, someone who is a sociopath may love someone unconditionally. A deathly tight grip on the person and they will refuse to let them go. It can be a blind love and insulting the person they love will invoke their wrath.

I heard stories at school about this boy who was so in love with a girl that one who badmouthed her ended up injured somehow. It sounded so cliché and ridiculous at the time, but this guy would intentionally find a way to hurt the person for badmouthing his true love. They are married now and have children and he is arguably one of the best lawyers in town.

- Narcissistic
- Quick to anger
- Disregard for the rules/law
- Anti-social behaviour
- Manipulative
- Lacking empathy and the struggles of those less fortunate
- Impulsive
- Charismatic
- Pathological liar

Now, there are sociopaths out there that cannot understand what love is and what it does. There are sociopaths out there that lack any empathy at all. There are ‘normal' people out there that cannot understand love. There are ‘normal' people out there that lack empathy.

Also, you are not born a sociopath. As someone else said, it was the conditions that Tom Riddle was raised in that mostly caused it. I am sure that he was quite a rotten boy, but put him somewhere that he was loved and safe and that would eliminate most of his... questionable traits.

The scientific literature doesn't really have a defined meaning for the word "sociopath". Unlike "psychopath", it's a wishy-washy term that means different things to different psychologists. Some authors just use the word in place of "psychopath" to avoid the general public's missinterpretation of the word "psycho". From what I've read, there doesn't seem to be any scientific research showing that 'sociopaths' are functionally different from 'psychopaths'.

Studies have shown that subjects are more likely to have psychopathic personality traits and related maladaptions if they have certain genes. The brains of diagnosed psychopaths actually function differently from 'normal' people in measurable ways. However, their environment growing up does significantly affect whether they express those traits in harmful ways. Psychopaths who grew up with abuse or neglect, or without responsible role models, are more likely to show violent tendencies and engage in criminal behavior.

tl;dr Psychopathy is primarily caused by genetics, but childhood environment does affect the way the disease is expressed.

** I've always viewed his creation of his first Horcrux as his path of no return, the point where he truly becomes irrdedeemable (because the Horcrux creation permanently destroys any chance he has at feeling empathy, etc). Before that point, while he is certainly not a very moral-driven character (he was willing to kill an innocent girl!), I don't see him as irredeemable, just like I don't see Lucius as irredeemable despite all the things he has done in Voldemort's service (but not redeemed -- big difference).

That being said, I've read the occasional Tomione fic (I don't read slash). A lot of them has him fall over and declare his undying love or her within 20 chapters giving up his previous ambitions, which is incredibly unrealistic.

** Ok so while I don't ship him with anyone sympathetic Tom Riddle isnt hard to do if you look at him as a kid. Weird creepy kid who gets picked on for being weird and creepy. So he lashes out like most kids do except he has magic. Lets be honest here alot of kids have sociopathic tendencies.

Kids can be mean and harsh and cruel. They dont know better. They can be sweet and kind too but that doesn't discount the asshole tendencies. There is a reason creepy horror kids are a thing. Its because kids are at times really creepy. Its just not a big deal because they grow up and are pretty harmless as kids. But Tom Riddle like other creepy horror kids is op so this ends up being a problem especially in combination with his bitterness and lack of human companionship. Growing up in a orphanage full of people he hated during WW2 in London while it was being firebombed.... well his preoccupation with not dying isnt completely unfounded either.

Now im not saying he never had a say in the matter and anyone in his situation would turn out like him and in any other circumstances hed be a great guy. But the curcumstances definetly played a part and in different circumstances perhaps things could be avoided. And in fiction that makes for fun what if situations.

** Just because the abusive boyfriend is someone no one should stay in a relationship with doesn't mean that's what happens. Tom was also described to be very charming in order to get what he wanted and I don't see why this couldn't create a steaming (from one side) romance with just about anyone. That's sort of how I would imagine a cannon Voldemort to have a relationship, something abusive with really high high highs and really low's kept carefully in check so that person completely fell for him, this would continue as long as he had use for this person.

​

I think that this fic really goes with this idea [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681/chapters/29871909]] (is not particularly safe from questionable content). But I can absolutely imaging Tom being the highly manipulative, charming and sociopathic fuckboy type that he is in this fic.

1. Tom is literally old enough to be his grandfather.
2. It's gay.
3. Tom MURDERED his parents. There's no excuse that makes that forgivable enough for a romantic relationship. I mean, even if he was imperiod by Dumbeldore to be the dark lord to his light, he still killed your parents. You don't just get over that.

1. Some people enjoy those older than them. Also, it is canon that witches and wizards survive longer, therefore the age gap would most likely be a bit more lenient.

2. And? If people want their characters to be gay, that is their concern. Do not read it if you find two males in a relationship repulsive.

3. I agree, but Tom Riddle is shown to a charismatic man in his youth. If he were able to wave away everything it could still be fine. Assuming he groomed Harry or whatever. There was no witnesses to the event that happened except for the word of Dumbledore. It would be easy for Tom to simply state that something else happened and he was defeated by something else entirely.
