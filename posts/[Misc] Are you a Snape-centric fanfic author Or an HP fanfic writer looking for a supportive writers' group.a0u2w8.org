If you are an HP Fanfic author - especially a Severus Snape-centric writer or beta, [[/u/the-phony-pony][u/the-phony-pony]] and I extend an invitation to our Discord server.

In addition to the general writing resources and chat areas, we offer a set of private Snape specific channels ("Snapechat") for you to chat and develop your stories without the usual controversy and arguments that pop up regarding our dear Potions Master. We are a supportive and active group!

We primarily serve /writers/ of Harry Potter fanfic, rather than the readers, and have many different resources at our disposal. This server is open to any HP writers; access to the Snape channels is granted on request.

If you are interested in joining, please comment below and either myself or [[/u/the-phony-pony][u/the-phony-pony]] will PM you the invite code.

** I'm trying to get back into writing fic, but I am definitely into beta-ing. And I am 100% ride-or-die when it comes to Snape. (I know how that sounds, but I'm not going to change it.)

  What if adults acted like adults? If they take responsibility, don't get distracted by revenge, build capable governments, and don't try to hold three full time vitally important jobs at the same time: result? Shit gets done. Sirius raises Harry; Dumbledore is awesome; the Blacks are possibly awesomer; the Ministry is functional, and Lupin gets a very interesting job.

  Memories maketh the man. But his memories reveal more to her than she could have imagined - his childhood, his life as a spy, his sacrifices, but most intriguingly, his mother - and her shocking true identity. This is a story about the choices we make, and how they make us. This is a story about how love can find us, if we let it. Canon compliant, rewritten October 2018. SS/HG
