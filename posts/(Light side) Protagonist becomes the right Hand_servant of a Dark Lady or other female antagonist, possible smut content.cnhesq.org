I wouldnt restrict the Protagonist role to Harry, so any other is fine too. He might infiltrate the Enemies group and maybe even working as a double agent. Possible mind control or not...maybe he even pretends to be mind controled.

In any Case, the Female Enemy would might be attracted to the Protagonist and consider him her Lover.


** Do you mean Right hand, as in Main sidekick or trusted person, or Right hand, like the main hand many people use for certain acts. 'Cause the "Possible smut" kinda leaves that in the open.

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

The only ones wasting time are the ones respoding. If you feel offended for this post even existing, why are YOU wasting your time, if time is so so damn precious for you, that you feel the need to speak for everyone, as if you could, or should. Its people like you who exemplify the best reasons for downvoting to exist. Even if its a shitty mechanic.

Disgusting judgemental prick.
