I've already read The Mind Arts! :)

Anything is fine as long as it's well-written and isn't far-fetched

Thanks in advance


** linkffn(Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath) The mind magic involved isn't very varied but it's well written. Inspired by Warhammer.

** Callidus Prince Series by ContraryToEverything is definitely something you might also like to look at. The author's writing style is brilliant and original. She does not simple rehash the books, but makes it unique while keeping the tone of JK Rowling's HP World. However, it's more of a de-aged story rather than a time travel story. Since the principles are similar though, I'll recommend it anyways. So far the author is on year 3. Year 2 was when the mind magic become more prominent. Also, more detailed as well.

The basic run down of the story is Severus Snape somehow got de-aged to 11 years old with only memories at that age. So he does not remember anything pass 11. He is aware that something is not right and he is in the wrong body.

** Have you considered leaving the Harry Potter fandom? Linkffn(from grace, I fall) is really good about mind magic (the force) and you don't need to be a star wars legends guy to read it.
