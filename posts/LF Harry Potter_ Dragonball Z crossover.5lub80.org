Has anyone here ever come across a DBZ/HP cossover fic that's actually worth reading, and not a slash fic?

Basically I'm looking for a fic where Harry ends up in the DBZ universe and isn't part saiyan or some other crap.\\
If anyone knows of such a thing you'd be opening up a whole new world of fanfiction to me.


** Tbh the only real crossovers are where Krillin goes to Hogwarts, unless someone made one without marking it as a crossover.
