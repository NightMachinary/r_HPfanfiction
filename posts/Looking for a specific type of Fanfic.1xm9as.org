I prefer long, well written fics. I love it even more if there are sequels. If they have powerful!Harry, whether through training or just born with power, it's even better. My preferred ship is H/Hr, but H/G is fine too. I just need a ton of suggestions, as I've burned completely through my store of fics I had saved up. Two of my favorite fics are Harry Potter and the Fifth Element (incredible story) and then, of course, the James potter series, to give you guys some examples. Pleeeeaaaase help me out! Thanks guys!

** If you don't mind comedy with no real harry/insertgirlhere pairing check out nonjon's "Where in the world is Harry Potter?" and it's two follow up fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon]] nonjon's ffnet profile and the first story in the trilogy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]]

I've actually gone back to reread his fics a few times just because of the quality of his work.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]]. This meets all of your requirements except for the ship but it is amazingly written and has two sequels. Power is a very important underlying theme in the story. It's wonderful, cannot recommend it enough. And it's super long and well written.

** Might I recommend Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent. It's a bit long, 250kish, is decently written, although I haven't re-read it in a long time. It has 2 sequels, Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions, and Harry Potter and the Triangle Prophecy. Can't link as I'm on mobile. It's all complete with a prequel I haven't read yet. It was also the first fanfic I ever read, back when I found it on Imesh (a napster clone) masquerading as book 5, 2 weeks before OotP came out. It was the fanfic that got me started and addicted.
