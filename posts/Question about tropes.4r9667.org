I've seen a lot of discussions about specific tropes, what tropes people like or hate, etc. But as someone who is fairly new to the world of fanfiction, I don't quite understand what makes a trope a trope... Is every commonly used plot device a trope? Are common pairings considered tropes? What makes some tropes hated, and others loved? Is there a list of tropes out there? If you're writing a fic, how hard is it to avoid tropes? Or can you make a trope different enough that it's no longer considered a trope?

Sorry if this has been discussed before, but I couldn't find anything about tropes in general... Thanks!

Tropes that are more reviled are ones that tend to result in or be associated with bad storytelling. For instance, there's a collection of tropes that often co-occur, wherein Harry receives a large inheritance from a number of ancient and noble houses, he suddenly becomes studious, he gains a huge boost in magical power, he instantly gains political power, and he essentially overthrows Dumbledore with a few words, since it was clearly the case that Dumbledore was trying to keep him from inheriting. (And, quite possibly, had put blocks on Harry's magical powers.)

That combination is bad because it instantly makes Harry significantly more powerful, sets up an enemy, and then has Harry defeat that enemy without significant work. It's unsatisfying in general for a character to succeed without struggle.

That's a confluence of tropes, not a single trope on its own. However, the combination is common enough that it's largely tainted each of the elements. Plus the elements each contribute to the primary problem we have with the combination.

On the other hand, there's another trope that Daphne Greengrass is an "Ice Queen". This is a pretty neutral trope, all told; nothing in canon counters it particularly, and some people are a bit frosty in their relations with others, so it's hardly unrealistic. It doesn't make it harder to tell a good story. Some people don't like it, but it's mainly a matter of taste.

** "A trope is a storytelling device or convention, a shortcut for describing situations the storyteller can reasonably assume the audience will recognize."

example: A guy in a story being named Damien will obviously be the bad guy, even if he seems good at first.

A subversion of that trope would be to then have Damien turn out to be a good guy who's been working for the bad guys to bring it down from inside.

A reconstruction of the trope would then have Damien, having torn down his enemies from the inside, betray the good guys and take over the criminal element to rule.

Edit: some people, like myself, differentiate between trope and cliche(which can be considered synonymous) as a common story element and an overused story element, respectively. In example, Harry being an immortal due to mastering death by getting all three hallows is a cliche. It's overused. A potential trope would be that Teddy is a metamorphmagus with blue hair, to compliment his mum's pink hair.

** Yeah, there are a lot of commonly used plot devices. Like, say you want Harry to travel to a different dimension, instead of making up something new and interesting, they'll just have Harry fall through the veil in the Department of Mysteries and wake up in the new place. It's been done a million times, and will likely continue to be done.

It tends to propagate itself, and that's when the annoyance factor comes in where people start to hate them. The first time you see an idea, it may be quaint or even interesting (though it is important to note that all because an idea is original, doesn't automatically make it interesting or good). Like, Author A writes about there being a secret library in the Chamber of Secrets and Harry finds it and learns all he needs to defeat Voldemort there. It sounds like an awful idea, because it is, but Author B saw it and liked it, and wrote it into their story, with almost the same exact setup. Then Author C does the same thing as well, and before you know it, there's ten thousand indy!Harry stories all taking place after 4th or 5th year with almost interchangeable plots. Just take a quick look through the Harry/Daphne section and you'll see a thousand identical stories.

** Yes, it's essentially just clichés. I'm sure there are lists out there, but it's not to say that it's bad if you use a trope. Many can be written well. Some cannot. If you're new to fanfic I would suggest just reading what you want and enjoying it before the tropes start to annoy you :)

*** Lol I've been reading non stop for a while now, definitely seen a lot of clichés, but they haven't started to annoy me yet. Bad writing, horridly ooc characters with no explanation, bad character development, annoying. Plot clichés, not so much. :-)

***** Lol I have seen this a few times, but so far it's always been approached in a different way with a different outcome, so not annoying yet lol.

*** A trope isn't a cliche. Everything in story telling is a trope. If you make up something completely original you're making a trope. Cliche means overused and typically bad.

**** In common use they're essentially very similar though. I did clarify that tropes could be written well.
