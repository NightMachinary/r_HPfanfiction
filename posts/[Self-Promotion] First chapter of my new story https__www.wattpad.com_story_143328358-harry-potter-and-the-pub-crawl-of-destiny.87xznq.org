** Your story's good and well-written but two things I wanted to mention:

1. In the books, especially after Goblet of Fire, Hermione was NEVER afraid to use Voldemort's name. She even surprised Harry of it in Order of the Phoenix when they met for their first Dumbledore's Army meeting in the Hog's Head Inn. So for her to say "You-Know-Who" in your story even after the taboo had been set in place doesn't seem like her.

2. The Taboo myth that it was used during the First War was debunked (not officially) as during that time, Dumbledore encouraged others to use Voldemort's name so that they would not fear it. If the Taboo was truly set in place then, it's unlikely Dumbledore would've encouraged the community to say Voldemort's name as it would have endangered them in doing so.

These two points are a small snipped of what's included in your first chapter but they stuck out at me that I thought to give them a mention.
