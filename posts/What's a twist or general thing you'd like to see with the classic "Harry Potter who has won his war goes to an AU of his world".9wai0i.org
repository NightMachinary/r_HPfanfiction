** interacts with his counterpart. Usually, it's a world where harry died and his parents survived. So it's about childless Lily and James bonding with orphaned harry. I wanna see Harry bond and mentor AU Harry.

I wonder how awkward it'd be for Lily and James. Basically a son they never lost or missed.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Some more stuff like Wind Shear only he doesn't get dragged into the conflict but remains outside it except when it comes to him/crosses his path. Overall he doesn't seem to do anything from his perspective, but the things he does do cause ripples that make life easier for the Light Side sometimes or cause them serious headaches other times.

​

An example that comes to mind:

He is at the Quidditch World cup when DEs strike. He was enjoying the after party and rather than run scared he captures/kills them all. As a result several people wind up in prison that wouldn't have. The hiccup reduces their influence in the Ministry/elsewhere with casacading effects from there.

​

or

​

Snatchers try to grab him and he leaves their organs across threehundred different trees. Snatchers never catch Ted or Dean or the trio because so many are dead/busy trying to find this guy that keeps killing them.

** From the POV of the new world, and the new Harry is not a nice person. I don't mean Death Eater, or outright evil, but perhaps like Dark Marauders from BajaB's fic. Technically on the good side, but only because he opposed Voldemort. So maybe he fucked his world into a dystopia and he'll want to fix past mistakes in the new sandbox.

And now local Harry and the gang have two big league Dark wizards on their hands.

** I'd like to see it played straight honestly. There's always some weird twist with it when the main thing I want with that sort of story is the interaction with Harry between his parents, Sirius, any possible siblings, and his AU self.

But there's always some other thing like the parents die when he gets there, or he's evil, his parents are evil, or there's marriage contract shenanigans, or Harry has some new random special power etc.

** 1) I don't want time travel involved because that's just going to make things too easy for the good guys.

2) I really want to read some meta fics, meaning Harry from one fanfic interacting with AU from another fanfic or the canon universe.

3) I don't hold canon Harry in very high regard, for obvious reasons we often discuss on this sub. Therefore, I prefer an AU Harry giving him some assistance and guidance.

4) It doesn't even have to be Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Lily, Sirius, Regulus, a good Bellatrix, a good Tom Riddle can all fill that role. In fact, a good Bellatrix or Tom would make for a more interesting story. I also want an AU Dramione teaching canon Draco some serious lessons.

5) Canon Harry going somewhere else has been done many times and I'm no longer interested.

6) I want an AU badass Lily building a kick ass mother-son team with canon Harry, kind like Sarah and John Connors. Mothers are not appreciated nearly enough by the fandom. I don't want to see this Lily fucking her own son.

7) Fighting Voldemort has also been done too many times. Magical Britain is beginning to feel too small and restrictive, some grand international conspiracies are highly welcome.

There are countless issues left that would make sure that you don't run out of plot, even if you royally bitchslap the Death Eaters. I mean, the Ministry was quite eager to carry out a genocide and that required more than a few people, so weeding out that kind of employees (and by extension the sentiment in the entire population) gives you more than enough plot.

The one thing I noticed while writing that premise (without the WBWL part) is that you have to use a lot of OCs and due to the more than a little complicated history of the world outside of the UK, Iberia, France and North America, you basically need to invent at least 300 years worth of history for the region or alternatively use the borders/nations/political systems of ~1700.

That's why I like revolutionary fics such as “The Sums” and “Marriage Law Revolution” so much. Too few realize that the Ministry was the true fucking incompetent failed state that enabled those sadistic genocidal maniacs in the first place. Unfortunately, Starfox5 seems to moderate his stance significantly in his recent works and generally write towards reforms. Even Lucius Malfoy begins to survive!

Maybe you are interested in writing more radical solutions?

Yes, it will be difficult to write. But then it can also be extremely rewarding for both readers and writers. I think what a writer can do is to develop a world gradually in many one shots and short fics. You can slowly add characters and scenes together. In fact, JKR is exactly doing that with Pottermore and FB. Of course, you can do a much better job than her when it comes to consistency and numbers.

Well, considering the spiritual HIMYM crossover I published last night has Britain occupied by foreign powers much like Postwar Germany, I think I got that covered.

As much as I advocate executing any and all Death Eaters, you'd run out of people to run your magical nation if you use the same fervour on the Ministry.

I don't think this would work unless you want to devote years to that AU, at which point you might very well write original fiction instead.

In the story I have written I took the approach of Harry and Tonks fleeing Britain and at first sticking to the one person they distantly know (Penelope Clearwater), who gets them in touch with a few others and that way more and more original characters are added without an 5 chapter long infodump.

** Harry actually killing Voldemort quickly and then having to live in this new world that isn't his own. How do you have a deep relationship if your lover can't understand that Your from another world, you tell your significant other this and you are either breaking up or you are heading to a mental hospital.

Harry shows up kills Voldemort and then ends up in a Crossover, like he wins takes some gifted Gold and Money and heads to the US, only to save a person from some Twilight Vampires, or he meets Harry Dresden or he gets caught up in Shield Bullshit and now has to deal with a added unknown effects.

He shows up kills Voldemort and then it's revealed that Dumbledore is a tea big bad here and This new Harry has to beat back the most accomplished wizard of his time and convince people that Albus doesn't have their best interest at heart as he slaughters those that stand in his way
