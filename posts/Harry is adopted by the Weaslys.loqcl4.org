I've seen lots of fics where harry is adopted by the Malfoys, but none where he is raised as a brother to Ron. I think that he would grow up to be a pretty different person if he grew up surrounded by that much love and family. Thanks for any recs!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** It's a fun story, not quite what you were looking for since it doesn't start until Hogwarts but I thought it fit the concept.
