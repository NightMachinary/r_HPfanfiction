As the title says :)

I think I read quite a lot of those on ff.net my favorite being at the moment HP & The Wastelands of Time.

But i'm always looking for new fictions !


** If you enjoy Wastelands, you might consider browsing through the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/99/1/1/][DarkLordPotter 5-starred and Featured Authors C2]]. It only includes well-written works and they tend to favor the non-traditional het pairings.

Enjoy!

**** [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net][Dark Lord Potter]] is a separate fan site that has a bit of a reputation for being brutal with its criticisms. The stories that passed muster within their review system are the ones listed in the C2.

Check out the site, but don't start posting until you get a sense of the atmosphere. 'They do not suffer fools lightly'.

*** Thanks for the suggestion ! I read it until Chapter 8 yesterday and I grow tired of it, to be honest the whole "early" part is too much and not credible if you know a bit about the topic :(

Ty anyway ! :D
