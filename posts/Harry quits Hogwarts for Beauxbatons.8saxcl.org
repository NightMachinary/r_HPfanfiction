So, it's pretty common for Harry to use the threat of quitting Hogwarts to get what he wants...but how many fics are there where he actually follows through? I'd be especially interested in ones that actually follow his school life at Beauxbatons, getting used to a new school in a different country with a different language...if such a fic exists.

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.

Not exactly quitting, but temporarily transferring for his own safety during third year. Fic is still in its early stages though. Updates every now and then.\\

  With the threat of Sirius Black looming, Dumbledore feels it best that Harry Potter does not attend Hogwarts for his third year. Fortunately, there is an alternative. Hopefully Harry enjoys France!

**** Hey pal, thanks for promoting my story! This one is in a bit of a hiatus while I try to decide where I want to go with it. I intend to write more, but it might be a bit before the next chapters come out.

*** Is Accidental Bond the one where he gets punished by Madame Maxime for fighting back against an attack on his class instead of running and hiding?
