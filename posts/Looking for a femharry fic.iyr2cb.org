#+begin_quote
  Harry gets a surprise on his seventeenth birthday when he discovers a secret Lily Potter took to her grave; a secret that will change his life forever. He must learn to interact with the wizarding world all over again, and discovers the darker sides of inequality and misogyny. Not HBP compliant. Fem!harry

** I think I've read this or something similar. Only harry was born a girl and because in the wizarding world girl babies especially first borns were usually "lost" lily and snape used some complex magic to hide harry as a boy until his 17th bday. I never finished it not can I remeber the name sorry
