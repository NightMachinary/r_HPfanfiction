:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading an old WBWL fic where Harry teamed up with Hermione and Luna in 5th year and took a stand against Dumbledore and his evil father James. I believe Harry was a Ravenclaw and there were instances where he was a better Quidditch player, but Cho still got the Seeker spot and he was the top student, but Flitwick didn't give him the Prefect-ship. By the end of the fic, he got expelled and I believe his brother died. There was also a huge emphasis on parseltongue and using serpents and basilisks in this one.

Does this ring any bells for anyone?

*** No that's not it, but cool looking story nonetheless.
