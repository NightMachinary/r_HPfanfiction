Just finished what's been written of linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) and I'm looking for any other good crossover fics between HP and LOTR. I've read a couple, though I forget the names right now, and so I can definitely say I prefer the type of crossover in shadow of angmar where harry is stuck alone in the LOTR universe rather than a whole ensemble of characters being transported from one universe to the other, but I'll take what I get. Thanks.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  The Valar chose many companions to help them create Arda... save for Námo. The Judge of the Dead chose only one companion, who eventually pled for eternal rest. Too bad Námo had different plans. Eons later, Harry Potter woke up in a field of grass. "Sodding dreaming potions..."

*** Thanks for the suggestion, I read a few chapters in, but it's like I have to struggle to keep reading it, does the constant retelling of each event from Legolas's (or anyone's) POV stop? And does harry ever just accept the /change/ or does he spend the whole fic talking about dreams and potions?

**** It has been quite a while since I read this.

From what I remember, once you get deeper into the fic, the retelling of different POV should become non-existent, but the author will still switch been POV's now and again. While Harry struggles with the change in the beginning, he will start to adapt and accept who is.

I don't want to spoil it, but I remember also struggling with the start of the story, but it really does get more interesting the further you get in. I'm waiting for the next update. Luckily the author is still updating other stories so I haven't lost hope yet.
