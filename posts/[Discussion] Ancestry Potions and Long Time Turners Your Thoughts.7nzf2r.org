We're all seen it done for the sake of thought -- ancestry potions that show one's true family, and time turners that send users years into the past. Like many aspects of HP fanfiction, I believe that they can easily go either way (good or bad). What are your thoughts on them?


** u/fflai:

  ancestry potions that show one's true family
#+end_quote

Is supportable by canon. We know that magic can be used to gain information (time-turners, revealing charms, ...) and we also know that the information is there (mundane in the DNA, for example), and I suppose that's no problem for magic to 'understand' a human concept like ancestry, especially since it is magically significant (metamorphmagi and parseltongue are inheritable, for example).

So yeah, it's probably possible to find out your ancestry using magic, and doesn't contradict canon in general.

I personally however have never seen them used in a good way, only ever to show how awesome Harry is.

Usually only used for some peggy-sue moments, but usually [[https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/][executed very badly]], even by good authors. I'd also like to argue that canon doesn't really support it, especially if you end up changing things, but ... yeah.

I do prefer other peggy-sue mechanics to time-turners. My idea how they could be good: Only allow use for information-gathering, that would be awesome.

**** So, a Pensieve that doesn't require memories?

Also, I read a fic where that was mentioned, unfortunately, there was an accident and instead the creator got stuck in a time dilation area for a couple hundred years from the outside perspective, while a few minutes passed on the inside.

** As far as long distance time travel is concerned, 90% of the time I skim the prologue chapter which explains how said character was launch many years into the past, and if it doesn't catch my interest I just skip however many chapters are necessary to get the character into the past.

I don't care, in any way, how the author decides to send their character back unless it's done extremely well. So if you want a 2 paragraph explanation of: "Oh Harry just uses a time turner and spins it a million times," more power to you. I probably wouldn't have read it anyway.

** I dislike Ancestry Potions as a /plot device/, but they fit well into the lore. I don't want to see Harry taking one, but it makes sense that they'd /exist/.

Long-time Time-Turners --- they're canon now, and I never felt they contradicted the way Time-Turners worked. But again it's all in how one uses it.

** I call bullshit on the potions, for them to work they would need to be some kind of temporal magic, hardly used for something that mundane.. No, ancestry should be done by simply having recorded the magical equivalent to DNA through out generations (like for the black's family tree). This could be done by the goblins having a registry of those who used their vaults or something, the greedy little monsters would find a use to anything I'm sure.

** Ancestry potions are extremely rarely well-done. IMO, ancestry potions can work if you have more than one sample, for example, if you have blood from two or more people, it could show how are these two are related but if you have only one sample, then it is immersion breaking for me, especially if it tells you the ancestry over 50 generations.

.

For time travel, why not but the well done one I've ever read would have been the one at the end of linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King) but even that one is more of a mess than anything, with plots within plots within plots.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

*** You could maybe have the cliche "put a drop of blood on this parchment" artifact except it can only tell you your relation to people who have taken the test using the same artifact (because it either directly stores the blood or just the information about them)

** I think ancestry potions are perfectly viable as something that could exist in the potterverse, but they're usually just used to reveal that our character is actually related to merlin, all the Hogwarts founders and just about every pureblood family out there.

In terms of long distance time-turners, it's more or less the opposite, I find them less canonically viable, but more acceptable in stories. I don't mind time travel stories so if it's there as a plot-device that's fine with me.

** Ancestry Potions: that someone takes to discover the names of everyone they are descended from makes no sense. Even if a potion could separate the individuals, how would it find out their names?

Blood tests that simply provide a yes/no response to the question “Are these two people closely related.” Makes a lot more sense.

I personally have no problem with Gringotts storing a drop of blood from each generation of a family in order to validate next-of-kin claims.

Time-turners: the only one we see allows someone to travel back in time and interact with their surroundings, but it will turn out that all actions taken will have already happened the first time through.

Also, there appears to have been a limit on the ability to travel, Hermione missed a class, and her reaction was “Oh no! I forgot!” rather than “Well, guess I'm doing today again.”

So I'd argue that you can only use a time turner to do something you already did with the outcome that already happened, and only for a few hours at most.
