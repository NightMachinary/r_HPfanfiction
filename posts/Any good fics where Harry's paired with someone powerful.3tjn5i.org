** Well most super!Harry fics are like this. Turns out Ron was holding back Hermione. Or Luna is a super genius if people would just humor her about Nargles. Or Daphne knows everything, because purebloods really are superior(except Weasleys obv.).

*** Really? Most super!harry I remember had his girl(s) be more or less arm candy since Harry was smarter, more powerful, and more special than anyone else.

**** Hey, now, it's perfectly possible for a character to be Very Powerful and yet so utterly passive that nothing she does actually affects the story; and even the most Powerful character can be subdued to facilitate a rescue plot. ;-)

** Voldemort is very powerful, and I am sure there exist some readable Harry/Voldemort fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&c2=348][here's a search to get you started]]. :-P

More seriously, there are some decent ones that 'ship Harry with a powerful!Hermione or plan to, in all evidence:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)
- linkffn(Rule of Two, Dreams Come True by Darklooshkin)
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen)
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]]) stuff tends to have a pretty powerful!Hermione. He has the advantage of actually finishing his fics, though.

Other than that, I'd recommend looking into Harry/Fleur stuff.

  Whitetigerwolfs Dark Lady challenge. Hermione watches Star Wars at age six and tries to connect with the force. Now watch how a game of pretend turns into a journey to the dark side filled with -friendship and love? Yes, Harry's responsible somehow...

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** I'd add linkffn(Always and Always). It's the only Harry/Voldemort I've even been able to contemplate reading, and it's pretty good.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
