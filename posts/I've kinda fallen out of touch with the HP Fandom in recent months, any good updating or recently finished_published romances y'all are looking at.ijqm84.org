So I've been busy listening to the Magnus Archives and not really reading fanfiction all that much and I've kinda fallen away from fanfiction in general.

So with that said do you guys have any recommendations for romance that have updated or been published recently? Slash isn't preferred but is fine as long as no Voldemort, Tom Riddle, death eaters, Snape, or Draco are involved.


** A bit of self-promotion but I myself haven't checked the HP archives for anything new in a while.

I am currently working on a Harry/Daphne fanfic that will follow their life. Plenty of romance is planned and hopefully, the current scenes are enough to get you interested.
