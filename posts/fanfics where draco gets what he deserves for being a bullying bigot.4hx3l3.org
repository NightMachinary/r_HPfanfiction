** Among my top 10 fics, exactly half has Draco killed off. Since you hate him, I'll list those for you:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]*, linkffn(10595005): after Voldemort's fall, pureblood extremists in the Wizengamot were crazy enough to pass a marriage law, and Hermione would have none of that. They staged a revolution and got rid of the British pureblood aristocracy, in the Roman proscription and French revolution style. Draco's arrest and execution took almost two chapters.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]*, linkffn(4101650): many say it's the gold standard for time travel fics, which I agree. The writing, characterization, and some of the plot are absolutely brilliant. Draco was a very minor character here and basically used as a spell fodder.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]]*, linkffn(5604382): a light-hearted Harry/Multi story, where Harry and his girls made up a really smart and powerful team. Harry, however, would hold back nothing when his family was being threatened. So when Draco threatened the life of one of his girls, Harry essentially fed him to the acromantulas.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]*, linkffn(6989327): this fic is actually epilogue compliant. After finally rounding up the last Death Eaters, the Trio and Ginny were called by Hermione from a different dimension to defeat Voldemort one more time. Draco was a serious bad guy here, and he met a well deserved end.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]]*: the Horcrux in Harry was sentient and it made a deal with Harry. As a result, Harry became very very powerful. When Draco's mission at Hogwarts failed, Voldemort killed him.

** He's not bad, he's just misunderstood. And he only bullied Harry and Hermione because he had feelings for them. JK Rowling even said that she originally planned to have Draco and Hermione get together and then get married at Hogwarts, where instead of throwing confetti, everyone writes them a nice Tumblr post about how whenever they are around each other, they just can't even. Honestly, you need to learn to read between the lines. /s

*** I nearly downvoted on instinct.

My favourite is when theories like 'Draco almost fought in the Battle with the Order because of his love for Hermione!' Crop up like....no. You're literally contradicting canon, there's zero evidence for your claim. If that was the fucking intent of the author she would have fucking hinted it, like she did with every other couple/character growth. >:(

**** What, such theories exist? Draco was pretty disillusioned by the time of the battle, but still, this is incredibly far-fetched. He still tried to redeem himself in Voldemort's eyes by capturing Harry, and after that failed, he just ran through the castle in panic and pleaded with both sides to let him stay alive.

***** I'm literally not even joking right now, I read that exact theory on Facebook and all the comments were like "I knew it!!" [[http://winteriscomingbitch.tumblr.com/post/8020005929/jk-rowling-revealed-in-an-interview-that-draco][Here]] is the same claim on tumblr, alleging JKR said it. I could come up with a good dozen other bullshit theories that have been spread claiming 'JKR said it' when either 1) no she didn't. Ever. Or 2) she said something tangentially related (Eg: Harry *might* be better /in some ways/ for Hermione than Ron) and turned it into their own wish fulfillment ('Harry and Hermione are confirmed! Ginny and Ron were mistakes!').

In this case it's the damn Draco/Hermione shippers. Apparently they've taken the 'he teases you because he likes you^{1} ' notion, combined it with their attraction to Tom Felton, and their ability to relate to Hermione, and gone full wish fulfillment, reading comprehension of the actual series be damned. (Side note: I have no issue with shippers of any pairing, as long as they are aware that some ships require a certain level of OOCness. Dramione wouldn't work with the canon characters, but that doesn't stop me from reading good AU/OOC fics).

^{1} Apparently they also fail to realise that calling someone racial slurs and wishing death upon them at age 12 isn't the same as playful teasing.

** So, I'm in the same boat as the OP. I hate Draco, and I have a strong distaste for fics that worship Draco. I read a fic called linkffn(accountable by dyce), which is NOT a dramionie fic but I wish it was. It's essentially an 8th year fic and Draco lost his arm in the war. He's humble, self-aware and . . . I don't know how best to describe it, wry. It's not a facet of Draco that I've seen before (although now I'm keeping an eye out for it, hopefully I'll find something else that's similar), and it's not exactly what you asked for (unless you count Draco cutting his own arm off as punishment, and you want to see the aftermath) but I really enjoyed the fic and I thought that Draco was the best part (not something I ever thought I'd say).

** Yeah, that's exactly why I hate Draco, too (I was bullied in school for four years (and when it finally was winding down, I changed schools and those fuckers did it all over again, but not for long, I grew smarter and offered them my English homework (stuff I brezed through in minutes) - in exchange vor their business-studies homework (which would take way longer than English) and them stopping to bully me...so both sides got something from that deal)) so I know bullies quite well and frankly: I hate them all - I only hate their enablers (teachers, parents and followers) more and I think any teacher who lets bullying happen should lose his or her job and bullies should be thrown out of school if they don't stop after being warned (my school director - a monk! - was too nice in that regard, he didn't want to even suspend them and my parents didn't force the issue (they could have gotten a lawyer for example)...I mean I am not vindictive (not really), but sometimes I'd love to see them suffer as I have suffered and still suffer (I still have self-esteem issues!) and when I am in particularly dark mood I'd love to see them actually lose everything and hit rock bottom!).

I always thought he got off too easy in canon (I know his fans will tell you that he was coerced and that it was his fathers fault for raising him that way etc. etc. but all that treats Draco like he can't think for himself and it blames others for what is essentially his responsibility!), so while I can't recommend any fanfictions (I've been looking ever since I got into fanfiction and there's damned few that actually handle punishment of deatheaters and their co-conspirators and supporters etc.):

I do second this request whole heartedly :)
