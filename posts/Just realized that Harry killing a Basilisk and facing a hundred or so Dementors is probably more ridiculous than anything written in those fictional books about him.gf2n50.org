"When he was twelve, he killed a sixty feet Basilisk with a sword."

"When he was thirteen, he chased a hundred Dementors away."

​

How ridiculous it must sound to someone in the Wizarding world?

****** Lol, think about this for a second? Even if wizards tended to ignore bullets and guns and such, they couldn't do the same with the bows and arrows. These were used by other armies whether magical (centaurs, wizards, etc) or muggle. So they must had protections against this, which probably extended to bullets from guns. This is extremely likely in my opinion as participating in either World War wizards would've had to encounter this somewhat. So especially Tom Riddle, who grew up during the second war, would've known these methods for protection and used them. Though this is all conjecture on my part.

**** but no one in the wizarding world publicly knew that at the time, did they? Only Dumbledore suspected it. I just think that considering the Daily Prophet and other news sources in the British wizarding world, that anything published would be taken with a grain of-scratch that, likely buckets- of salt. I imagine there's some individuals who did not even believe when it was published that the Dark lord was gone(in which case they wouldn't have been entirely incorrect in their beliefs). But, yeah, I do think that if we go that route, people either believe in everything he's done or nothing.

*** What is hilarious about this is that he didn't actually take the curse at all, it backfired and hit Voldemort. But then when he was seventeen, he /did/ get hit with the curse and lived, so he ended up actually doing what he was already famous for!

(Although I have mentioned this before and someone said they interpreted backfiring as hitting Harry, creating his scar, and then reversing, and then when Voldemort's soul exploded, the piece entered into Harry through a cut that already existed. I think this is a great interpretation, but then we have to question why Harry is left with a mark from a curse that famously leaves no mark. We could argue that the backfiring itself is what makes the mark, though, but I'm not so sure I find that convincing. I don't think there's a definitive answer, but it's interesting to think about).

(*Sowilo* is the *rune* of the extreme strength, embodying and channeling the power of the sun whose it symbolizes the energy and the light. Literally, this *rune* is the vital principle of the solar light) with the largest target of a swaddled baby being the head because the chance to miss is greater for a body shot the rune could be the strongest point with the most power so on activation it burns the scar in and the massive power of that point makes it become a Horcrux since it needs to recharge the light energy and then has to protect harry's mind and soul from corruption(causing pain when near voldy because the connection is lending small wisps of power to empower the horcrux).

If you only want to hear your own opinions parroted back to you, then I recommend having a discussion with a mirror rather than posting to an online discussion board.

All I'm saying is that responding to a thread which is themed around something else with a nitpick on the author's knowledge is rude. How about you stop being so god damn defensive and stop attacking me for that.

I'm not "protecting the author" - rather, I'm saying that your comment wasn't asked for. While this thread had an OP that didn't mind, you say yourself that you would be justified even if the OP did mind, which isn't true.

** I would agree that Mcgonagall's comments in PS are probably the justification for the idea that there are Harry Potter books. I mean think about it, according to canon. He's considered the Saviour of the wizarding world, he's in at least two historical books, he is considered to have defeated Voldemort not his mother. And of course he did this as a child.

So it's not that big of a stretch to think that there were "other books" about Harry Potter. I mean how else would Ginny (and other children) be so starstruck about Harry as I doubt she (and others) was reading wizard history books at that age.

So while canon does not come straight out and state that there are Harry Potter children's books it's not that difficult to assume they exist.

Actually, this is something that weirded me out once I thought about it. Presumably, Harry's a big deal with all magical children, but I can't imagine how. I understand it being the case for families with one or more magicals in them, whether it's parents, siblings or close relatives. To them, the fall of Voldemort would've been a big deal, brought on by a miracle. I even buy Hermione knowing about Harry. Her sitting down and obsessively going through modern magical history, is something I can easily imagine. But Colin Creevy? How the hell did he turn into a superfan?! Presumably, before coming to Hogwarts, he'd only have just become aware magic was even real, much less any other relevant information. How is it we never see a meggleborn going "Who's Harry Potter?"

**** Can we say plot hole?

But you're right. Harry should be a complete unknown to any muggleborn who didn't have an older sibling or relative who was magical. Now for those muggleborn who are at Hogwarts before Harry shows up you could potentially believe they know about harry because the magicals all talk about him. But those who show up with him or after him should be clueless.

The only thing I can think of that even remotely may be workable/justification for why a muggleborn like Colin is a superfan is that when the professors introduce the new muggleborn to the wizarding world they mention that they will be going to school with Harry Potter the hero of the wizarding world. And then the new muggleborn would pick up the Harry Potter children's books.

How else would Colin be such a fan? I mean really. Colin had roughly 10 1/2 - 11 years of magic isn't real/no knowledge that world exists. To then finding out that magic is real and he's offered a spot in their school. To instantly becoming a Harry superfan. The only thing I can think is plausible is that between finding out Magic is real and meeting Harry is that Colin reads about Harry. And it has to be children's adventure Harry stories as no kid would become a superfan reading a wizarding history book.

Hearing about the shit Voldemort pulled towards people just like you, then asking how he was defeated would work, I think. The fact that Harry is a humble ace athlete who's superficially tolerant of Colin's enthusiasm but doesn't give interviews would make him the perfect obsession for a budding photographer.

***** You're probably right. Though your explanation of how older muggleborn know about it got me thinking: just what /kind/ of fame does Harry Potter have?

When he first shows up, he'd been out of the public eye for a decade. I'm not implying they should've forgotten about him, but it would be weird for him to still be such a hot topic. I feel it would be kind of like you or I sitting down with some friends and going "You remember how Barack Obama became the first black president of the USA?"

The best explanation I can come up with on the spot, is that prior to Harry's first year, the faculty/papers/politicians had some kind of campaign to drum up interest, or something. Well, /that/ or him being a major cultural icon, which he seems to be, /but/ then you have to wonder how can they flip-flop on their treatment of him, when they spent 10-12 years being thought he's just short of a god.

I already feel, like I've spent too much time thinking about this. Good talk, though. Kind of wish canon had some answers for me.

Well, more like "you remember how Barack Obama was elected the first black president of the USA, and then after his second term ended /he vanished/"? Think about Elvis.

Also, it's really easy to venerate an imaginary person - once they turn up and start doing their own things, it becomes clear that they don't completely agree with you on everything, and then they're betraying your imaginary version of them.

******* Well don't forget that canon heavily implies that at every Halloween the magicals celebrate the end of Voldemort (end of the first war) along with the "traditional" Halloween reasons. That would keep Harry in the magicals minds (which means I can see articles celebrating that eg "one year today little Harry Potter defeated You-Know-Who the worst dark lord ever and then disappeared. We wish Harry well wherever he is" and then "In a few month's it will be the tenth Anniversary of the Defeat of You-Know-Who by Harry Potter. It should also be the time that Harry Potter returns to the wizarding world when he joins our children at Hogwarts").

So between my belief of wizarding world "end of Voldemort" anniversary celebrations (with appropriate news articles) and children's books about Harry, that the Wizarding children all know about Harry and that muggleborns when they join the wizarding world get "introduced" to this celebrity "hero Harry".

"Magic works on suspension of disbelief" - Wizards are raised in a magical environment, so they learn not to dismiss anything out of hand, because with magic it might be possible, you never know. That leads to them believing some truly ridiculous things, but eh..!
