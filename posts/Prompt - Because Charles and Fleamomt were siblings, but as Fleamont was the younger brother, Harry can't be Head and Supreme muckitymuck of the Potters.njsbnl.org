We all know those Lordship Harry fics where Harry is Lord Potter because he was the grandson of Fleamont, etc, but what if Fleamont was the younger brother (e.g. Charlus and Flea were twins but Flea was second) and so Charlus was Head and Supreme muckitymuck of the Potters instead.

Even better if Charlus only impressed the Black's because of his love for the Dark whereas Fleamont was pure light.


** According to Pottermore et al, Charlus married Dorea and they had a son, who is presumed dead (no names given). If that son had no children, it would still fall to Harry.

On the other hand, if the son (I've been calling him Aries) had children of his own and Charlus was the elder brother, then those children's claim would indeed supersede Harry's. It would be a fun concept to play with.

******** I like Charlus and Dorea but not as Harry's grandparents, I'm satisfied with Fleamont and Euphemia, Charlus and Dorea fit me better as his great-uncles, as those relatives he doesn't expect to have, the classic "rich uncles" (although in this case they would be great-uncles) that are in every family. I imagine Charlus and Dorea as James's pampering aunt and uncle, the ones who visited him every weekend to bring him presents and have tea with Fleamont and Euphemia, Charlus being the one who also gave James his fine clothes for his wedding day to Lily.

** If Harry is the only living Potter then the point is moot because it would fall to him anyway.

He has the Cloak, which is supposedly passed from father to son, arguably the firstborn, so yeah, wouldn't work unless you have Harry having some cousins, which would beg the question of why he wasn't sent to them since they would be preferable to the Dursleys.

** This prompt makes no sense. In order for this to be true Charlus or his sons would need to actually be alive, otherwise it'd be a non-issue.

- If he is also dead, then it's a moot point and Harry would be head of house anyway.
- And if he is alive the question would be why Harry doesn't live with him. He only went with the Dursleys because Harry had no wizarding family left. There is no way in hell they would let the boy-who-lived and one of the most famous wizards out there not be under their control.

So the story where Charlus is alive but Harry lives with the Dursleys is a weird one that might as well be the same as just canon.

And the story where Harry grows up with other potters as part of a family is a completely different story altogether.

*** There is every chance that living Potter cousins would be passed over for custody. Petunia is still Harry's closest living relative. After all: she is Lily's sister and James has no siblings. The Potter cousins could technically sue for custody, but there are many reasons why they would not want to:

- Danger from Boy-Who-Lived shenanigans/politics
- Dumbledore said it was not an option (works both for Bashing and non-Bashing depending on his argument)
- Simply not having a close enough connection with James to want to take in his kid
- Age/disease/disability/other responsibilities
- For litterally any sort of reason a person like you or I would not want to take in the todler of your nephew/cousin

The only reason I see for a Potter cousin to want to take Harry in is if:

1) Potter's are much more of a closeknit family and actually were in regular contact pre-Halloween, therefore knowing that Petunia should not get custody.

2) Potter's want the status of 'having' the Boy-Who-Lived

** I feel that it would still be Harry who was 'Head of House', because as far as we know he is the only Potter still around. While it is not impossible that Harry has some second cousins knocking around, unless they were living under a rock on the other side of the world, it would be weird if nobody so much as mentions them, even if they don't want to get in touch themselves for whatever reason. Although nobody wants to talk about the Potter family at all, so maybe there is a reason for that.

*** There's definitely a bias towards his mother's side (due to her sacrifice and thus why he's with the Dursleys). It is interesting though that there's nothing in the books about any other Potters other than his dad that are mentioned in the books. There's the Black family tree with Charlus and the Pottermore article with Fleamont and Henry.

** I feel like a prompt like this would need more detail because in the books, it's clearly stated that Harry's got no living family on his father's side. It'd also depend a lot on what the direction of the story wants to be taken in.

You could base it off the WBWL ideas and make Harry bitter or something but I feel like things would have to be a bit more AU for that to work while still being in character with Harry.

You could do what someone else suggested and have his cousins (or maybe his great uncle is still alive, idk) take care of him. They could train him, teach him Potions, etc.

This is a lot more off topic but it could be an AU where Harry's current life is affected by their deaths and why they died and stuff so he ventures on a journey to figure out the secrets behind his father's side of the family before they all died mysteriously.

It could be an AU where Harry's raised by his father's side of the family (like his father is the one with the protection or something). This could work if maybe Pettigrew was the one that asked for James to be spared.

There are tons of possibilities with a prompt like this so it depends on where you want to take the story.
