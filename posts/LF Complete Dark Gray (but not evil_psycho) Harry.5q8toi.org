I'm good with him killing people but only as long as its for a reason and not "I felt like it" or something similar.


** Don't let the title or summary tags fool you with this fic, Harry isn't really evil just ruthless as fuck.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
