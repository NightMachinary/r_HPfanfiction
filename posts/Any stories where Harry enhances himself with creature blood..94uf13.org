Like dragon blood for impenetrable skin, troll blood for strength, and other types of enhancements. It doesn't have to be blood as long as he enhances him self with a piece, or pieces of a creature/s

Like usual the more words the better. If completed brilliant.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** "Cold Blood" by DerLaCroix fits that - if you accept "enhances himself by accident" as well.

** So, if I'm remembering right Harry doesn't actually use creature parts in and of themselves (though it's been a bit since I've read it so I might be wrong), but Harry /does/ enhance himself with animalistic traits, and hopefully that (and the amazing writing) is good enough.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** linkffn(The Horse by Elsa2)

The creature blood bit is quite a ways in, but I love this fic so much so I reckon it's worth it.

It's one of those ones where there's a bit of everything trope-wise, but really well-written and believable characters for the most part :)

  Looking after a Muggle animal should be easy compared to saving Hogwarts from Voldemort. Harry and Draco might disagree with that. Featuring Luna, Marauders, peppermints and, of course, a tall, black, badtempered horse named Simon.
