So I read this fanfic like years ago I think the 5th book had only just come out if even. I lost it after changing computers or something before I realized what the alert button does. It was about harry getting these elemental powers, with like 4 other characters (all oc I think) of like earth, fire, water, air, and i was to say something like the mind. I doubt it was very good or that anyone knows it but it's worth a shot, if it's even still around.
