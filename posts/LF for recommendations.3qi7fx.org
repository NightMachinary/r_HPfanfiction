Hi

I really like Jeconais' work ([[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/]]) and am looking for recommendations of similar fanfics.

Thanks!


** It has been ages since I read any of Jeconais' work, so my suggestion might not entail exactly similar themes, but it should be close.

Anyway, if you haven't checked him out, I would propose reading Draco664's work. He is also on fanficauthors. I've read his unfinished trilogy, and it was definitely interesting.
