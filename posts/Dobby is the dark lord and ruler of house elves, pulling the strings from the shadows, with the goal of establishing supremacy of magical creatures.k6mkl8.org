Similar to idea that JarJar Binks was supposed to be a dark lord, Dobby is an actual honest to god dark lord, working from the shadows to take over the wizardring world.\\
His allies are neutral and light magical creatures while dark ones are 50-50 between him and Voldemort.


** And his ultimate weapon which none shall stand unbroken before is the great and honest, true and just, powerful and rightious Hermione Granger (and her two tag along I suppose)

*** Priestess of the cult of elvish magic, a spy girl, devout believer in elvish supremacy, hiding in plaint sight, acting like a naive bookworm with complete trust in authority.\\
Accidentally falling in love with Harry, after much internal conflict, she tells him of hidden forces of the magical world.\\
Now the hero must find a balance between conflicting alliances, of light, dark and gray (creatures). As well as, resolve his feelings for a devout priestess.
