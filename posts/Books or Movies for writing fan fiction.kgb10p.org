Hi all,

I'm looking to write my first fan fiction in the Harry Potter Universe. Up to now I've only watched the first four movies. I have a few ideas bouncing around, however I want to dig through the story for more ideas. Would it be better to watch the eight movies or read the seven books?

Thank you for reading my post.


** READ THE BOOKS they are magnificent. There are plenty of people who don't read but love HP, myself being one of them. They also have plenty of humor too.

** Personally, if I encounter a fic where film situations are used instead of the book equivalents, I will just stop reading. Maybe others disagree, but personally, if Hermione is the one who explains "mudblood", like in the films, instead of Ron, like in the books, I probably will stop reading.

*** Or that scandalous downplaying of their argument about Scabbers.

** It depends, it is your writing so you can do whatever you want. Fanfiction is using an existing work as inspiration, not gospel. I am trying my own and using the books on their own, as it is easier to stick to one, and I prefer having text to flick through.

** The main reason you should read the books/audiobooks is to see how characters develop through them, especially if you want some self inserts/another POV from canon/another adventure from canon(aside from the fact you like the universe and want to be immersed in it). Movies are great as a standalone thing, but books are canon (sry not sry).

** If you want your piece of fanfiction to be super detailed with all the Harry Potter stuff, you can read the books, but I don't believe it matters too much.

If you don't care, then watch the movies! Each of them (Movies and the books) have pretty great things in them.

** I have never seen all the movies. So I don't think you need to read/watch all of them. But maybe movies would be better Just because it's easier to sit and watch a movie then read a like 600 page book.

Sorry this is mostly rambling but I don't think you should feel obligated to read the books

** As I see it, if you're /writing/ a fanfic, you should read the books.

If you were making a fan video, then just watching the movies would make sense.

** I'm honestly interested to see a fic written from just the first 4 movies.

Curious where the story might end up with that as a starting point.
