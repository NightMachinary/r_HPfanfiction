Fics where the magic is something more than just wand-waving and a few words. Fics where magic is ancient and portrayed beautifully like in Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194) or Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574).


** The Lesser Sadness is always a good one where Harry does some especially impressive and ancient magic at Azkaban. Unfortunately it's only three chapters in. linkffn(10959046)

Another good one is Bonfires at Midnight where Harry explores ritual magic surrounding magical days. It's only through the first year, and the second year hasn't started yet, but I'm a fan. linkffn(9652275)

** Newcomb's other one is also pretty great. It takes a few chapters to get to where magic beyond "wand-waving and a few words" is shown though.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** Nothing beautiful or ethereal about it. It's just Harry and Hermione screaming "I'm better than you and can do whatever I want because I have OVER 9000 MAGICAL CORE!!!". It's pretty much the opposite of ethereal.

**** That's a bit harsh, though not entirely off base. While there is a good bit of "look how powerful harry is", there also is interesting discussion of why Dumbledore acts how he does, and limiters on harry are introduced later in the story.

I was focusing on the bit where the OP wanted magic that was more than a few words and wand waving. Throughout you see harry doing cool magic, and eventually [[/spoiler][magic turns on him, twisting his intent and showing harry why most wizards just use the simple stuff]]
