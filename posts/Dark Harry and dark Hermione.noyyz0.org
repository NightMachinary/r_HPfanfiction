Im looking for a good fic with preferably more than 50k words where Harry and Hermione are in love and turn dark lord and lady together. A little (read: heavy) weasley bashing wouldnt be too bad either. Bonus of its "Oh harry ive been in love with you since blah blah blah" (yeah im cheesy like that). Thanks for any suggestion!


** They never claimed to be dark in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], but I think their actions speak for themselves. Ron can be considered their chief henchman though
