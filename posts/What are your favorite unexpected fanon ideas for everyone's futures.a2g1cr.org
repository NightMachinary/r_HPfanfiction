I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever]] (a fic where Dudley's daughter ends up being a witch) which had Luna Lovegood of all people as the Defense Against The Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. This really surprised me because it's not a job I'd ever have expected Luna to end up in, but honestly, I love how she was written and the story really sold me on the idea.

Another idea I've seen in several fics now is having Lavender Brown become a colleague of Harry's at the Auror office. Again not something I would have ever come up with, but let's be real, a lot of people are very different as adults from when they were teenagers and I but found that I much prefer this interpretation over how most fanon always treats her as a memetic dumb airhead.

I want to hear more ideas like that. What are your favorite places that people might end up in after the end of canon, or that you've seen in fics, that are pretty unexpected and non-straightforward but still somehow work really well for the character?


** I like career alternatives for Harry that don't involve him becoming an auror or any kind of dark wizard hunter. In my mind, he's had plenty of that already, and might not want that fight to define his life any more than it already has. Personally, I'm kinda fond of the expected subset of unexpected careers (in that it's not what happens in canon) that Harry discovered an aptitude for teaching in the DA and later went on to become Hogwarts' DADA professor.

â€‹

A story I read once also put forth an interesting, if a bit OOC, path for him, namely that he becomes a stay at home dad and even takes up his wife's family name rather than the other way around. I can't really see Harry actually doing this in anything close to his canon characterization, but I think it's a neat exploration of him escaping the fame of his name and an endless life of battling dark wizards in a really unique way.

*** To be honest, Harry ending up as the permanent DADA professor once the curse is lifted (perhaps a few years after, as to not get it literally right after finishing school) is fitting IMO, and I similarly prefer it over his Auror job.

**** I've always loved the idea that he starts as an auror and then goes "Yeah, fuck this." at like 23 or something. Does the stay at home dad thing for a few years and the takes over DADA at 28 or so when whoever takes over after the war just decides they're done.

***** I figure Harry did end up at Hogwarts eventually. Wizards live long lives, he had a career in the ministry then eventually went to Hogwarts to teach for another several decades.

Let's be honest, Harry was never pushed into fighting. He ran in eagerly against the cautions of others. His being an Auror is what he wants to do. His becoming an administrator instead was probably for Hermiones sake. So after awhile as head of the department he'd probably want to transition to something else he enjoyed, teaching.

*** I used to like the idea of Harry as a teacher of some sort, but the idea is so self-evident from the DA that I feel like it's been done to death. That is to say, I could sit through a mediocre story where Harry goes and becomes a magical farmer, but I couldn't do the same for Professor Harry #1074 unless it's really good or brings some other interesting ideas to the table. I even feel like the Auror idea is done less often than the professor one. But I really like ideas where they go even more off the wall.

**** It is logical, and thus /should/ be a common trope, but really I haven't seen it much at all? Maybe I just don't browse the right type of fics if I wanted to look at this.

** I read a fic ages ago (can't remember its name but i remember finding it in some random corner of the internet so likely not well known).

But in it, Hermione ends up as Headmaster of Hogwarts. Maybe not the most out of the box thing, but still fun since she is usually looked at as Minister of Magic or at least a high up Ministry position.

But that's not even the best part. The best part is that it also has Harry deciding to change it up, becoming Ollivander's apprentice, becoming a wandmaker, and marrying Luna. I remember it being implied that to get materials he and Luna travels the world finding amazing magical creatures and whatnot. It was almost like a Harry with some Newt Scamander traits.

I've never seen it since, either here or on the internet so sadly it probably got deleted. It was also sadly not very well written despite its really cool ideas. I kinda hope someone sees this and it inspires them heh.

** Luna becomes a healer. I think that brings her viewpoint on things to the fore usefully as she can diagnose things that are more rare or unexpected, and also it speaks to her losing her mother young and wanting to protect her friends.

I also love werewolf!Auror Lavender Brown. It's such a character arc for her to have to learn to live with scars - not to say that she deserved it in any way, of course. I just love characters unexpectedly proving their House qualities.

Stay at home dad Ron Weasley who bonds more with Molly later in life is another that I like a lot. That's the kind of husband Hermione Granger could do with and also has some neat parallels to Ron enjoying being a big kid, as well as countering his early dismissals of house elves and the work they do.

Have to say although I do like the canon pairings I'm also an absolute sucker for Harry x Draco much later in life following one or both of them divorcing and growing up and changing a lot. Ultimately when school and the war are 30 years in the past, they're just two people with a long history and complementary colouring :')

** Either Harry or Hermione (or even both) getting together with Lavender after the war when she is shunned for being mauled by Greyback (be it for being disfigured or having some form of Lycanthropy). It has some nice hurt/comfort moments and a reconciliation between Lavender and Hermione.

Sadly, the few fics with those pairings are not really good.

**** I was going to mention this one fic where Harry became a woodworking artist, but couldn't remember the name of it :) I really liked how his chosen profession had absolutely nothing to do with the Aurors or Defence. I imagine this (doing his own thing, creating beauty with his own hands) would fit after a life of constant fighting.
