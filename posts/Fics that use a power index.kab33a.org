I'm interested in reading some fics that use a defined, measurable, power index.

I'm not super fussed what the scale is or how its measured (observations, testing, a spell), and it doesn't have to play a big part even, I just think it's a cool idea.

Thanks!

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!

**** Isn't it? Not gonna lie, the tags put me off, but now it's my favorite examination of canon. Especially the hospital scene when Snape narrates the canon abuse Harry suffered, without exaggerating it or downplaying it.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

** Oh another chance to rec my favourite fic? Hell to the yeah!

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran has an exponential power system. Your magical power rates from a 1 to a 10. A 1 is enough magic to be alive, most muggles fall under this. A 2 is twice as powerful as a 1 and is the bare minimum to be enrolled in Hogwarts. A 3 is twice as powerful as a 2 and a 4 is twice as powerful as a 3, so on and so forth. Dumbledore registers as a 7, and Voldemort and Harry as an 8.

However Harry and Ginny are soulbonded, and together have the only registered 10 since perhaps Merlin. Certain spells are hard to cast without over powering them as such. For instance, Bluebell Flames, the spell that makes fire that doesn't burn, can be lethal.
