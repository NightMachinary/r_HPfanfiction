Ok so in my other thread I asked why their are very few fics in other era's or nations And it's sparked some discussion so here is the challenge.

Must be either in another country Or time period.

Any characters are allowed time travel is acceptable Any morality is acceptable

I would prefer no crossovers but I won't say no

Forbidden

marauder era Next gen Hogwarts fix

The reason is those are the two eras that already have plenty of story's for them

Some examples you could do Ancient Egypt Ancient Rome Ancient Greece Dark ages Renaissance Industrial revolution American revolution Civil war Ww1 Ww2 Cold war The Vikings The slave trade Spanish conquest Feudal Japan Napoleon conquest French revolution

Modern north Korea or middle east

Have fun !

We don't do challenges here. Or at least we're not collectively enthused about them, which amounts to the same thing.

*** I remember a couple of successful ones, but those were challenges that were asking people to write only a few hundred words with a /very/ loose theme.

** What is the challenge? Writing or finding it for you? You seem to be interested, why don't you write it?

** Er . . . Could I suggest hopping over to [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]? That's a lot more of a writer concentrated place. R/hpfanfiction is mostly us readers arguing our pants off about characterisations, tropes & fics, and helping other people find stories. We don't really do challenges here.

Over on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]], though, there are 3 active writing challenges */right now/*. You might have more luck there.

*** P.S. If I misunderstood and you were actually talking about finding fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11477665][this]] /might/ be something you're looking for. It's about Harry going to a school in Japan. It's not really great, and didn't fit my taste, but you might find it a good read.

** As well as the clear reluctance of the community at [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]], your formatting makes your post rather hard to understand.

*** Poor OP. Must be surprised we aren't jumping at it! But they're asking for a long fic that needs tons of research and original characters. Way more work than a shorter story following characters and locations we already know. It's hard enough to write for yourself, let alone someone else's wishes
