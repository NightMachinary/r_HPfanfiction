By not rehashing canon I mean something changed when they went back, either by the time travel itself (DC Comics Flashpoint type ripples) or because another person/group went back and changed things. Complete or actively updated fics preferred please.

As an example linkffn(Once More Around The Bend)


** Nowadays, I really HATE canon rehashes, especially in time travels. That's the main reason I soured on *BWP I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650).

Following time travel fics have completely dumped canon stations:

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795)

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855)

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107)

*His Greatest Wish*, linkffn(6548167)

*Many Thanks*, linkffn(4692717)

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093)

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059)

*Spectrum*, linkffn(10687059)

*The Moment It Began*, linkffn(3735743)

*Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is*, linkffn(10610076)

*We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516)

**** A Little Child Shall Lead Them is pretty well-written, and is an interesting take on the time travel trope. It's not to long either so it won't take up too much of your time.

and Backward With Purpose: Always and Always is decent. I recall it having good writing, though being a little too long winded at some parts. It did know how to tug on my heartstrings, though--I think I cried at some parts.

Definitely Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is. I really enjoyed it, although I am partial to MoD!Harry fics. It doesn't change the fact that it's well-written and a very different take from usual timetravel fics.

I've also read Ginny Returns, but I can't remember much of it... If it counts for anything, what little I do remember, I liked.

**** I'm surprised you thought Harry was an idiot in *Delenda Est*. His manipulation of the elder Blacks and Malfoys was masterfully done, and did pretty much everything right until that duel in Gaunt Shack. In second half, it's true Bellatrix took the lead, but Harry executed all of his missions successfully, and he handled the relationship with the Ministry very well.

Among other fics, I like *A Little Child*, *Ginny Returns*, *Returning to the Start* the most. In all three of them, the protagonists didn't waste any thoughts on 'maintaining the timeline', instead they destroyed their enemies efficiently and ruthlessly. Their main struggle was no longer dealing with Voldemort, but how to adapt themselves to the new reality.

  I'm surprised you thought Harry was an idiot in Delenda Est.
#+end_quote

I have read it only till the end of chapter 9, and in those chapters he was being either an outright idiot or just a plain, dull character. He often made stupid decisions^{1} (or stupidly failed to act)^{2} [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave][only to comment on his poor actions later on;]] he was a very incompetent teacher,^{3} reading about which grated on my nerves; and he was almost submissive in his relations with the teenage Bella.

I think I also remember his plans being smarter on the author's paper than in actuality and the background characters being poorly portrayed (either dull or OoC). Would you say this changes in the later chapters? Maybe the smart manipulations you've mentioned come in later, and that's why so many people tend to recommend this story?

^{1} e.g. not leaving the fight scene and getting the ministry's attention when he wanted to stay unnoticed

^{2} how stupid does a wizard have to be to not go and buy a wand immidiately when their current one gets broken? Especially someone in Harry's situation?

^{3}

#+begin_quote
  (1) “"Sir," Lily called out approaching his desk as other students began working, "I'm not sure we're supposed to be brewing this potion today."

  The headache turned into a pounding migraine. "Does it really matter?" he asked, doing his best to keep a level tone.”

  "Well, we're supposed to learn them in a certain order. Didn't the headmaster give you any of Professor Slughorn's lesson plans?"

  Now I know how Snape feels when Hermione is on a trip, Harry thought

  (2) Harry soon decided that assigning his students essays could wait a day or two, or even a week. It wasn't as if they were going to complain about Harry being lazy in that department. They wouldn't do the essays until the last minute no matter how early he assigned them.

  (3) "Our next topic of interest," Dumbledore said as soon as introductions had concluded, "is yesterday's incident in the first-year potion class."

  Harry winced. This was the awkward subject he had not been looking forward to. He supposed that he would just have to get it over with quickly. "The first-year Hufflepuff Stebbins melted a cauldron," Harry stated succinctly. [..] "Normally, the melting of a cauldron isn't so serious, but Stebbins had been using the wrong ingredients and the spilled potion came into contact with his partner's potion ingredient kit. That kind of started a long chain reaction and things got pretty bad. Fortunately, Madam Pomfrey took care of everything."

  Stupid Stebbins, Harry groused silently. One look at him and Professor Snape would hail Neville as a genius potions master. The rest of the professors were not impressed. "Why didn't you do something to stop the situation from getting as bad as it did?" Professor Bennings asked.

  Harry felt his ears begin to burn red. He had been hoping that this would not come up. "Err . . . it turns out that just the day before I had been practicing some spells, and my wand exploded. Apparently Wanda and Wandel's are not representative of England's better wandmakers. The bottom line is that I don't exactly have a wand with me these days. I haven't had a chance to get out and replace it yet."

  Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, what was his payment? He got kicked out of the Wizarding world! They tried to bind his magic and it backfired, so what has Harry been doing the past 15 years since his escape from that world, and what happens when he gets a chance to take another trip around the bend? Time Travel Story, some bashing. Grey!Harry Independant!Harry. OOC.

** I once thought about this problem when I was writing my own fanfiction about half the class of 1991 ends up transported back in time. I ended up abandoning it but I tried to avert the problem by having the travelers ending up being argumentative amongst themselves, with for example, the Ravenclaws demanding the diadem not be destroyed until the last minute or the trio ended up being sorted into Slytherin. Still, at the end of the day, there was still too much canon rehash.

*** We know what happens in the books so why rehash it? So much could be slightly altered to make it interesting.

Authors don't have to completely change the years to make it interesting. Maybe the TWT happened in France, or had different schools in it. Maybe the basilisk killed someone or was released early/late?

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
