I mostly just want to see the main story of Harry Potter, but from the eyes of a female Harry. I find a lot of stuff, but often it has other big changes to the story.


** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) has fem!Harry and while it doesn't exactly follow canon, it stays true to the feel of canon. And in this fic actually goes into what differences fem!Harry would have.

*** Hmm, Snape/femHarry is kinda weird. I'm looking on fanfic.net and ao3, and it's hard to find stuff that isn't an Avengers crossover or too NSFW.

**** This fic is very gen. Nothing romantic actually happens with the future pairing. At the very end Harriet starts to crush on Snape, and all the adults involved (including Snape) freak out. the author said she wanted to give a heads up as to what the endgame pairing was, and that it would happen in the very distant future.

**** It doesn't actually happen in those 600k words. It's some far off pairing. It's not even really considered, I don't think. Harriet might have some crush at some point which everybody, including Snape, finds disturbing.

But I get your hesitation. It's pretty weird to me too.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
