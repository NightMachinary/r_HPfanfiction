Come up with a summary and make us (everyone else) judge the "story" based on it. If your summary doesn't tell us much about the story itself, then we have to guess what it is.

Go nuts.


** /Day 14: Have found someone else's rudimentary encampment, mostly sod blocks to form shelter. Seems abandoned, will use as my base camp as it's readily defendable from the skeletons that arrive in the night. Adding arrow wound to list of grievances against whoever sent me here. At least I know a good recipe for mutton./

**** heh, I've been debating a minecraft/HP story off an on, thinking I'll do it like my Cookbook of Doom story, updating whenever I feel like writing an entry instead of following any sort of update schedule.

Basically a 1st POV with Harry sent to the Minecraft'verse, he finds Steve's journal which is useful as it helps him figure out this weird blocky world and he explores it, trying to figure out what he has to do to get back or at least survive long enough for his friends to get him back.

***** I don't think it needs to be an HP crossover.

Any suitably sarcastic smart ass of a protagonist, SIs included, could make a short story consisting of journal entries like that one a hilarious read.

****** It could easily be a series of various characters stuck in the--DAMNIT, now I have another massive crossover idea. Harry, Commander, Shepherd, Master Chief, Buffy Summers, and more are all trapped in minecraft in the same seed and eventually find each other. It becomes a village of trapped characters.

******** How cna they be helpful? I've only come across them once, I usually play in creative peaceful mode because I just like building stuff. Just recently started playing an actual survival game of it.

********* Oh. Sorry, I haven't played in ages so it may have changed but AFAIK in game they're just kind of there. They don't 'help' in any way.

But...

I meant that /in story/ you could presumably have additional options for interacting with them, but that it'd be great if the group of lost characters only find this out months after Buffy starts a protracted war with the 'demons'

**** That's the point, right? To get you interested enough to read it? Yes, time traveling, because that's my favorite trope. Unfortunately, this story only exists in my head at the moment and I've got too many others to finish before I start another one. I do have the notes for it in my ideas folder, though.
