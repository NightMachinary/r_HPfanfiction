I'm 90% sure that's the premise of the story. I think it was a fire and he was locked in the cupboard so he died? Thank you!


** It could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5733024/1/Fire][Fire]] by Lucillia; it seems to match up with what you said. Unfortunately, it seems to have barely started before it was abandoned. linkffn(5733024)

  Vernon can learn to be decent, all it takes is the death of the Boy-Who-Lived and several decades to see the consequences unfold. Vernon goes back to prevent 8 year-old Harry from dying in a fire that Petunia set intending to get the boy into trouble.

** That's a pretty jacked up premise, I hope he dies in the end.

Edit: Go away irrational anger at poorly written characters, you'll only make me do something I'll regret...
