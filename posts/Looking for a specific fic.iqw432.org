I really don't remember the name nor the author. The fic was on fanfiction.net (not sure if it has in other pages) about harry potter time traveling in maruder* era and he adopts snape, sirius and remus. If I'm not mistaken he gos in that time by "Harrison Evanston" or something similar. There one near this, but it's already finished named back i go (where only snape was adopted), but it's not that one.

*Non English speaker, so I'm not sure if it's right


** linkffn(Erasing History)
