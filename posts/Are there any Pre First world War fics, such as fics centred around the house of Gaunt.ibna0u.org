** I haven't read the whole thing but Orders of Magnitude includes stuff from the Merlin era and the founding of Hogwarts, plus the Medieval ages, plus the present, plus the far future. It's a weird and disjointed book but definitely good in places. I don't remember anything in it about the House of Gaunt though.

** There was one about Loxias being tracked down by Arcus Gaunt and Livius Malfoy separately but for the life of me I can't remember its name. Maybe someone else can help.
