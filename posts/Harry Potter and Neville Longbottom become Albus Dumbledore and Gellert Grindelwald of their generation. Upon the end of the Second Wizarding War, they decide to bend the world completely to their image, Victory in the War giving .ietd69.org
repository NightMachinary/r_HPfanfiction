** I really like this prompt, but if I could just make a little suggestion, "What we do is for the Greater Good" may sound a bit too much like Grinderwald slogan (judging Krum reaction at the Lovegoods in DH, people have not forgotten).\\
Maybe Harry and Neville could use another seemingly nice slogan which could later be corrupted by their actions (especially if they follow the Dumbledore/ Grinderwald road with one of them regretting their action while the other commit atrocities). Something like "Never Again" or "For the Future".

*** I'm with you on the need for a new slogan. Grindelwald had the message of 'Greatest Good for the Greatest Number' so it could be flipped around with 'Least Evil to the Least Number' instead.

It makes sense, while also being different from his slogan. 'For the Least Evil' or something like that.

** I have always liked the idea of Harry having a Dumbledore/Grindelwald type relationship that ends in a legendary duel, but I can't envision Neville in any iteration of this prompt. For this specific one, I think Hermione is perfect, either as the protagonist or antagonist.

*** With Hermione and their respective backstories and personalities I think Hermione would be the one easier to fit into a Dumbledore mold in fighting from within the system for equality while Harry grows disillusioned with the governments and starts a revolution. Though then again if it is regarding the Statute of Secrets Hermione would be the most likely to try abolishing it while Harry fights to keep it and maybe even making the divide greater.

**** I don't see why Harry would fight to keep the Statue of Secrecy. He literally got emotionally abused for a decade, and absoutely hated his relatives and going back to Privet Drive.

I can see a timeline where Harry grows so bitter and frustrated by the divide that he wants to break the Secrecy because of the injustice he faced. Heck, I could even see him agree with Grindelwald's speech of "/A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter! A law that demands that we conceal our true nature! A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear lest we risk discovery! I ask you, Madam President--- I ask all of you---who does this law protect? Us? Or Them?/" because he himself was hidden.

**** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  Statute of Secrets
#+end_quote

Yes. My thought was that they'd start out trying to breach the gap between the two worlds. Hermione grows increasingly more violent against wizarding obstinacy all the while Harry is learning about the wizarding world and the Potters specifically. In the end it would completely break with Hermione trying to destroy the statute so as to give muggles access to magical things, specifically medicine, and Harry being wholly against it.

Or, as someone suggested on DLP once, you could have a Harry who is exhausted of fighting while Hermione wants to keep going. He supports her from the wings, but then her mind begins to wander to the Unbeatable Wand.
