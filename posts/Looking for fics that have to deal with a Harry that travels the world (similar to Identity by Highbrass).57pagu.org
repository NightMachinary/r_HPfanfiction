I really liked the concept of having Harry do stuff outside of Britian and travel the world but there doesn't seem to be many. I don't care about any pairings but if there is any would prefer it to not be ginny or hermione. I would prefer longer ones but i'll take what you give me.


** Make a Wish linkffn(2318355) is the only one I can really think of. Harry is convinced he's going to die and decides to travel the world after seeing a brochure from the Make a Wish Foundation. It's slightly crackish in humor but nothing too out there, IMO. It takes Harry's luck to extremes.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** A Long Journey Home meets your criteria, after a fashion. Bungle in the Jungle also involves a fair amount of world travel.

** Draco664 trilogy [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice Potter]] trilogy includes some travelling in the sequels. It's a post-OttP story, where Harry gets tossed out of Hogwarts, due to trying the cruciatius in the ministry. Features angry!Harry. Pretty entertaining (but last fic is abandoned).
