Does anyone have any fics where Hermione gets in trouble because she doesn't keep her damn cat from trying to murder Ron's rat? I give zero fucks about the fact that Scabbers is Pettigrew. Hermione should have damn well gotten several lectures over not keeping control of her massive, ugly cat. And canon never acknowledges this because of course Hermione was Right All Along and totally justified in her shit pet ownership abilities. So would love to see a fic or two where Hermione actually receives some sort of comeuppance for it, whether it's a chewing out or an actual penalty of some sort.


** A hundred approved predator pets roaming the school, but it's Hermione's fault Ron does absolutely nothing to protect the unapproved prey besides keeping it in his pocket. If anyone is a shit pet owner, it's Ron letting an animal as dirty as a rat have free reign in a school full of animals that eat rats.

*** Rats aren't particularly dirty. But yeah, it's funny that Ron brought his pet rodent to a castle full of cats and owls and somehow it's Hermione who's the horrible pet owner.

** Hogwarts officially allows students to bring cats. I assume many do. That castle must be overrun with cats. Cats keeping the rat population down is generally considered a good thing.

If Ron wants to keep a pet that was not on the approved pet list, he's responsible for protecting it from pets that were on the approved list.

*** I just realised - Scabbers never left the protection of the boys' dormitory, except when Ron himself went out of Hogwarts - like back to his house. And the other boys didn't have problematic pets. Harry's owl didn't try to eat Scabbers even once.

Hell, Mrs. Norris never even went near Scabbers, and it's Filch's pet with unlimited access everywhere.

But who decided to bring something that proved times and times again to be dangerous to Scabbers? That's right, Hermione. Hermione never tried to stop Crooshank from coming to the Boys' dormitory. In fact, she encouraged it.

Cats are pets. You need to teach them where they are allowed to go and where they aren't. By violating the sanctity of the boys' dormitory, Hermione effectively told her cat "it's okay to go on there". By never punishing her cat for attacking Scabbers, she effectively told him Scabbers was fair game.

What could Ron do, then? Buy a cage to hold his pet rat? With what money? The Weasleys are poor as heck. Send Scabbers back home? Then why have a pet in the first place?

Ron did protect Scabbers. Not to the fullest of his abilities - but then, he wouldn't think about his wants or his pet's wants.

â€‹

Furthermore, owls eat cats. Should Hermione buy a cage for her cat? Owls are on the "authorised pets" list. Or maybe, it's Harry who should cage Hedwig. Hmmm, decisions, decisions...

**** If only Harry Potter took place in a world where you could transfigure any old random piece of junk into a perfect rat cage for absolutely free. Woe is Ron, whatever can he do. There aren't even any professional Transfigurers around he could ask to do it for him if he was so concerned for Scabbers' health.

****** It is actually. It is fanon that it wears off. According to JKR herself, it affects an item down to the molecular structure itself.

For example, the Ministry attempted to reverse the Transfigurations on the Quintapeds but were unsuccessful so they remain transformed to this very day. There is an entire branch of Transfiguration dedicated to the reversal of transformations. A properly transfigured item (such as one done by an expert such as McGonagall or Dumbledore) would last forever unless intentionally reversed by someone.

Conjuration is temporary, but transfiguration is forever.

*** Which is fine until Hermione's cat is attacking an animal that is known to be another student's pet. Even worse that it's the pet of her close friend. Sure, keeping the castle rat population down is good, but so is having boundaries, regardless of the pet species. She did not keep control of her pet.

#+begin_quote
  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.

*** Oooh, I have read this one and I love how Hermione's imbecilic response is to rat out Harry's map. I wish the author had done a follow-up dealing with the fallout. Thanks for posting it!

** So, let me pose a simple question to you: if Hermione's a bad owner who's taking every class, as well as trying to make sure one of her closest friends doesn't end up dead, what does that make Ron?

He blames her for her cat's "actions" when, if you look at any type of animal attack save for maybe a spider and lizards, would require blood to be on more than just one sheet, as well as fur from the animal attacked, yet there wasn't. Just ginger cat hairs. Perhaps he was just looking for a reason to blame Hermione.

On top of that, this is when Hermione is also doing all of the work on Buckbeak's case. Ya know, to help a friend. Harry at least has the excuse of Quidditch, but Ron? He doesn't have the excuse of "too much homework" or Quidditch.

Both are at fault, but Ron's actions towards Hermione in the book like, I don't know, getting upset that she would rather have Gryffindor miss out on the Quidditch Cup in an attempt to keep her friend safe, is damning to the whole Scabbers thing. It's a two way street where if Ron wasn't an asshole, you'd have a valid claim. As it is, you trying to blame one person when the other--in the eyes of others at least--valued a broomstick over his friends' life
