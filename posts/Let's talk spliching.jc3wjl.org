So, today I read the last chapter of "Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay" by Saphroneth (which by the way has some of my favorite worldbuilding/magic theory) and within the story, the author posed that splinching was a disassociation between the body and whatever was left behind which if I understand correctly by comparison with canon is much less dangerous if no less traumatizing.

In canon, splinching is leaving behind something while apparating (disapparating?) from clothing and hair to flesh or muscle, in the movies we see that it causes actual injury and bleeding (which poses the question, has ever been someone that got beheaded by spliching?)

This comparison has become a brainworm for me, I like Saphroneth idea it makes sense to me and sustains the prevalence of Apparition as a common means of transport as it risks injury and the Statute of Secrecy to some degree that is deemed acceptable as opposed as a skill that is that and potentially lethal...which might explain the use of things like the Knight Bus and Floo...

What you all think?


** From the books it sounds like an embarrassing inconvenience at most. It talks about "leaving behind" a thumb or a leg or whatever, not having it severed or ending up mutilated and urgently needing to stop bleeding.

I interpreted it as if you'd forgotten to pull all your pieces through after you, but they're all still attached in every meaningful way /other/ /than/ being where you usually keep them. And since you've already finished apparating, you have to pop back real quick and pick up whatever you forgot. It seems to be the simplest model that fits what's shown in the books, and it explains why wizards think about splinching in much the same way that you'd see accidentally leaving your keys behind when leaving the house.

The movies...playing it up for shock and gore in the movies is far from the first case where they took things in weird directions there. I'm kind of surprised they didn't end up with constant ridiculous Evil Dead style gore spurts with students standing around laughing.

*** As I recall, Ron was badly injured by splinching in the book, not just the movie.

** I feel that it should be noted that under normal circumstances, the risk of splinching is so remote as to be considered acceptable by the general populace; and that it's only really a concern when a wizard or witch is first learning the spell (Susan Bones left her entire leg behind when she first attempted it in the Great Hall, for example), or during times of great stress, like when Ron left behind strips of flesh from his shoulder and arm when he, Harry and Hermione had to flee the Death Eater ambush.

*** That sounds reasonable, although I believe that by enhancing the risks involved other means of transport become more important, It can be argued that the floo remains prevalent as a close replacement to what muggles get from landline telephones. Which leaves the Knight bus and portkeys the first might be exclusive to London and the latter for longer distances.

However, if the risk is as minimal as you suggest then most adult wizards would mos likely bypass/ignore any other means of transport on a regular basis because they quite literally can pop in and out to deal with whatever in person. Of course, then the limits of apparition might fall into distance and power exertion but that is more nebulous IMO

**** You can change up the worldbuilding to impact the choice of transport. I'm not saying the following is true for canon tho.

1. Most wizard houses have basic wards (or it is considered disrespectful) to stop apparition close to the house, so it could be simpler for people with regular destinations like work or shops to take the Floo. Therefore receiving new guests or arriving uninvited requires apparition

2. Apparition is unsafe while drunk/intoxicated so young wizards out clubbing take the Knight bus home

3. Portkeys have to be planned ahead and are regulated, so they are used more for big events or for underage wizards.

4. Brooms are for exercise and play, or for exploring the local area. Though they would have been more common in the past as I think the other technologies (Hogwarts Express included) would be more recent developments.
