** An actual Orwellian ministry would be fucking terrifying, given the existence of memory charms.

Orwellian doesn't just mean constant surveillance and authoritarianism. The government in 1984 straight-up reshaped the reality of their subjects on a semi-daily basis to suit whatever their current need was.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/][Knowledge is Useful]], linkffn(8215565) -- All ministry/wizengamot members including Dumbledore are bound by enslaving oaths ... but the story quickly gets weird.

*** I really liked the nature of oaths and the corrupt, self serving Ministry in this one. It did get a little weird toward the middle, though.

**** I think it makes more sense to think of it as three separate vignettes about "power" -- the ministry, living magic, and magic law -- rather than one contiguous story.

**** I thought that the author mixed up who the good guys and the bad guys were. Usually, when you have one side that has a small number of people endowed by an accident of birth to rule over the rest with force and terror and the other side consists of a large number of ordinary people who try to keep these tyrants in check, the second side are the good guys.

***** The issue is that those "ordinary people" ended up being death eaters or sympathizers.

It was poorly thought out though.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628): In my one shot, the Ministry is a far far more effective institution and Harry is maintaining an iron grip on Magical Britain's security forces. Their DA Network, enforced through magical contracts, includes about 15% of the country's population and is the almost equivalent of a permanent ruling party.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
