** The other end of the vanishing cabinet was busted, so an argument could be made that nothing would happen.

***** No one blame you. I have seen fanfics describing it as broken and stored in RoR even in first year. One had even paid a lot of attention on many of the details and still made this mistake.

** I think the cabinet Harry hid in was supposed to be the vanishing cabinet. I mean, I'm sure it wasn't at the time, but when Rowling later came up with the idea, I think she intended for that cabinet to retroactively become a vanishing cabinet. Of course, it really doesn't matter much either way.

Realistically, nothing of much interest would really happen. Harry would suddenly find himself in Hogwarts, where he would probably be able to find a teacher who would take him back to Diagon Alley.

*** I actually suspect that Rowling did intend for the cabinet in Borgin & Burke's to be the paired vanishing when writing Chamber since that's the book that introduces us to the Hogwarts one. Like you said, it doesn't really matter, but given the level of thought that went into the instruction and development of the vanishing cabinet as a plot device, I think it's more likely she already had the pair down too.

The second half your comment has me wishing someone would write this scene of 12 year old Harry stumbling around an empty Hogwarts in the summer. You could build on it, so that when he thinks a away in POA, he intends to go to the cabinet to live in Hogwarts for the summer

**** JK hinted a few times prior to release of book 6 that something insignificant in book 2 will play a big part in book 6. While you could say something similar about the diary, the diary was in no way insignificant in book 2.

*** I don't think he would get there. With the Hogwarts cabinet broken he would probably be stuck in a limbo. (Sounds nightmarish, honestly.)

The Death Eaters could use it only after Draco fixed the one in the Room of Requirement.

*** I'll have to double check Cannon, but I /think/ Malfoy was threatening Borgin into keeping it on hand, so that Borgin would not get rid of it or sell it. The one in Hogwarts was eventually broken in Second Year, but I think the one at B&B was intact.
