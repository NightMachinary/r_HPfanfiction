** I feel like roleplaying as underage students is suggestive content that involves minors, even if the roleplayers are over 18.

*** It is. It's a bunch of pedophiles getting together to act out their fantasies about 13 year olds having sex and excusing it because "ROLEPLAY!!!".

*** I mean, the books have suggestive content between minors... children don't suddenly become sexual at whatever arbitrarily their country chooses...

**** The books hardly have "suggestive content." They're absolutely rated PG.

They have kissing, between 15 year olds. That's really not the same as "suggestive content" and RPGing a 13 year old who can be asked for "sexual favours."

** This is basically gross. If you want to do sexual RPG, role play an adult wizard or witch fgs.
