Why is a blood traitor and what do you have to do get get the title? Like why are the Weasleys class as blood traitors? While your family is class as one can you get pass it?

**** Not technically. Molly and Arthur both come from long lines and are magically strong while producing strong children as well and they are Purebloods. So having a long and strong line does not mean that they had Muggles introduced, it just means that they didn't participate in as much inbreeding as the rest of the Purebloods. So Lily may have been the only Muggleborn since wasn't James a Pureblood? Meaning he would have had no Muggles in his ancestors.

****** I don't remember if JKR ever specified, but I know she drew inspiration from the Nuremburg Laws that denoted Jewish people during WW2. So having just 1 of 8 great grandparents being Muggle/Muggleborn would have them as Pure, as long as the rest of them were Halfbloods or more. However 2 of the 8 or more would mean they are not Halfblood.

However that is just theory since she never confirmed. However we do know that just the presence or lack thereof of muggleblood doesn't dictate how strong you are.

****** I like the idea that some Purebloods claim that to be Pureblood means there is /no/ Muggle blood in their ancestry. Obviously there must be otherwise the family would have died out due to interbreeding, but each family doctors their records and think that they are the only family doing it.

#+begin_quote
  “- His family was not sacred twenty-eight; as far as purity went, Pansy was quite sure they could only show proof of wizarding ancestry up to four generations. Within the right circles, that was practically a half-blood.”
#+end_quote

That was from the fic Coven. I reckon that some Pureblood families are snobby about it and strict with who can call themselves a Pureblood whereas others take a more relaxed view, like that two magical parents is enough. So maybe there is no canon definition of a Pureblood because they're not even sure within universe.

** I believe it has to do with not only being sympathetic to the causes of Muggles and Muggleborns but to actively protect them. Arthur manages to pass a bill called "The Muggle Protection Act" which blood purists found offensive.

Harry may be friends with Muggleborns but doesn't really seem to care much about the blood stuff. However his great grandfather who was member of the Wizengamot arguing in favor of the wizards protecting their Muggle neighbors during WW1 resulted in the Potters being excluded from the list of pureblood families (the Sacred Twenty Eight) despite the Potters being purebloods.

In practical terms, it's "I can't insult your actual /bloodline/ but I want to throw a pureblood-ideology related slur at you anyway". See also, 'race traitor'.

** Tbh I don't think it's ever explicitly said. There are inferences that can and have been made. However in JKR canon it's never explained. Kinda like we never see this wizard culture that purebloods are so defensive over. So they dress different and use magic. Is that it?

*** Are Purebloods ever defensive over wizarding culture in canon? Obviously they argue for Muggleborns to not be allowed in their society but I don't think they ever state that it's because of ‘wizarding culture'. It's a popular fanon idea though so I wonder if there is any canon backing to it.

**** There is not really (see below), but take in mind we also never get such a dialogue. Malfoy gets short taunts in, but otherwise, all lengthy discussions we have are on the Dumbledore side of the team. Whatever the opinion of the other side, for us, it's limited to "it's nonsense". It appears as if Harry is wrapped in a bubble, and regardless of whether or not the world's the same beyond it -- which is perfectly possible, IMO even likely (no "Wizarding Culture" etc.) --, that's the origin of all the typical FF.

The closest we get is Draco's comment at Madam Malkin's:

#+begin_quote
  “I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?”
#+end_quote

That's the abridged version of the argument, so you can make a case for it in FF, but I wouldn't say it's conclusive.

** From A traditionalist pureblood perspective, the term blood traitor probably meant a wizard who acted unbecoming of his heritage,be it from their lack of wealth,sympathies to outsiders (the muggleborns) , disregard of cultural traditions, advocating in favour of their leaders(muggleborn and magical creatures)et cetera. The Weasley family for instance possesses no noteworthy influence,are poor and are interested in their leaders(muggles and muggleborn).The Potter Family in canon however is well respected ,probably rich and have the boy who defeated the dark lord and hence it is political suicide to call them blood traitors.

** Canon doesn't give any clear definition about "what" is a Blood Traitor, and I personally doubt there are any. It is just an insult used by extremist to brand someone as "one of the bad ones", without any justification needed, and what is a Blood Traitor probably vary from family to family (if not individual to individual).

I could think of several insults currently used the same way everywhere in the World, but for the sake of not creating conflict, I will rather use an historical one. Being called a "Blood Traitor" is pretty much the equivalent of being called a "Socialist" or a "Commie" during the Cold War USA.

Proofs and justifications are not needed, and there is nothing the victim can do that would "truly" erase the accusation. If the accused has "moderate" views (or rather less extrem ones), then he is truly one and must be purged. If the accused is an extremist ("More Royalist than the King"), then he may be a spy and should still be purged.

Since the insult is a Political Tool, there is no clear rule about how a member of one of these families must be treated. If I take Percy as an example, who stood by the Ministry until near the very end. Someone who appreciate him may say that "/He is one of the good ones, that managed to wash a part of his family shame/", but that doesn't mean that someone like Malfoy won't come and say "/Look at him trying to act like a Pureblood. Once a blood traitor, always a blood traitor/".

​

Basically, the insult "Blood Traitor" is, like the "Sacred 28" (and basically anything from the blood purist) is just a stupid idea build on a foundation of lies and bigotry. It's just a "catch-all term" used by Bigots to excludes people they don't like from their private club.
