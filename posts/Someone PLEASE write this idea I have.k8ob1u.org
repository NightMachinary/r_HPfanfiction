Alright folks here is the idea that has been in my head for WEEKS so I figured I'll post it here and see if anyone is interested. So I'm not that big on fics with the main character not being Harry. I'm fine with OCs and SIs or even something like hermione or luna so there's that. Now here's my thought, Harry(or oc) has some type of thing for expanded trunks early on and thinks "let's step it up a notch" and goes for pocket dimensions. Now this can either be self study or a family magic or just and affinity for space magic IDC. Now he gets a snake familiar early on but don't forget my girl hedwig she's number one. Just some regular snake could be a garden snek or a cobra I don't mind. While experimenting with Pocket Dimensions (PD for short) he discovers he can make something similar to a pokeball for his snek.

In tattoo form.

So he has snek tattoo but it's actually a PD on his body and can be called and talk to at anytime. Now he has been getting all these ideas from muggle books and thinks to himself "What self respecting wizard doesn't have a wizards tower" so he decides he needs his own isengard or something. But ol snackface is after him so he needs it protected. What better place than on his body. So He makes his own tower however you want. His own magic, goblin or dwarf contract, House elves whatever. He upgrades the shit out of it wards, a time dilation room, huge semi sentient library, RoR, indoor farm and animal reserve, etc etc. An army of House elves for everything. He can connect it to any worlds ley lines for rituals and extra power. Then he makes it a separate dimension and instead of a tardis or something he has it tattooed on him all he has to do is pump magic into it and state a pass phrase and have some rules like it needs a least 2 leylines intersecting for prolonged use. Can't be used by himself unless it is placed and locked. Other people and being can be inside and since it's a different dimension it's technically only one person travelling so less power restriction.

Now during first year his snake senses the basilisk some how or just smells it, you do whatever you want but you get that bad bitch as your familiar also. IDC how you do it and IDC how you explain more than one familiar but you get it. Bam badass basilisk tattoo that covers a good portion of his body. He freaks out realizing he Is running out of space so he must be picky from now on who is actually a familiar.

Alright we got the main parts down time for some power levels and titles. I enjoy OP characters they don't have to be thanos snapping level but definitely can woop most ass. Give him some armor with enchantments and he can hold his own physically some what but he is a glass cannon mostly. Alot of MoD stories have him either able to respawn or instant regen, do you boo boo just don't make him god like. Another thing with MoDs they never use the stone!! Summon some god damn spirits and LEARN!! Ancient magic long lost to time, things modern wizards believe as fact are not actually real, if flamel is dead and you wifey will die while you are gonna live until the universe disperses ask how to make a fucking Philosophers stone. MERLIN, THE FOUNDERS, ANYONE!!!!

Sorry that always bothers me, ANYWAY, I enjoy some good romance. There can or cannot be lemons I really don't care either way. There is plenty out there if I'm feeling randy. But I good romance is always awesome especially if it's believable and they correct each other's mistakes. Like alot of Harmony fics, he Is the practical user and power house, she is the theory junkie and precision. You need that mountain gone harry's your guy, you have to vanish a small price of shrapnel from this guy's brain hermione can sneeze it away. Now don't get me wrong there are other matches depending on your MC. I always enjoy a good insane waifu, doesn't have to be bellatrix but her mannerisms toward moldybutt is always fun to read to me. Or as I have always said Luna best girl.

Now the last big thing I can think of is the HP world can be boring af to ready post Hogwarts imo. I have yet to find a decent one where it's purely HP and not a crossover with a good story after graduation. So I love crossovers. No this is not me looking for post Hogwarts fics. I don't like them. But a good crossover is always welcome and what I hope someone who writes this will go for.

With his own PD home he can go ANYWHERE he wants and have a safe place. A fidelius is all it takes. Go to lord of the rings and show them what magic REALLY is, show gandalf how a wizard is supposed to live. In style with his own grand wizard tower with giants serpents, dragons, unicorns, and any other magical being you can think of frolicking on your front lawn. A never ending library for your hot librarian gf. Oh is that an army of darkness heading for your fortress let me introduce my titanic fucking murder snek. Oh you have the one ring? I have the one wand and the one stone and the one cloak eat my magical ass you pink eye MFer!!! Go to inheritance and get you own fucking talking dragon. Learn a new magical language, fuck angela because shes fucking awesome and needs company other than a werecat. Learn to forge a dragon riders sword and reforge the sword of gryffindor into Stabby McStabface.

Go to avatar and learn spirit bending because the elements are already your bitch. Pimp slap ozai because fuck that guy.

Go to Marvel because the mcu is too small. Meet Dr Strange or the ancient one. Learn more magic and get a dope artifact. Depending on your MC be a new doctor doom or save the mutants(I prefer a good or grey guy. Not into evil MC's really). Make Nick Fury even MORE paranoid. Beat a god of magic and mischief at his own game, your a fucking son of a marauder damnit. Pick up thor's hammer and then give it back with a "meh mines better" like nothing happened. Have tea with the watcher, battle galactus, fix Logan's memory, decide dumbledore shouldn't be the only one with a phoenix and yours is a hot red head.

Go to twilight, knock out then shrink Edward, put him on a mithril ring and propose to your hot goth gf because you went to Jared and got that big diamond she always wanted.

Literally anything. PLEASE! I'm begging you people to make this a reality. You don't even have to do everything I said just god please some of it. Especially the Edward ring.

One last thing I have nothing against it but I'm not into slash. It can be in a side character relationship I don't mind that but I like to immerse myself with the MC and I just don't swing that way. Single relationship, poly(like 2 females max). Add a sister or brother bond in their whatever.

If someone does end up trying this tag me in this post please I will be forever grateful. Love you all except you degenerates who put pineapple on pizza. ♥️♥️♥️

EDIT: I just thought of this. That fic where harry goes to mcu and creates an island paradise for magical creatures something like Armageddon dimensional something. I've read it twice can't remember the name. But in that fic they use the "faith" power where he becomes stronger as more people believe in him and basically make him a god. You can so do that too but with the PD tower you can make your own Asgard type deal. Where before it was just like a few miles in each direction of land and then the tower but you can slowly have it grow without him even noticing at first. Like he has a mountain range at the border in a circle so it's hard to notice at first but as he becomes stronger and/or he gathers more faith his dimension is slowly become better, stronger, more real. Non-magical animals start to pop up he didn't be by in. And by the time the story is coming to a close he has his only personal planet in his dimension soaked in magic and life, He brings in races like goblins, dwarves, elves, etc. Keep them from going extinct. Magical animals and beings from different worlds. Like the inheritance dragons with the HP "dragons" (wyverns). An alien race about to be killed? Pop them sum bitches in there. And you can add a water system like Baboo has in star wars with underwater tunnels going all through the planet. Find atlantis before it sinks in an AU universe or just back in time and settle them on your planet. Bring the giant eagles from LotR. See where I'm going with this? I hope so. It sounds dope.

Adding silly stipulations like this to a writing prompt is only gonna turn people off

If you're going to have rules about the type of pairing, you'd better off making a commission

** The fic you describe in your edit sounds like post apocalyptic potter from a parallel universe by burnable it has harry going to the mcu setting up an island paradise for magical creatures and building a new asgard. At least that's what it sounds like

******* Don't get me wrong I loved em I just like action too and there were just large gaps between action scenes. That they FELT like fillers but they really weren't. And I agree harry and Nat was a wonderful pairing. And I'm happy with how they handled the nymphs with xera(that's correct). I just wish they didn't stick with the mcu and the marvel movies. There is so much they could have done in the comics. Like galactus is so much more powerful than thanos sans the stones. Squirrel girl would have been a wonderful addition(sisterly) and luna would have a friend. He could have curb stomped early doom and showed him what real magic was. The hell dimension with mephisto. There was just so much potential not used but by the time they got toward the ending there wasn't much that could stop him with his battery ring.
