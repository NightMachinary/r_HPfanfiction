I keep looking for it, and nothing turns up. There was an order meeting, and Harry was there for some reason. Snape and molly started saying he shouldn't be there, snape saying he was spoiled, and Harry made snape look at his memories of abuse from the Dursley's and then was super apologetic and angry at dumbles for leaving him there. Please, what's that fic?


** There is more than one of these. The only one I can remember is 'Harry Potter and the Sisters Black' by oldwolf. Still available on AFF. Story is smut filled and Harry/Harem.
