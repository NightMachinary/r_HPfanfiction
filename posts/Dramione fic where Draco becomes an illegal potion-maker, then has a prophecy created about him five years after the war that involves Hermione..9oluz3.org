The title sounds super cringe but one of my online friends, whose FF username is Femina Serpens, has continued writing (in my opinion) her best fanfic. She lurks here so I hope she sees this.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11551157/1/The-Prophecy#end][The Prophecy]]

Draco decides to disappear from society altogether and gets roped into being an illegal potioneer by Theodore Nott. Hermione is in law enforcement and is cornered by Draco at a party to find she's in his prophecy, and they team up to figure out what the prophecy means. It's ongoing right now, seven chapters so far.

She wrote and didn't finish a story years ago called Head Versus Heart which has hundreds of reviews, it's one of the fics that got me into fan fiction. When I asked her about continuation, she said she'd been in an abusive relationship and developed a drinking problem so she couldn't finish and didn't want to after so many years of absence. She's one person who talked to me a lot when I was going through a hard time even though we've never met physically.

I just want to promote her because I think she's a pretty good writer and feel like she deserves more recognition.
