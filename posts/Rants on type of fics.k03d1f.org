Well the title more or less explains it. I want to read your rants about certain type of fics you absolutely Hate.

Like say Severitus, Mpreg, A/B/O you get the point


** I HATE au rewrites (if u could call them that) basically it's when a fic its labeled whole series au, but the changes dont start until the 5th year for example.

It's just so TEDIOUS to read the same things over, and over again. It's even more terrible when the description it's really lovely and interesting, but u dont KNOW when the changes start so ur just sitting there and scrolling.

(edit bc I wanted to recommend a fic)

Its honestly a bummer, especially because I LOVE AU's- particularly the ones that focus on expanding the world and wizarding customs- I dont even mind the Lord!Potter ones. My favorite fic series rewrite is The Sacrifices Arc by LightningOnTheWave- it's really lovely if u dont mind the slash and heavy exposition :))

*** Ok this is not an AU fic but its divergent and I seriously cannot stop recommending this every chance i get!

The Debt of Time by shayalonnie

The changes don't start til canon book 7 but the story starts right there where the changes happen so it feels like an AU a little. Its 153 epic chapters that end better than the series itself. I can't recommend it enough!

/this is not a spoiler because its basically a rewording of the summary/ It starts after Dumbledore dies before the kids go home for the summer break. It follows the big plot that happens in canon but with some significant differences to the outcomes because Hermione figures out how to bring Sirius back from the dead.

Its got a smutty version on ao3 and not so smutty version on fanfic so whichever you prefer although the sexy version is absolutely glorious!!!

There is time travel but it is done very well and sticks to the canon of the time we are taken to perfectly. No time rules are broken. Everything is explained by the end. There are some interesting couple pairings but nothing like death eater/order member or adult/child.

Bonus #1 theres a podcast that reads a chapter a week called Firewhisky and Honey

Bonus #2 there is a small business candle company called starcrossed sundries that has candles and wax melts that specifically designed them smell like the characters from this story and some locations too. I have all the scents now and I'm going to do a reread where I sniff the candle while a person is involved and feel like I'm actually there.

Bonus #3 the podcast has coupon codes for discounts on the candle website!!!

You can write most exquisite stories featuring realistically portrayed 11 y.olds if you had the talent and the perseverance for it.

** I hate fics that suddenly decide that death eaters, especially Draco or Snape are good guys without putting the work in. Given how shallow characters are in canon, it is fine to show how factors and pressures which Harry doesn't know about force them to play roles/compromise their principles, and can make excellent stories with interesting character development. However there are too many stories that try to pretend that the enthusiastic members of a genocidal terrorist murder cult were actually cuddly on the inside all along in canon.

It is not just that the dissonance breaks immersion, but what it says about the writers. There are a terrifying number of the FF community who apparently think that wishing someone dead/part of a slave cast = cute sexual tension. That dressing in black, sneering and being edgy just means they want a hug, regardless of all their other crimes. It is the 50 shades of grey thing of actually encouraging abusive relationships.

*** I mean, /nobody/ is evil all the time. It's perfectly fine to write death eaters being nice to each other or their families, as it is fine to have Voldemort be nicer to Harry if there's a reason for it. What's not fine is pretending that, because they're nice at times, they're not evil. Not only is it annoying to read, but, outside of a heavy, in-depth AU, justifying death eater crimes also severely detracts from the story. But sadly, most authors just wanna rush to get their self-insert Harry railed by Draco.

*** As soon as a Slytherin Harry story jumps to Snape thinking “maybe this kid isn't too bad” I check out.

1. I prefer to dislike Snape

2. If he isn't mean and aloof then that's not his character. I'd believe it more if he traded places with Lily and she was the potions master.

3. It removes a lot of the tension when Snape is caring. Not just fanon stuff like fixing the scars of childhood abuse, but he needs to be an antagonist in books 1 and 3 at least.

4. Once Snape shows a glint of caring all the kids suddenly trust him completely, which I guess would happen but I hate it. They lose their feisty personalities. (Even Draco will suddenly have a surrogate father that cares more for him than his parents).

** I wouldn't say I hate them, but man, canon rehashing gets soooo oooold after a while. Let's just quote large sections of the book verbatim! Then, um, add in an OC to change a few lines, before getting back to everything happening exactly the same way it did in canon! And then let's have Harry make a discovery that should change everything, then go back to doing things exactly the way they happened in canon!

Until, you know, 400,000 words later, we finally get to the end, and everything happens. . . just. . . like. . . .canon. Except, with like three specific characters doing something slightly different, and no one dying, and the finale being what the author thinks it should have been, and different epilogue pairings.

​

Look. We don't need a full repeat of the saga to get to that. Just write a oneshot of the finale and we're good. Or do a series of snapshots of when things actually played out, y'know, at all different. guuuuuhhhhh

I've never really come across what you're describing, though it does seem really disturbing to write something where a thirteen-year-old acts three or four.

It would destroy her however. For all of Ginny's faults, she is a good person and that would utterly break the relationship. She wouldnt trust herself to be mad at Harry, and the relationship would spiral. And thats if Harry didnt find out.

She wouldnt do it frivolously. That is just stupid.

*** I once read a fic that portrayed a relationship in disrepair. Not actively toxic, nor is either of the partners portrayed as a bad person (misguided at worst). It was an interesting take because rarely do I see fics that portray relationships where there isn't really anything /wrong/ with one of them, but rather that they simply drifted apart, wanting different things. A breath of fresh air, so to speak.

Then in the last chapter, one of them cheated on the other. That made me very disappointed, because the author had a good thing going, and didn't need to remove one person's agency entirely that way. It wasn't even portrayed in an understandable way (alcohol + failing reiationship or similar -- it wouldn't justify it but it would make it understandable), but rather it came out of nowhere.

- Ginny is vilified horrendously for leaving, cheating
- Powerful Draco is fun but the story might not be balanced
- and death eater playing with teddies should be a head canon:
- while on one hand it softens the depiction of racists, on the other it humanizes them and shows that really alt right characters can be closer to home than you think
- are you implying Draco is fundamentally evil or that in some way or form Draco isn't shaped by his upbringing, like idk what you mean

I also dont like the idea of noncon stuff some of them are spreading. Also the fact that the system is taken from a study of wolves that isnt even true is just lingering in the back of my mind (read: screaming) and i cant focus on reading cuz of that.

Also: "my inner wolf/beast whatever raged iside me, it was telling me that he is MINE" this kind of bull is just no.

This combined with mpreg always makes me wonder why there are even women in the universe, since there is no biological need for them.

Head the tags of the fic as it is pretty intense in some sections.

The description of the r*pe is pretty intense. The focus of the scene is how the victim felt not on the assault. It leads straight into mentioned suicide attempt and hospitalisation (mention).

Sorry for the warnings but it's not a fic to read unprepared imo. The authors note for the chapter gives info on where to skip to to avoid the scene.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

**** It's incongruous diction. It doesn't fit the type of vocabulary and register that she would use, at her age, in her job, with the society that she lives in, and with her uptight-ish personality. "Figure out" is OOC because no way is McGonagall so laid back as to use such "common" (for lack of a better word) language.

Kinda difficult to explain. In French there's a difference between "langage soutenu" and langage familier". Most regular people in all languages speak in "langage familier" all the time, and only make an effort (i.e use "langage soutenu") when writing a dissertation or making a presentation in front of an audience or whatever - or teaching. But some always speak in langage soutenu no matter what. McGonagall, Dumbledore, Flitwick, Slughorn etc, without being posh, /are/ such people.

So that's where I'm comin' from.

** fanfics are there to explore often overlooked relationships or plot points which the author ignored but pairings which are completely illogical are absolutely stupid.

Why would Harry and Voldemort get together? He killed his parents and ruined his life. Why would Hermione and Bellatrix pair up? She tortured her and they are basically polar opposites in term of mindset.

Pairing a female character with literally any male character she had a partial conversation with is also absurd. Hermione gets paired with almost every deatheater..... why? Dolshov and Hermione, Hermione and Scabior. Like.... what?

*** This just made me think why I love Tomarry/Harrymort but absolutely despise Hermione/Bellatrix.

Most Harrymort fics I've read, they make Harry grey and not a bloody Gryffindor who views the world as Black vs White or Dark vs Evil. They also make Harry somewhat distant about his feelings about his parents. I mean, yeah, Voldemort killed them, but that's what happens in war. People die. There's also the fact that he never really met them, either. Most authors make it so that Harry more or less views their deaths as hearing about a distant relative or a random family dying. No real ties because he didn't /know/ them, but feeling bad because they died and other people are heartbroken about it. Most fics more or less reflect on their similar childhoods and play up Harry's abuse and hatred of his Muggle relatives.

And sure, it's highly unlikely that Harry would ever get with Voldemort, but that's the fun in it, isn't it? It's fanfiction, where we change canon however we want.

However, I still absolutely /despise/ fics that have Hermione/Bellatrix. Like, what? Bellatrix is an insane psychotic bitch who takes insane pleasure on murdering and torturing people, Muggles and Muggleborn in particular. So it makes absolutely /no sense/ to ship that bitch, who's /married by the way/, with Hermione, a /mudblood./ The only reason I see Harrymort different than that is because they're both half-bloods and people mostly make Voldemort insane because he split his soul and then they fix it somehow and he's sane again. Still a murderer, mind, but less hair-triggered and more into the politics of separating Muggles and witches and wizards because of his shit childhood. They make it so that's basically how Voldemort started out but he became more insane and falling away from his goals the more he tore up his soul.

You said it yourself it's fanfiction and changes are made for someone to enjoy is so I don't understand the hypocrisy of Harry/Voldemort gettin a pass but not Bellatrix/Hermione.

If we were morally judging ships and pairings then half of them wouldn't pass, along with those two collectively but accepting one pairing while judging other when both are messed up is kind of weird if I'm honest.

***** Oh no, canonly he totally is, I just meant the fics where his soul is somehow miraculously pieced back together or he absorbs some of his Horcruxes and is no longer psychotic and suddenly has some morals but is still his dark torturing self. Just... less blind rage and murder campaigns and more politics and stuff.

I think the reason I'm totally put off of Bellatrix/Hermione is because 1) I'm not really into femslash, 2) I'm pretty sure Bellatrix has always been a pureblood psychotic bitch whose ideals are very anti-Muggle/Muggleborn and she is in no way hypocritical, 3) she's married, and 4) there's a way where you can more or less explain Voldemort's actions because he was tearing apart his soul, had a pretty traumatic childhood, Dumbledore certainly didn't help (bashing is very much common in this ship), and you can make up a pretty convincing backstory that Voldemort most definitely does despise Muggles because of his childhood and his original campaign with the Knights of Walpurgis was some sort of political group that tried to limit Muggle contact with the wizarding world and trying to take magical children away from Muggles.

For the pairing to work, though, Harry has to be at least grey or a little dark, has to overlook his parents' death, and has to hate the Dursleys and agrees with Voldemort somewhat on the child issue, though not about just taking them away willy-nilly, but just the abused ones.

Also, I'm a weird person though I stand by my ideals that Harry and Voldemort could be together potentially (though definitely not in canon) and there is no way in hell that Bellatrix would ever lower herself to cheat on her husband and screw around with a Mudblood. (Hey, she's got to at least have some morals.) You've got to go through some crazy voodoo to somehow make the insane pureblood princess Bellatrix even consider screwing around with a Mudblood, let alone go against her family's teachings and her heritage. The only way I personally think that Harry/Voldemort works is because they have very similar childhoods and that they're both Muggle-raised and half-bloods.

I also completely agree that some pairings are simply not morally correct (and even illegal!) but I ship them anyway.

Hope you're having a nice day, too!

****** See, this is where I disagree particularly because of one thing you have said, which is that anyone can change canon to fit their own fanfic and world. Which is why I believe that any pairing could be explained including both Harry/Voldemort and Hermione/Bellatrix.

You used the “Voldemort absorbs his horcruxes back” trope, which is fair because when something is well written and planned it's probably gonna work regardless of how the characters were in canon. You can make a backstory for anyone including Bellatrix.

We don't know what drove her to her insanity, we don't know whether she was born this way and it was the House of Black family illness, if it was a trauma caused by her parents if there was any trauma to begin with. There's a lot of ways you could explain that. As for her growing up in a family with the pureblood opinions, in a way I see it like this - if you can write Dracos redemption about blood purity so can you anyone else's. The point is any pairing could be believable if written well.

I understand your reasons why you might not like a certain ship, god knows a don't like a lot of them, but saying you can't see a ship work while making similar excuses for another one that's just as bad is an absurd to me.

That said, I respect your opinion even if my own differs from yours.

******* True about Bellatrix. I suppose, for me, it's because I don't have much information on her in canon other than her being insane to base some of her character on. I suppose you could say the same for sane Voldemort, Blaise, Theo, Daphne, or anyone else, but I still can't possibly see Hermione shipped with her. I've seen fics where Bellatrix is pleasant enough, but I can't see her with Hermione or anyone other than her husband, really.

** It's not a hate but a strong dislike. I am not a big fan of harry/harem or harry multi whether that be with female, or male partners. I have read a few, but they never seem to have a good plot, and the relationships aren't even realistic. It is not my cup of tea, but I am not bashing others who like it. I am not going to go look for a harry/harem fic, but if you are going to write one, make the relationships real and with flaws, and not perfect. I get that it is fanfiction, but that doesn't mean that relationships should happen with little to no development before the pairings are confessing their love for each other.

** Probably the one that gets to me the most: Misspelled names.

The source is written for fucks sake. And Google exists too. If in doubt, whack it in a search and you'll get the correct spelling at the drop of a hat. And I don't mean the occasional letter in the wrong spot, but consistently using the wrong spelling of a name throughout the entire fic. The one I see the most is Lilly instead of Lily.

And this sort of ties in with the awful habit of giving Harry some bonkers long-form version of his name. When he is in court, the Minister himself refers to him as Harry James Potter. If the government trying to toss him in jail doesn't give him this long-form version, it doesn't exist. Harry is perfectly fine as a name. Stop stretching it out and calling him Hadrian and such.

By no means is this the pinnacle of writing. A lot of it is synopsis of cannon that can be skimmed, especially in the first chapter. Rereading it now, a lot of it is unrealistic, especially how quickly everything happens. The dialogue is choppy and the writing isn't the best, but it really does mean a lot to me (and possibly other lgbtq+ people) to have a story like this out there.

​

The only thing I would say is Mpreg usually excludes gender bending or body swapping or such. (so is a subset of Mr. Seahorse)

There are quite a few fun takes on this.

It can be a fun body horror piece, if you take it seriously in that missing parts will result in horrible outcomes.

There are also a few really good sci-fi pieces that have alien biology. Usually an alien race having biological males appear physiologically/culturally female and vice versa (usually with "Our race has the female inject the egg into the male during sex). Makes for good culture clash fics as well as making any cross-species romance get... problematic fast.

And hey, characters dealing with problems are what make good stories :).

​

Unfortunately most HP fics that deal with this are not interested in any of the in depth stuff, and it is simply used to get characters together / expose characters to a maternal role (because adoption doesn't exist apparently) and the like :(.

** Eh, I'll bite.

- Uncomfortable ships\\

Basically most fics that feature a romance between someone much older than the other, usually Sirius/Hermione, Snape/Hermione, Snape/Harry, etc. Bellatrix/Hermione and Lucius/Hermione are also getting more popular, which concerns me quite a bit. Oh, and let's not forget Tom Riddle/Harry (let alone Voldemort/Harry), which is usually written with tendrils of parasitism that make me feel very uncomfortable. I am on the fence about Harry/Tonks. The age difference makes me uncomfortable for in-Hogwarts fics but I feel like if the friendship started as it does in canon but the romance starts later, it could work. I just haven't yet found an actually good Honks story yet.

- Bashing\\

I do not like bashing. Even if it's a character that I don't like (Umbridge, for example), I hate bashing. It's lazy, and it inserts the author into the story as if they are a manipulative and vengeful god. If you want to villainise someone like Ron or Dumbledore, go ahead, but make it /good./ Don't just make them a card-carrying trope-filled one-note villain. For example, I /hate/ Umbridge with a passion, but that's not because she's a poorly written character in a poorly written story, but because she's a fantastically written character in a good story. So to see her get essentially tortured by the suddenly much more enterprising Hogwarts students is really uncomfortable and will make me drop a fic. It's why I rarely read Draco/Hermione, or Snape/Lily fics. The vast majority of them are full of bashing.

- Non-con smut, A/B/O, and any other fic that features power differences being wielded for sexual benefits\\

I don't think I need to say much on why I don't like this. It's not me being a prude, as I do enjoy erotica and smut, but I don't like forced slavery/removal of choice within the relationship. Most marriage law fics are like this. I honestly wouldn't mind reading an actually good marriage law fic, but so far I've not found a single one and given up on the trope. Note that this doesn't include dom/sub, as there is nothing whatsoever wrong with two consenting adults having a dom/sub relationship.

- Explicitly written underage smut, harems, and "sex god Harry"\\

Teenagers have sex. It's realistic, it happens a lot, and there is nothing wrong with writing about two teenagers having sex. However, when it gets very explicit, for example where the genitals of the underage characters are described in detail, it makes me very uncomfortable. I much prefer if the sex scene is focusing on the emotions of the sexual experience and the closeness of the characters and how they interact rather than describing in great detail what is going on physically. Harems are annoying because they usually aren't part of good stories, each woman in the harem has a character defined by loving Harry so much that they don't mind him cheating on them (and that's usually the extent of their character in these stories), and have a fundamental misunderstanding of how poly relationships actually work. I have friends that are essentially in a poly relationship, and it's nothing like any of the harem fics. Plus Harry is usually a "sex god" with a nine-inch penis (when flaccid), and let me tell you, grotesquely large penises are not fun nor erotic for the vast majority of people that are attracted to people that have penises. It's just ridiculous and far from erotic.

- Excessive references of Muggle media\\

Let me copy a comment I made a few weeks ago on this sub:

#+begin_quote
  It's one thing to mention that Harry goes to see a muggle movie during the summer. It's another to have Harry reading and giving out books like /Lord of the Rings/ and whatever to all his friends. /Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay/ is particularly awful about it. I constantly have to skip over entire sections of the fanfic because it's just Harry's musings about whatever book series he's reading at the time. It's uninteresting and adds absolutely nothing to the story.
#+end_quote

To add onto that, I like to read about the wizarding world and its culture, not 90s Muggle Britain and its culture. The Wizarding World is, after all, a secret, and the majority of non-pureblood wizards and witches leave the Muggle world behind.

Dumbledore, only not necessarily proven right as he is in canon. For instance, Voldemort is death but Dumbledore places Harry at the Dursley's even when every death eater is round up. Or Dumbledore kills people he sees as threats to Harry, but gets into legal trouble for it, and gets a bit... worse after dealing with Dementors for a long time, making good on his claim he ‘could escape, of course ‘. Then /he thinks/ he wasn't impacted by it, but the rest would see him slip back into his greater good days, only with a different target. Alternatively, Harry finds out just how much was planned and it includes horrifying things like the disaster at the Ministry (not necessary Sirius' death tho), and the dementors on the Quidditch field (to encourage Harry to ask lessons), stuff like that, and then Dumbledore finds out and points out nobody would ever believe Harry...

The third point is more general, and includes the power dynamic issues not covered by the first, such as those erupting from politics and classism/racism.

** The rant I won't get into, because that flame has long since burnt through many of my nerves is summarized in my flair.

But one thing I'm kinda constantly salty about whenever I hear it is fics in which the muggles (or wizards) go to war against the other side, and - guess what - the muggles always win because the wizards are written like they're sharing a singular braincell with each other. The only one with a singular braincell there is the author, because they can't be arsed to think of ways their non-preferred side could reasonably win.

bUt mUH NukEs!!!!!111!!!

Fuck off. Nukes, rockets, tanks, surveillance - fuck all that. You nuke wizards, they fiendfyre your continent. Thats if you ever get to the point of nukes. Chances are your president/prime minister/King or Queen are already replaced with an Auror on a constant diet of Polyjuice.

There are so many caveats, so many win conditions you need to introduce to give the muggle side a modicum of a chance to win, that it gets to a point where its more or less "the mortals win, because the gods didn't bother". Or the gods were written as Oblivion NPCs - that seems to be the prefered alternative for shite plots and mugglewanks.

"But they have guns!" I hear them shout. Yeah well, every wizard and witch gets a weapon of mass destruction at the age of eleven - that also doubles as a mindcontrol device, reality bending thingmaker and casual "fuck physics, lmao" stick.

"But the muggleborns would allie with the muggles!" First off: All of them? Really? /Really?/ Take your average being of cosmic power and ask them if they would help the not so awesome population win a war against the other beings of awesome cosmic power. Suddenly its a war of the awesome beings, and the mere non-magical animals may now please remain silent and prepare the throne for whoever wins afterwards. Because /fuck taking orders from non-demigods/. And of course your premise of Muggle = great, wizard = shit is down the drain since you basically admitted that only other magical beings have a chance of victory.

*** I think the mugglewank thing is rooted in Arthur Weasley. He's the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department and yet, as far as I can recall, he never shows any evidence of being particularly knowledgeable about muggles. If anything, he's particularly /clueless/. This does not paint a good picture about the ability of wizard society as a whole to recognize muggle threats like guns and missiles and deal with them accordingly.

I'm not saying that you couldn't write a fic where wizards win a conflict between the two sides, but you'd have to write in a few assumptions to make it work. Reasonably common or simple spells like the shield charm being more than sufficient to nullify bullets, for instance, or existing secrecy charms fooling satellites and cameras in addition to people. That way, the ignorance seems less like wizards being idiots and more like wizards being so blatantly superior that they don't have to care.

(And if you'll permit me going on a tangent, the idea of wizards being inherently superior to muggles is literally what Harry and co. were fighting /against/ -- see the "magic is might" statue -- so it's perhaps understandable that fic authors aren't chomping at the bit to write a scenario where the bad guys were, in a way, right.)

But I think the conflict was more a matter of morality, not actual biological superiority. Because I find it hardly debatable that wizards are, in fact, the superior species on the scale of raw power over their environment; from a purely naturalistic viewpoint.

Even without the Fantastic Beasts movies (where its clearly shown that wizards who are interested, in this case at the very least Grindelwald, have knowledge of contemporary muggle technology), I doubt that there isn't at least working knowledge present. And even if not, you only need one or two muggleborns that hate their magic-bashing family (or whatever) to tell you that Electricity and Fuel is kind of important to the muggles. Fuck up their energy, you win the war. Turn their highways' asphalt into silt. Let trees sprout on their airfields overnight. That all, of course, if fiendfyre is still a bit too harsh a weapon for you.

Surveillance is nice, if you can manage to write AI that recognize wands, and not a billion to 1 false-positives of normal people holding a stick like object. I'll just go out on a limb here and say you won't find the manpower to do it, even if you tried. Satelittes are nice, but well... kinda hard to make out A) Houses that literally do not exists on this dimension B) Vital infrastructure that is underground C) Basic infrastructure that simply does not exist because wizards don't actually need any that you could see, D) and so on and so on.

And yeah, Arthur is probably the source of it all. But pointing to my arguments above, once shit hits the fan people like Amelia Bones, Moody, Shacklebolt take the reigns against the muggles and, well... replace the secretary of the prime minister on a whim, and without asking.

With the exception of the extremely wealthy, sports stadiums and boarding schools, magical populations are either in hidden neighborhoods inside muggle cities or gathered in small villages nearby muggle population centers. No matter what kind of conflict there could be between magicals and muggles, on any scale, the muggles would be at a severe disadvantage considering their most dense civilian areas house the equivalent of fully armed and equipped armies.

Also, if the Muggles have wizards on their side, especially if they've been working with them for a long while, they're going to have procedural, tactical, and/or technological counters/workarounds for some types of magic. Just as most wizards aren't going to try fighting an armored division in the open field, neither would a real military just go "hurr, durr, let's just use what we've got" - they'd R&D the f**k out of it, and it's total wizard-wank to say that magic would just win vs. technology. They'd also likely come up with a few creative new uses for magic, either on its own or in combination with technology - having a lot more brains working on a problem is a huge advantage, as is knowing a lot more about how physics/chemistry/biology/etc. actually work.

EDIT: Really, any conflict between wix and Muggles would probably come down to whose side the Muggle-borns (and others aligned with them) supported. They know enough about Muggle society and technology to help aim the wix at the best methods/places to apply their abilities, but their magic could also be a huge help to Muggles looking to counter enemy magic.

***** Eh... You are harboring under the misconception that wizards don't know anything about technology. Fudge was, with little effort, able to make the president of U.S to forget to call British PM. That means access to the highest levels of government, knowledge about the downfalls of technology (i.e: even the most astounding of techs are worthless if you can be made to forget to use it) and an astounding levels of surveillance.

The muggles got a gun? A duplication charm later, so do wizards. Muggles came up with an ingenious strategy to win a conflict? Three drops of veritaserum or a careless legilemency later, wizards know all about it. Meanwhile, the wizards have spells that can control dozens to such degree that, even wizards themselves are slaves to it. Wizards have ways of magicking a land against showing up on maps, or even be seen, they can become invisible, they can transport at will and those that can't use a bus that can make whole buildings jump away when needed. Magic is not just a tool, it is something that utterly bends reality. An unbreakable charm will make something unbreakable, not just hard to break. No bullets will pierce an unbreakable glass. No bombs. No tactics nor any tech.

But that's all secondary. Wizards have something far more nefarious. Far more impossible for muggles to defend against or even comprehend. Dementors. Just the hundred that were garrisoned around Hogwarts could turn London a ghost town with little to no trouble. If wizards didn't stop dementors from going berzerk, no muggle couls ever survive.

You're right that Muggle technology probably doesn't have anything that could do more than detect Dementors (thermal cameras would pick up the aura of cold, at least), though canon doesn't give any indications of how invulnerable they are. Of course, it also doesn't indicate how physically strong they are - some less-lethal weapons that were already around in the 90s could at least seriously inconvenience a Dementor, like covering it in heavy adhesive foam to curtail its mobility. I don't think the books ever have them flying, which means they wouldn't be impossible to corral with the right equipment, after which you could give them the Chernobyl treatment and encase the entire area in multiple layers of concrete.

Any signs of mind-control would be screened for, especially among people in important or sensitive positions, and there'd be heavy compartmentalization of both information and function, to limit the damage an infiltrator or mind-control victim could do.

That's all assuming that no technological countermeasures were possible, when canon itself gives an indication that that's not true: Magic, at least in sufficient amounts, disrupts electronics. Therefore, magic has an effect on electronics or electricity, which means that with enough research it should be possible to create at least a rudimentary magic-detector.

In short, "accidental/unplanned mpreg" just makes me want to scream.

I get that not all writers have even a basic grasp of biology/anatomy. And I've played the Sims, I get the unnatural allure of a guy giving birth to a baby. But one would think that more would realize that a man's pelvis is nowhere near wide enough to fit a baby through it. Anyone who has watched crime documentaries will likely know how male skeletons are visually distinguishable from female skeletons through differing characteristics of the pelvic bones. So it doesn't really matter how much the colon and rectum can theoretically stretch (which for the record would still not be wide enough for a term baby) with the matter of musculoskeletal structures not being adequate for childbirth. This leaves cesarean delivery as the only viable option, with or without antibiotics. And I imagine that there would be spells and potions to combat infections.

In short: for the love of all that is good, please stop making men in mpreg fanfiction give birth rectally.

Also, character bashing fics that sees the bashed character incurably ooc. Like Ron being dumber than a bag of hammers and a whiny brat, when he absolutely wasn't in the books. Or Dumbledore being as conniving and manipulative and cruel as a "Dark Lord of the Sith", his hands weren't exactly clean but they weren't that filthy either.

Also, fics that make Snape seem almost saintly. He became that which he so despised. Lest we forget that Neville was deathly afraid of him; his almost being the boy from the prophecy doesn't excuse that. Lest we forget that Snape was okay with Voldemort killing Harry and James as long as Lilly was spared. Lest we forget that Snape alienated Lilly in fifth year because she had the nerve to humiliate him by rescuing him from James and co. Lest we forget which side he chose instead of seeking his only friend's forgiveness.

Do you think Lilly would have forgiven him for James's death if she survived that night? For being one of the primary reasons that her entire life was left in ruins? Because I don't think so. Peter betrayed the Potters, but there wouldn't have been a secret to betray if not for Snape. Sure, he was ruthlessly bullied. But that doesn't justify or excuse any of what he did and it never will. He may have been remorseful for Lilly's death, and acted on said remorse. But I seriously doubt that he felt remorse for anything else he did.

** With HP fics in particular, what bugs me the most is character bashing.

When it's just so clear that the author hates a certain character so much that they're unable to empathise with them enough to give them a smidgen of dimension, or they make such an OOC prick out of their character to justify others breaking relations with them...Which would be fine if it was written right, but most of the time reading such scenarios feels like having hate propaganda shoved down your throat. It can be so jarring coming from a, say, Dumbledore-bashing fic to one where he's a well-loved mentor. And usually you can notice that stories that bash certain characters will almost always have common characters on the pedestal, and vice-versa. Can't humans be, hm, I don't know...Complex, multidimensional individuals with different personalities and motivations? No? Just assholes and good guys? (As a well-loved character of mine once said: "The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters." I believe you recall the rest.)

I'm obviously not going to mess up metric vs imperial, jumper/sweater, trainers/sneakers, biscuit/cookie, but what slang or phrasing was being used by British kids in 1993 is just not that important in the face of things, since I'm sure not even most UK authors are doing the level of anthropological research necessary to correctly represent slang from students from different parts of the UK or even to represent the sort of slang McGonagall (born in 1935) or even Dumbledore (born in /1881!/) would be using.

***** As a Brit, I have to say I don't mind you saying sweater or cookie or stuff like that, but just please, there are two things Americans should never do because they pull British people out of the story and make us go "really?"

One is pancakes. They aren't even a common food over here now, and definitely weren't in the 90s. Our breakfast food tends toward the savoury, a "treat breakfast" is a full English.

The other is /cream in tea./ You do not put cream in tea. No one puts cream in tea. You have your tea with milk, or you have it black, or you have it very occasionally with a slice of lemon. Cream does not get poured into a cup of tea under any circumstances. I think some of the confusion about this has come from people hearing about having a "cream tea" - which is a fancy meal consisting of small sandwiches, scones with jam and /cream/ that give it it's name, some other cakes and a pot of tea (served with milk or lemon). It's not posh to put cream in tea, it's not an upgrade to milk that's fancy. It's weird and no one would do it!

We have them rarely, usually only on Pancake Day for most families, and they tend to be served in the evening after dinner as a desert and you put sugar and lemon juice on them. We probably had pancakes a max of three times a year when I was a kid.

If we have pancakes at breakfast, we make the American style ones. But again that's really rare and something we're more likely to encounter in a US themed cafe or restaurant than we would make at home.

There are also, just to confuse everyone, Scotch Pancakes, which are a bit more like American ones but smaller in diameter often with dried fruit cooked into them. You buy them pre cooked in the supermarket, on the bread and cake aisle. They can be eaten cold or warmed up by being lightly toasted. TBH they're the closest thing a lot of people in the UK have eaten to American pancakes.

Probably the most annoying of all these is when people change the typically British response of "their /lot/" to "their /crowd/", even though I've read enough to realise that they actually changed that in the original text of the Philosopher's Stone halfway across the Atlantic, along with changing Dudley's new word in the first chapter (It's actually "Shan't!") to "Won't!". I mean, that's just excessive. Does nobody in America want them to realise that different countries use different slang? And even if I know, logically, that it's not the author's fault they were brought up in America, it still jerks me out of the story /with force/ whenever somebody mentions the "Sorcerer's Stone".

I've heard of a few fics where the only reason the darkish families call the light pureblood families "blood traitors" is because they're ruining wizarding tradition in favour of catering to the Muggleborn who find their holidays and traditions "barbaric." I mean, I'd be pretty pissed too if I was a pureblood witch who grew up celebrating Pagan holidays and rituals but learned that they were suddenly switched out in favour Christian holidays, or were being banned, to the point where I have to then hide my celebrations to appease the Muggleborn who deem my heritage barbaric, those same Christians /who used to/ */burn/* /witches at the stake/.

** I feel really lucky in that most people will happily put what kind of story it is in the summary/tags so I can easily avoid a lot of genres or pairings that I'm not interested in. But something the author often doesn't warn you about is when the narrative is completely one-sided, with protagonists who never face and overcome meaningful setbacks, and antagonists who hold the idiot ball all for all 100k words of the fic. A lot of these are listed as Super!Character so I can easily avoid them, but even when the main character isn't egregiously magically OP, there are still lots of cases where the author contrives situations for their POV character to breeze through the narrative with no sense of meaningful conflict.

The same way that het couples sometimes (often? usually?) prefer to have biological children, why /wouldn't/ a gay couple have that same desire? Writing a universe where men can bear children isn't erasing women, it's just catering to the fantasy of creating a bio family with non cis/het characters.

Mpreg is a kettle of beans that many don't feel like opening, and for the most part done by (what seems to me and my friend) cis het women that fetishize gay men.

“Surrogate is probably something i would go for with either a blood adoption or ritual to have them both be biological parents to the child. Seems more plausible than mpreg.”

** Not so much a rant against certain genres as against AO3's tagging system and how useless it's gotten because of authors abusing it.

Why, in the /fuck/, is there like 9001 different tags on AO3 for Harry/Voldemort, equally as many for Dumbledore-bashing and Weasley-bashing, and /none of them are aliased to the same thing/ despite literally /being/ the same thing?

And why is "Past x/x" aliased as still being that relationship? If I'm searching for a certain ship, I emphatically /don't/ want to read a story in which they have a horrible breakup in chapter 1 and the rest of the fic is spent vilifying the non-main-character party - which is what "past x/x" implies the vast majority of the time. The "9001 different ways to tag it and no aliasing to each other" complaint goes there as well, by the way.

Honestly, the fact you have to make a Giant Honking List Of Excluded Tags to get to the good stuff grinds my gears sometimes.

And that's not even going into tags like "I wrote this instead of sleeping", "Don't like don't read", tags that relate to other tags (ie "maybe x" "if you squint") and other stuff that just exists to pad out the tag-list to the point where there's more tags than there is actual /fanfic/ sometimes. That's just being stupid.

The tagging system itself has the potential to be useful, but /not if it's used the way it is/. It needs a firm, site-wide cleanup and there needs to be an option to just always exclude certain tags.

As for the Queen having actual power or authority over the magical world, I think that Merlin and Arthurian Legend are probably ultimately to blame.

And since Merlin served Arthur, it's not hard to justify the current monarch having some authority over current magicals. And part of Arthurian Legend involves Arthur coming back to rule Brittain again, and it's hard to imagine that not including magical Britain, which again makes a case for current monarchs having some authority.

You are right that most of it is just fetishizing royalty, but there is still plenty of room for good stories in there.

**** Historically some courts used to have people like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee][John Dee]] who spent a lot of time studying alchemy. It wouldn't be too hard to twist that a bit more and have a 'court magician' who would be the royals link to the magical world.

So something like that could carry on into a modern role/advisory position on how to deal with magical issues.

Also the Queen has weekly meetings with the PM. It could be interesting to have her advise the minister for magic too, if you really wanted to include her/the royal family. Although those would more work for political fics than anything else. An advisory role could be considered a soft power over the wizarding world of a sort though if she has the ministers ear.

** Ok I hate bashing fics but I also hate the super unfavorable depictions of certain characters that technically not bashing.

For example you could get away with making very over the top asshole bully Marauders or asshole Bully James. And canon is ambiguous enough about what they were like at that time that you whether it's bashing or not is debatable. But its not a very nuanced view of them. And tbh that's...really boring. I feel that way about most characters.

The exceptions being like Voldemort, Umbridge, Bellatrix, Greyback. I do like when fics do more nuanced takes ( minus with Umbridge) but if you dont and they just evil assholes I don't mind. I don't think it makes a fic more boring or the character more boring for those particular characters.

But everyone else? It definitely does. Even if I'm not a huge fan of that character id rather see them be complex. I may still hate the character but at least it's an interesting version of that character .

Also I hate fics where one or two characters are super op. Op as in not only magic. It can be intelligence too or with how much money and status they have. The obstacles they face aren't scaled up to be challenging enough for a character like this. And most of the other characters around them are also not as strong, or smart, or rich. So most relationships don't really have the same relevance to the story. That and the easy obstacles make the story really boring.

I want to say the problem is that its a power fantasy. And even though I hate political Uber rich 11 year olds in fiction who talk like they are 20+ I don't think the power fantasy is the problem.

Superheroes are power fantasies but its still fun power fantasies. Because there are multiple heroes with useful relevant abilities who are often in roughly equal levels of importance to each other. And the big threat they are fighting still requires a group effort. Any other intimidating enemies for any singular hero are hard to beat for that hero. They make the main character op or important for the world. But they also make the allies op or important too and they put effort into making the threat one that would be a struggle for this set of characters. So it still fun.

** If I were to rant about any tropes common to HP fanfiction, my first choice would be time travel.

It is in the nature of fans to want to partake in a little wish fulfillment with the stories they love. Perhaps they'd like to put a spotlight on some facet of the narrative they wish to explore further than the author did, or examine certain characters in more detail, or even simply alter events in such a way that their outcome makes a little more sense than they used to. That's all well and good, for these are some of the chief reasons fanfiction as a whole exists at all. However, there's something crucial about the concept of time travel that the Harry Potter fanfiction community just can't seem to grasp: Time travel changes EVERYTHING.

I most often see time travel used by writers as a mechanism by which they can reasonably enact changes on the established narrative, sometimes by placing a mind with considerable foreknowledge in their younger body but most often by moving a character to the past wholesale. In either case, the writer then motivates the time traveller with the opportunity to change the future they know and proceeds to shuffle up or at least slightly alter the relationships between characters as events change.

The problem with this is that the vast majority of fanfiction writers in general fail to grasp is that they are using a form of reality manipulation to justify the changes they want to make in their version of the narrative. That is like using an industrial plasma cutter to cut sandwiches in half; It's excessive, out of place and hilariously redundant. Why use this tool when a tool isn't necessarily required at all?

The Harry Potter universe is a relatively easy framework to write within. Certainly broad and historied, but not overly detailed or deep. It's a fantastical setting with a semi-soft magic system and grounded, if eccentric characters. Its logic is mostly grounded in reality and the world around the characters is structured to reflect that. Time travel is possible across short periods, but is a tightly controlled and extremely valuable commodity. Now add long-period time travel to that mix and a lot of new questions have to be answered.

How was it possible if the only known means of time travel is dangerous as it is? What consequences will the act of time travel have for the one that did it? What would confirmation of stable long-period time travel mean to other people if they found out? Who would be interested in such information and why?

Now, it is possible to write a good story without answering some of these questions and the many others I don't have time to list, but some of them must be answered in order to justify using time travel in one's story at all.

*** It sounds like you and I have seen some very different time-travel stories. Most of what I've seen have been "do-over" style, where one or more characters' memories are sent back to their younger self, with physical time travel being much rarer. This often addresses a lot of your questions, as /physical/ time-travel is heavily limited but /mental/ isn't. The method is generally also somehow a one-off: It was an accident, a higher power intervened (the "Don't Fear the Reaper" and "Champions of Lillith" challenges, for example), Harry's soul went back in time after the AK in the Forbidden Forest, etc...

Also, I'm having trouble figuring out if I agree or disagree with your fourth paragraph. Certainly, if you're using time-travel to enact minor changes, you're using it /wrong/, but the time-travel fics that I've read generally tend to result in very substantial changes to events. Unless there's some cosmic restoring force trying to prevent changes to the timeline, the only things that remain the same are those outside the scope of the protagonist's actions (which students get Sorted where, unless they had important conversations before reaching the Hat) or that the protagonists deliberately leave unaltered. Time travel that just alters a pairing or two is massive overkill; time travel that changes the course of the entire war isn't.

It's just, bashing pretty much by definition has the characters be out of character - it highlights those characters' bad sides to the extremes. And it's also just not fun to have the main character be right all the time and curbstomp those characters that are being bashed.

I mean, I guess you could make some of the typically good characters into villains, like the Weasleys, or Hermione, or Dumbledore, or whoever you really dislike, I'm not against that. But don't just bash them. Make them a compelling, competent antagonist that has reasons for being the way they are, and that way readers would feel even more satisfaction when the main character finally defeats them.

** Slice of life is the death knell that signals the end times. When hell comes to earth the devil will hold slice of life up as his weapon to destroy the world. It is literally a story with no plot. A non-story. No interesting or suspenseful things happen by /design/. I can't imagine a better apotheosis of every terrible aspect of fanfiction.

Universally bad writing /check/

Extremely poor pacing /check/

Unbearable characterization /check/

Contrived setting and events /check/

It's a genre that lacks a fundamental part of storytelling conflict. And unsurprisingly, whether through ignorance or design that takes away things like-

Character arcs

Motivation

Tension

Dramatic payoff

All of these things have poor analogues in a slice of life story but by lacking conflict they are always approximations of the real thing. Simulacra, an inferior and flawed copy of whatever they try to emulate.

Abortions of the literary world. Lifeless copies of the bundles of joy we hold so close (books).

If you like slice of life you don't like to read actual books. You may try to read real books but by enjoying slice of life

Second, I'm kind of wondering what Slice of Life stuff you're reading? Like, does something require action or an antagonist to be good? Is something with a complete lack of those two things but inner or inter-character conflict still SoL? Fair enough if it does require action or whatever for you to enjoy it, but fanfiction as a whole is lacking in character arcs and all the above things in the first place. In addition, stuff like linkffn(6432055) which is undoubtedly slice of life doesn't really fit any of your "SoL automatically bad for these reasons" criteria (which, may I add, are very subjective). Slice of Life does not mean conflictless and I can't think of one example which was remotely popular that I've seen. Then there's things like linkffn(What's her name in Hufflepuff) which is again mostly SoL, but with some plot driving the main character forward outside of the main focus which is the SoL sort of interactions.

I think by definition mundane life is so low stakes that any conflict has no meaning.

It is super important to understand what I mean by conflict. It's so easy to misunderstand but I don't mean the regular definition.

These stories lack "literary conflict" which is distinctly different than struggling with some internal problem or even fighting someone. A story can be entirely filled with only depictions of fighting but lack any conflict whatsoever.

For example if you simply write about a series of fist fights with different characters each time with no connecting plot, coherence, or setting then you lack a story and any real conflict. Even fighting can lack "literary conflict"

The context and plot surrounding events/conflict are what make conflict what it is.

If you have a character struggling with depression and just write about how that effects their every day life and the mundane actions within without the addition of some arc, goal, or exciting factor then you have written a non-story. That has no conflict. It is stagnant. Conflict is the addition of something to a story that brings change. It doesn't need fists or superpowers.

A toy helicopter being lost can be a source of conflict if it brings about a goal, arc, or new element. It will be infinitely more conflicting than an internal struggle that doesn't change.

***** Right, I totally get what you mean and I know the concept of literary conflict, I was just wondering about your definition of Slice of Life. I think it's a lot narrower than mine, which is perfectly fine! The story I linked is absolutely no other genre, but does have that central literary conflict (which to put it to real life terms is basically the child of cultists experiencing life in the actual world for the first time). I think the key thing is the arc because it's a damn strong one, and without it I agree it'd be meaningless to pretty much anyone but the author. However, I do also think if something with no other genre bar slice of life has very strong character arcs and goals, it is still capable of being a good piece of fiction/literature and to dismiss slice of life altogether is a bit reductive. Hell, I can't blame people who like the stuff that is just straight up no-conflict slice of life even though it's not my cup of tea, because I'm sure it's nice to have some distraction from how awful reality sometimes is.

***** I think I have another definition of SOL as well as you.

I write a story I would call SOL about the life of Lily Evans in Hogwarts. The chapters are just sniplets that look at moment in her life, without always setting them up or transsituions between them. But there are a few developments and conflicts you can track over the different chapters.

The main conflict is her growing up as a muggleborn in the first war and how it does affect so many things in little things that grow into big things. And that conflict is refected in the little conflicts, about how her relationships and friendships with Snape and Petunia crumble over time, how her relationship with James grows, how she and her friends are still teenagers with mundane teenager problems in the middle of all that, how her view on things clashes even with other muggleborns, how her and her friends' characters change because of those little things adding up.

So the story and plot is about little mundane things adding up to big things and too a war experience, but a lot of it is still SOL, at least in my book. Or what would you call such a story?

SoL by definition is a story without high stakes. It's meant to be calming, mundane, or low tension. I don't think this is up for debate.

By it's nature it eschews conflict. This means it lacks a complete story.

Conflict is one of many basic elements of a story.

Plot, characters, and setting are some others.

If a story is missing one of these then it isn't a story.

By missing I'll apply an arbitrary percentage. Let's say 25%. It's probably lower but idk.

If a story lacks a conflict, plot, characters, or setting in 25% of it's pages it lacks a fundamental part of storytelling. It is no longer a story imo.

I think these two statements contradict. I don't know since I haven't read your story but you can probably figure out for yourself easily.

Does it have danger, moral dilemmas, antagonists, obstacles, or challenges that push the plot forward? Just one or more that feature in more than 75% of the book is necessary.

Or you could use the other aspects of story to figure it out.

Does a character deal with something and change because of it? If so what is the thing they are dealing with? Is there a plot like a mystery, romance, tragedy, or quest that a character is motivated towards? If so how are they motivated?

If you can honestly answer that more than 75% of your story has one of these things then you probably count as a story.

More importantly do the words on the page reflect the answer given to the above questions?

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

**** I've just finished reading the stormlight archive in prep for Rhythm of War. And Soulhome by Sarah Lin.

On the ff side I've been reading Peel by ManMagnificent, Born Weapons by Gallyrat, and The Never Lost Sons by Sheev The Senate Palpatine.

I don't think you should be ashamed. You just haven't written anything resembling a story. That's ok. Plenty of people don't write. Or they write awesome stuff like poems and songs which can be little mini stories. But I don't like that people like that genre. Feels wrong.

It's kinda like if someone enjoys something that's antithetical to the entire culture and then professes to like that culture. I would hesitate to call you a fan of movies if you only watched only subtitled movies without sound that were supposed to have sound. If you liked to play video games with only audio and turned off your monitor I wouldn't call you a gamer.

It's missing an integral piece that makes it whole. Pizza without bread. Macaroni without the pasta. If you called those things cheese and said you were a fan of cheese I'd be cool with it.

But apparently you're calling it a pizza? That isn't a book. Its missing the bread. It's missing the pasta. But you call it macaroni. You call it pizza.

You can't call that a story. It's missing something too important to be called that. It's kind of insulting that as a fan of pizza you get to pick up cheese alone and a whole ass pizza and say I like em both. If you think that's pizza you don't know what pizza is and you sure as hell don't need to call yourself a fan of it.

It's kinda why I automatically dislike slice of life fans. You find enjoyment in something so opposed to the very nature of storytelling. It makes me think you might not like stories. I don't like that.

***** For me, 'Slice of life' means depictions of the POV character's daily life. Like most Harry Potter fanfics show Harry going through life in Hogwarts - Great Hall breakfast, classes, homework with Hermione and Ron, interactions with dorm-mates...

Slice of life (SOL) fans are usually people who enjoy /SOL arcs/ in the story, not people who completely hate all semblance of plot and never want any divergences from the SOL lol.

I don't understand how anyone would be okay or even happy with their husband/wife/partner being in love with someone else and in a romantic & sexual relationship with that other person. I know it's fanfiction, but ugh. I don't want to be reminded of it.

Also, cheating/rivalry/jealousy tropes. I don't condone cheating and I hate when authors bring in a rival just to make the MC jealous. Why in the world would anyone think jealousy makes a person fall in love more with someone is completely beyond me. If anything, it would make me lose trust in that person and, if it were me, I'd leave the bastard. A faithful, monogamous man is far more attractive to me than a handsome man with dozens of women hanging all over him.

Though, honestly, its mostly just a polyamorous relationship, and the one I'm refering to eventually became not "One guy with 2 girls", but a loving relationship between 3 people.

To note is also that apparently the effort necessary for such a relationship is not linear, but quadratic to a 2-person relationship.

*** /Yessssssssssss./ I absolutely *despise* multi shipping. I've only read one harem fic and that's because I didn't know it was a harem until I got too invested into the story. (And it was a pretty banging fic, by the way.) Other than that, I hate it when Harry's suddenly a womanizer or is a man-whore. Like, /no!/

The only threesome fics that I'll consider checking out is if it's the golden trio getting together and that's only when it's tastefully done and all parties love one another.

Quite frankly, I'm not into polygamy myself, but if three people love one another then I don't care. I just hate it when Harry's suddenly this really powerful lord-like figure who has five wives because he needs an heir to each of his Houses or some other bull.

Fanfiction includes everything if you didn't know not just one type, if you wanted that then find a sub that supports that type.

** First is MPreg. It's simply a trope I cannot stand. I don't understand why it's a thing and I don't particularly care to learn.

Certain relationships. Snape/Harry, Hermione/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, etc. The more astute may have noticed a pattern with age and that's exactly it. I cannot read any of these ships without just being disturbed, the age gap makes it creepy and I'm personally incapable of getting over that. The only exception to this rule is time travel fics which is a whole other can of worms.

Let's talk about abuse for a second. Now, I personally hate canons display of abuse and have frequently cited it as one of my biggest issues with the books. With the level of abuse we are consistently shown there is no way Harry should turn out anywhere near as okay as he did. Which brings me to my issue here. If you're going to show more of the abuse or amp it up some more MAKE IT IMPORTANT! This is doubly annoying because I genuinely like well written abused!Harry books. But honestly, Chekhov's Gun is a basic writing rule and if you're not going to do something with it, why bother introducing it. Also don't claim to have more realistic abuse results and have nothing aside from one emotional breakdown then herr-dee-derr everything is all better. That's no different from canon really.

Also might I address the rampant sex scenes. I personally don't mind reading Drarry fics (main culprit here but by no means the only offender), but there is a reason I tend to avoid them. For what ever reason authors feel it important to throw in a random sex scene. Normally, this is fine, I'll skip it and continue reading. However, the author sometimes feels the need to put important story information through the sex scene, making it so my skipping it means I have no clue what's happening with the story. The fact that I've seen this happen multiple times in T rated fics (where I initially read these fics to avoid this issue) is ridiculous and was the final straw for me.

Next up is needless bashing. Now, I personally don't hate bashing if done right. Normally, we're experiencing the story through Harry. Thus, if Harry decided “screw Ron, he betrayed me” after the events of Goblet, sure whatever. It's a story reason and I'd expect to see more negative opinions of a person that the character we're following dislikes. It when it comes out of the gate just bashing a character for no acknowledged reason (or a shitty one). I'm also going to tie in an annoyance of mine here too, why is Manipulative!Dumbledore seemingly equivalent to Bad/Evil!Dumbledore? A Manipulative!Dumbledore could still want the best for Harry (this is essentially how I've always read canon Dumbledore) and I fail to understand why Manipulative!Dumbledore is always stealing money and paying Hermione and the Weasleys to like Harry. That just seems like a wasted opportunity to me.

Another minor annoyance (I know you asked for things I hate, but bear with me) is the length of some books. It's. It's not uncommon to see books in this fandom be 200K+ words long, and it's just one of a series. Most fantasy books are 100k-120k words long (unless you're a veteran, publishers refuse to give leeway with these numbers). For some context, Sherrilyn Kenyon's Acheron was 275K words, the hardcover copy of that book (what I have on me) is 722 pages long (the manuscript was 1100 pages). Now, this annoyance turns into hatred when I find that authors (not all) just throw in filler to attempt to get it to that length. If your book is over 120K words, I'm reading it only because the summary impressed me, how impressed I need to be is directly proportional to how long the book is. I really am not impressed when I start reading a book this long and the author starts putting in pointless filler.

I might have to come back with some more later, but this has been at least an hour and I can't think of anymore to add.

Although, Stormlight doesn't have a lot of filler, and WoT has a lot of landscape description and circular/repetitive introspection, and at least one whole book that most people don't consider necessary.

What about genetic influences? What if the tattoo says you belong to a John Smith, UK? Does it ever put the location and time of meeting there as well? What if you disagree heavily with your soulmate on every single thing (opposite religion, or one atheist and one very devout person, or a conspiracy theorist and a normal person, stuff like that), are they still expected to stay together? /Can/ you even separate/divorce in that world? What about if you're are the soulmate of someone in the past, will you somehow time travel or would you be immortal until /exactly/ when you meet your soulmate? And if it's limited by same time period, how? Why?) I've yet to see it done properly. If anyone could recommend any that answers most of this, I'd be much obliged! That also goes for A/B/O. It was done well in brave new world with genetic engineering and a explanation that made sense, but in all the fanfic I saw it's all ‘Bang! Guy A is in heat and just /has/ to bang B /and they both enjoy it and then get Feelings!/ and then they tell each other! But oh nooos one is a completely disgraced OMEGA so they cannot be together!! Or can they?' Just /once/ I'd like a explanation. Or a ‘OMG THEY'RE BOTH ALPHA AND TOO DOMINANT TO BE TOGETHER!' Or ‘Oh noos!! Two Alphas can never /ever/ be together!' Or even a ‘two alphas bring Hell onto each other without a omega to placate then enough to bring hell onto other people!' Or, for actual realism, everyone becomes a alpha... as soon as they have kids. And yes, the kids are lower in rank but not so bloody submissive all the time!! And I /loathe/ any teacher x students things. No, it's not romantic, no making Harry just that awesome isn't a excuse for why only Harry x teacher could possibly work, it has, as far as I can see, absolutely /zero/ redeeming features. For that matter, the Dursley's abuse doesn't have to be exaggerated for it to be bad. Vernon doesn't need to sexually and psychically abuse Harry to be a bad person, same way Dumbledore and others /can/ do bad things without becoming monsters or doing it just to be evil. Righteous! Dumbledore who makes mistakes and genuinely thinks he did what he had to do, no matter how dark or mistaken, and who has /reasons/ for thinking that (good reasons, reasons we'd all believe) is far more compelling then evil cackling Dumbledore paying the Weasleys to spy on Harry and feed him love potion (a actually decent manipulator, as he's supposed to be in those fics, wouldn't /need/ to do that - the Weasleys would've spied on Harry, if he convinced them of the need and benefits to Harry, without the risk of hiding frequent monetary transactions. And even if he /were/ to pay them, why, it would just be donations to help those poor Weasley's along, nothing as obvious as clearly sneaky transactions, esp were Harry could conveniently overhear them.)
