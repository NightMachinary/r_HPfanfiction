*Update: we should be back in service!*

--------------

Hi folks, the bot is partially down as ffnet has added protections to to prevent bots.

AO3 and other sites should still work for now.

We are brainstorming solutions but the timeline for a fix is unclear.

** AO3 hasn't worked for a long time in my experience. Whenever I linkao3() it just doesn't work. Unless it was recently fixed?

EDIT: This was the last attempt I made: [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kceai8/looking_for_recs_young_snape_stories_please/gfpue0i/?context=3]]

I later removed the linkao3() later since it clearly didn't work, but what I typed was "linkao3(The Hogwarts Potions Professor)".

******* Id rather they beefed up the moderation team and then acted more upon reports like youtube. Facebook and twitter for example apparently host more of that vile stuff.

Problem is that people will just move on from pornhub to less friendly sites. The content will not go away, and there is a ton of sites out there

**** A "journalist" posted an article on New York Times about child pornography on Pornhub. Apparently, less than 200 videos were uploaded over a time of 3 years. This caused Visa and Mastercard to stop accepting payments to Pornhub. This caused Pornhub to delete ~80% of all videos without even a notice. Meanwhile, 11 million photos and videos with CP were deleted from Facebook over a period of 6 months.

** Yup, Causes FanFicFare plugin for Calibre to fail too, reporting 403.

I'm not sure if FFF uses the API, or if it's working off of the user-agent, but the only workaround I've found for now is using the archive functionality of ff2ebook, which is good for the function of adding new stories, but of updating them.
