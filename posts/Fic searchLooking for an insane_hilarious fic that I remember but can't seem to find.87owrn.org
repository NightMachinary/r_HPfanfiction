Ok so for the life of me I can't remember the name or author but I do have a lot of random details.

So the initial premise is the chamber of secrets happens and Ginny dies, Harry gets thrown in Azkaban and then becomes friends with Bellatrix and Sirius. He gets out a year later. Stuff happens.

Now for the rest, in no particular order,

- Ginny isn't dead and is instead possessed by teenage Voldemort
- they resurrect Lily potter using a huge cube covered in runes
- Tom!ginny joins the death eaters; realizes that his future self is an idiot and goes and joins the heroes.
- The prophecy is slightly reworded to "neither can die while the other survives" so harry and Voldemort are kinda immortal
- Luna from a dark future returns to the past to set right what once went wrong and arrives by bursting out of her past selfs head
- Voldemort (the older one) makes it so the founder's artifacts/Horcruxes possess people when worn.
- Harry is a bunny animagus
- A minigun that fires valerian steel bullets is mounted on fluffys back and used to fight a jabberwocky.
- Harry and Fleur kinda have a thing
- Harry gets dragon skin boots, they are very nice

And that's about all I've got if this sounds like 20 different fics its cause it sorta is? I think? I kinda remember an authors note saying that this was essentially a snippets/omake/ideas collection that was then taken and crammed into a single fic.

EDIT: Solved! [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]


** Ah! One of my favorite fics. The author deleted it off ffnet, but you can find it here: [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37]].

It's An Old And New World. Very amusing fic, with a ton of awesome shit. There's some grammar mistakes, but it's so entertaining you can easily look past them.

EDIT: actually, reading this version now and I swear it's a way better version than the one that was on ffnet, grammar- and formatting-wise

*** Is there any way to get this as an ebook file?

EDIT: [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=6849022][here is a link to the ff2ebook archive]], although I'm not sure if it's up to date considering you're saying the one you linked seems to have less grammar errors.

**** I didn't want to get a reminder and discover that nobody has answered. I thought that, of anybody would answer this question, they would do it at least in two months, before the post gets buried.
