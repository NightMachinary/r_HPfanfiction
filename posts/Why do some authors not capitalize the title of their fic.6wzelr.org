I'm not hating but I've seen this happen more frequently lately and I don't get the rationale for this stylistic choice. Are the lowercase letters supposed to signify something?

** It seems more common on AO3 in my experience. No idea what the point is. I'd prefer they didn't, but I've read some decent fics that do this so it's not enough to make me ignore a fic.

** I see this far more on AO3 than any other sites. Generally when they use song lyrics as a title. It also strongly correlates with unnecessarily long titles, in my experience.

** My unscientific impression is that this convention corresponds most strongly to oneshots that are 1) emotionally intimate or introspective, 2) built upon a sequence of snippet-length scenes, or 3) both. I won't guess as to correlation/causation, but this style of title reflects (or signals) the unconventional mode of storytelling, perhaps.

** As others said, it's stylistic. Perhaps symbolising a quieter, more understated fic and a move away from tradition.

It's not exclusive to fanfiction. E.E Cummings often didn't use capital letters in his poetry titles.

But yh, no specific, universal reason.

***** You fail to realize that many "younger folks" as you so adequately used let their hobbies (e.g. writing FanFiction) and real-life aspects (i.e. work) bleed together, even if they don't realize it. And I'm not making such a huge deal out of it; you made a comment and I replied to it with my thoughts. However, reading your original comment and your response to mine, I can clearly see you don't always use proper grammar or capitalization, but it's the internet...who does, right?

** You're overthinking it. It doesn't really have a deep meaning and the people writing like aren't dumb or lazy or "non natives who don't realise the importance of capital letters". It literally just looks cooler or more aesthetically pleasing.

** Maybe it's a stylistic choice? Or English could their second language and they may not realize just how important capitalizing the words in a title is.

*** Yeah I understand that it's a stylistic choice but what is it supposed to convey exactly? For eg: I understand the stylistic choice of including quotes in front of chapters but I don't get the meaning of this. I've read good non-capitalized titled fics, but they're not any different from a good fic with a capitalized title.

**** Wouldn't know since I don't do it. Perhaps you should ask a writer who you know does. The reasons for it probably vary too.

** Most of the books on the shelf I'm looking at have titles that are in all-caps. What's the difference?

If you can choose the way your title looks in addition to choosing the words themselves, why not?
