*** Oh god. Thank you! I haven't laughed this hard in weeks! And yes, serves them right. If they really wanted the kid to have a normal name, james and lily should not have left it to a Man-child, not to mention that remus is normally useless in controlling his friend's worst impulses. Plus it had been Hours by this point, Remus had no energy left to fight.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.

*** "Hadrian" is one of the most common names to use in "Harry is Lord A-Million-Last-Names, Dumbledore is trying to set him up to kill himself, the Weasleys are after his titles and money, luckily the Goblins will all bend over backwards for him because he remembered the name 'Griphook' and the Slytherins are friendly because Harry could ruin them with a word".

It's also a name that, if you look it up, a lot of baby-name websites will suggest "Adrian" instead because adding the H makes it 9001 times more likely for your baby to be bullied for having a shitty pretentious name.

** linkao3(From Ruin by GraeFoxx) has a defeated, mind tortured for a decade Harry Potter travel back in time to fix things, but something happens and he ends up having to masquerade as the heir to Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, taking the name Ares Flamel, because Nick thought it was a proper wizard name, but also because it was close enough to Harry that it's be easier to react.

The alternate world is also one where his parents are alive, and he had a twin brother, but it's completely unclear why Harry was nevertheless sent to live with the Dursleys, nor what happened to him at the Dursleys to make for the set of circumstances that brought about Ares Flamel.

I really like this fic and could gush about it for several paragraphs more, but I'll stop here for now.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
