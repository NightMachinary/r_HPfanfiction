** Honest thoughts: I could picture the sceen, and it grabbed my attention. I'm curious to the backstory and where things would go (if he gets free)

A little confusing identifying conversation vs. Internal thoughts I felt the description of the forest was a little wordy

6/10, would read another chapter if available, wouldn't follow to be notified of future updates. I'd keep refining, it seems like you'd be able to write a unique story which is the hardest part

*** Thank you for the honest criticism! I honestly wrote that in about fifteen minutes with no planning, so I didn't expect it to be above average.

***** Much obliged! I'm thinking of doing a series of one shots from that "universe" and if it's well recieved maybe run with it. I dunno. I just got tired of waiting for new fics and well, if you want something done you may as well do it yourself.

** It started off well. Your descriptions of the setting were great. But I think the dialogue was a bit difficult to get past. Were there just two speakers? Their "voices" were a but indistinct and didn't sound like natural speaking language. I think if this scene was framed by more context -- a bigger story -- this would be fine but as a standalone it is easy for me and readers to be picky.

*** Just two speakers, sorry for the confusion. I didn't specify which of them because it was a third person with a slant of first person. Thus, if Harry couldn't distinguish which was speaking (y'know, being in a tree and all) then we (the readers) shouldn't be able to either.

That was the thought process anyway.

** I think the flowery description at the beginning could maybe use a rewrite- not that there's anything wrong with the impulse or the idea, just that you said you did it in 15 minutes and I think it shows there. Your strength is definitely in dialogue and I was really caught up in the situation and wanted more by the end!

** The story looks great, and the setting really gives a sense of atmosphere. I personally found it a bit hard that everyone sounds so American (not much of the original series uses goddamn, dammit, pain in the ass etc) and there's a bit of a disconnect between the very, very formal descriptive language and the informal dialogue. I think it'd help the atmosphere even more if you chose one style to go with- the formal and have the dialogue / thoughts formal too (but maybe still tone it down- 'power that one knew not' is maybe more appropriate in satire or historical fiction) or go informal and have the language chatty. I read somewhere that every word and description should actively be setting, advancing, or changing the scene, and we're not conscious of it when we read but we notice it anyway. Maybe have a read of a few super famous fanfics and see how they keep the descriptions in tone with the dialogue, and what sort of dialogue and language is usually used by Harry, the deatheaters, Brits, etc.
