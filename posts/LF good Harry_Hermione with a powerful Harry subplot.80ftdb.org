So I am reading Limpieza de Sagre and really enjoy how harry powering up is more in the background.

And the Harry hermione "reading" together scenes made me wish for a good hphg fiction.

I prefer longer fics 100k+ and wouldn't mind if it got steamier towards the end (I don't want a pure stroke story)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] by AngelaStarCat is a good one from what I recall. Harry is intelligent in this one. Plus Hermione reads to Harry in this one due to reasons...

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
