I read a story once about Harry being raised and trainedby Merlin but unfortunately is wasnt finished. I am looking for stories where Harry is raised/trained by someone awesome like Merlin or Dumbledore. Hoping for stuff thats complete. Thanks ahead of time.

*** This was a good fic. To bad it's not finished, just when it was starting to get really good too.

The stories not completed, it was published towards the end of November, is consistantly updated, and currently at about 47k words. It's a wbwl story with quite a few cliches, but it fits your requirements.

This fic will severely stretch the idea of "someone awesome", but it is complete. Harry raised by Lockhart.

Does this mean that it's written in the same universe as HP and the Children of Change, but by a different author?

**** Not really. Basically, in HP and the CoC, Harry's cover story for his knowledge and strength is that there's an organization called gnicc that trained him.

In the spin-off, it's true. You probably don't need to read CoC at all.
