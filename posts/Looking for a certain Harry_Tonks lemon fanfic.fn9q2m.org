** There was one where Harry finds out that he's actually a metamorphamagus, and needs Tonks to teach him how to control it. This one didn't have Remus and Tonks getting together, but Harry and her do instead, and together they even end up taking down Moldy-vort...

#+begin_quote
  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards
