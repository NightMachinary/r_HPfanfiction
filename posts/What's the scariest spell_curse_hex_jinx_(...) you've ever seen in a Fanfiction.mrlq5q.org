I have alway thought spells that induce artificial and everlasting sleep paralysis to be particularly terrifying.


** I read a ritual spell in a fic once that basically stripped everyone in the area of the ritual of their magic unless they were in a specially prepared safe zone created hy the RoR or deep under gringots. The magic returned but the people effected were either squibs lr significantly weaker depending on how strong they were before. Imo this is honestly worse than any Spell of mass destruction. Especially the cavalier way harry used it and only warned a select few people of it in the fic.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

** For me it would be from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) and it is the Imago Dei spell or in English the face of God. If you have run into the Trope in Harry Potter fanfiction of as I will so mote it be and then magic doing as the caster wills this is the Dark mirror of that spell. It allows someone in theory to rewrite reality as they wish.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** I'd imagine it depends on how quickly it transfigures the blood into mud. If it happens immediately, yeah you'd die pretty quick. If it happens relatively slowly though it'd be a pretty painful way to go. The particles in the mud would clump up and clog your capillaries and mess with your joints, probably similar to "the bends" when a diver ascends too quickly.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

Dumbledore's alchemical super weapon in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] literally melts people into a pile of fluid, which in turn can spread and melt more people.

Grindelwald's Protego Diabolica in [[https://youtu.be/WSsyczFjLwE][The Crimes of Grindelwald]] is mightily impressive.

Voldemort's improved Jamaican soul magic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] allows him to mass imperius his enemies.

Already mentioned, but I'd like to emphasize Hermione's nanoparticle swarm in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] again. It's absolutely terrifying in how they slowly disintegrated Bellatrix Lestrange.

** Some fics uses memory manipulation spells that goes far and beyond simple obliviate and show the pov of the victim. Which makes these spells all the more terrifying. Especially when they're used for completely selfish reasons by complete assholes.

I think in canon we are told that Voldemort uses such spells for torture but I don't think he rearranged someone's mind permanently for a long time, he used imperio for long term control.

Hermione modifies her parents memories, but we don't get the victims pov and no matter how immoral Hermione's intentions were good, which lessen the impact.
