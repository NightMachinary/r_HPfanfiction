Maybe a paradigm shift results in muggle-borns being viewed as 'superior', due to the fact that -- out of a family of muggles -- THEY have magic. This led to the belief that they were chosen and special.

Imagine how blood supremacists of the past would feel about such a cultural change.

** It's a great idea, but doesn't sit right for me. For a group to have superiority, they need to be the older group. Muggleborns will never be considered superior, since they're essentially outsiders.

The whole thing is a metaphorical reference to immigrants. No one will ever herald immigrants as superior, not unless they come in guns blazing.

*** Mm, no, I think it could work. All you need is one strong muggleborn witch/wizard a while back that established a bunch of things, with their own brand of rhetoric.

They would claim that those who were chosen such as themselves were of the divine, and those who were stricken (squibs) are accursed.

**** This one was interesting for a while, but it gets repetitive and kind of complicated to follow the timeline. Imo it gets to a point where the story is boiled down to a character introduction, exposition, and a time skip then repeat.

***** its mentioned on pottermore

but alot of pottermore is non jk articles

it also makes no sense, for wizards to think people who are raised in wizarding households with wizarding parents are less talented then those who do not have the inbuilt advantages

Unless it was a rare term used by the fringe people

They were considered gifted, NOT superior. It's mentioned one time in all of JKR's extra babble. It's in the second paragraph.

****** Slytherin's discrimination on the basis of parentage was considered an unusual and misguided view by the majority of wizards at the time

That seems so weird given that it was a thousand years ago and people tended to be far far more extremely religious back then

If anything I would have expected slytherin to be considered the reasonable one by most of the wizards of the time

teaching the muggle children magic, are you mad who knows what chaos that could cause my aunt astrif once used magic to heal a muggle she had to flee her village as they chased her out
