I'll start

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8065437/1/Petunias-in-the-Summer]]

Summary: "When Severus Snape makes an unexpected appearance on the Evans' doorstep, it throws Lily's differences from her family into sharp relief."

I really like this author, but this one is my favorite.

What are some of your all-time favorite oneshots?


** I liked that one! I've read that author before, she/he has some really nice stuff.

Some of my favorites are:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1920286/1/The-Hero-of-Hogwarts]]

Because I have a huge soft spot for Ron.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3699470/1/Anticipation]]

A tiny bit cracky but funny.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

Slightly depressing but incredibly touching.

*** It does indeed. :) Esama's stuff has been deleted from ff.net and tumblr, but an enterprising DLP poster managed to create an archive before it was deleted.\\
The dropbox link is [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/92776639/Esama.ZIP]] And if you want to verify for yourself, the DLP page is here, the link is two thirds of the way down, posted by user esperjones. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=608767&styleid=6]]

** Since OwlPostAgain already mentioned 'Cauterize', I'll offer this gem:

Memorium by Aesop [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium]] The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe. Rated: Fiction K+ - English - Drama - Amelia B. - Words: 27,424 - Reviews: 76 - Favs: 254 - Follows: 38 - Published: 06-22-11 - Status: Complete - id: 7108864

This is a great look at the Ministry's interactions with the real world in a crime-drama fashion. It's like 'Law & Order: Muggle-Magical Unit'

** My favorite author has a couple.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6660837/1/Black-Regrets]]

What if the tragic story of Black's betrayal that Harry heard while crouching under a table in The Three Broomsticks was actually the truth? Sirius Black is after Harry Potter. For real, this time. What happens when he catches up to him?

or

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6024600/1/The-Stone]]

Lily Potter JR is in the forbidden forest the evening after her father's death when what should she discover but the dropped resurrection stone.

Or

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6120130/1/The-Wrong-Grate]]

Harry Potter exits out of the wrong grate his first time flooing, but instead of landing in Knockturn Alley, he lands in the house of a certain wizard.

**** I think it is because Sirius is one of the most beloved characters in the series and people (myself included) are drawn to him because he was such an affable, impulsive, interesting and tormented character. How much he suffers and in turn Harry, Remus and Wormtail suffer is really intriguing to me and it is one of the main parts of the series that I find myself pondering often.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King]] - "The Sea King" - probably the first version of "19 years later" that I liked. There is something special here.
