Hi all.

I've been writing some FF but I've noticed in the HP fandom, because of the high volume of fanfictions..you don't have many views or reviews on your work. E.g. My most recent work has 21k words and 2 reviews on FF.net, and 10 Kudos w/no reviews on AO3.

I was wondering if on this thread, we could all add our usernames and then we can read each others work and help each other keep our motivation high so we can carry on with our work. I'd love to read your work as well, I've read a lot of work and I'm desperately trying to find more to read.

My Username on FF.net and AO3 is NariNyxx. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enarinyxx][https://www.fanfiction.net/~narinyxx]] [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/NariNyxx/works]]

My current fanfiction that's most recently updated is called 'Torn':

Lyra, and her older brother Caelum have been brought up by the Malfoy family. After being sent into Gryffindor away from Draco and Caelum and with their allegiance towards their houses and friends.. will they be able to survive through the impending war unscathed? Harry Potter - Rated: T - English - Romance/Drama - Chapters: 7 - Words: 21,342 - Reviews: 2 - Favs: 1 - Follows: 8 - Updated: Dec 29, 2017 - Published: Sep 16, 2017 - [Fred W., OC, Draco M.] Harry P.

I'm also writing another fanfiction story and it's broken up into three books which will all be released around the same time. It's a project of mine. One is set in Tom Riddle's school years, the Marauders years and Harry's years. There are three generations and I'm intertwining the fates of the OC's lives into the Canon characters. No chapters are released yet but they will be within the next week or so.

I'd really love to read your work so please introduce yourself and introduce a FF you are working on which you'd like me to read.


** Hi, my name is Alma and this is my current updating story! It is on my Quotev. :) [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights]] But I also do have a fanfiction.net version that is not as updated yet because I do not like the website. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12784998/1/The-Fight-For-Rights]]

It is about my girl version of Harry Potter and takes place after Hogwarts, and the main plot and all the subplots are all original and unique, and it is about a nonhuman civil rights movement. Also there are a lot of characters I made myself. I am very into the worldbuilding. I hate canon rehashing and the Voldemort conflict, so please know that this story will have nothing to do with anything from canon at all ever. Voldemort might not even show up in it later. I am entirely focusing on totally original stories and conflicts (that is why I skipped the Hogwarts years entirely, because I want to tell adult stories).

I will be posting my fic probably within the next week and would love reviews !

** I'm definitely up for this! Would be great to try some new reads, and would love some reviews.

My user name on FF is tartan_slippers, and I have a few WIPs as well as one-shots - mine are mainly Marauders, especially L/J, but I have a few others as well of various era.

Any feedback is appreciated, just drop me a PM or comment here if you read any maybe? I'll do the same :)

** Hi :) I don't write atm but I am an editor. Spelling grammar, general notes on the plot, characters progression. I may wrote someday but right now I don't have time for it.

** Hey! The reason why it may not be getting a lot of views/feedback is because it's OC-centric and this fandom as a whole, unfortunately, isn't as into OCs. However, as an OC-centric writer myself, I'd be happy to review your story.

Here is mine, if you might be interested: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12628217/1/The-Outliers][FFN]] , [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/chapters/26365128][Ao3]] The latest chapter is not on Ao3 yet but will be next Friday. Edit: it takes place in Tom Riddle's school years and shortly after, funnily enough.

** You have to fix your latest chapter, titled "Potions." In its current state, it isn't readable.
