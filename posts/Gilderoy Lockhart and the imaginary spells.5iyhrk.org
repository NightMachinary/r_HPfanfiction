Ok, so we all know Gilderoy's story - did wonderful things, yet couldn't cast any spells successfully, used made-up spells, eventually turns out to be a fraud who stole people's memories.

But why? He took actual events from actual people. He's not a complete fool. Molly Weasley used his Household Charms books. Molly used it /after/ he was exposed. So it must have been good. We know he was good at magic when he was at school, but just didn't use it very much. He was a Ravenclaw, nearly sorted to Slytherin. So why did he write things that were so implausible, and attempt to use fake spells?

My theory is - Gilderoy met Mick Dundee and Wally, and got the story of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf from them. By the time Wally wally-fied it, we had the Hormophus Charm. Ok, so it was actually a warlock from Armenia, but you get the point. Either the Wagga Wagga Werewolf was an Animagus who was pranking/or a serial killer, or a werewolf got out once, and someone either dealt with it and from there, the legend grew and they all had fun telling the famous stranger this ridiculous story right up until he obliviated them.

Can you imagine someone pulling his leg, telling him about the dangerous ghoul he captured in a tea-strainer? Or informing him with a perfectly straight face the correct way to go about giving a Yeti a headcold? I guarantee you Xeno Lovegood got obliviated at least once! I can just see a couple of old guys sitting on a porch with their pipes down in Cornwall, going "oh aye, a right pest those pixies are. Easy enough to sort out, a peskipiskie pestornomi clears 'em right out. The wife used to do it every year." and Gilderoy's blissfully unaware that the chap is a Squib and is badly mangling the actual spell. Or his Dictaquill being faulty and misinterpreting someone's accent and miswriting down the broken bone healing spell. You get the idea!


** Huh, I've never thought about this possibility before; that people that the travelling handsome blonde ditz meets like to pull his leg.

Have a cookie for being clever! It has some potential to be turned into a plot twist, if someone finds something in Gilderoy's books that they /know/ is an urban legend or popular joke.

** Aussies love messing with foreigners about shit. Once told a guy that drop bears were genetically engineered koalas with glider wings and vampire teeth that fall from trees and suck peoples blood. Told him that vegemite wards them off, and since we eat them from childhood we secrete a scent that keeps them away.

The guy ended up coming out of his tent wearing a massive sombrero and covered in vegemite.

*** Shit mate, that ain't messin, that's life saving advice. I mean Our Museum has a page about them. Shit's legit. Be scared, I live in fear that everyday my vegemite shield may fail and my death will be a whirl of fangs and claws. Bloody, ferocious but at least swift.

*** Exactly! Someone should write a Gilderoy down under book. Dancing with Drop Bears? Kicking back with Kangaroos? Chatting with Crocodiles? Filled with a whole bunch of Aussie made up shit.

** I reckon that all of his stories were given to him by Mr Lovegood as satire, with Flophart believing them to be true, and the amount of memory charms Lockhart cast caused Xeno to start believing in things like those Crumple Horned things

*** Holy shit. This is an A+ fan theory right here. I really want people to start incorporating this idea into their fics.

*** Well according to wikipottia Dumbledore suspected him because he knew two people who'd been obliviated - so it's possible Xeno and or Pandora were some of them
