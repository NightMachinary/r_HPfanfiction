*** They had us in the first half, ngl. I've always read Hermione as black, I think that was because when I was younger I had a very smart black friend who I saw as and often compared to Hermione, not from text. Seeing her in the movies was very odd as a kid. I do think with the rise of Hermione in Cursed Child being cast as a black woman, it has brought with it the rise of Black Hermione, but I think there were people like me who always thought Hermione was black. - E/C/L

**** My problem with black Hermione is that it deserves a different story. Canon Hermione's story is this: upper class background (parents are dentists), smart and capable as hell. She enters a new culture and suddenly she, who was privileged as hell becomes the target of racism. Suddenly the white, rich, smart girl has to fight discrimination for the first time in her life. As sad as it sounds, this teaches white kids how meaningless things such as blood or skin colour are.

Black Hermione on the other hand deserves and needs a different story. My black hermione faced discrimination all her life. And when she finally entered the wizarding world she was glad to leave the racist muggle world. (She maybe sees that skin colour doesn't matter here). She thrives, she flourishes. Until she is called a mudblood. Mistaking that for a skin based insult first, she is even more scandalized when she finds out she is discriminated against due to her blood. black!hermione struggles with it but eventually comes back stronger and declares that she has known discrimination all her life. She has seen her parents, her cousins, herself be discriminated against by racists and ignorant people.

She can overcome this too.

This is a different hermione, one that doesn't blackwash hermione but rather makes her really black. It's not enough to paint her black, she has to be black.

On the other hand, this is fanfic and anything goes if the author wants to have a discrimination free world and escape reality.

***** Well it's the issue in every ever flip of characters.

Society shape who we are, what we believe in, and our values. Change anything about the character's background, and you change the character, if only a little.

Even Rich Ron wouldn't be the same guy. Black Hermione would be different. Fem! Harry would be different. Gay Draco might be even a bigger jerk at the beginning, because of denial and homophobia and trying to compensate even bigger for fear to be rejected by his father.

As someone else mentioned, it's great to see characters be casual about all that. BUT they can still be casual, but have some tweaks in their personality that shows those difference it makes.

****** Absolutely. I just feel like you can't take the most marginalized fictional character in Harry Potter (funnily enough - white rich - hermione) and then just make her into another marginalized group from the real world (black in predominantly white countries) and then not show it and build it into the plot, if the books specifically are about said marginalization.

Honestly even a black Ron would be easier adaptable without changing much but it would give a nice insight into all of it. Black family not being discriminated (only due to their allyship) mudblood girl discriminated.

***** I think that British black people have a very different experience than black people in the US, especially around the time Hermione's parents grew up. That's not to say that there was no discrimination, but certainly no segregation or civil rights movement.

And at the end of the day, her parents are well off, so it's not as if she had grown up in a bad neighbourhood. Knightsbridge or Chelsea aren't the Bronx. Even if you make her black, she would be very far from the average American black character and their experiences.

****** I'm not american, I'm European / German and have lived in the UK for a spell, and I am a PoC as well. While the american black and English black experiences do differ, it's wrong to say that they don't face a similar kind of discrimination. In the 60s it was still legal in the UK to discriminate based on skin colour.

The UK has massively improved from the slave trade, especially in cities such as Liverpool.

Colonialism and the UK is a love story like Harry and being oblivious about things.

There have been civil Rights movement in the UK. There have been Black British people killed by the police just like in the US. There have been black and Caribbean civil rights community leaders in the UK.

To say otherwise is ignorant and US-centric.

But you're not the only one under this misconception. I invite you to read the following article: [[https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/27/britain-black-power-movement-risk-forgotten-historians]]

Yes there are upper class Black families. Which still face discrimination. Less so maybe than lower class and yet it is there.

And see another comment of mine - it was legal in the UK to discriminate based on skin colour. I know that it was legal in the 1960s, not sure when that changed. The books play around 1990ish. You can't tell me that an upper class black Brit would be unaffected by black discrimination around that time. Hell, they still face it in 2020.

I'm sorry but try to read my comment again.

In a story about discrimination and marginalization you see the following: a girl that has not faced discrimination now faced discrimination.

In this story a black person does not fit. As the black person had faced discrimination before that.

In this story a poor person also does not fit. As a poor person has also faced discrimination, no matter the skin colour. (I can give you data on this if you want)

You need to change the story of Hermione accordingly if you want to insert a person who has faced discrimination before.

You said I should read your comment, but I think you should read your comment. Not to mention, the mudblood part is such a small, small part of the plot.

** It's not really the mention of a race or an ethnic background that annoy me, but rather the "useless change".

In Canon, Dean Thomas and Angelina Johnson are described as black, the Patils are Indian and Cho Chang is asian. In all of these cases, their "race" doesn't play any role in their character. Cho Chang could be replaced by Lydia Mason, a blond "white" English girl, and her character could still be written exactly the same. Yet the mention of the race is not a problem because it just help the reader to create an image of them in their head.

What I find annoying is when a character is "modified" without the change having any influence on the story. What's the point of making Harry Indian if he stills act 100% like in Canon (outside of some throw away line like the one you mentioned)? Make him study Indian Magic, make him closer to the Patil or even speak Hindu with them. Just make some signicant change that justify the mofication because without that, it just feels like "I needed to fill a racial quota" that I find very annoying.

I have the same problem with Gender Bender fics. What's the point of writing a whole fic if the only difference from Canon is that Harry is now called Harriet?

Also, India is incredibly heterogenous, and while there are things in common, culture, food, language, beliefs can greatly vary from region to region. Authors just saying "Indian Harry" are only advertising their ignorance, I've found.

*** I'd argue that the "race unlocks certain abilities" is worse than just the token throwaway stuff (and actually racist). I don't need to be a American to order a Cheeseburger, I don't need to be Russian to drink Vodka, but I need to be X to get access to OP magic which wins the day?

You don't need to make the MC a certain something to explore it. Between the canon cast's origins, Dumbledore's knowledge and Hermione ability to devour books, you could justify finding about just pretty much anything.

Locking magic behind "race" is as stupid as making Harry an American so he can shoot Voldemort with his 1911. After all, he might have 7 Horcruxes, but Harry's gun holds 7+1.

**** Changing Harry's "race" doesn't have to unlock a certain ability, just create a significant enough change from canon to justify the modification.Even if I don't agree 100% with the rule, I think that the Chekhov's gun, which say that any irrevelant element should be removed from a story, should apply in this case.

In my opinion, it's fine for an author to give any race to the character they create, even if they don't plan to "use" these races later, because at the very least, it gives flavour to the story. But fanfics are different, because they modify a pre-existent character (and I want to "respect" the base material). As a reader, I'll spend the totality of the fic wondering /why/ this change happened and be frustrated to not see and development.

I don't really care what the change is, I just want it to exist. Whenever it's to give Harry a new Magical ability (which I agree may be a bit racist), creates a foreign family that may or may not help him, or just makes him experience racism, it doesn't really matter.

Because if the story is just a canon rehash except Harry is Indian, what's stopping me from taking a canon book, automatically changing every mention of Harry Potter by Sunder Sarkar, and then call it a fanfiction?

**** To be honest, I think the whole 'race unlocks X magic' is actually an accurate thing.

In a lot of cultures, there are certain practices that just aren't open or available to outsiders for various spiritual reasons, and something that can get you to view a practice is being a certain race.

Like, let's say that there was a certain ritual that needs to be completed, but you can only do the ritual if you have an ancestor that qualifies X. That's not an uncommon thing, in fiction and out of it.

But unless it's explicitly said that there's a particular spiritual/ancestral reason, I see what you mean.

In other words, if you found the information in a book or something, you can still use it. It could be explored in the sense of ‘X culture stole Y's culture's [magical ritual] and made them public, what are the ramifications?' and that would work in a different way (even if it's also a transparent discussion about cultures stealing or appropriating other cultures stuff) because it would have actual ramifications that go beyond ‘Harry is now super OP and unstoppable'.

*** I'd say learn Hindi with the Patils.

The Dursleys are very likely racists. There is no way they would let Harry explore his father's culture and learn the language. But I can see an Indian Harry eager to not only learn magic, but what being of Indian Decent means, and discovering his own culture. Through the Patils, at first, and then other characters, OCs etc.

I'm not the one to write that story, since I'm not Indian nor I know anything about Indian Culture. But that's the take I would find the most interesting.

  Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration.

  "All right," he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. "All right, let's say for the sake of argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that Kingsley bloke."

  Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed half a dozen times.

  "As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug-- I mean, your Prime Minister."

  "Exactly -- he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in.

Well, it kinda is? I mean, Harry has a very British name, nothing in his (known) family history even hint him being of a different origine, he grew up in England in the 80's and went to school in Scotland. Not to mention that, when describing a character, he /always/ mentioned their ethnicity when said person was from a minority.

If we go by statistic, Harry has a very big chance of being white and it's what I'll assume when reading the story. Just like, if Harry had grew up near Bombay I would assume he is Indian unless said otherwide, and if he went to Ugadou School of Magic, I would probably think he is black.

Same thing with is sexuality (or is it gender?). Canon Harry was never seen doubting his own sexuality, and never shown having any interest in someone that was not a girl. So why would I not assume he is straight (and cis?) ?

Also, for our world, cishet is the default. It's what the majority of people are. In Europe, different shades of white people are the default. In other areas, other colours are the default.

In any original story you make, you will either have majorities and minorities, or you have to explain their perplexing absence. Due to simply how different races, be that human or otherwise, are formed, they will almost always start out as separated groups that then will meet each other and start either fighting or living together. And because there are obvious physical differences, people will eventually start saying that those differences allow then to rank each other.

**** Because every detail should have a impact on the story. You can't you go ‘oh, [MC] has autism/is gay/black/Christian and then it never comes up again. It should have /implications/ for that character. A autistic character can subtly be shown to have autism for instance by them being drained at the end of a day by masking; how would that impact their homework? A gay character in the ‘90's or 80's would approach romantic relationships in a different way bc they'll need to figure out if someone is interested in them in that way w/o outing themselves. A Christian character would have to cope with having magic, something that's traditionally seen as being ‘from the Devil' - as would their family.

So just mentioning it isn't enough to make a book/fanfic ‘diverse'. Which isn't to say that making it all suffering and gloom is necessary (on the contrary, I love my happy endings!). To take my original examples, the autistic person can totally find friends who make them feel accepted enough to slowly stop masking, or at least help them with homework, the Wizarding World can turn out to be accepting of being gay, which removes at least one obstacle, the Christian and their family can learn that having magic doesn't make you possessed/evil/a bad person etc etc. The point is more that it should be more then a throwaway line.

Being taught about the Bible doesn't mean you're a heavily fanatical evangelic. But it burrows inwards. It shapes values, morals, ideas of right and wrong. Part of that idea involves a devil, and temptation, and magic not being cool or even okay but wrong and a tool the devil uses to tempt you. If you combine that with the requirement that you basically leave home for most of the year (in other words being less under the parents influence, around a age when most people get incredibly influenced by their peers) would make most parents worry, but especially if it's a school that teaches their kid something that is commonly described as being evil, or at least the first step towards evil.

I think you really don't understand how little western Europeans think of religion. Christian religion's dogma is seen as some vaguely humanist, "treat others as you would want to be treated" "Love thy neighbour" thing. The Bible gets cherry-picked for stuff that supports this, and that's it.

***** This is absurd. And insulting. Not every detail needs to be important to the story. That sounds like some bullshit to dissuade people from putting anything but straight white men in their writing.

We need a reason for a character to be black but not for one to be white. How convenient.

A character can just be something without it being important. I do not need every black character to have some side plot about them being black, and the same applies to gay people, Indian people, Christians, etc.

Stop trying to gatekeep the importance of people's sexuality and race and whatever else. There is nothing wrong with having a character just /be/.

And plenty of others agree. Look at this recent post on [[/r/actuallesbians]].

****** You haven't been reading, have you. At least, you haven't been reading Harry Potter. Every detail, from the tiniest Christmas present or gesture of someone, to the most obvious things, was significant to the plot, either the plot of the book or the plot of the series. If not that, then it characterized people and places; the portrait of Sirius' mom and the tapestry may not have helped the plot directly, but they gave tremendous insight in the people that lived there and via that, into Sirius himself, who would otherwise be quite mysterious.

At no point was I suggesting that any of this required a whole subplot to resolve; on the contrary, it's kept rather small and subtle. But it's not like JKR said ‘oh yeah, and Sirius mom was abusive but that has no impact on Sirius whatsoever because he's just that strong okaybye' nor did she say ‘here, have a entire book full of Angsty Details About Sirius' Mom'. See the difference? There was a /in-between/. Sirius' family had a impact on him, *without taking over or being important to the story.* Now /that's/ something nobody is objecting to. Nobody is saying ‘That bit with Sirius mom is just unnecessary virtue signaling! I hate that! Couldn't they have showed the impact of Sirius mom a bit better?'

Please tell me how Dean being black is any different than a character being gay in this regard. There are a ton of details that add nothing to the plot and only serve as a description, and that's fine.

Honestly, I've dealt with self hatred for /years/ because of my sexuality. The last thing I want is for every gay character to have their sexuality /have/ to be important to the plot. And I know plenty of other minorities to feel the same. I /want/ lesbian characters that are casually lesbian. I live for that shit.

********** Who the hell is Ben Shapiro? And no, what I've been /saying/ is that changes to canon should have a impact on either a character or the plot. Or, if you're working with canon, be shown why that is actually plausible. For instance, there's a fanfic out there that makes Hermione a sociopath, and /it works/ because it shows how chillingly plausible that actually is within canon, by explaining her alternative reasons for doing what she did canonically - not by saying she's a sociopath and then never mentioning it again, nor by giving her a whole new subplot. As I've also detailed with the example of Sirius' mom, something you're being curiously silent on, nobody is saying every minoritycharacter needs to have a entire subplot. But it has to have a impact on the character. For example, let's say a character is gay. Then there's zero need for the usual big plots, y'know, school's ostracizing them etc. They can be totally accepted, no big deal. They'd /still/ have to figure out if their love interest likes them that way, navigating ‘I love you's' that can be either platonic or romantic. Because guess what, impact isn't decided by how the outside world reacts, or how much time the story spends on it. It's the small stuff. But you already know that, because it's the second time I told you. You're just refusing to admit you know it.

No, they don't. They can just get with an openly gay character and that's that. Or what you said. Either one is fine. Or there can be no romance for that character. It's perfectly fine for a gay character to exist without being with someone.

Only ever having one way or the other is beyond moronic, and damaging. Your path would lead to people continuing to treat homosexuality as something abnormal.

Such colonial pasts make little sense with magic since the worlds separated before Britain got most of its colonial empire and the rest immediately became independent according to Rowling.

The issue with Kingsley's family is that they must have been around for a long time in Britain to be considered a local pureblood family in the 1920s, and given the attitude wizards have towards muggle, any related background (eg something colonial or the Royal Navy) would not have been accepted by them.

When Henry and the secondary line of Potters died out in England Fleamont and Euphemia travelled back to raise James. They are quite wealthy, technically pureblood but the English don't want to count them, and don't have a longstanding homebase like the Blacks or the Malfoys.

James is full Indian, and the only marker for them being English to begin with is the cloak and the Potters on other families tapestries.

As much I love that JK Rowling included the Patil twins we did not get to see much of anything remotely Indian from them. They were minor characters and had little role to play in the story. But growing up, I would have loved to read someone who I could relate to on an intrinsic level.

Making Harry an Indian makes little sense. India in incredibly diverse. Even if his green eyes , jet black hair and pale skin could be explained dubbing him from maybe the upper north of India but what role does it even play in the story? If it's a well written fanfiction which explains the racial changes and incorporates the cultural aspect in the story then I'm all in. I would legit love it but if it's simply mentioned as a diversity box to fill when it's of no importance to the story then it's really not required.

We know his parents were older when they had him, and he's the only kid. So perhaps they were unable to conceive and so they adopted a baby from India. James grew up in England and identified as British, but had Indian ancestry. Harry, in a bid to learn more about his parents decides he wants to learn about his dad's ancestry/bio parents. That could be an interesting fanfic and one that I would actually love to read. I hope they don't give him any indian family/cousins because I think part of Harry's story is that he so desperately wants a family of his own and he doesn't have one, so he makes one (friends like family).

***** I don't recall a single reference to Harry's golden skin, could you tell me where?

Also, names are a huge part of cultural identity for me and most Indians I know. Indians don't tend to anglicise our names when we live abroad. Most “indian Harry” fics retcon him as half-indian on the Potter side, but like I mentioned, Potter, Fleamont, Euphemia, James and Harry are not indian names.

For Hermione as well, there are references to her pale face in canon, so I never think of her as black, but I don't know enough about black culture to be annoyed by inconsistencies, it's not my place.

To reiterate, I don't care if others have that headcanon, indian or otherwise, feel free, it doesn't hurt anyone. I just don't personally like it. I would LOVE fiction that has more diverse protagonists, but like truly diverse, not just lip service diverse. Like Percy Jackson does this reasonably well I think from what I remember (especially in the follow up series).

And to be clear, this has nothing to do with actors. I have no issue with a black actress portraying Hermione in cursed child. They should get the best actor to portray the role! But that doesn't have anything to do with the /character/ of Hermione.

That's thanks to the colonialists terming India as a country of snake charmers. Really stupid. I mean while India does worship snakes in some parts of the countries, mind you these are remote and not unique to India. ASEAN countries and Dravidian countries also worship snakes or used to at one point. As for snake charming, it's the practice of playing music to a defanged cobra for money by a very small community who were oppressed. A practice that's illegal. Got banned in 60s I think. Not sure. Either ways, it's a misguided concept.

**** Indian here. The snake charming thing is not something you would actually see happening in India. I do not know why the western media is a bit obsessed with really old Bollywood music ( They kind of put them everywhere in anything related to India) and snake charming. Maybe one would see it happening in small villages or in some ethnic fairs that some communities hold but it's really not a popular job profile to have here.

The magic profile could be connected to nature. Hindu culture as well a lot of local religions worships nature and deities. The forest groves are held sacred with a lot of tribal communities and even to this day the government is assisted by the locals in preserving them.

I can't say for other religions but as a Hindu, I can attest that we do have a long history of rituals and sacrifices in the Vedas. The sun is worshipped and celestial evens such as the full moon and the new moon still hold importance in the Hindu calendar. So, maybe it's the religious and cultural practices that aligns with how magic is presented.

*** Too difficult to put in the effort to be honest. It's simply not worth it. Country is way too diverse. Southern India has a completely different script from Hindi. There are 21 official languages spoken across the country, culture differing from regions within a state and differing even more once you move past state borders. Everything from day to day practices to religious practices differs. And that is not counting the effects of a caste system that continues to exist while breeding hate and oppression. And the effects of British Colonisation.

Setting up a magic school in India itself will be difficult because of its history. People from the north would clash with south. People from the east continue to be discriminated against. So would there be one school or more, how would the ministry function, etc would be too much of a hassle.

And then we have the problem of who would read it.

First we have the problem of isolating communities. Sanskrit, and Hindi which is derived from Sanskrit, are popular only in certain states. Adopting it as the main language (as some fascists in India try to do) would end up isolating other communities, like the entire of southern India and possibly eastern India, who'd then reject the story cause they can't relate to it. Same applies for cultural practices.

Then you need to take into account the fact that we have a lot of religions which have been here for ages. I mean Buddhism originated in the subcontinent and was the main religion in India until 7th Century BC. So you don't want to isolate them either.

Also not too many people abroad would be interested in reading such a story.

So yeah, too much effort, not enough satisfaction for doing it.

People aren't just their cultural trappings, and it does a severe disservice to define them by them.

For example I've seem fics where authors write Harry and James as Muslim, more often than not racebending them as well (which is something that's really bad because muslim is not an ethnicity. Not all muslims are arabs, or Iranians people!), but when doing so they have Sirius still written as Harry's Godfather. Why you might ask is this a problem you ask? Islam does not have the concept of Godparents! To be a Godparent requires the child to be Baptised ergo the child would logically be raised in a religion that practices Baptism which considering the time and place HP takes place in would be a branch of Christianity more than likely the Church of England.

In still making Sirius Harry's Godfather you display a complete and utter lack of research and insult two Major religions by assuming that are interchangeable to point of no differentiation! The only reason for such blatant disregard for basic research is that one isn't writing for exploring how the changed backstory effects things but for freaking brownie points for being perceived as culturally inclusive.

You can take the whole victorian-esque theme of the Harry Potter universe and roll with the idea that they're an extremely repressed group of people with generally bigoted values - or the whole 'magic is magic' idea and they're far more relaxed around ideas regarding human sexuality and gender.

I find it incredibly ironic that J.K. Rowling is a TERF when within a magical universe its feasible that someone can just drink a potion and switch things up at the drop of a hat. I mean, look at polyjuice.

​

I can imagine it could flip flop depending on the person

​

Draco: uh! That Granger not only is her blood filthy she also sleeps with women.....do we need any further evidence of absolute corruption?

​

Goyle: I saw you naked with Graham two days ago.....are you filthy?

​

Draco: but we are pure so its not the same.........plus I fully intend to hold true to my vow to Astoria and continue the Malfoy name.

So its one rule for me another for thee type thing

​

so Harry wouldnt nessicarly face any problems as he's not in the Muggle world. I could see it cycling back to blood...if it's Drarry then the problem Draco is killing his bloodline. The issue isn't sexuality itself. His parents would prefer him to breed first other than that they don't care

** There's no reason to change a character's ethnicity just cause, but seeing as race and ethnicity never come close to playing a significant role in any canon character's story arc, I will also contend there's no reason /not/ to change it. That being said, if it reads like a white author romanticizing certain races/cultures in an uneducated/ignorant way, I'm out.

On paper, I would love a story where this type of change is taken seriously. Let's say one of Harry's parents was, for instance, Han Chinese. He grows up different. The Dursleys treat him differently, kids at school treat him differently, he's subject to different stereotypes and expectations, etc. He's a different person. Maybe he doesn't make Gryffindor. He befriends Cho and the Patils and Su Li and other Asian kids. Maybe he wants to reconnect with his roots---chance to worldbuild about magical China. I think that sounds great. But it seems like most fics treat changes in ethnicity as a throwaway detail, which again, is fine by me if it's done respectfully. I would hate to miss potentially good content just because Harry happens to be brown in the fic.

Sure, it's how he is on the cover art and in the films, but those aren't canon. The same is true for a whole lot of characters; their race is never stated, people just assume they're all white.

But that's the whole point of fanfiction. People can work within ambiguity, adding details and imagining as they like. But they can also change things however they want, and for whatever reason. It doesn't always need story justification. No one bats an eye at changes made or details added just to be cool or fun or interesting (without broader narrative significance), so why should this sort of change be worse?

I agree that it shouldn't just be tacked on at the end of the story. The author should make it clear within the first chapter or two. But I don't think it needs to be tagged /unless/ it's an important point in the story.

** the Granger surname is a huge part of this. With the exception of African immigrants who arrived post-WW2, most black people took “Anglo” names, similar to freed slaves in the US: Freeman, King, Douglas, Floyd, Taylor are all Brit-aligned surnames.

And Hermione has one in particular canon-connection to the black experience: the hair. Now, I'm a white blonde who has “fluffy” hair growing up who identified with Hermione's hair struggles. But after watching my high school friend spend hours straightening her hair, I understand why the sight of her straight hair was so shocking to the boys in GoF. The defining physical trait of Hermione is her wild hair. So for hundreds of readers, they envisioned a black Hermione.

By contrast, pure blood culture began (per JKR) as the pre-statute of secrecy British aristocracy and thus, a British identity. I'm a genealogy nerd: we obsess over how certain ethnic groups intermingled historically. My big thing is that necessary ret-con is necessary to create ethnic diversity within pure bloods. A ret-con that needs to be explained in-fic if it is added to the narrative.

For example, if a member of the Black family married, say, a witch named SiYu Jiang who served as an advisor to a Chinese delegate or one of the Potters visited Asia during Britain's early days in Malaysia/Hong Kong/Singapore/ etc, or a woman named, say, Jahanara Balik (named after a little Mughal royalty research, sry if I mixed ethnic names) perhaps was part of the retinue of a visiting Indian dignitaries in the Colonial Victorian era, it 100% works.

In short, a James Potter who is 1/4 Indian works 100%, but his skin would be fairly pale. If his mother was Indian, they need to say that his mother anglicized her given name.

On the Zabinis: the tie to the Italian elite and the long historical connections with Moorish groups (just look at /Othello/) easily accommodates a dark complexion. Also note, Blaise is pureblood but not Sacred 28 (aka Malfoy pure).

On Shacklebolts: here's my idea: the first shacklebolts arrived in Britain with the Romans: see my argument for the zabinis. It is my headcanon that black wizards arrived in Tudor England with the staff of Catherine of Aragon and soon established themselves into the wizarding elite as discrimination in the Tudor court grew and the statue was implemented. (Catherine”s staff historically included Spanish Moors).

Muggleborn are easier to diversify because their ethnic lineage doesn't play into the main conflict in canon, but the purebloods do.

We /should/ be able to tell the difference between a /bona fides/ organic exploration of different points of view, contrasted against yes, a clumsy effort to virtue signal.

But, for many reasons... we don't seem able to. We are stuck describing certain fiction as "good" if it ticks off the subculture checklist, and we never call any fiction "bad" even when it objectively is. That is quite a pity.

********* Well, I won't argue that there's not a portion of people I as a leftist and someone that would be categorized as an SJW call wokescolds - the name fits pretty well - but again if your focus on critique is not the writing itself but the poorly handled inclusion (which is a symptom of, again, bad writing) I can see why some people may assume you're coming at it from that direction.

I don't know. The language you use leads me, personally, to believe your issue is with the inclusion and not the writing. Saying it's about a "moral panic," and the idea that people are writing these things to 'score points,' is the same language I hear from reactionary types who are mad about black people being included in Star Wars, or that a Korean movie won best film at the Oscars.

I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just saying the language you use is very pointed and I can easily understand /why/ people think you're just dogwhistling the ideas that reactionaries are proponents of.

I repeat. It is not an issue of wokeness, it is an issue of bad writing. If it was written well no one would consider it the same. It would simply be a well written story with inclusionary aspects. By it being bad people focus on the inclusion as opposed to the poor skill with which it was written.

Edit: Actually, decided to look at your profile, and what can I expect from someone who's mad about, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mtqpc7/witches_place_in_the_wizarding_world_in/gv26zru/]["Politics being injected into media,"]] and a strange obsession with Marxism.

That is a new one to me.

Well, if you really want me to come clean, I will, on certain points. I am pro-democratic, free market-capitalist, pro-small government, centre-right, and male. Let me explain what that means. It means I am anti-Marxist, and would have been described as a Leftist and a feminist in most of the 20th century. I do not believe in giving power over a large number of people to a small number of people, without adequate checks and balances, as inevitably there will be abuse and inefficiency.

Now, there are many cultures in the world which would appear far-right authoritarian patriarchal to readers of the Guardian. All I can say is... surely you realise this is part and parcel of multiculturalism, and need not necessarily arise from bigotry of race, creed or gender. Have a look at the GLOBE studies, you will find that to truly embrace the majority of the world's people, you will have to depart quite a ways from certain popular ideas espoused by the British far-left. There is much more to inclusivity than having dosas and curry for breakfast (which incidentally I did, haha). I'd go so far as to say that if you're not experiencing culture clash, you're either lying to yourself or ignorant.

BUT, as I implied in my very first post: in HPFF we rub shoulders with many people of many different views. Let the fics we write be the final judge. Let us enjoy what we read, regardless of the identity and politics of the writer, and leave it at that. Isn't that more true to the spirit of what we've been saying?

P.s. bad writing about my culture, however well-intentioned, insults my culture too. Think about that for a sec. There's more out there that's bad besides "appropriation".

Sorry, but I can fully understand why people see you as simply whinging about 'that damn woke brigade' rather than having a tangible argument, because everything that you say - while very flowery and put together in an incredibly Jordan Peterson-esque way - culminates into, "I'm a conservative whose entire knowledge of leftism involves buzzwords."

I don't, actually, as I tried to hint earlier. It's a bit difficult to go into what is Left, partly because it "Left" is relative. Like I said, in some places I would be regarded as a Leftist. But I described myself /to you/ as a "right-centrist", because from your perspective it would seem to be so. And indeed you have labelled me as a "conservative". Would it have helped if I called myself a "liberal", simply because in e.g. Saudi Arabia I would be considered as such? Not at all.

Therefore, no, I don't think Twitter or the Guardian represents the Left. I'm simply holding up that particular concept as an example of a bogeyman that I'm trying to avoid calling up. Because the opposite is also true - the "conservatives" too are painted with buzzwords, and that is wrong as well. And that kind of mentality helps no-one, on either side.

(See, I told you I'm a centrist. I'm used to getting flak from both ends...)

Jordan Peterson and I speak the same way for good reasons. We are both academics, and we are often accused of being illogical and bigoted. Therefore we have to speak carefully to explain ourselves, almost like writing a journal paper. Yes it sounds weird, but it's difficult and time-consuming to write carefully AND casually. I don't of course talk like this in normal conversation.

Ah, there is so much to talk about in politics. For example, you skipped over my point about "free market-capitalism" and "small government" and jumped straight to "IDpol". Does that mean you are a conservative who only rags on about such? Of course not. I won't do you the disservice of thinking you are such a person, kindly don't do the same to me.

Yes, "appropriation". To be blunt: as I said earlier, I can pull a minority card anytime I like and bitch about appropriation in the right circles and bam! I'm in the Good Guy List. I don't want to. I said I'm a centrist and doing that would be betraying my own principles. So I let my ideas speak for themselves.

Some people have taken to critiquing the first category as automatically bad because it's not "woke" enough. The second category is popular these days but, as I point out, can simply be an example of stereotyping, and that's not actually good.

But frankly, I really think the selling point is the fact that whenever a POC appeared in the books, they where described as such, so if no ethnicity was given to Harry, probably a safe bet to say he was white. Also, don't underestimate the power of gossiping people in small communities, Dudley was already a pest, why wouldn't Harry be the same? While in the wizarding world, well. People like drama. Celebrities getting in scandals sells lots of papers and all that.\\

The majority of Brits were indeed white (and probably still are), but this doesn't mean there needs to be a specific reason to make Harry a minority.

On the other hand, I think when most people read fanfics, they want to read about an interesting concept inserted in the story and how it would change it, so other changes are not welcome because they want to be canon as much as possible.

******* Lily is obviously a big part of the story, but she isn't the main character per se, so I see why people don't do it, just like they don't change Neville's race. They usually do it with the trio because they are all main characters. They are the ones you're keeping in mind most of the time. So I don't think it's because Lily is a pretty white girl. If Hermione was described as pretty, I could see this happening just as often.

Also, people who want to relate to the characters mostly write stories about Harry's generation, probably because they have an image of them as teens and the Marauders' generation as adults. At least from what I've seen, Marauders' gen writers mostly like bending the plot and exploring the things we didn't get to read about, whereas Harry's gen writers do that too, but also want to insert themselves in the story somehow. They change more details like these because they want to make the teens more relatable.

Keep in mind this doesn't happen only in the Harry Potter fandom. At least I see this everywhere and the characters that get their characteristics changed like this are the younger ones, because their age is already relatable for most writers, so they try to bring the characters closer to their reality.

******** yes and changing Harry's the main character's race involves changing his parents race. Hermione's race doesn't matter since her parents essentially dont exist.

Ron's race does matter since you have to change his whole family as well as explain the fact hes a English pureblood from an old family yet is still a member of the privileged class that's looked down on do to poverty and politics not for being outsiders. that characteristic of Ron's somehow doesn't transfer to harry because we're all playing games of semantics.

but lily is a pretty redhead from a poor working class background whose sister marries a well to do upper middle class men and lives the life of a stepford wife in order to escape her disenfranchised youth. and lily does something close to the same effect as well. Lily's and petunia's race doesn't matter in the context of class or culture except no one touches it since making petunia a person of colour is an unflattering portrayal of abandoning ones roots out of envy and resentment.

If you write black Harry or Indian Harry and his parents are still white, then you don't pay attention to details whatsoever. I've seen fanfictions in which they are both of another ethnicity, their race isn't mentioned or that he's bi-racial.

Last option makes him black, but keeps the idea that he took after his mother's green eyes (because this is the aspect he took after Lily, whereas what he took after James is his messy jet black hair, which a black person can certainly have), so it's a clever way to juggle with ethnicity change and canon narrrative. Apart from that, they've made Lily black or Asian too.

everyone remarks that harry looks like james with lily's eyes. except lily's eyes have only ever truly mattered to snape.

Except he isn't. Maybe the movie version is, but we have 7 books with a total of 1,084,170 words, and like 95% of them is the plot told form Harry's POV. So we have his thoughts, his feelings and his personality down to a T - but fanfic authors like to ignore all that and create their own OC.

Like the average Slytherin/Ravenclaw!Harry, Grey/Dark!Harry, Indy!Harry, thirstforMalfoy/Snape'sdickgay!Harry - they are basically OCs called "Harry Potter".

***** I think the problem there is that you can in the books see that Rowling didn't develop the whole Harry Potter world in the first few books, and so some problems occur. Prob. best seen with apparition and portkeys, which basically plop out of nowhere and then basically become a constant for the series. So Harry also naturally discovers things he didn't know, partly because Rowling didn't had them down (or figured out how exactly she would implement it).

But that is something I don't really blame Rowling for, it's a common trait in book series, because the author generally doesn't know if they make enough money to continue the series (or later find out they make so much money the continue the series past the point for which they originally planned for), so they just by nature leave some holes that need to be properly patched that they aren't obvious. Harry Potter isn't the worst example of it that I know of, but it also certainly isn't the best.

The reason is the author wants to. It might not affect the plot, but it doesn't need to to be changed. Again, fanfiction can change anything. In my opinion at least, writing is only bad in that sense if the changed premise or detail contradicts other aspects of the story. Otherwise, go for it.

Of course that if you have an image of the characters that is different from what was described, you will get surprised, probably in a bad way because this isn't how you want picture Harry or whoever it is to look like. However, it isn't a bad thing just because you disagree with it.

Besides, from all the minor changes that can be made, characters' races aren't so jarring. I don't think you can compare it with calling Hogwarts "Porkland". Harry being of a different race might be less likely since Britain is mostly white, but it isn't shockingly unlikely - even less if you take in consideration that some of the characters already are of other races in canon. And you can also make sense of it in real life if you think HP fans are of many races and might want to bring the character closer to their reality.

Having the founders call their school Porkland is much less likely (that I agree is jarring) because there is no foundation both in the story and in real life. What school has a name remotely close to Porkland? Who names their school after meat? How can anyone relate to this? As for in-world inspiration, animals, History and even flora have much more impact in names than food. You could argue Pigland instead, but "hog" is already a type of pig, and "land" still is a very basic sufix compared to the names JK comes up with. Hogwarts name /is/ taken after an animal and she mixed two words instead of making it Hogland.

** I don't mind when authors mention race or ethnicity, but I don't like it when authors change a canon character's race/gender/species. I fell in love with the canon characters as-is. There's no need to change who they are unless doing so will change the outcome of the story.

But even if they can justify changing the gender/race/species, I would prefer if authors don't make a huge deal out of it. You changed him. Great. Now get on with the rest of the plot.

I once read a fanfic where the author changed Harry's race. At first, I was okay with it. So, his skin color changed and his hair is a little bit curlier than canon. Sure, I can live with that. The author can say whatever she wanted, but I would still imagine Daniel Radcliffe as Harry in my head because my mind has already latched on to the fact that Harry Potter looks like Daniel Radcliffe. You can't convince my brain otherwise. It wasn't really that big of a deal for me at first. But then throughout every chapter, the author would constantly mention Harry's skin color or curly hair, as if she's afraid we would forget if she stops mentioning it. It totally broke the immersion. After a few chapters, I noped out. Which is a pity. The plot is great and everything, but the author made such a huge deal of his skin color that I just got sick of reading it.
