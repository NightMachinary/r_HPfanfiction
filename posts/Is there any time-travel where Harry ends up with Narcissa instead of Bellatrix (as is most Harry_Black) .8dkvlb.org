**** I agree somewhat, because of one thing. We don't know how much Azkaban affected her, so we don't know how vicious and crazy she was before.

The closest I've seen her being characterized as close as she is to canon, without being bat-shit crazy, was from HP and the Turning Sun, where she had to actively choose between Harry and her beliefs and urges to hurt/kill.

But then, I got the same feeling from her in that fic as from multiple Daphne from various fics.

***** Well we can agree that she enjoyed torture enough to send the Longbottoms into insanity, and she herself mentioned that you have to mean the curse in order for it to work. She could have been a well-intentioned extremist before joining Voldemort, but I doubt that. She did mention learning most of her power during her time with Voldemort, but we don't know how much it corrupted her, or if she only gained an added skill set to her evil

** There's an abandoned one from way back in the early days of HP fanfiction. Like before OOTP was released. Harry defeats Voldemort and both Bella and Narcissa are the only two left alive. So in some kind of victory bloodlust he grabs both of them and shouts some kind of chant he doesn't understand and it binds them to him.

I don't remember if its actually any good Haha. If you're interested let me know, ive got the name in a list somewhere and I can find it for you.

*** It is not in fanfiction.net, but a archive can be found in [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/aerie22/TSOW01.html]] When he is in the mood of victory he sees Bellatrix and Narcissa in the mud and Bellatrix asks him to shout 'Praedia Bellica' and claim them, Narcissa becomes afraid and this thrills Harry, he looks aside and sees his supporters were coming to him to celebrate ( They were doing battle nearby and in case of Dumbledore and Flitwick, maintaining massive war wards) he feels it is the right thing to say - something he remembers from History of Magic, he knows only the literal meaning, not that what it entails - and shouts it. Afterwards Dumbledore explains Harry that the implication is that they becomes his slaves, even ministry can't touch them - meaning they can't be prosecuted by ministry - that right belongs to him - he can do whatever he wants with them and no one asks, But he explains to him that it is a test of his character how he treats them - whether he descends into torture - a slippery slope which ruined many families or upholds his character by treating them better - even though he is repulsed by them - it all depends on him.

**** Yeah that's the one. I might have a downloaded version also, but that would taken even longer to find! I remember thinking at the time that it wasnt horrible and was disappointed that it was abandoned.

The author wrote another one called Dance with me Harry. Also on that site. That was a classic from back in the pre-HBP/DH time. It is complete but has an abandoned sequel.

Unfortunately there was a lot of really great fics either abandoned or totally destroyed with each book release. It was the thought at the time that fics set in the current time had to be canon. So if the author was in the middle of their story when a new book was released they would often drastically change the plot to fit the new canon. Which never worked out good and always led to excellent plots being absolutely trashed. Or they would just abandon their story.

I stopped reading fanfic for a few years after DH was released and when I came back to it I remember thinking that all the stories were going to be about post Hogwarts or time travel because they didn't totally interfere with the canon and that's all that people would be willing to write. But I was pleasantly surprised that now people write everything :). I guess with no book releases people feel ok with twisting the canon to how they want, and the readers aren't so excited about the new book they will only read fics with plots that conform to that.

And this went off on a huge tangent...
