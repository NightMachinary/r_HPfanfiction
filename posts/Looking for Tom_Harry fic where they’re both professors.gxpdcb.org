:END:
I read this on ao3 maybe a year ago, and i can't find it again for some reason!! Hope someone can help me out.

They're both professor at Hogwarts, Harry is kind of OOC and ditzy. He's also the divination professor. Tom puts up with him but then they actually begin to become good friends/boyfriends. Harry is friends with Cedric and Cho. Ron and Hermione are both students. It was unfinished when I last read it.

Thanks in advance!
