Hey guys, I'm looking for fics where Harry is a star, as a quidditch player, a a duelist or something entirely different as long as he gets the awe or respect from his chosen profession and not from voldemort/chosen one - prefer non slash - au and dimension travel is also all good üëç


** My mind jumped to something entirely different, where Harry was literally an incarnation of a celestial ball of nuclear hydrogen. Possibly something like one of Luna's heliopaths in a more literal sense or, in a crossover/metaphysical sense, like the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40658-star-shards-chronicles][star shards series]].

#+begin_quote
  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
