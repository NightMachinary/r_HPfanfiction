AU Lily's protection in Harry destroys the horcruxes when Harry touch them. Harry picks up the diary and it screams and crumbles in his hand and the attacks on the muggleborns stop.


** So there is not a piece in him? I already love this prompt, thank you.

*** The way I'd write it, it works as an adaptive defence or immune system against dark magic in general. The Horcrux didn't go away immediately, it took a while for the... Blessing? Enchantment? that his mother put on him to work out how to destroy them, so at some point he just lost the scarcrux. Now that it knows how to deal with it it destroys them on contact, possibly partially draining Harry's magic a bit to recharge itself after the danger has passed.

**** That's actually a good idea. And a better justification to drop Harry at the Dursleys if Lily's charm could get this strong and this smart.

Lily meant to protect Harry and the scarcrux was definitely harmful, so it tracks.

** So if Harry were to walk up to something like the Locket, the Horcrux.exe file would stop working?

*** It would be destroyed like Quirrel was at the end of the first book
