I will start by saying that Rowling has added plenty of details to the story since the release of DH that we all wish she hadn't, but revealing Dumbledore's romantic relationship with Grindelwald isn't one of them. I love this pairing. It just makes sense and I only wish she would have explicitly written it into the story.

Nevertheless, one small circumstance that's always bothered me is that after Grindelwald turns evil and starts his revolution, Dumbledore is left forever alone without a single romantic partner. If we were to mend this and pair Dumbledore with someone after Grindelwald, it would need to be someone he's grown familiar with over the years, someone who is fiercely loyal to him, and someone who still loves him despite his quirks. I can think of no one better than Minerva McGonagall. So many people could see something between them (it was a popular ship before Rowling's revelation) so in the interest of being able to obtain the best of both worlds, is it okay to portray Dumbledore as a bisexual?


** I see no reason why not. Certainly compliant with only the books (though very loosely given that we don't see much of Dumbledore's relationships in the books).

Besides, god knows how many stories there are of Harry being gay for a blonde racist, and that's certainly not canon.

** What saddens me about Rowling's revelation of dumbledore x grindelwald is that most authors seem to have run away with it and begun incorporating into their stories the allegation that dumbledore only attained his greatness because he defeated grindelwald, and then insinuating that he managed to do so by banking on the romantic feelings between the two.

I'd like to believe that dumbledore was hailed as a great wizard not just because he defeated grindelwald (though that certainly catapults him to the pinnacle). He had a love for learning magic---and imparting his wisdom with the youth, if we count the years he'd stayed on as teacher and eventually headmaster at hogwarts. That kind of passion would certainly bring about results, in my opinion.

*** Yeah, Doge's eulogy and Aberforth's words are by and large forgotten and I can admit to being guilty of that. Once you remember who he was in contact with, how he was published, and the awards/recognition he received all /before/ leaving Hogwarts it's easy to separate him from the pack of academics we meet.

** As a gay man, I don't see any problem with making Dumbledore bi in your story. After all, this is called Fan Fiction, not Canon Fiction. If I wanted to read Canon stories, I know where to find a good set of books by J.K. Rowling to read.

That would be like not being allowed to write Harry/Draco slash, as they are not gay in canon.

** "Forever alone without a single romantic partner "... well that is standard true love relationship in HP. No character had more than a true love. Ron never loved Lavanda, Harry's relationship with Cho was doomed from the beginning in the books and Ginny was actually in love with Harry from book 1 even if she had other boyfriends. When we saw characters with someone else, it was never love... But when they find the One? They stick with them, or the idea of them, forever, even if it goes bad.

Rowling has got a Disney movie stand about this in the books.

** It's /your/ story. If you want Dumbledore to be bi? Then he's bi. I mean, if we can completely re-write the series to make it Sevitis/Severitis and give Harry a family that cares about him? Dumbledore can totally be bi. The joy of fanfic is asking 'what if...' and seeing where it ends up.

** He's canonically gay, so portraying him as bisexual would be erasing that, and would be very disrespectful. If it's hard for you to understand, consider how often gay people are pressured to like the opposite gender. Taking a gay man and deciding he'd be better off/happier with a woman is never not going to be homophobic. I mean - not to sound harsh, but he's literally the only canonically gay character in the series. Deciding he shouldn't be gay is in poor taste. It seems to be a common thing in HP fics, unfortunately.

Inb4 - erasing a canonically gay character and making a canon straight character gay/bi in fic are obviously are two very different things, and aren't comparable. One is erasing a poorly represented & discriminated against group for homophobic reasons, and one is completely harmless at worst, and a fun form of forging representation and reflection at best. Should be obvious to anyone with common sense.

*** Dude. You're harming your own movement with this sorta shit. This is the one thing that just /shouldn't/ be policed. Anyone is free to love anyone they want, and anyone is free to ship anyone with anyone thet want. Saying that turning someone gay is okay, yet turning someone straight is not okay is just plain fucked up.

I can /maybe/ see this being an argument with characters in modern TV series whose whole personality is being straight/gay, but when it comes to characters to whom their sexuality isn't even in their top ten traits, it's fucking /irrelevent/.

**** ‘harming your own movement' ‘policing' Yes, because me on the internet saying it's obviously pretty creepy for straight ppl to wish gay ppl weren't gay is the major roadblock for LGBT rights worldwide. I better tell the news what I've done to the community, I'm so sorry.

Jeez, but you sound so sheltered and condescending when you say shit like that. If you actually cared about the ‘movement', you'd be making an effort to listen to LGBT voices and would be thinking critically about your actions and how they affect societal homophobia. Instead you're... on Reddit defending someone wanting to write Dumbledore/McGonagall fanfiction. Maybe don't pretend to care about the ‘movement', mate.

‘Irrelevant' to you, but you're not the centre of the universe. Maybe sit down and think about people other than yourself from time to time.

****** I was speaking in general, but no, it's really not ‘odd'. First, you're literally asking Reddit's advice on what's homophobic or not. And specifically whether it's cool for you to wish a gay man wasn't gay. It's Common sense to think you'd probably be straight, if you're going to bloody reddit for this question.

******* "Common sense" is an interesting ideological term that you seem very fond of. It allows you to adopt a formulaic and narrow view of the world without the need for really understanding anything. It explains your view of sexuality not as open and malleable, a much more liberatory approach that would be, but as bound by burdensome labels and 'identities' enforced onto you by the oppressor that you seem unable to let go of. What you have is negation, what I want is transcendence. But besides, I'm getting sidetracked. I'll write it anyway. I merely wanted a taste of the responses to decide whether I should publish it. Guten Tag.

**** I'm not talking about literally overwriting canon. That would be impossible... but someone being like ‘hm, I think for fun I'm going to write a story where this gay person isn't gay because I don't want him to be' is still erasing the fact that he's gay. Surely that's clearly a very insensitive thing to do. I think you might be unsure what ‘erasing' means in this context. It's not literal.

***** Again, this is a fanfic group. Fanfic writers have made all the characters gay at some point in various fics. Gay erasure isn't an issue here. There's probably some story where absolutely all the characters except Dumbledore are gay.

****** Ik there's like nothing I can say to make u lot listen to LGBT ppl on this one, but the lack of critical thought is always hilarious. Completely ignoring my second paragraph, and no concept of punching down. Shockingly, like I said, making straight characters gay in a fic and making the only gay character not gay are very different things. I mean... common sense, man. A poor person losing ten bucks and a rich person losing ten bucks will have very different consequences.. I don't know how to explain to you that not everything is black and white.

Out of genuine curiosity for you lot - do you apply this across the board? Like if there was One Black person in a piece of media, and some fic writer was like whining about how they want to make them white in their fics and wrote a bunch of fics where they're white & cried abt free speech whenever ppl criticised them, you'd just be like 👍 sounds innocent and harmless to me. genuinely curious.

******* If fic writers regularly made all the white characters black, then yes, making the one black character white for a change would be fine.

If fanfiction were an exclusively heterosexual zone, you'd have a bit of a point, but it's not and you don't.
