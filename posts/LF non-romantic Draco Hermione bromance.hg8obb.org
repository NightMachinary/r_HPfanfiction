They're both so smart and could do great things if Draco wasnt a nazi, do you know any fics where they're friends? Obviously, Draco would have learned to be a better person for Hermione do consider him a friend and accomplice. Any redemption bromance fics?

No adultXstudent pairings or wild character bashing please


** Really interested in that too! But as someone said, that usually is a subplot to drarry fic or Snamione fics. I have some great Snamione that feature them as friends, but you're not interested so if I see something around I'll come back here.

** Pro tip! Go to the ao3 tag "hermione granger & draco malfoy" and filter out Dramione.

** Is Draco being smart canon? Because I really can't recall any of it.

*** He's good at Potions and Charms, he's a prefect, and he's in a bunch of NEWT-level classes. Pretty much everything beyond that is fanon, but it doesn't feel wrong or out of character to me when people portray him as being near the top of the class and more interested in books and learning than Harry is. In Draco/Hermione stories, it's a way to give Hermione a boyfriend who shares more of her interests than Ron does, but I think the only times I've seen Draco and Hermione written as platonic nerd bros is as a subplot in Drarry fic.

**** I will happily read drarry fics with that subplot, I am very into drarry! If you recall any of them, please let me know!

Also yes, that's why I think Draco is smart, and also he fixed that vanishing cabinet and managed to bypass the Hogwarts defence system/ward that is supposed to prevent teleportation magic like apparition, which we know was difficult because he nearly gave up on it and cried a lot, but pulled through.

*** Hes average, but probably worka harder than Ron and Harry, but is less taleented. I cant remember Malfoy ever getting the upper hand since first year.

*** If not smart, he's extremely innovative and may have artistic talent . . Like how he designed the badges which still worked years later and came up with that very creative insulting song about Ron. Just a thought .

**** Those badges sucked, he should be embarrassed to think that Potter stinks was a good insult. The badges and Weasley is our King are pure gold though.

I think Malfoy is an above average wizard like Harry and Ron, his talent doesn't seem to be combat though as Harry beats him every time, apart from on the train in 6th year.
