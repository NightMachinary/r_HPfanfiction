You NEED to do human experiments to find a way to win a war. You have a limited amount of enemy soldiers you could experiment on but they have to be kept on separate space stations due to hive minds or you could create mindless clones of yourselves and then base your experiments on those. How do you proceed?

Right now i'n pretty sure I'm going the clone route as it takes a week to create a clone and it only costs like ten thousand galleons in supplies to create versus having the potentially priceless information an enemy holds lost to experimenting on them.

Is a mindless clone(the hypothalamus is there and functioning but the brain is just a hunka unconnected matter) a person or a hunk of meat?

Edit: also, long time no visit, how's everyone?


** How about using transfiguration and experiment on whatever you transformed?

And why does it has to be human experimentation? The mind does not seem to be the catch since you basically want braindead clones. So transfiguring something close enough (eg apes) should do the trick.

** We harvest organs from brain dead people, so experimenting on mindless clones might not be that objectionable.

If the war is going badly, people might develop an "ends justify the means" mentality and excuse a lot of heinous acts.
