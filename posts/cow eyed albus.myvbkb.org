so this one is definitely not for the folks who ‘don't like slash', thanks.

So there are a few fics where Harry goes back to marauder times and becomes the DADA Professor, and a few of those have a good Dumbledore who wants to do good even though he's a pacifist and struggles to let go of his idealism. Are there any of these where Albus finds himself crushing on the powerful Harry rather than trying to dominate him as a grandfather/elder?

I feel like it could be an interesting dynamic, esp if Harry is into dudes too. I don't think it's at all realistic that they'd have a thing, or that Albus would sleep with someone he's in authority of, but I can imagine that the same part of him that fell for Grindelwald back in that day thinking ‘handsome, charismatic and has an inner drive and certainty about his ethics? What a guy'. But more as a winsome older man who is past the days of charming men out of their robes; that sort of ‘if I was a younger man' or ‘this is the type of man I /should/ have been chasing'.

In the seventies he isn't as quite as ‘I'm so old' because he's not yet been though the worst of the first Voldie war; there are still some other Grindelwald vets around a la Wind Shear, the Order of the Phoenix isn't yet at the point where they're getting the shit kicked out of them, their numbers dropping like flies; so that would affect the dynamic too.

I'm not a dude, and while I'm pan, I just don't think it's for me to write; but I do think there is an opportunity for a fic about gay men and their wholesome and sweet feelings that are often overlooked because of libido, and the ways that solidarity can strengthen bonds that the manly manly hetero-loving society will say has no place in battle or whatever. Gay men are strong as fuck in ways others aren't, and gay men who've seen war also have their own issues and traumas and positive experiences too that the rest of us haven't experienced, and I think it could be interesting to see these two in a non polarised (Harry as third side) or familial dynamic.

so yeah, if this appeals to you, have a bunny.

Please no discussion on whether this viewpoint or story thread is valid; and if you're more interested in them actually having a sexual relationship (which is totally valid) please make your own post so that this one says in this lane <3


** While I'm not going to write it, I'd be definetly down to read it. That is a very interesting prompt, I never thought of before

*** Same! I have always been content with familial at most relationship but I was just reading another one of those fics and it could be really beautiful and winsome but I don't feel like I could write it well enough
