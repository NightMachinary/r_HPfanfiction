/Brought to you by four months of lockdown:/

I'm very attached to the word muggles myself and prefer it in fics, however if muggle language trends hold true then words would be redefined to become more palatable. Most likely at a slower rate than in the muggle word as the wizarding world appears slower to change in general.

Those using progressive language would probably have shifted words at least once by the time the next gen reaches Hogwarts with the general population lagging behind in some areas more than others.

The alternatives I commonly see in fics are also problematic in my eyes.

*Mundane*: In my view, this is no better than muggle because it defines muggles as ordinary and therefore not interesting. (Cambridge Dictionary.) This isn't exactly a progressive stance towards considering muggles as having equal worth. Arguably, muggle life isn't even remotely ordinary compared to wizards and muggles are unlikely to describe themselves as uninteresting.

[[https://Dictionary.com][Dictionary.com]] tacks on a few extra adjectives: banal, unimaginative.

I appreciate that some people are going off a different definition (paraphrased from a couple of dictionaries) 'of or relating to this world, universe or earth, as contrasting with heaven or spirituality'

I've seen an argument that only wizards have spirits as they leave ghosts, but in that case the dementors wouldn't have gone for Dudley. Also, we know that when souls are taken from people they're essentially just a living body. Not exactly muggle-friendly.

With regard to wizards being the opposite (making them heavenly or spiritual), this strikes me as continuing the idea that muggles are below wizards in worth.

Though, I can imagine someone coming it up in a board room without any actual input from people who know muggles. (The idea that muggle relatives would be consulted, of course, is slim to none.)

*Non-magical*: I'll admit that non-magical does strike me as something that could have been fielded after the war, again without input. Nevertheless, it defines muggles by what they are not - rather than what they are.

If we take vocabulary changes with regards to minority groups/disability groups in the muggle world, people are fighting against being defined by what they are lacking. Albus Severus Potter goes to school in 2017 so well within this movement in the muggle world.

*Conclusion*:

I've not really got a good answer for what wizards should call muggles (or what on earth they'd say when they find out our plastic is in their drinking water) and I'm shit at naming things, but *it seems to me that a good alternative ought to describe muggle by what they can do - perhaps in terms of electricity or technology*. (Not all muggles have access to these things, but poverty and lack of access to tools like wands exists or education to magic likely exists in the magical world too.)

It also seems to me that fics ought to have different characters using different terms, to reflect that not everyone catches onto terms quickly or willingly. I understand, however, that some people seeking writing or reading an ideal world.

Anyway, what are your thoughts?


** I don't like "mundane" or any of the similar ones for basically the reasons you outline - it's saying that without magic a person is boring.

JKR took Muggle from the British slang "mug" - meaning to mug someone off, or pull the wool over their eyes/fool them - because the idea was the non magical people were being "mugged" into thinking magic doesn't exist. So maybe something along those lines but "the duped" or "the fooled" sounds even worse and "unawares" or something sounds like they think all non magical people are stupid. Hmm. I think in all honesty the etymology of Muggle isn't offensive, as it simply means the wizards are keeping them in the dark about magic, so maybe it wouldn't get changed?

I've always quite liked the term no-maj, since I heard it in Fantastic Beasts but given that's set in the 20s, I think even in America by the 90s they probably use "Muggle" because it's more up to date. But maybe no-maj could be brought back, as it's just short for "non-magical" so factual and inoffensive. Plus some 1920s slang is really cool, and language can be circular.

*** I've seen elsewhere on the forums that 'mug' was slang for a drug in the 1920s. I've never heard of it myself. Personally I've only heard of it in the context of 'you've been mugged off' and 'your ugly mug' (or, simply 'you mug'). If we're using it as an insult among ourselves, perhaps we wouldn't take kindly to all non-magically human's being defined by it.

That said, I do think it sounds 'cuddly' just as JKR intended. I have to admit, there's something about 'no-maj' that I just don't like, but it is to the point.

I suppose a major issue with the wizarding world is that, broadly speaking, they don't see muggles as equal to them so muggle inadvertently becomes an insult. Potentially, it could be for this reason that muggle is swapped out with no-maj which eventually becomes traded in for something else.

I was thinking along the technology/electricity lines myself because it would define muggle by how they solve problems, rather than in relation to what they are not. I found it difficult to think of anything that really defines the difference between muggles and wizards.

The problem with describing Muggles with what they can do (rather than what they can't) it that is risk to also encompass some Magical in that word.\\
Muggle (or non maj) don't have magic, this is what separate them from wizards. In comparaison, even if most choose to not do so, absolutely nothing stop a wizard to live "the Muggle way" with electricity and new technologies.

** I have the francophone wizarding world in my story call Muggles 'Communs' because it's what they are; common. Compared to wizards, who I assume are around 5 to 6 million worldwide, Muggles are just everywhere and so numerous with their seven billion population. If witches and wizards are a rarity in the human population than Muggles are common. Simple as that.

Considering the Parisians called their revolutionary government the 'Commune de Paris', I would think it is a somewhat safe bet.

Edit: I forgot about that, but I reread my notes and it's supposed to be coming from the expression 'le commun des mortels' but over time it was shortened to be less wordy and more casual. I made magical France have a very Ancient RÃ©gime aesthetic and I thought the expression was flowery enough for such a society in addition to being a word that wouldn't raise suspicions like 'No-Maj' and 'Non-Magiques'.

Good luck coming up with a way to make "normal people" a category without it sounding demeaning because, yeah, Rowling wasn't so nice about it.

** The people who would have the most input would be muggleborns.

It would come from what they would rename themselves as.

I doubt the term muggleborn would be kept. Whatever term the muggleborns would use to rename themselves would have a large effect on what muggles would be known as.

What do terms do you think a muggleborn would use to describe themselves and their non-magical relatives?

*** Naming things has never been forte. Having given it some thought, I think the term could be themed around electricity. tl;dr: the only rubbish things I could come up with was something like Voltons/Voltas, Electros... see, rubbish and most don't really fit with English either.

Initially, I was thinking electricity or technology but the more I think about it, wizards can charm technology to run off magic. As yet, they cannot stop magic interfering with electricity itself. Essentially, wizards and muggles are using two different power sources.

So, a wizard could mimic living as a muggle with enchanted technology, but unless they eschew magic it would be difficult for them to engage or develop muggle technology. Using enchanted muggle objects isn't really any different to muggles living their lives with enchanted objects. Given Arthur's job, it seems likely that muggles can use magical objects even if they can't perform magic.

My person, unfounded, suspicion is mimicking electricity is somewhat difficult (although magic progresses also) and while enchanting self limiting objects might be fairly simple (old cars, toasters, a TV/DVD set up), it could be much more challenging to enchant modern items such as cars with digital controls, access to the internet in magic dense areas (for example, getting the cables themselves to function).

**** I've been thinking about this too. I actually got so mad I spent like 5hrs going through root words to see if any of the words attached would fit the bill.

The way I would think about it would be more of like a branch or divergent point. Not so much what you were born with exactly, but where you branched off.

If divergent wasn't already taken by a bad YA book and movie, I would work along those lines

Like it has a completely separate culture with its own âscienceâ fields.

So it's not so much the magic itself now. It's the magic and the culture it's attached to.

Non magical is probably the easiest term to work with.

Unfortunately, wizarding superiority complexes would never leave.

Can you imagine the unholy nightmare scenario shitshow that would be the magical world reveal?

It's where a lot of this thought process came from.

The animal poaching alone would be hell.

Too much brain time went into this. I did learn a lot about root words though. How do etymologists live like that? How

** I have been playing with the idea that Muggleborns band together to not only rebrand themselves as 'newbloods' or 'youngbloods' but call purebloods 'oldbloods'. The trouble is I find it unrealistic even just in my head that they could make it stick. Then what if another English speaking country, like the US, spearheaded the change? It could be more realistic if we give a background like most wizards being Muggleborn there since purebloods don't leave their home countries. But, again, it's all just playing in my head.

** u/asifbaig:
#+begin_quote
  Nevertheless, it defines muggles by what they are not - rather than what they are.
#+end_quote

But isn't that exactly why there is need for a separate name for them? Otherwise wizards and muggles can both be called "people". Wizards are people who can wield magic. Then there are people who cannot wield magic. Nothing is stopping a wizard from doing pretty much anything a muggle could do.

As far as I can tell, and correct me if I'm wrong, the only reason one would want to refer to "muggles" is in a context where their inability to wield/perceive magic would be relevant. Otherwise there wouldn't any issue with just calling them "people".

*** I agree it is difficult to define muggles because wizards could live as muggles quite easily.

I would argue that the two major differences are culture - firstly neither muggles nor wizards have a single unifying culture but nonetheless they are culturally distinct from each other.

Secondly, magic interferes with electricity so wizards would have to eschew magic to live a truly muggle life. Certainly, muggle items can be bespelled to run off magic, but fundamentally magic and electricity are incompatible. A wizard who lives entirely or near entirely like a muggle wouldn't culturally be part of the wizarding world. Such people are also rare enough that, on the whole, the definition would work. No definition, after all, is perfect.

I suppose what I mean is that terms such as non-magical define muggles by a negative attribute, as though their only worth is in relation to wizards. We know this is an embedded value because the wizarding world literally have a statute of muggles holding up wizards. Language shapes the way people view things and by having terms which define people (or things) as lacking, we come to view them as such.

My suggestion is that a more equal term would define muggles by something they can do /are rather than resting with the assumption that magical is default.

Examples of this in the real world include the backlash against hearing loss/hearing impairment with people preferring to be called d/Deaf and the less tasteful (imo) hard of hearing.

Another example is in the autism (and increasingly other developmental disabilities) community where the average person is called 'neurotypical' and rather than being atypical or non-neurotypical, the term 'neurodiverse' has picked up.

I believe there's a push for differently abled and a not entirely separate push for the social model of disability - it's the environment which is disabling, not people. (Dys meaning ' bad, ill, abnormal, impaired, difficult'.)

I agree that ideally, the term muggle would only be used when talking about magic. Unfortunately, I think that would be a very long term aspiration due to the necessity of keeping the wizarding world secret.
