Due to a misunderstanding, a younger student thinks there's no Fred and George Weasley, but rather a Fredandgeorge Weasley; a singular being inhibiting two bodies and everyone's just too polite to mention it. After having a laugh over the silly theory, the twins calmly try to put it to rest by showing they're two distinct people. It proves /much harder/ than they expected.


** I think that the truth of the matter is, no one knows who is Fred and who is George. Their parents had a hard enough time keeping track of them as infants, but trying to keep track of five other kids made it impossible to keep track of the twins. After a few years of getting confused for each other, they decided it didn't matter who was who, they were both Fred. They were both George.

*** I actually don't agree with this. I think Fred is in general a lot more...callous? Maybe that's not fair, because he isn't malicious, but George is definitely the kinder of the two. Just a little more sensitive to feelings, and his words aren't as sharp.

If you look at their speech when they're together, it's usually Fred starting whatever they're into, and George responding. When they leave the school during OOTP, it's Fred saying “I think we're done with full time education, don't you think?” And George responding “I was thinking the same thing.” Most of their interactions have this patter.

So yeah George is the more sensitive and kind one, while Fred is the more active, startery one

**** There was an excellent essay about this very subject! I can't remember the full details.

Fred is the instigator in most of their antics and is effectively the driver, so to speak. He's a risk-taker and has a fierce temper. He's the one who wants to ask Harry if he remembers what Voldemort looks like. He's literally driving the Ford Anglia to rescue Harry. He's the one who gets the idea to blackmail Bagman. Contrasting George who is able to be restrained by Harry, it takes all three Chasers to keep him from breaking Malfoy's jaw when he insults his mother.

George is far kinder. He is the first to notice Harry is struggling with his trunk and calls on Fred to help them hoist it onto the Express. He's the one who offers to write Ginny (Fred offers to send a Hogwarts toilet seat). He's the one who wonders how the family is going to afford to pay for all the Lockhart books. He's more argumentative with Wood during the Rogue Bludger incident and is actively angry that Wood is risking Harry's safety. He's the one who's actively anxious about blackmailing Bagman. George is the one who helps a small first-year to her feet after they test a product on her.

Edit: I remembered a few more aspects.

When Arthur is injured at the Ministry and Molly finally is able to come back to Grimmauld Place, George is the only Weasley child other than Ginny who runs to hug her. George is a momma's boy.

****** I think I have that essay. I was impressed enough to keep it as a reference because I use the Twins a lot. It may have been taken down as Googling passages from it returns nothing.

I would post it.... but I'm not sure how the Mods would feel about a 1000-word wodge ot text dumped into the forum.

******** I just private messaged it.... though re-reading it suggest it may not be the one [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir]] was referring to. It makes valid points, but not the ones CryptidGrimnoir mentions.

**** Yes! I don't like Hermione/Fred stories but I like Hermione/George. It's not my favorite pairing, but I'll read it.
