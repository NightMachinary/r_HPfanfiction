I'm looking for fics where harry doesn't really care about voldemort and have no intention of fighting him. He just want to learn magic and be left alone

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjWe31S_0g]]


** To add on to this, it would be hilarious to read a fic where Harry doesn't care either way about Voldemort and just goes about his business at Hogwarts as usual. Voldemort keeps trying to kill him but it never works out, despite the fact that Harry does absolutely nothing to work against Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
