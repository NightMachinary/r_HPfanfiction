** Any first name not associated with his family or his accomplishments would be better.

Based on his canon personality and the attention he dealt with based on his unearned celebrity as a child I personally think he would do everything he could not to saddle his kids with the same thing. Having the last name 'Potter' would already set them apart...naming them 'James' or 'Lily' would add even more of a spotlight.

I would have much preferred if his kids were named randomly or after people in Ginny's family. It's extremely corny but Arthur would have been infinitely better than Albus.

#+end_quote

I actually think it would be much more of a problem for Albus. Everybody knows who Albus Dumbledore is, and it's a big name that comes with a lot of expectations. But at that point, original James and Lily are most likely footnotes in the history books. In fics, everybody comments on how James is just like his namesake, but how would people know that? Most people who knew James and Lily are dead, and those few who aren't didn't even talk with Harry about his parents much.

I would disagree about James and Lily being reduced to historical footnotes, though. Dying so tragically and heroically, especially at such a young age, would most likely lead to their myth only growing over the years.

** Albus Rubeus. To this day I maintain that Albus was not a bad choice. I love Dumbledore's character and his relationship with Harry, it's one of my favorite things about the series honestly. It stands out a little next to his other kids' names, but I like it, especially if they're using a nickname like Al.

Tbh I get why Harry named his son after Snape - I couldn't fathom it for a long time until JKR mentioned that the ‘Severus' part was simply out of guilt which...is 100% Harry. I still hate it though lol and I think Hagrid definitely deserved to be honored. He and Harry had an incredibly important relationship, not to mention that comment JKR made once about Dumbledore and Hagrid being two sides of the same father figure coin for Harry & symbolizing the white and red components of alchemy. There were other people that were significant to Harry too, but James, Sirius, Remus, and Arthur have already been recognized and used for other kids.

Albus Rubeus is fucking perfection and I'm still mad about it.

**** To be fair this is brought up fairly often as a case against all or most of their children's names coming from Harry, but I don't think that's exactly true.

People forget that Ginny had four other surviving, procreating siblings to carry on family names, and Harry had zero. Ginny married Harry because, obviously, she loved him. Wouldn't it follow that she would want to honor the people who meant the most to her husband, who protected him and died for him and loved him? Not to mention Ginny's no doormat. She's not going to carry and birth three children and then not care what they're named. For all we know, she might have suggested using James, Lily, etc.

As far as her having hung out with Hagrid, I don't know, we don't really see them together apart from when Ginny was hanging around Hagrid's hut in CoS. But couples don't have to have an equally close relationship with somebody to use their name for a child.

** I think it would have been perfectly fair and in character for Harry to leave certain names, like Remus and Fred, for others to use.

I think Colin (who represents a very pure version of Gryffindor bravery) and Regulus (who had the courage to change his mind and die for both that and a house elf) very much deserve to be honoured. They are the people the wizarding world might forget.

****** Okay. My original comment was kind of a joke because he's an unimportant character in canon and I don't think Harry even knows his name let alone name his child after him. But it should be interesting to so he him more developed.
