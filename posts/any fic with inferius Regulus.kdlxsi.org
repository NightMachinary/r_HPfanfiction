or a prompt.

I want any fic that has Regulus as inferius.

I imagine someone gets to the inferi cave and discovers which one is Regulus and takes him. could be Harry, Sirius, Kreacher... whatever. it could end with a cure or it could be crack, I don't care.

or maybe Regulus himself regains consciousness and leaves the cave... or is stuck in the cave undead until Dumbles comes with Harry...

or someone tries to make an inferi army, gets all the inferi and... idk, Sirius recognizes him in the battle.

anything. I honestly never saw this in a fic.


** An inferius is made from dead bodies right? Why and how would you cure death?

*** anything is possible in love and fanfiction. was it actually ever detailed what inferi are? I'm sure there are some zombie movies where it gets cured. what if it's like in that new /I legend/ movie, where the zombies actually have some mind left.

there is literally a stone that resurrects people. ok, maybe that doesn't count cause it doesn't really work like that, but... FANFICTION!

also, it doesn't have to get a cure. I just want inferius Reggie.

hell, Frankenstein's monster is just made from dead bodies and he is alive. come on, a little bit of imagination to our boring everyday lives.

Sort of. This is about the extent of it (from HBP), but TL:DR is they're reanimated bodies with nobody home that have been programmed via magic to do things.

Chapter 4, Horace Slughorn:

#+begin_quote
  “Er ... right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn't very clear.”

  “They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard's bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. ... He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. ...”
#+end_quote

Chapter 21, The Uknowable Room (the ghosts are transparent conversation)

#+begin_quote
  “The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.”

***** Thanks for the evidence.

I think what OP wants is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_Man]] with Regulus Black as the hero, or corpse, in any case.

  An accident with the Resurrection Stone has far-reaching consequences. In which the remnants of the war, the cursed and the damned, band together in some attempt to salvage what they can from the disappointment that is the Wizarding World post-war.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/632600][Crow Rides a Pale Horse]] series, a sort of undead Regulus eventually becomes a character. Great series.
