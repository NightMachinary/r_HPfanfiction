Anyone know any fics that aren't slapstick or too over-the-top?


** Whats your threshold for over the top?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] are both fics that are funny, but also follow a plotline that isn't /just/ comedic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] is a oneshot with Harry and Neville drunkenly lamenting their underlings poor writing skills.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] has hilarious moments, but isn't really a comedy, despite the sorting hat's best efforts to the contrary.

** /The Inner Eye of Harry Potter/ was never finished, but is worth a read if you want some comedy. Harry Potter, if he was raised by Trelawney.

/The Seventh Horcrux/ is very funny. What if the horcrux in Harry took control early in his life, and tried to one day achieve its original ambition - becoming DADA teacher?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by The Carnivorous Muffin has a number of laugh out loud moments while not being crack (despite the description).

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5713064/1/Little-Red-Courgette][Little Red Courgette]], if you're a fan of political/bureaucratic satire, specifically Yes, Minister.

** I seriously /cannot/ recommend Shoebox Project enough! It's Marauders era and full of crazy shenanigans. Not only is it hilarious (first and only fanfic to literally make me laugh out loud) but it creates a whole new depth for the HP universe. It's full of hand drawn illustrations and is just awesome. Only thing that can be a possible deterrent is that it is eventual slash (Sirius/ Remus). [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/page/4/]] Enjoy!
