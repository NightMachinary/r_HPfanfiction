So I just finished the latest chapter in the HP/Dragonriders of Pern crossover, "Beneath Sovereign Skies" by Bobmin356, and I'm rather desperate for more of the same type.

It doesn't have to be crossover, and it certainly doesn't have to be about dragons. Phoenix, elves, thestrals, I don't care, any other stories like this series?

For those of you who have NO idea what I'm talking about, here are links to the stories so far.
