In sixth year, Romilda Vane gives Harry a pack of chocolate cauldrons which have been spiked with love potion. Hermione has, prior to this, warned him that she was trying to potion him so he doesn't eat them.

​

As a twist to the normal love potion plot, Harry eats the cauldrons, due to not receiving or believing the warning from Hermione. This causes problems as he has already been dosed with a love potion keyed to someone else...


** Could it cause a condition with strange symptoms? What symptoms?

Tbh, I'd imagine that the quality, potency, and time it was administered would affect which potion would work, 1 would work, the other wouldn't.

​

Maybe it'd cause the person to want a threesome? I dunno.

*** I kind of figured it would cause a horrific condition where the person is caught between loving two people exclusively as both potions catch them in a tug of war. It would certainly cause a hospital wing visit and possibly involve st Mungo's depending on effects.

**** Perhaps, but love potions pretty much make you love (or maybe actually more like lust) for someone, and you can lust for more than one person at a time, right?

** Putting aside who they are keyed to, love potions could be like Veritaserum where too much is a bad thing, possibly even lethal. Harry would still be getting a double dose.

Hell, it could be two different kinds of love potions. The Weasley twins had a full line of different varieties in their joke shop. Potion A and B could be different, but mixed together could create some weird effect.

After that, worrying how the interactions between the two different targets could work. The mental gymnastics of that would be... weird. Would he want a threesome/harem? Would he temporarily or permanently go insane? Would it overload the scarcrux with enough artificial "love" that it instantly exorcises itself to get away with it? Would he swear off the female gender and instantly profess his love for Sna- Okay, that last one went too far. I apologize.
