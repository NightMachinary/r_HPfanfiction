In canon, the only examples I can think of are the Unbreakable Vow and the Goblet of Fire (Hermione's DA list may or may not apply). In fanon, there are a LOT more, from Wizard's Oaths to various types of contract. When searching on the subreddit there was no discussion I found on if and how these could work; some came close but quickly became derailed onto discussing crackfic exploitation (which is hilarious but not what I was looking for).

My current thoughts: - Wizard's Oaths (I swear on my life and magic, etc etc) seem kinda pointless as truth-telling is already covered by veritaserum and darker options, such as the Imperious. I guess they could be an outdated attempt to assure honesty, but the idea of losing one's magic seems incredibly heavy handed. I can imagine that it may cast a compulsion on yourself to keep to the agreement, but I have no clue what a suitable punishment would be for breaking your word. If they are "less serious" than the Unbreakable Vow then the consequences should be a lot less damaging. - Unbreakable Vow: these seem pretty straightforward and I have less issue with these. You break your word? You die. They are intended for serious things and are never entered into lightly. - Position-related contracts and oaths: I saw an interesting fic where bindings attached to honorary positions were a way to keep powerful wizards under societal control. I think this is a bit too dystopian for the HP universe, but it was interesting nonetheless. - Where does the magic come from to enforce these? In one fic it was from the mage's own magic, which is why such agreements are generally frowned upon. "Tying up" one's magic in this way is considered similarly to a breach on one's rights.

TL;DR So, what do you all think? Do they exist? Should they? How do they work?


** I have no problem with them existing, but I have a problem with how quick fanfic characters are to throw around vows under pain of death just to show how deadly serious he is and how correct he is in a situation. It's pretty shitty storytelling.

I like the idea of the Unbreakable Vow being on its own tier of magic. I've posted this idea before, but there are concepts that seem to bring about an innate power. There's a certain power in giving your word and not breaking it, just as there is a certain power in putting your trust in someone elses hands (such as the Fidelius)

** Contracts and oaths make sense as we have them in the real world. But in fanon so many involve losing your magic, and I just can't see that as realistic. To many wizards (mostly purebloods, but I can see some muggleborns not wanting to go back to a pre-magic existence either), losing your magic would be worse than death. They'd much rather be dead than suffer the indignity of being a squib. I believe that's why the Unbreakable Vow kills you instead of taking your magic. So personally, yes on contracts and oaths, no on always losing your magic (especially in the Triwizard Tournament). Be creative people and come up with alternate consequences and curses.

-leave you unable to speak so you can't speak more lies -give you bad luck -make you infertile - disfigure your face like Hermione did -cripple your hands so you can't sign more contracts

See, I agree with your main point that "at risk of your magic" is used far too frequently in magical contracts or oaths as a rule in HP fanfiction, but I'm actually ok with it as a punishment for violating the rules of the Triwizard Tournament. The Goblet of Fire is clearly a very powerful device that would have the ability to enforce such a clause and it follows that their would be major consequences for failing to fulfill one's duties as a champion. Bear in mind that the Tournament has been around almost a full millennia, and while we (and modern wizards) might consider it barbaric to put that much at stake to ensure participation, it isn't hard to believe that wasn't the case in prior centuries. Furthermore, it gives weight to the "you have to compete" logic in GoF, where the "why" was left unexplained.

**** I understand what you're saying and if it were explained as such in fics I wouldn't mind it as much either. However, it tends to get thrown about so casually in some GoF fics that it makes me think of the author as less capable of writing a well thought out story.

As for why Harry had to compete being unexplained in canon, before reading fanon it seemed to me as if it were only because Crouch Sr. was under the imperius and Dumbledore wanted to see what happened to try to get the other side to tip their hand. So I don't need the extra explanation to satisfy my headcanon, but I see the appeal to you.

So IMHO the "you have to compete" isn't because Harry truly has to compete (he could sit the Tournament out without any consequences - at least until after the first task, because that shows that he accepts being a competitor which also means he accepts all the rules and what not governing the Tournament! Entering people into contracts without them having a choice IMHO is a bad plot-device (why not make a freaking artifact that forces Voldemort to go to Azkaban if he doesn't want to lose his magic? Sorry, but the Goblet kind of is the ultimate weapon if it can do that to unwilling people! You could control the entire population with it...just enter all their names and force them to do exactly what the ministry says...if not? Instant squip...this way the purebloods would rule of the muggleborns with an iron fist and they would be slaves! So nope, this wasn't well thought out on Rowling's side!)), IMHO it's Dumbledore's wish that he competes (same for the Ministry!)

**** Curses like the imperius are difficult to cast; I think having a contract force someone to do something would be difficult. Perhaps it's only a specific kind of super serious contract set up by some super special person that actually forces someone to do something. Perhaps lesser contracts can inspire people to do things without making it so they have no choice but to do whatever the contract says. Like compulsion charms, confundus, and anti-muggle wards that don't make someone do something outright, but rather inspire strong feelings in them that encourage them to do whatever it is they're supposed to do.

But instead of compelling someone to do something, why can't a contract have different consequences? Say a marriage contract that if broken curses the breaking party with sterility. Or a marriage contract between enemies for political purposes that states if one party physically hurts the other, they'll have that same pain visited upon them. A business contract that when breached awards the innocent party with certain assets of the breaker.

** I don't object to any fanon magical invention, provided it is sufficiently well explained and integrated into the story's world. That said, I think there are several issues at hand with such oaths and magical contracts:

1) We must distinguish between contracts and promises to undertake or to refrain from some future action, on the one hand, and magical 'truth detectors' on the other. As far as the latter are concerned, we know that canonically the Imperius can be resisted by someone with a powerful enough will, and legilimency can be blocked by occlumency. I believe JKR has stated that good enough occlumency can stop veritaserum as well (which would imply that the potion prevents you from knowingly thinking one thing and saying another); even if that is not canon, I can still think of ways around it. For instance, suppose you obliviate yourself (or have someone do it for you), or that you temporarily remove a memory from your head (as Snape did in OOTP whilst teaching occlumency), or somehow convince yourself to entirely believe your lie. In general, I think if wizards really had a 100% insurmountable anti-lying device, it would have to either have a really serious cost to its use (such as the unbreakable vow, below), or else we would see it used for anything moderately important.

2) It is not made entirely clear how exactly the unbreakable vow acts upon its subject---does it exert a compulsion, or merely come in to force when the task is failed? Does it warn the subject when he is about to violate his promise? More importantly, how does it assign responsibility? Take the HPB example: Snape swore to keep Draco safe and help him complete his mission. Suppose Draco were killed somewhere beyond Snape's reach or knowledge, say he gets hit with an AK by a dark!Harry outside Borgin & Burke's at the start of the year, or better yet within the Room of Requirement. Does the vow then kill Snape too? How can it objectively judge if he had done everything in his power (because nobody is infinitely powerful or omniscient) to fulfil his promise? Does it rely instead on one's self-assessment of the same---in which case it can be deceived as above if you can convince yourself that you've done everything you can?

3) Now with Wizards' Oaths (or whatever you call them) as an affirmation of truth, as they are often used in fanon, we run into all of the above problems. Firstly, how exactly does it determine truth (or, rather, determine that you are not lying) and how can one be sure it works all of the time? Because for it to be used as it's used in such stories, there /cannot/ be a way around it, else it would carry no weight greater than your word. Moreover, what exactly are you promising? That you /won't/ lie about this specific thing to these specific people? In that case you run into the problem of magical compulsion in (2). That you /haven't/ lied about what you have just said? Then we're back to the problems of making magical truth machines foolproof, as seen in (1).

4) I do agree with what many in this thread have suggested, viz. that to a wizard, forsaking his magic is almost a fate worse than death. In which case, taking an oath on your magic is more or less equal to an unbreakable vow---so if you feel so determined, why not do that?

5) If there exist lesser oaths (i.e. ones which risk something less than your life or magic) then they are next to useless, for they suggest that you are hiding something after all, and we're back to the reliability of your word as a guiding principle.

Finally, as an indispensable element of free will, the ability to lie is an essential part of human nature, I think. The only way we've found around this 'prisoner's dilemma' is to play the game again, and again, and again. Build trust and reputation: the more you tell the truth, the greater the expectation you will do so in the future. I don't think the authors who write stories in which your truthfulness can be determined with a simple flash of the wand truly understand the full repercussions of that on people's relationships. It's one of those things which sound great in theory, but would make life as we know it unimaginable. Suppose you are possessed with jealousy, like Shakespeare's Othello---why wouldn't you force your Desdemona to swear a magical oath eventually? And when you did that, what they would happen to your marriage? Your friendships? In short, why would you ever want to trust anyone /if you didn't have to/?

** I prefer magical contracts like the DA list: Break the agreement, and suffer the curse placed on it. Or pay a Curse-Breaker to deal with it before you break it - though that'll usually cost more thn breaking the contract will save you.

I prefer to ignore the Unbreakable Vow, yes, it's often taken too lightly in fanon, but if your life is on the line if you can't prove your innocence, then who wouldn't take a vow to speak the truth for 5 minutes or so? And that's not even touching the question why a Dark Lord wouldn't require a vow frm all his followers. Or the Ministry wouldn't require a vow in special circumstances. And so on. The unbreakable vow is a plot-wrecker and doesn't even add anything to canon.

*** My personal theory is that the vow requires /absolute/ trust between the two parties for it to work. The person the vow is being made to must absolutely believe that person making the vow will keep their word, and the person making the vow must absolutely believe they will keep their word.

So in a courtroom setting this wouldn't really work because no one could be absolutely certain that the person on trial would actually tell the truth and someone on trial couldn't be certain of their own 100% honesty, making an unbreakable vow difficult if not impossible. And Voldemort likely has never trusted anyone in his life, so that counts him out. The vow only works when made between people who trust each other closely, and is more a symbol of that trust than anything else.

***** A vow is an affirmation of trust. You make promises to friends even if you trust them. The Unbreakable Vow would be just that - the ultimate unbreakable bond of trust, being willing to die rather than break your word.

If you reread the scene in HBP, Narcissa never once mistrusts Severus. Just the opposite, she goes to beg his help specifically /because/ he's the only one she can trust to protect Draco. She even says why; Snape has always protected Draco at school, is an old friend of Lucius', and is the Dark Lord's most trusted servant. He's not just anybody to her.

She comes to him believing he is one of the few she can trust:

#+begin_quote
  “Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?” Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair. “Yes, Severus. I --- I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .”
#+end_quote

She's willing to reveal the Dark Lord's plan for Draco to him despite being forbidden not to speak of it, and is relieved to learn he is so trusted that he already knows it:

#+begin_quote
  “It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice. “I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.” “I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, breathing more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. . . .”
#+end_quote

And she lays out her belief that she trusts Snape can help quite explicitly:

#+begin_quote
  . . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius's old friend. . . . I beg you. . . . You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him --- ?”
#+end_quote

And finally, her request that the vow be made is absolutely not one born out of mistrust. Just the opposite, it is a bond of trust between herself and Snape:

#+begin_quote
  “Severus --- oh, Severus --- you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?” “I can try.” She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape's feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it. “If you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?”
#+end_quote

Her trust is born of out desperation, perhaps, but she absolutely trusts Snape to help Draco. So they make an Unbreakable bond of mutual trust.

There are other interpretations sure, but mine is an entirely acceptable canon-based one which helps make Unbreakable Vows more workable.

3. Again, you are referring to canon as well as fanon. When did I say I wanted the world to be bland? My thinking process is as follows:

   - Fanon creates useful spell/artefact/whatever (i.e. Wizard Oaths)
   - How does it work?
   - What is its place in the world? Is it useful?
   - If it is useful, why isn't it used in every case? Is there a cost?

As in, you have a way in which to check the truth. Yet in both canon and fanon, people still lie. How? In canon Veritaserum is a controlled substance and difficult to brew, and the Imperious is illegal. In fanon, oaths are bandied about willy-nilly when plot relevant and otherwise cease to exist (in the majority of fanworks). The base idea is good, but as they stand they simply /do not make sense in the setting/. Hence, discussion.

** Canon includes too many instances of magically-enforced vows to toss out the idea entirely. I think there are different sorts of magically-relevant vows, depending on the criticality of the trust required.

I've used them in my stories but they're one of several functional changes I'd make if I were to do rewrites. One thing I always included, though, was the idea that a vow has to be between two different people. If someone vows, another has to accept it for it to have any meaning- such a thing is essentially a verbal contract, and the weight of it has to even out somehow. You can't promise someone to never lie to them if there's no way to judge how dangerous the truth-telling would get.

What I find intriguing about the Unbreakable Vow is that there's a third party involved- Snape has been accused of being untrustworthy, so enters a contract to fulfill some specfic obligations within the next year... as evaluated by Bellatrix. While it isn't explained thus, it suggests that Snape's compliance with the vow is going to be by her judgement rather than his own or Narcissa's.

That's the point of Magic, there's a lot of pointless things that happen but make it ultimately more wonderful.

I see your point about the severity of the punishment making the vow effective, but "Do Or Die" approaches are uncommon in most agreements and vows normally, so I thought there might be lesser alternatives.

Someone else pointed out that the Goblet is ancient and the heavy-handedness would make more sense in the historical context, so I'm warming up to that idea.

Sorry for the assumption about the "hows" and "whys" of Magic - my personal headcanon is that it follows rules but that they make sense thematically, narratively and emotionally rather than strictly logically; so that base assumption was underlying my OP.

What I despise, however, is the self-binding "raises wand and swears on his magic such and such" vow. It breaks all sorts of things with regards to character interaction and plot holes. And on top of that, I just can't fathom how that would even work. How do you bind your own magic with itself? I imagine it would be like trying to tie a knot with taffy, or trying to lick your own elbow, or pull yourself up by your shoelaces. It would just mold back into itself and you're back at square one or it just 'wouldn't bend that way'.

** Unfortunately, due to how vows work in most fanon stories, this is exactly what people should be doing if they wanted to act rationally and get people's trust. However, the rest of the society clearly shows that this is not how their world works. Therefore, we need to look at rules that make more sense in the setting. The rules should not give an easy way out of situations (e.g. /"I swear on my magic that I tell the truth"/) but can create interesting situations (/"I swear to kill Albus Dumbledore"/).

My oaths are subjective. There is no all-knowing force judging whether people keep their contracts. Whether an oath is broken is determined by the unconscious mind of the involved people. This is important because this stops many exploits. When you swear to speak the truth, you can still lie if you are convincingly.

A contracts works similar to a list of oaths. Unlike oaths, they become active when all parties have signed the document. In addition, breaking one oath typically voids the rest of the contract. This is typically used in high-class business transactions and requesting a magical-binding contract may increase the price a lot.

** I don't have a problem with those working - as long as you have to enter them willingly (so nope: Using the Imperius-Curse doesn't work, neither do drugs/potions/alcohol (so no signing a binding magical contract while stoned/shitfaced or drugged up!) and neither do things like the Goblet of Fire (using someone's signature from somewhere to enter somebody into such a contract simply can't be done!) or long term enslavement magic (the Imperius isn't a long term spell IMHO, unless the target is weak willed and already kind of wants to do the things you force it to do!) unless you willingly entered (so you put your own name into the goblet, then yes: It can bind you!)) and they only work if you have all the information (if the other party lied or cheated, then the oath/contract simply is un-enforceable!)

they're tools at a writers disposal. use them badly and the story will be bad. do not use them badly and there's no problem.
