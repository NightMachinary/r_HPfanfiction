As an example, why did Albus place the Philosophers stone under so many 'protections' only to destroy it in the end? What was the point? Is Dumbledore really the manipulative-test-enthusiastic coot portrayed in many fanfics?

I'm just curious about which parts in the books/movies made your raise you eyebrows and question the logic.

Thanks!

Uh, where did you get this information? Coz I'm quoting below straight from the /Half Blood Prince/, where they say it works for up to 24 hours at a time; that's worse that roofies. And no, they never acknowledge how dangerous it can be; they're selling it openly in the shop.

  Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” she asked.

The only reason Love Potions are treated cavalierly is because they were used on men by women in the books, and not the other way around. That is still treated as a joke by a lot of people while the opposite would've been a PR disaster.

Narcissa was involved in the conspiracy that lured six teenagers to battle with a dozen Death Eaters and got Sirius killed. She was involved and had information on the plot to kill Dumbledore. She was involved in waging war against the government. She was involved in keeping Luna and Ollivander prisoner in her house. She watched while her sister tortured Hermione. She would've gladly handed Harry and co over to Voldemort. Just because she loved her son doesn't wash away her crimes. Love is not some transcendental force that makes you a good person. Most criminals love someone or the other; it doesn't make them immune to prosecution. She is still a shitty person and a criminal who should be in prison.

#+begin_quote

Not really. He willingly became a Death Eater; it was only when he realised that he might fail and there would be dire consequences to failure that he had second thoughts. He was a coward, not remorseful. He nearly killed Katie and Ron. He could've killed Rosmerta, Leanne, Harry and Slughorn. He led Death Eaters inside a school full of children, one of them a feral werewolf. Then consider his last actions in the war. Even though he had the option of evacuation, he chose to remain behind and attacked Harry so that he could hand him over to Voldemort.

Lucius is even /worse/.

******* Pay more attention to what happened IRL. Clue: there were a lot of party members, i.e. Nazis. Even quite important/significant Nazis didn't necessarily get life sentences.

Draco is pretty clearly meant to be a Hitler Youth... starts off as a bully being indoctrinated, ends up getting thrown on the front lines with no particular attachment to anything other than his own skin. His choices aren't "free" unless you believe both that "your money or your life" is a "free" choice (some people do) and that there is no truth to the Jesuit boast (i.e. "give me the boy to the age of seven and I will show you the man").

Of course, this is a part of the books which is less... consistent than some of the other bits. Dumbledore's "our choices define us" bit is somewhat in tension with those ideas because it supposes that choices exist to be freely made. But that's from CoS. By the time of HBP Voldemort appears to have been destined for evil since he can't love and therefore can't choose to love. Given that the whole Death Eaters = Nazis thing was seemingly a later development (I mean, why have Grindelwald be defeated in 1945 if it's just a weird parallel? I think what happened was Rowling decided Voldemort needed fleshing out more and went back to the Nazis), that might be the solution here too.

Lucius' getting away with it is quite different since he's like... honestly the Nazis he's most like all died before capture (e.g. Heydrich, Bormann, Goebbels), but they sometimes got trials in absentia (e.g. Bormann, but I think that was because they weren't sure he was dead). On the other hand, he's literally called a "slippery friend" at one point... that he gets away with it might have much more to say about Lucius than what happened to the other important Death Eaters.

However... I am still inclined to the theory that wizarding Britain has no tax system and that Lucius was pretty much single handedly funding the Ministry. The books (well, Fudge) make(s) a lot more sense that way.

Compare "Willing Executioners" (roundly criticised by historians... as opposed to political scientists) and "Ordinary Men" (written by an historian).

I repeat, do you accept both or either of:

- your money or your life is a free choice
- give me the boy to the age of seven and I will show you the man is false

?

It is perfectly reasonable to agree or disagree with these statements. The first is much harder to defend, imo, but people really do believe it. The second... it'[s a bit of a toss up. There's a misquoted version that runs "give me the boy from the age of seven and I will show you the man" and that's easier to defend and harder to disagree with (again, if you ask me).

The point, though, is that to judge Draco as hardly as you do... you really do need to accept both of those statements. To do otherwise is to just deny the nature of the human condition.

I'd really rather you refrain from making historical comparisons if you're unwilling to read what you're responding to when someone suggests your statements are wildly simplistic.

*********** The Hitler Youth was a very insidious and very deliberate part of the Nazis overall plan for German society. It is scarcely a simplification to say it was charged specifically with creating the ideal German man who, of course, would love to join the SS. Thus to say:

#+begin_quote
  he was Hitler youth who proudly joined the SS
#+end_quote

is essentially to summarise the entire purpose of why the Hitler Youth was created. Towards the ends of WWII they also had a tendency to be thrown on the front lines (which is to say, Germany's defensive lines).

The "good Wehrmacht, evil SS" thing is quite clearly articulated in the film The Eagle Has Landed. The basic idea is that there were ordinary German soldiers fighting in the Wehrmacht who shouldn't be called evil since it was special organisations like the SS who bear responsibility for the Holocaust. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_clean_Wehrmacht][It is not a true argument. There is, in fact, a quite substantial Wikipedia article outlining the problems with it.]]

I brought good Wehrmacht/evil SS thing up as a quick illustration that there's... big issues with trying to separate out Death Eaters, Ministry bigots and, say, Snatchers into three distinct groups. The Nazi Party obtained power because lots of people voted for them and because there was never any widespread rejection of their rule. The German people, as a whole, bear culpability for the Third Reich, even if we can point at specific things and say "without these features, it's hard to believe Hitler would ever have been Chancellor". The mistake most people make, however, is in imagining that they, themselves, would have been any different were they a 1920s and 1930s German.

Bormann was Hitler's secretary. This probably makes him sound less important than he was, but while he gets far less attention than Goering, say, there's a reason why both Bormann and Goering got tried at Nuremberg.

Heydrich was one the architects of the Holocaust. He was assassinated in 1942.

Goebbels was the Nazis propaganda man. He's widely considered to be a very good propagandist which, to my mind, means he's one of the five most important Nazis.

(There are actually problems with posing the question "which Nazis were most important?" From a practical point of view, the Third Reich is a system or a process, not the plaything of a few individuals. From a theoretical point of view, the question veers very closely to a discredited theory of history called "Great Man history". We might compare Lamarckism or the theory of humours as similarly discredited theories from biology and medicine, respectively.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This comes back to what I just said: "the mistake most people make, however, is in imagining that they, themselves, would have been any different were they a 1920s and 1930s German."

Have you ever read Brave New World? Of the four characters who think they're living in a dystopia, two of which come to the conclusion because they're dissatisfied with their own experiences. Humans are not like Helmholtz and Mond... it is very rarely by thought alone that we reach a conclusion that something is bad. Rather, we go along until the point we find ourselves confronting something we can't stomach. Our experiences are all evaluated in a wholly conditional manner.

There are huge swathes of people that judge humanity by standards of reasoning psychology and experimental economics tell us we're incapable of living up to. In my experience, one either accepts this argument and thus embraces paternalism or rejects it wholly and dismisses the moral relevance of "what we're actually capable of". This is unfortunate. What we can be ought to be the first plank of any moral argument.

Thus:

- your money or your life is a free choice
- give me the boy to the age of seven and I will show you the man is false

I do not consider the first a free choice. We are told repeatedly that the stakes facing Draco are not only his life, but probably that of his parents to. We are told from the start that Draco's told to kill Dumbledore to punish his parents.

Draco initially does not understand the nature of his problem because he's been indoctrinated for much longer than a mere seven years. He comes to realise this over time... and possibly /because/ of the side-consequences of his desperate attempts... in much the same way that any actual human (as opposed to the arrogant fantasy implied by rejecting psychology and experimental economics) might be expected.

To err is human. To forget this is diabolical.

The last also would have resulted in her brutal murder if caught. Also she was never marked.

Lucius should get the kiss, veiled, or life without. Whatever the maximum penalty allowed is.

In a court of law? The spells and antidotes, no. The occlumency? I can see that. But seriously, that's easy to counter. You get multiple legilimancers to just pound away at their shields. Department of Mysteries could probably supply something. If only to disprove their uselessness.

Also there is no indication that your proposed counter against occlumency would work. Especially since Occlumency isn't a shield in canon, its a skill where a wizards puts themselves in a certain mental state and becomes seemingly immune to magic against their mind. When Harry used it he described it as shutting his mind of from Voldemort.

** My question is how the horcrux inside Harry was both harmless and deemed 'safe'. Voldemort couldn't even touch Harry because of Lily's sacrifice. His vessel literally burned alive when Harry touched him. So how is a horcrux that is literally inside the boy still safe?

Horcrux's also effect the person and while Harry remains generally unaffected DUE to the horcrux, you think it'd have effected him at first. I know I wouldn't feel indifferent to a fmaily who kept me under the stairs. Harry's mental health is totally inconceivable. To grow up at least somewhat fine is a ludicrous idea. Many children are affected just by being without a parent, being raised in an unloved/abusive household should've at the very least caused him to have depression.

*** Two ways this could've happened probably. The first way is that it wasn't intentional, but he split his soul by killing a child and soul piece went into open wound. Now the second way is that Riddle, being the prideful and arrogant man he was, could've attempted to make a horcux out of the prophesied boy as a way to prove his power. However, this went wrong, as we all know, and the ritual was botched with his death. This leaves a soul piece cut off, but not sealed in a container. So as a result, it latches on to the nearest place. Harry's open wound.

Why is this important? Either way, it can't actively influence him, or really even at all. However, since the horcrux was beneath the skin, Lily's protection didn't affect it. This is because the protection, while it flowed in the 'blood', prevented skin to skin contact. This is essentially equivalent to asking why an insurance company doesn't cover an accident that took place before you had the insurance.

As for the mental health, I agree. Unfortunately as much as people love J.K. Rowling, I don't. Simply because of stupid stuff like this. I get it's a children's book. However, this little issue, that is in fact humongous, is never really gone over when it progresses to Young Adult. That's the main problem with it. That's why manipulate!Dumbledore tropes happen a lot, because you try to realistically portray a children's book, and to do that you need to make someone at fault. Is Dumbledore really at fault, same as every other adult who probably knows of the abuse? No, because in a children's book it's not important. The problem is you have to make someone be the bad guy, and he's the most convenient. So, if this was more of Young Adult book, he'd probably have to deal with more mental health issues. Unfortunately, this would also mean it became more angsty with more words and sdcnes devoted to both showing and reflecting it. Which J.K. Rowling probably didn't want to do, or just didn't. Either way, mental health in the series is a joke.

** The Trace, as described, makes no f-ing sense. In the days before DH, we all thought it was on the wands, but then DH came out and said that's not the case. It's on the person (somehow). Various theories were that it is applied to the first years as they cross the lake in the boat, or that it has to do with the slips of paper handed out at the end of the year reminding them not to use magic over the summer ('I always hope they'll forget to give us these,' said Fred Weasley sadly --- from the end of /Philosopher's Stone/). Clearly it's not applied before they start school, because Hermione says on that first train ride that she's tried several spells and they "all" worked for her. Students freely use magic on the Hogwarts Express with no consequences, so maybe it's considered part of the school.

And yet somehow, when Dobby uses magic at Harry's house, he gets a warning for using magic. So the trace is based on proximity and not on the person? How does that work if the student isn't actually at home? Not to mention Hermione uses it on Harry's glasses in Diagon Alley before second year starts. Who knew that the Death Eaters could have all the mubble-borns expelled simply by going to their neighborhoods and summoning things? It also means that students from magical households can freely use magic as long as their parents don't catch them.

And if it's based on where the underage student lives, then they could use magic all they wanted while on the horcrux hunt, because since they weren't at home the Ministry would have no way of knowing it was an underage person. After all, Harry didn't get any warnings after duelling Voldemort in the graveyard (but maybe that counted as being "at school" because it was the school year, even though he was off campus).

Moody says it can't detect "some forms" of magical transport, including brooms, enchanted cars, and thestrals. What a conveniently specific list. (And why would you think thestrals or enchanted cars set it off anyway, since neither of those use the traveller's magic? Brooms arguably do, since they wouldn't work for non-magical people.)

And then to say that it AUTOMATICALLY DISPERSES as soon as the person turns 17. Say what? If that's the case, then Hermione's should have dispersed early because of all the extra hours she spent with a time-turner. And it should be based on their actual time of birth, not ticking over to midnight on their birthday.

Just too many inconsistencies; clearly not well thought out. Who says you can't have it both ways, because she has it about six ways.

*** The Trace makes perfect sense in terms of the means of its operation being clear:

- The Trace is on all wizards under 17 years old.

- The Trace detects magic cast in its vicinity and feeds that information to the Ministry.

- Trace tells the Ministry what spell was cast and where.

- The Trace does *not* tell the Ministry who cast the spell or even whose Trace it was that detected it.

That's how the Trace works from the magical standpoint. Separately, you also have the issue of how the Ministry chooses to act on the information they receive.

The Ministry have a set of presumptions which determine how they act:

- If the magic is cast in a magical area, they assume it was cast by an adult and do nothing.

- If the magic is cast in a non-magical area, they cross-reference the location data against the magical individuals known to live in the vicinity. If there is an under-aged wizard living in that area with no adult wizards known to be present (i.e. a Muggleborn, Dean or Harry) then it is assumed that the magic was cast by the under-aged wizard and enforcement proceedings are brought against them.

- If the magic occurs before the under-aged wizard begins Hogwarts, the Ministry appears to assume it is accidental magic and do nothing.

- It appears that magic cast by Ministry officials does not set off the Trace.

This is all perfectly fine in terms of it not contradicting itself or lacking clarity. It doesn't make sense in the systems design sense - no one would ever choose to design a system that operates in such a way - but that simply suggests that there are either magical or political limitations which prevent a simpler system from being implemented.

As an aside, Hermione fixing Harry's glasses in Diagon Alley is movie canon. In the books, Mr Weasley does it.

Also, you're rather making assumptions about the dispersal at 17. It's entirely possible that magic considers you to have turned 17 at midnight on the 17th calendar anniversary of your date of birth; rather than when you have experienced 17 years of life.

As for DH, recall that Voldemort's Ministry made it illegal not to attend Hogwarts. So all magic during the school year which is detected by the Trace outside of Hogwarts would be an indication that an underage wizard is illegally not in attendance at Hogwarts and would likely be investigated.

Snape says to Lily when they're kids that the ministry won't allow them to do magic once they start school, so Hermione too would be fine until she starts school.

And brooms and cars are fine for transport unless you're the one enchanting them, if they can already fly when an underaged person uses them then that can't be detected. Same with thestrals.

The ministry can see every place magic is being used, and if grown-up wizards and witches live there they won't care. If only a school-aged and underaged wizard or witch is registered in an area where magic is being done, the Ministry will jump to conclusions and assume it has to be them who are doing it.

Mr Weasley did do magic at the Dursleys, but I believe other people have explained he probably notified the Ministry he was collecting Harry, so that's why that was fine in fourth year.

** While I understand the concept of trying to keep Harry as humble as possible from the headmasters perspective, I really don't understand why Harry was given to the Dursleys. Neither the fact that Dumbledore seemingly never checked on Harry also is slightly strange, while Arabella Fig was there, of course, she seemingly didn't bother to tell Dumbledore about the multiple injuries that Harry contracted while living at the Durselys.

I mean, Wizarding Culture is basically inbreeding 101, so I am sure that there was some other kind of extended family that Harry could have gone too.

I mean, quite literally, though the Black family, Harry is basically related with half the wizarding population. The Malfoys (not suitable as they were death eaters), The Tonkses (I really don't understand why he hadn't been brought to them) and many many more are more than just loosely related with him.

I understand that both Sirius and Remus were out of the question, but there were probably enough people willing to take up Harry who knew his parents.

In general, putting the "saviour of wizardkind" into the care of muggles who, probably known to multiple people who knew Lily and James, were rather unfriendly when it came to magic, while there would be probably still a handful of other options is really questionable in my opinion.

I understand it is a good plot-device, but in reality, it seems like a really bad choice...

(It has been a while since I read the books so I can't really say for certain when it comes to the Tonkses, but I remember there was a conversation between Harry and Andromeda were they talked about something similar like that in the seventh book. (I am not sure though))
