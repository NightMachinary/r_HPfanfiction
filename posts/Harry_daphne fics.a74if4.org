Long stories (like 50k +) , have to have a few lemons in there, also (Slytherin Harry)/daphne preferred


** I like Harry/Daphne fics so I'll rec a bunch and talk a little about them. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a5msy6/best_harrydaphne_fics/ebowz9g/][Here's a previous post where I mention five or so, I won't reiterate them here.]] Those are all pretty good reads.

I'll accept the 50k+ thing, but I'm going to ignore that you asked for lemons. Sorry, but I really don't remember what has them and what doesn't.

linkffn(No More Games by VagueJester) is pretty long, and a decent read. It's a bit power-trippy and trope filled at times, but still. I didn't actually finish it, though, so keep that in mind. Not the best read, not the worst. Meh.

linkffn(The Perks by Free Drinks) I don't remember this well, but I do remember enjoying it. It's unfinished and comes in /slightly/ below the 50k mark, but I figure 49k is close enough.

linkffn(Paid In Blood by zaterra02) The writing is meh, fair amounts of bashing, and you either like the idea or hate it. It's pretty long, though, so if you can get past the drawbacks at least there's a shitload of content there.

linkffn(Harry Potter and The Sirens Song by hermyd) Objectively this fic is probably terrible, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I dunno why. The writing isn't terrible- grammar, dialogue, all that is fairly good. Harry is pretty ooc, though, and it has some tropes and slight d/s stuff. Give it a shot if you want.

linkffn(Big Brother Is Listening To You by Holz9364) is 144k words of fluff and drama. We're talking about a fic that's basically just a reality TV show. So if that's your thing, have at it. There's no lemons, iirc, but there's a couple bits of implied sex if that's good enough for you? idk.

linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie) I liked this, but it (and all of James Spookie's fics, actually) seems to lack.. depth in character interactions I guess? Maybe my brain just doesn't like the way he writes, but it seems like his fics are missing /something/.

linkffn(Contractual Invalidations) is a good read. It's light on the action, but the characters are interesting and the clashing viewpoints are also interesting.

linkffn(Not Quite So Boring) I'm ngl, I remember basically nothing about this fic except that I liked it. So yeah there ya go.

I can probably scrounge up a few more recs of varying quality if this isn't enough/you don't find anything that fits your fancy, since this is only from looking in one of my three folders of HP/DG stuff, but between this and that "fanfic collection" post you've probably got at least a few to read. ffnbot!slim

Fuck me, I used brackets not parentheses. Fixed, though.

Ha, I've also just noticed that you posted the other thread I linked.

** A Fine Spot of Trouble [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]] Completed, nicely written, some drama but good ending, Ginny bashing, no smut, 130k+ words.

The Marriage Contracts Redux [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux]] Completed, comedic (almost a parody), nicely written, serious weasley and dumbledore bashing, no smut, 70k+ words.

These are two that I read again from time to time for they are good and fun.

*** Is.. is that version actively updating? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11260631/1/A-Different-Sort-of-Bond][It's also on ffn, but it hasn't been updated since 2016.]] They're pretty different, but seem to be the same fic. There's a few bits here and there that are almost exactly the same. Seems like he heavily edited it and reposted it on ao3.
