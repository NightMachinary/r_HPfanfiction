Just recently read Harry Potter and the Daughters of Fate linkffn(11911818)

It was very fun, but by far too short (its basically a 1 shot).

So I am looking for fan fictions similar to it, or in the same vein... just hopefully longer. If what I am asking for below is too detailed, then by all means PLEASE suggest anything similar or in the same vein.

--------------

So Harry as master or in control of death/time/fate/luck/magic... whatever. It can be represented by a physical female being (like in the Daughters of Fate), or not. I would prefer romance being involved either between Harry and the representation of what hes in control of or with a HP female character or characters, or both. Harems, Groupings, Odd pairings, and similar are welcome, but no male slash please.. just not my thing. How much power it gives Harry doesnt matter, although im guessing less power will make for a more interesting and longer story than one where he can just do whatever.

  We all know that Harry Potter is the Master of... wait, Time? How did that happen? And whatever will Death do when she finds out about this?

**** Most MoD fics make Harry immortal, or a time/dimension traveller.

Few personify Death though. A few ASOIAF crossovers come into mind, with the whole stranger thing. There was one Twilight crossover too I think.

Usually the genre is ridiculously cliche in plain HP verse, so I prefer crossovers(Plus no Hermione there). Lemme know if crossovers are your thing, and Ill try to dig them out.

***** Crossovers are hit or miss for me. Generally I hate superhero crossovers. The few HP crossovers I have enjoyed were either Star Wars or Star Trek (due to the endless possibilities with magic, time, and space), Twilight (due to the vampire connection), and the occasional LoTR (rarely). I also have always been curious if there was an HP/Eragon crossover out there but have yet to stumble on one.

If you do have anything to suggest by all means. I asked for one type of thing, but I enjoy exploring pretty much anything (except for male slash) and am always up for new things to dive into.

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.

I dont know anything about this Japanese series. How easy would this be to read without knowing ANYTHING about it?
