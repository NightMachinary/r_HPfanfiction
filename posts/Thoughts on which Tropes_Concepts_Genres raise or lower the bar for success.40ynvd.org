Something I've run into a lot lately is that there are a lot of things in fanfiction that are generally considered to always produce 'bad fics' when they're included. Common examples include Harem fics, SI's, Super!Harry, etc etc...

I've found myself thinking and commenting lately on how I feel like it's not that the various /concepts themselves/ are bad per se but rather that it's more difficult to write them well enough to be a 'good fic' worth reading.

The opposite, I think, would be 'crackfic', where I think it'd be a lot easier to produce an amusing crackfic than it would be to produce a serious one.

I'm curious what, if any, tropes/concepts/genres you all feel are harder or easier to write? Or if there are things you think are legitimately *impossible* to write well? (And, at the risk of sounding like one of my old English teachers... Why do you feel that way about <X>?)

*EDIT: And yes, I will happily be /attempting/ to play devil's advocate. Currently; Marriage Law is the one I'm finding hardest to argue for.*


** Tropes that lower the bar for success: friendly goblins, soul bonds, inheritances, magical cores, marriage contract, elemental!Harry, Hadrian, golden super patronus of love, fifth house, magical trunks, katanas, secret canadian super!schools, phoenix!animagus, 'Mione, secret library in the CoS, harems, Moldyshorts/Dumbles, reading-the-books, Lord Potter-Black, Prank Wars, pureblood!Lily, mindscapes, cub/pup, Ice Queen, ye olde Lord Potter-Black, superwands, "embracing the inner slytherin".

/Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations. On the whole, tropes are not clich√©s/

--------------

You didn't necessarily insinuate that tropes are bad, but that is an incorrect idea that I see a lot of on this sub.

Tropes are a way to frame a story or an idea, they aren't good or bad, they just are. Some tropes, as an individual idea, are horrible as in everything you mentioned.

We all have favorite tropes, they're what we refer too as sub-genres withing fanfiction. For instance I myself am a big fan of dimensional hop stories. So that is a trope that raises that bar for success for myself.

However I don't think that was what OP was asking for. I believe he wanted tropes that are well regarded, or at least not ill regarded, that make it easier to write a quality fic.

Yeah... but also make that it harder. I was curious if there were tropes/concepts/etc that people believed made it easier OR harder to write a quality fic just by the nature of their inclusion.

I was kind of thinking in terms of the fact that I'm a new writer. I'm writing an SI story because... it seemed easier to start an SI story off and then the initial half joking premise just kept going and now I'm 170K words in. One thing I've noticed is that as a result of the *nature* of what an SI story is, it's easier to get into my main character's headspace... but at the same time I feel like an SI story is like... telling a friend about that really awesome dream you just had. It may well have been *really freaking awesome* ... but it's difficult to make them care since it's not their dream. Same with an SI story... it seems like writing a given story with an SI makes it harder- but not impossible, obviously, since I have some readers that seem to like it- to draw an audience in and make the story work even though it might make it easier to get those first few chapters on paper.

I assume there's a lot of other things in fanfiction like there where they aren't by themselves good or bad but they do make some aspects of writing a solid story easier or harder for the author that chooses to employ them.

***** Self Inserts as an idea isn't bad, that is an example of people just executing poorly. With a self-insert the story cannot be about the defeat of Voldemort, that at best becomes a background thing, the focus of the story has to shift to something else to engage the reader. linkffn(In Bad Faith) Is an example of a great self-insert. The story was abandoned early on, but its success lay in the fact that it had nothing to do with Voldemort. It was a look into the life of an entitled Pureblood, a point of view we don't get to see at all in canon. As well as exploring more aspects of magic.

People think of self inserts are shit because most of them are. They are basically super!Harry except with an OC no one cares about. Or else they're I-Wanna-Fuck!EmmaWatson/TomFelton let me tell you my story. Neither of these things are something that people want to read.

  The story brought to you by the depressing realization that any realistic SI involving myself can be summed up as: "He died. Horribly." But... death in the Buffyverse is hardly the end. Sometimes it's just a beginning. A pseudo-SI turned vampire story. Rated M for comedic sociopathy.

I was thinking of 'lowering the bar' meaning making it easier to write a good story... so I would have inverted your list into 'raising the bar' as in making it MORE difficult to include and still make a well written story.

In the first chapter he uses the room of requirement as a Hyperbolic Time Chamber then goes to a Canadian super school, that has a secret society and a lot of assassin alumni, and learns to become a magical animagus. However other characters are more powerful than him so it's sort of okay, maybe? (It's totally not balanced)

It does have a lot of interesting parts, a new culture, new kinds of magic and new species.

**** What you described is more in line with betrothal contracts or arranged marriages, and I've read a few good fics about that theme.

Marriage laws are, on the other hand, basically attempts by a government to force couples together against their wills, which amounts to the equivalent of rapes sanctioned by the government. I don't think even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, or Maoist China went that far. But there are many marriage law fics written in the HP fandom that have Harry, Hermione, and other heroes submit to the wills of such tyrannical and perverted governments. I find them disgusting.

***** Well... yeah... a betrothal contract is what I suspect it would take to make Harry go along with a marriage he had no interest in. If the contract is magically binding, then canon already shows him accepting the idea of someone else putting him in that position (see Goblet of Fire.) Similarly, the rest of the characters that observed that happening might accept that its a thing in that world and that fighting it isn't practical or safe.

But going back to marriage law stories... even while playing devil's advocate I'm not saying that the idea is legally or morally sound, or that the people who literally /just/ fought a bloody civil war with a corrupt government would accept any such thing for /legal/ reasons. I'm just saying that it might be possible to write a good story about two characters who weren't resistance fighters... like say... Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott going along with it. (And it would likely read sort of like a contract story but with more anger at the government)

It'd still be fucking weird, and it would need to be very well written to pull it off, I'm just saying it's not impossible as a concept or premise... Though I do agree that convincing me that Post-DH Harry/Hermione/Etc would go along with it probably is damned impossible and by the time you're done author fiating in the magic to compel their cooperation I'll have likely closed the browser window.

******* I've got an idea for a Marriage Contract fic that could be good. Would required the protagonist, probably Harry or Hermione, to return to England ~10 years after the war ends. Harry has been traveling or whatever, it shouldn't be too difficult to create a believable circumstance where Harry wants to go see the world after the childhood he had, or where Hermione's parents stay in Aus and she ends up staying with them.

When the protagonist returns home they find out about the new marriage laws. All Witches and Wizards are required to be married by age 30 or something. We would see things from an outsiders perspective, and learn how this came to be a law and how most people are okay with it since it has been a gradual thing and not something that was imposed one day.

The fic could then go in a lot of directions. Harry marries Susan/Tracey/Padma/Whoever and they become friends while working together to change the law and public opinion about it. Or maybe this takes place before they're 30 so they're working together before hand. Would mostly likely be a romance where they end up together in the end anyway.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return.

What's that saying about "eye for eye makes everyone blind"? The response to attempted genocide is not genocide, because it makes you no better than the ones you're genociding. Sure, revenge can be satisfying, but it should not excuse anything you do as revenge.

And before you contest the word "genocide", that's actually what you're proposing. I'll quote the international definition of the term:

#+begin_quote
  ]...] genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

  (a) Killing members of the group;

  (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

  (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
#+end_quote

In other words, attempts to destroy pureblood culture (which is not the same as wizarding culture, despite some fanfics arguing to the contrary) is incontroversably genocide.

#+begin_quote

I'm not contesting that the treatment of muggleborns by pureblood extremists (again, not the populace at large, mind) was/is terrible. But, again, this doesn't justify acts of genocide. Nothing ever has, nothing ever will. I'm not sure how this is somehow to be questioned.

Though things that are inherently inferiour to muggle versions? Those will disappear as soon as the social pressure by idiots that maintained it is gone.

One thing that I'm not sure I've ever seen explored very much is how many laws/customs that appear to be stupid to muggles and muggleborn actually make sense or are even necessary because of how radically magic can change things. Yours does it some, if I remember correctly, but it seems like it would be a fruitful topic to delve into.

For example, in a magical society where the stronger and more skilled magical people can do so much more, is a genuine democracy even possible? You can't use taxes or anything to take away magical power.

It depends on just how much more the more powerful can do. Can hundred average wizards, working together, defeat a Dumbledore? The same question has been asked in D&D circles - how can an aristocratic or feudal society handle adventurers/heroes who can walk all over an entire country of non-heroes and take it over by force?

One way is to make those heroes members of the aristocracy, or even royalty. Wizarding Britain might have done the same by elevating Dumbledore to his different positions.

True, but that's why I mention taxes. You can regulate money in ways that make it harder for those with economic power to subvert democracy. Whether such efforts are successful or not is another story, but at least in theory money can be taxed and regulated to an extensive degree.

But magic? Especially in a society where everything is done by magic? And where those with greater magical power and skill are put on pedestals? Not so likely.

They either couldn't, or wouldn't try, when it came to Voldemort. Remember he was about ready to win back in the late 70s.

#+end_quote

That seems very likely, though it's just as possible that elevating powerful people to such positions is an expression of their hero-worship as opposed to a conscious effort to contain them. In the muggle world, sports heroes and military heroes can get elected to high office, but not too often and not too easily. In a society where elevating such people is the norm, democracy would suffer.

Then there are all the things which a democracy needs to work well, much of which might be too easily subverted by magic. Can you have secure, secret ballots in the context of magic, for example? Perhaps, but it would be tough. Democracy needs a reliable, trustworthy legal system, too, which magical Britain definitely doesn't have. There are too many ways for magic to subvert crime investigations, I think, which might make a trustworthy legal system impossible.

#+end_quote

Well, Fudge worries about his image with the people, so there must be /some/ sort of popular feedback on his job performance, whether it's elections or just a healthy fear of being lynched. That's not enough to qualify as "a working democracy," but if there are elections of some sort, then on some level they are trying. Which means that they value something about democracy, even if on a limited scale.

And of course you need that at a bare minimum to even try - if the people don't care, nothing else you do will matter. So there is something that can be worked with, even if pitifully small.

I remember the story you're talking about. If I also remember correctly, /every/ job connected to the Ministry came with oaths. So basically you couldn't do anything government-related (including Hogwarts) without accepting restrictions that got tighter and tighter the more deeply you got involved. So why do it? First, given the overwhelming power of the Ministry, a person didn't have many options for accomplishing much otherwise.

Second, /no one knew/ - this was a secret which Dumbledore communicated to Harry at great personal risk. The early oaths given to low-level employees were minor and reasonable (like to do your job, that sort of thing). The trap wasn't obvious until you were already in it, and then it was too late. Dumbledore wanted to save Harry from that.

Tying down powerful wizards and witches so they don't become a threat is understandable. The problem is, doing so also keeps them from helping in extraordinary ways, too. Making everyone mediocre isn't a good idea in the long run.

Executing people who promote, praise, engage in, and/or try to legalize murder and rape is /not/ genocide. Not by any stretch of the imagination and certainly not by the definition you so helpfully provided. Perhaps you should go back and read it, though more carefully this time.

One might legitimately debate whether the death penalty is too extreme or not in such cases generally or in the cases described in the story. The death penalty is certainly a controversial topic.

My main problem with most fanfiction is that 90% (guesstimate) is written less because of an interesting story idea or plot and more as wish fulfillment. Marriage law fics are used to easily push characters together without the need for that pesky plot getting in the way. Super!Harry or Harem fics are used as wish fulfillment, Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasleys are used to fix what people see as plot holes or annoyances with canon.

Of course there are probably exceptions to all of these. For the most part though I'd say fanfiction writers just write what they want to see be dammed whether the plot turns out good in the long run and use tropes to take shortcuts to getting to the parts they want to write rather than making things happen organically.

I agree completely. I hate the badguy/manipulative Dumbledore/Weasleys. These stories are almost always about the author trying to convince me as a reader that these characters are bad and I shouldn't like them. However I really like how this trope is done in the 'Travel Secrets' series. These fics as a whole have a lot of problems, but they handles this trope really well. Despite Dumbledore being bad I never felt like the author was trying to change my opinion of the character, but instead show how in this fiction he's a nob.

The majority of fanfiction stories are written by amateur writers with little experience and even less training. Their stories were never going to be very good (especially if we define "good" as "publishable"!), no matter what tropes they did or did not use.

Consider the fact that "main character, who's an orphan, discovers that he had powerful parents, a great destiny, and is being hunted by evil" is itself a trope (don't know the name, sorry). George Lucas used it well. JKR used it well. It's in pretty much every HP fanfic that comes within spitting distance of canon... and most of those stories aren't great. Yet, for some reason, I've yet to see anyone whine about /that/ trope.

Oh, I'm familiar with Campbell - I nearly minored in Religious Studies in college.

But since you bring him up, this is a perfect way to link back to the original thread topic. I don't believe Campbell ever wrote about a "marriage law" or "harem" trope across cultures and literature. A Harem with a Thousand Faces? Unlikely.

There are tropes (themes, ideas, plots) that speak to us more deeply than others. Some of that is learned (we see it a lot, and it becomes familiar), but some may be innate as well. Those tropes are probably more "forgiving" - even if you don't do it well, it's still a darn good story idea at its heart.

So while a "marriage law" story can, in theory, be good, it will probably be harder for a variety of reasons: it's not really that great to start with, it's less forgiving for an inexperience writer, it's very unfamiliar, etc. It won't automatically be bad, just because it centers around a marriage law, but I wouldn't place any bets on it unless it was done by a writer I know does a decent job in general.

The canon ministry and Dumbledore were too incompetent imho, almost unrealistically incompetent.

** I'd say one of the only ones I find impossible to play straight is the Evil!Dumbledore trope. Depending on how you interpret the books, Dumbledore is many things, but he is in no way, shape, or form evil. Mistaken, yes. Manipulative for the Greater Good, sure why not? But the moment he starts mentally rubbing his hands in glee over some bad thing happening to Harry is the moment I drop the story.

The only way you could make Evil!Dumbledore feasible is to go back to his teenage years and twist something, but that would make it firmly AU.

** bashfics are impossible to reach a decent level. They're guilty pleasure with the same reasoning behind their success as michael bay movies. They're bad, but fun (in small doses).

The really hard fic to get right would be harem, Lord!Potter, romance (yes, that shit's really hard), Slyce of Life, Angst, Super!Harry and OC stories in general.

I also see a funny trend when I look at slash fics. While femslash is very often on an at least decent level, maleslash is mostly absolute garbage.

And finally, character development is something most authors fail. But to be fair, even professionals fall into the various traps all too often, so having amateurs do it isn't much of a surprise.

**** Fics with harems in them do one thing wrong, mostly. They think that these relationships work with one pivotal person and all partners just hovering around them. These polyamorous relations rarely develop any form of depth. What they'd need to do is to build polygamic relationships where every person in it loves the entirety of the group involved in the relationship.

I could see such a fic working, but I fear that most fail due to the lack of experience of authors with such a relationship. The moment someone takes turns, or is "first wife" or some such nonesense, the harem has failed, in my opinion.

Creature fics and wrong BWL stories. If "Harry" is a Veela!Dragon!Vampire!Werewolf, then he's not Harry Potter. Similarly, if "Harry" isn't the BWL who constantly tries to duck his fame then he's not Harry Potter.

But does that necessarily mean that the story will be bad? I mean all sorts of opening premises make a change to Harry and and then set him loose in the HP world... Sure it won't be the Harry from canon, but I don't know if that guarantees that the story will be bad... Just different.

I do agree that telling me a compelling story about Harry being a Veela is going to be a hard sell, but I could see myself enjoying a Harry dealing with being a werewolf story *IF AND ONLY IF* it's well done. Making it work would be harder than some other set ups but I don't know about impossible?

If a fanfic author wants to make him into a werewolf or the younger brother of the BWL, then that's great. But for it to be really well done IMO, this change would need to have an enormous impact on the protagonist's values, morals, abilities, and weaknesses.

Harry won't even be born yet to be there, but it's still definitely set in the same school / setting.

I must not have communicated what I meant very well, then. I'm not a canon enthusiast nor do I believe that a Harry with canon personality traits is inherently superior to one without those qualities. I'm just saying that it would be difficult to replace those traits and still have the reader recognise that character as being Harry Potter.

Given how comparatively little we know about Lupin's background and schooling, I think a werewolf story would be far easier to do well in this era as opposed to Harry's time. The author could fill in several gaps in a character that lacks sufficient backstory and the reader wouldn't have to suspend any measure of disbelief. On the other hand with Harry, he's already exhibited quite a bit of personality even in the first few chapters of PS. This is why authors like robst are so disliked. They alter Harry in significant ways and expect the reader to not take notice.

If they flesh it out, yes. If they lay it out step by step how they changed into what they are, and the reactions to the conditions they went through are believable, yes we are still reading about Harry Potter. Just because he's not Canon!Harry does not mean he can't be Harry Potter. Different circumstances can change a great many things, even if a character only reacts to them a certain way due to their personality.

From your reply to Ruljinn:

If an author can stay true to a character's personality, then different circumstances should still be believable. But different circumstances also means a character learns different lessons, which can change their personality over time.

He's an 11 year old orphan dumped into a 'world' without a single clue, a kid whose enemy is the biggest bad. Let's assume the plot should make sense though JKR didn't fuss a lot about it.

He needs a serious power up.
