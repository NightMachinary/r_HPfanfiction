The Luckiest of Them All

Harry walked through the halls of Hogwarts, spells flying around him yet not one hitting him. He almost drowned in a bulk batch of Felix felisis when he was a baby. That may explain some of his strange behavior. A streak of green light flew past his head, while the floor collapsed beneath where his feet had been a couple seconds ago. He walked up to the great hall and dodged another killing curse. He wondered whether he could ever be killed. Honestly, after that stunt with the shopping cart in the third year, he didn't think it could really happen.

“Harry, I dare you to go down the astronomy tower in a shopping cart.” Ron said, too tired to really comprehend what he was asking.

“Ok. I'll do it at midnight tonight. That should give you enough time to spread the word.”

“Wait, bro, I wasn't being serious! You could die!”

“Do you honestly think that could happen? I have had about twelve attempts on my life since I started school, and I'm still here, so what could go wrong?”

“Well, you haven't been trying to die all those times, so you might because you tried.”

“I'll take the risk.” Harry said with a laugh. At ten before midnight, Harry Potter and about 50 other students where at the astronomy tower with a muggle trolley, a stopwatch, and a blindfold (courtesy of Fred and George) ready to leave. Harry climbed into the cart, put on the blind fold, and let the two large Slytherin boys pick up the brunette and his container.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Ron asked, obviously afraid for his friend.

“I'll be fine. Drop it boys!” Harry screamed as the boys dropped his cart off the side of the tower. It felt like the coolest roller-coaster ever made. The drop straight down, the feeling of his bottom coming off of the trolley just a bit, and the pull in the pit of his stomach, just waiting for it to pull up, though he knew it never was. The crash was more than a bit jarring, and he could feel his right leg snap. The entire staff heard his scream before he blacked out.

“Harry, you're ok now. There's nothing wrong. It's only a clean leg break, nothing too bad. Madam Pomphrey gave you some Skelegrow so you should be up and ready for class in a couple hours.” A kindly face looked down at him, so of course his reaction was;

“F**k off, you bloody git.”

“Remember Harry, we do not use language in this school.”

“We bloody well use language in this school.”

“No, we do not. Now your leg should be mostly healed up by now, but you are going to stay here for a couple more hours.”

And he was double sure because of that incident in fifth year.

He was just about to go skydiving when Snape intercepted him in the hallway. The greasy haired man looked like he was having a bad headache and he couldn't take another pill for an hour.

“I have heard from some very reliable resources that you are going to jump off of your broom from 30 meters up at noon today Mr. Potter.”

Harrys high crashed. Hermione just had to tell on him, didn't she? Well, Harry knew a way around this.

“You gotta catch me first.” And with that Harry took off running, yelling that the broom jumping was being rescheduled to now. Almost all of the students that heard him followed, especially when they saw Snape chasing behind him. It was a given this would escalate, as the last time something like this happened, Hagrid had to spend three hours trying to get the basilisk out of the lake. He ran through the doors opened by some helpful Hufflepuffs, and grabbed his broom from the locker room, almost being caught by Snape on his way out. He ran out to the middle of the quidditch field and took off. He flew up about 30 meters up, whooping in triumph. He stood on the broom, and slowly fell forward, casting a cushioning charm below him just before he hit the ground. Harry stood up next to an infuriated Snape, and spread his arms. A resulting cheer resounded from the stands where more than 70 students watched.

And that is why he is essentially immortal. He guessed that only old age could kill him off, in the end. Harry stepped left and narrowly avoided a crumbling wall. He always tried to help others with his luck, as it seemed to rub off on them when he was around. He pulled a young girl out of the way of an Imperius curse, smiled sweetly at her, and continued on his mission. All of the horcruxes where destroyed, one by a very helpful Neville, so he was clear for the kill.

He walked into the great hall, and saw the chaos ensuing. Voldemort was dueling three different aurors at a time, and one was slowing down. Harry took his place and started fighting his way closer. The rest of the aurors fell back, stunned at the skill of the young wizard. He was fighting with everything he had, and driving the older man back against the wall. They dodged all of the spells the others sent at them, good and bad. Voldemort began to gain a bit more ground, the tension rising with every step. Eventually, the two dueling foes where back in the middle of the hall, ready for the kill. They both circled around each other, each hesitant to kill the other. They paused, getting ready for the kill.

“Avada Kedavra!” They both screamed in unison. The two enemy's disintegrated at the same time. Voldemort's last words where; Haaaaaaarry Poteeeeeeeer! Harrys last where lightly more dignified. “Hermione, tell Ginny I love her. You have been good friends and an amazing family. I'll see you on the other side...”

*The End*
