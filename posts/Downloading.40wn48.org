How do I download a book from fanfiction? Usually I just do it from the bot description but I don't know how else to do it.


** 1. Download Calibre [[http://calibre-ebook.com/download]]
2. (I'm on OSX so you might have to dig a bit to do the same on Windows) Select Preferences --> Advanced --> Get new plugins
3. Filter for the plugin *FanFicFare*
4. Click install and choose the option to place the icon on the toolbar
5. Restart the program
6. After the program starts select "Download from URLs" from the dropdown next to the *FanFicFare* icon
7. Paste the URL of the fic you want to download in the box and press ok

I hope this is enough to get you started!

** The bot uses the following: [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/]] as our first choice, and the one I recommend above all others except Calibre.

Our second choice is [[http://ficsave.com/]]

*** Thank you for the suggestion and for the bot. It's how I started downloading fanfic and why I asked. I should've put 2 and 2 together but I'm not a ravenclaw.

** If you use Android, Codex Reader is a good offline fanfic reader. Supports FF.net, FictionPress and AO3. Can also download as epub.

** I guess you mean Fanfiction.net, since you you mention the bot? There are other fanfiction sites that provide ebook formats themselves ([[http://archiveofourown.org/][Ao3]] is the big one). Many people have already mentioned bots that will automatically create an ebook for you from various archives.

If all those others mentioned fail you, you can also try the [[http://grabmybooks.com/][GrabMyBooks]] extension for Firefox and Chrome. It's good for archives that aren't big enough for the automated grabbers to bother programming for, for sites that aren't fanfic-specific (and therefore don't have standard formatting, like individual blogs), and /especially/ for sites that are password-protected, because it saves what's displayed on-screen.
