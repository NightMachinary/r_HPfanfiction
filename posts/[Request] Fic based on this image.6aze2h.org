  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** Eh seems like a lot of hard work, I mean look at Argus. You're basically nothing more than a watch keeper for brats who cleans up occasionally when the House Elves can't be seen. It kind of sucks.

*** Janitors already tend to be treated like dirt by normal, muggle students. Imagine what it would be like if you're can't defend yourself from "pranks" pulled by students who think you should have been drowned at birth because you can't wave a stick around.

It's really no wonder Filch is such a bastard.
