We have many fanfics where Harry moves to Grimmauld place and fixes in after the war. But what if he chose to move to his parents' cottage and fix that up? We know from DH that it's mostly in ruins, but with the amount of money Harry has, that should be fixable...

*** I've seen it, but trying to recall a specific indy!Harry fic from amongst a field of 50,000 fics isn't an easy thing to do.
