  Harry was abandoned by his parents at the Dursleys only for them to abandon him in New York a few years later. Luckily, Harry met a strange magician under circumstances only Harry could consider normal. How would the Marvel Universe and the Harry Potter world change now that he's being raised by Dr. Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme? Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived. Harry/harem. ABANDONED!

**** I've read this one a while ago, unfortunately it's abandoned. Although I think another author adopted it.

There is also this one linkffn(Beyond the Veil Volume One: Arrival by megamatt09), Harry had spent some time training under Strange there. It has sequel also but it's not for everyone considering almost 50% of story is smut and harem.

** Harry Potter and the Game has some minor references to it. It's not completed and just starting to explore the Dr Strange type magic. You may like it if you like video games.

*** He keeps saying that he likes to make so called 'cool references and connections', but I have a feeling that it might be more involved in the story than that. The story has a bald Nepalese woman with a magical school of her own ffs!

  or the Resident Spy. When Dumbledore left Harry Potter with the Black Widow it was with the hope that he would get his own assassin in return. Too bad Natasha had different plans.
