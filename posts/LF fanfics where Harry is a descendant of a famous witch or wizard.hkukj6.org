Preferably I'd like fanfics where this is a big deal, rather then it being a case of "oh yeah, I'm a descendant of (insert name)" and then never brought up again.

I don't really have any particular preferences as to who the famous person is either. I'm talking:

- Salazar Slytherin
- Godric Gryffindor
- Rowena Ravenclaw
- Helga Hufflepuff
- Merlin
- Morgan Le Fay
- Emeric the Evil
- Herpo the Foul
- Ekrizdis

If there is a relationship in the story I'd prefer no slash.

Thank you. =)


** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) Harry is proved to be an actual descendant of Salazar by his portrait, because in the ACV-verse, Parseltongue can only be passed on through blood.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** Wow this story is crazy good! I'm about 2/3 in it (500k words in three days? Oh yes you bet I'll finish it tonight haha) and damn it's really damn good. I'm surprised I've never come across it before. Thank you so much for the recommendation! Definitely one of my top 15 fav stories now.
