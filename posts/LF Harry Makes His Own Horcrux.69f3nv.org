*** He doesn't create a horcrux.

[[/spoiler][The deal is that he discovers he has a fragment of Voldemort's soul in his head. He and Slytherin's portrait, after weeks (or /months/, I can't remember) of research, decide that he can likely follow the horcrux ritual to an extent except, instead of splitting his own soul, he'd split Voldemort's soul from his own. Then, instead of placing it inside of an object, he could let it die.]]

[[/spoiler][I can't remember, exactly, but there is some kind of trouble that arises from the ritual. He doesn't accidentally create a horcrux, but I believe that Voldemort's bit-of-soul ends up merging with his own instead. I don't believe this had any affect other than, essentially, destroying the horcrux while allowing Harry to continue speaking parseltongue.]]

[[/spoiler][Belay that last line. I'm pretty sure in this story Harry is a legitimate heir to Slytherin (having nothing to do with Voldemort), but again, it's been a month or so since I read it.]]

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
