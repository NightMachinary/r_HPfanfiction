Hi I'm looking for some fanfics where ginny had many boyfriends prior to harry. Basically more experienced Ginny at dating than Harry because I like to read a nervous flustered Harry


** It's called Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.

** I don't know if you're looking for AU or canon-compliant fics.

But [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]] on Ficfiction. It's beatifully written and as the name suggests, it's from Ginnys's PoV. Canon compliant. Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12924292][A Second Chance]] is a AU fic where Sirius get freed from prison early and is the one to raise Harry along with Remus. In this both Harry and Ginny date a couple of people before coming together. It's also beautifully written and extremely long. It follows the canon books mostly with a few things changed here and there. Incomplete and ongoing.

Hope you like them.

***** So you claim to have never read fanfics that were closely in line with canon... Harry wasn't shown that nervous when he was with Ginny because their relationship wasn't explored that much in canon... So take your nonsense somewhere else..

****** I never claimed anything like that? Though it is partly true, I don't read canon rehash fics, I also don't really care for anything of Harry's Hogwarts time, mostly just exploration of magic and cool ideas, I think I've read one fic which had a Harry/Ginny pairing, and that was a Harry/multi fic, sooo..

It wasn't explored in the movies much maybe, but it was explored plenty in the books (imo) and if the books don't count as canon then I'm going to jump in a lake..

******* Yeah how much was it explored other than like two chapters in HBP and just a kiss in Deathly Hallows.. They weren't properly together till Voldemort was defeated and THAT wasn't explored. Then the epilogue came. So I don't think it was explored that much. Probably thats why there are alot of Harry/Ginny fics because it wasn't fully explored....
