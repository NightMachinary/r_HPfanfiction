So, one of my favorite HP fics was an animagus story that starts... pretty dark. It begins in 4th year and Harry has returned from the graveyard and is wracked with debilitating pain from the cruciatus curse. In an effort to comfort him, Hermione holds him, which leads to him unintentionally raping her (as he's barely able to even comprehend his surroundings). It evolves from there into a Harmony fic centered on animagus self-study, and they both become large cats (ie a panther). I remember it gets them in trouble because they become more reckless as their feline personalities take more prominence.

I thought I had it bookmarked and favorited on FF.net, but I can't find the links now. It had a Latin sounding name, I think.

Can anyone help me find this fic again?

If so, thanks!

*** Definitely Vox Corporis. That post-Cruciatus bed scene always left me confused as hell.

**** Thank you!

And its an awful scene, but I like how the author handled it later on during the story and how the relationship grows from there.

**** The bot link is wrong. The original fic has been taken down recently. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/3186836/1][Here]] is an archived version.

***** Thank you so much! That's it. :) The author is still in my favorites on FF.net, but the story wasn't. Awful that it was taken down... :( But now I have a way to read it again. So thank you!

** What's the deal with rape in HP fanfics? Seems like every other fanfic has an entirely unnecessary rape scene. Is it for rape awareness? If it's for that it's doing it pretty badly. Is it going for shock value? Going for shock value is the lowest way to generate interest in a story, and doing it by way of unnecessary rape scene is just kinda fucked if that's the /only/ thing you can think of to keep an audience entertained.

*** I can't speak to anything about that in general. Most fics I read do not feature that. In this fic, it is a catalyst for what occurs afterwards and the development of Harry and Hermione's relationship. It occurs once in a very early chapter, and is necessary for the story. Don't judge all stories based on your view, for it isn't always the case.
