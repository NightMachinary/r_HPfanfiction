** "... as the seventh month dies." prophecy rung out into the empty room. Sybil blinked her eyes. She scrunched her eyebrows. What was she...?

"It will be all right, dearie. Just don't forget to fix your hair before you go." magical mirror on the wall remarked out of nowhere. Sibil sniffed haughtingly. The damned things always chatted at her unprovoked.

(Unconsciously she patted her hair. You never know what mirror've Seen, after all, little scrying buggers)
