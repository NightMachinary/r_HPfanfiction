  The Dark Lord made a very different choice on Halloween of 1981, and with it he may have brought the very destruction to the light that they so rightfully feared. Now Harry is growing under the training of Lord Voldemort in order to avenge his parents deaths to the proclaimed leader of the light...Albus Dumbeldore. HarryXDaphne
