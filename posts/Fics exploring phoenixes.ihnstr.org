What are some fics that you like that deeply explore the phoenix? Phoenix familiar, animagus, whatever is all welcome. They're so cool.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery)

This is the first in a series (has 3 fanfics in it). While the main focus isn't Phoenix's they do play a fairly good-sized role and has good discussions regarding them.

-Note: I HIGHLY recommend all of semprini's works. There's 5 fanfics, with limited reviews so I feel like they don't get as much attention as they should. One of my favorite authors, honestly.

** On strength of steel wings

Has a good bond between Harry and Fawks, but also he gets power to travel through flames with a ritual and eventually ends up having a phoenix animagus form through rituals in Egypt.

Sadly it's abandoned

It starts a bit rough, but don't worry: it gets better.
