:FlairText: What's That Movie Review?
:END:
It was an amateur re-enactment of the Death of Voldemort scene explaining how absolutely absurd it was done in the movie. Harry alone defeated Voldemort in the courtyard of Hogwarts, and then he runs to the Great Hall crying: “Hi, guys! I have just defeated Voldemort in the courtyard! Yay! Unfortunately, we were alone, while you were doing here I don't know what, and his body kind of exploded, so no, there is no proof that I have just actually done it.”


** Were they actually alone? Really? I haven't watched the movies in a long time.

*** Yes, they were totally alone in the courtyard in the movie when the deus ex machina happened. That's what makes the movie death even worse. He turns into ash and is blown away in the wind, instead of leaving a body to show proof that he's dead, and was also human like them.

**** Yeah, that was stupid. The book emphasized that he died just like a normal man

** Such a weird little thing to get hung up on in a universe where legilimency and pensive memories are a thing, and besides, the guy went through hell to destroy the horcruxes and after that almost everybody witnessed him literally coming back from the dead. If there was anyone in the castle whose word was gold was Harry's.

Where were these when Harry was trying to tell Fudge that Sirius was innouncent? That Dementors really did attack him? That Voldemort was back? Year after year, Harry proved his word was golden, and yet everyone turned on him literally every year but the third.

*** And all those Death Eaters or pureblood supremacists all over the Great Britain hoping that Lord Voldemort would rise up from death AGAIN, will believe the word of Harry Potter?

**** I don't think their opinion mattered at that point. Considering no big DE resurgence was ever brought up after the battle I think it's safe to assume that whether Harry's word was believed among their ranks was irrelevant.
