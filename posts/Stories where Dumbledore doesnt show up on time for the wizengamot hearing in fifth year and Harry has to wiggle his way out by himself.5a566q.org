** Nothing comes to mind...at least, not anything that doesn't feature ridiculous political/overpowered Harry.

Too many fics I've seen that focus on the trial, seem to treat 'holding a full criminal trial e.g. treating the accused as an adult, automatically defeats any charges of underage wizardry (because you're treating them as a legal adult)' as a perfect defense. And there was some strange one where Harry planted bombs throughout the Ministry building and boasted about it?

...I suppose that there's Almost A Squib linkffn(3885086) , it's a snippet story featuring a Harry with very little magic for a change, chapter 5 has a bit about the trial where Harry denies everything.

...Actually, you know what I'd like to see? A fanfiction with the trial in which Harry doesn't answer questions. Not as in stubbornly being silent, as in answering questions with questions and innocently inquiring things, like 'Why would I cast a Patronus charm?' and 'You don't think someone near me could have cast it?'.

Questions designed to pry into how the Ministry detects magic, how they knew Dudley was there but not the dementors, et-cetera. Basically leading Fudge into describing the whole scene of the crime, up to and including what Harry was casting the Patronus at.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
