What would you change or fix?

******** Do we know Dumbledore flew a broom all the way to the Ministry? Which chapter is that? I can imagine him flying, rather than walking, to just outside of Hogwarts' anti-apparition zone. Or maybe he enjoys the sensation of wind up his robes.

I'm not going to assume there is a practical method for transporting a dragon. But again, using brooms just to bypass Hogwarts' anti-apparition field, and then using some other form of transportation for the rest of the trip, seems reasonable.

Patronuses seem like really impractical messengers. For one, anyone can overhear their messages. And what if they deliver their messages while the recipient is busy, flying, asleep, whatever?

How would the map have helped? There wasn't a dot labeled “Heir of Slytherin.”

***** Certain portions of the fandom have criticized JKR for her choice in revealing that Nagini wasn't a snake, but an Asian woman. Because in retrospect, her entire existence now revolves around being a tool, accessory, or a victim of white men.

- In FB:CoG, she's bullied by a circus owner, is rescued by Credence Barebone, and spends the rest of the movie following him around and helping him find his family. She doesn't have much of a motivation or personality of her own besides being a shy monster girl who wants to protect Credence. If you have the script/screenplay, she literally only has 2 lines the entire movie.

- In GoF, she's milked to feed Fetus_Voldemort, does his bidding killing and biting his enemies, carries his soul inside him, so the existence of any personal agency of her own is questionable. This wouldn't have been a problem had she been just a snake, but she's a person under a blood curse, stuck in the body of a snake.

- Then she's decapitated by Neville in DH. No one knows that she was a real person, and no one will remember her, which is sad if she was, along with a bunch of other people, a victim of Voldemort's manipulation, and was brainwashed by his soul piece. Dumbledore may or may not known she was a person, but of course he never told anyone because she had to die for the Greater Good.

** In his speech at the end of year feast in book 4, Dumbledore talks about the importance of being united "Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust." The sorting hat in book 5 has similar sentiments about unity, specifically among the houses. I've always felt it would have been neat to have a sort of B plot, maybe in Half Blood Prince, about unity and houses becoming more united. Unfortunately in canon, nothing ever really came of Dumbledore's speech or the sorting hat's warning.

Also, I'd probably have a few characters (even minor characters) who are in Slytherin, but aren't antagonists. Slytherin got the short end of the stick when it came to likable characters. #JusticeForSlytherin

This is one of my main issues with the portrayal of Harry/Ginny in canon. Harry saves her life in CoS and then she barely shows up at all until HBP. If Rowling intended them to have a mutual bond over their experiences, it's a serious case of "not showing, and for that matter not even telling".

It's not the main premise of White Squirrel's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/4/Scribble-Pad][The Brothers Gaunt]] - that's about some Horcrux shenanigans - but the letters and conversations between Harry and Ginny were one of the few times in fanfic I thought "damn, that actually should have been in the books".

My only quibble with this is that time turners create stable time loops, they don't change the past. Everything H&H experience the first time they go through the climax of PoA happens the same as the second time through, only their new perspective lets them (and us, the reader) see what /really/ happened.

I mean, this is /exactly/ what makes Harry realize he can cast the Patronus -- he already saw himself do it (although he thought he was his dad because he was really out of it at first).

**** Harry would know that Molly cares about him after seeing that her boggart turns into a dead Harry. When Sirius offers him a wrapped package and doesn't tell Harry what it is, just as he did in canon, Harry wouldn't be bothered so much about Molly taking it from him, understanding that she has his best interests in mind. I know at that point, Harry is mad about being kept in the dark about Voldemort and the Order, but this random package doesn't look like it has anything to do with "adult secrets" being kept from him until he's old enough to know. He'd forget about it the next day, and Sirius won't explain it when they spoke through a Floo call. Harry would only find the package in Grimmauld Place clearing the house out after Sirius' death, and remember where it came from.

Of course he'd still feel guilty about not being able to do anything to save Sirius, but I think it's better than him having the mirror in his trunk all along and never opening it, which felt incredibly contrived, just like the Basilisk from CoS that just so happened to never make direct eye contact with any of its half dozen muggleborn victims. That bothers and infuriates me way more than Molly taking the mirror for safekeeping.

Harry having the mirror would change the plot of the books, as Sirius would support him during his angsty "everyone thinks I'm crazy" phase, and offer advice about dealing with Snape and Umbridge. The OP of this thread said "Anything that changes the plot is too big".

  Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.

  He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. ‘Use it if you need me, all right?'

  *Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.*

  *He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.*

  *This is a two-way mirror, I've got the other one of the pair. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.*

  Harry's heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it --

  He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, ‘Sirius.'

  His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.

  He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:

  ‘Sirius Black!'

  Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own .

Without a conviction, it is likely that he would have received custody over the estranged sister who considered magic an abnormality. And Harry would have been safe behind the wards of Grimmauld, which are not breached in canon (one DE learns the secret, but that's another can of worms).

- Allow Voldemort to go full scale evil- let him raze smaller wizard settlements and isolated muggle villages, using their corpses to create an army of inferi. If he destroys one of the smaller wizard schools, make that some sort of "oh shit" moment to show that things just got real.

- Fracture Voldemort's forces into several factions- the cultist/genocidal Death Eaters like Bellatrix, the werewolf rebels, the ambitious power-seeking Death Eaters like Lucius Malfoy, etc. Allow those factions to be played off against each other.

- Increase the threat of polyjuice potions and the imperious curse. Show what happens when they succeed, making our protagonists paranoia more urgent.

- Involve more people in the Horcrux Hunt. Bill Weasley has extensive knowledge regarding reversing darker magicks, and Remus was an extremely capable professor. Minerva Mcgonagall is trustworthy and has access to Hogwarts, and Arther Weasley has contacts within the Ministry that could all be of assistance.

- Involve the DA more, and give them more than just pranking missions. Have Harry and Ginny collaborate often and work together to utilize what is essentially a youth Order of the Phoenix to set up safehouses, smuggle out muggleborn students, and search the Hogwarts Library for obscure information the Golden Trio might need in the field.

By upping the Wizarding population, you open up the story for a much larger scale and dynamic war. As it stands most people seem to be in a holding pattern while the Golden trio do their thing, but making it a dynamic war that Voldemort is winning adds a sense of urgency to the Horcrux Hunt that wasn't there before.

As for why, in universe, people would choose not to send their children to school: the same reason why, in real life, many parents encourage their children to leave school at 16 with minimal qualifications to go get a job. Education is not universally valued, and I picture a large number of wizards feeling like Hogwarts is excessive education. Basic day-to-day spells would be enough for most wizards, plus a specialism in whatever narrow area of magic they use in their career (which they can learn by apprenticeship).

***** Hm, I actually really like that headcanon. It gets the maths to add up.

It doesn't work for every child to go to Hogwarts. If there are 80 per year (let's say Harry's class of 40 was reduced due to the war) and the average wizard lives to 150 (just a guess based on Dumbledore's age), then the Hogwarts-educated population would be about 11K.

But what if Hogwarts is closer to, say, how university was thought of a few decades ago? (i.e. slightly elite and academic, with a corresponding 20-30% attendance rate.) Then the wizarding population swells to a respectable 50K. I'd say that number (just above the smallest principalities in Europe) mostly reflects the size of the wizarding economy we see in the books.

(Some things still don't add up. The Wizengamot seems a bit large, and Lockhart's book signing has /very/ impressive attendance. But we can chalk that up to wizards and witches having a lot of spare time.)

And bullets are faster than the speed of sound, as are the electrical impulses which detonate explosives. The difference in an ambush would be that you get maybe two spells downrange before you are noticed while a good machine gun (eg MG42) spits out forty bullets in those two seconds.

I mean, they were running the entire shop and their mail order business. Most of their products were their own inventions, which means that they spend a lot of time on R&D. Their production capacity was already fully in use before the massive order. And by the time they had produced a significant quantity, Voldemort had taken over.

All of this is speculation, but so is the idea that shield hats would protect you against firearms. Because from the last debate about magical shields, they are usually fixed in place and protect you from all directions, but render you immobile. There is only one directional shield charm, but if you take that idea for shield wear, you'd need a lot more enchantments to cover all sides, which increases production time even more.

  “You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. “Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur's heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It's a big job, he's got ten people reporting to him now!”

  “What exactly?”

  “Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing... so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off... Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Hotelier, who've never done an honest day's work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater

  [...]

  AMULETS

  Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi!

  A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.

  “One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her pretty neck?”

  “If I were on duty...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.
#+end_quote

It's clear that in dangerous times there's a strong market for protective objects. While some are counterfeit, no doubt the genuine article also exists. We know, for example, that sneakoscopes work.

One imagines that most individuals in a dangerous line of work (like snatchers) would seek out some form of magical protection to wear while they go about their business.

Again, I doubt these would be uniform. One person might have a sneakoscope, alerting them in advance to danger such as an ambush. Another might have a protective amulet. A third might cast a protective charm on themselves before they leave the house. Or take some form of protective potion. Another still might have one of Fred and George's shield hats. And so on.

And that's not even getting into the possibility of accidental magic, which may well protect wizards from Muggle dangers, given Hagrid's disbelief that a car crash could kill wizards.

** - Fix the population first. Small societies don't survive civil wars. Small societies also don't have governmental bodies with too many super-specialised departments, and they certainly have absolutely no need for legislatures. The three thousand figure that JKR quoted would make wiz Britain the size of a tiny village - I've never heard of any villages with legislative bodies or of any scientific research like what's shown with the Department of Mysteries that happens on that scale. It is downright ridiculous how bad the math is.

- Also, build the world more. Canon world building is bad at best and absolutely woeful at worst.

- Secondly, bin the no-killing policy of the good guys. I've never heard of a battle that had casualties on only one side. Except for Karánsebes, maybe.

- Thirdly, don't have the war end with the death of Voldemort. Enough is said about his first rise to more or less suggest that the fall of the Ministry was looking inevitable by the time Lily works her miracle. This means that he did have considerable support. Voldemort may be incredibly powerful, but he's also just one man - a figurehead for the Death Eaters. Even if he were to go, they'd still fight on, simply because they're already control the government. For a real life comparison, take the LTTE in Sri Lanka - they kept fighting long after their supremo and his sons were killed.

- Fourthly, saxx.

- Fifthly, make Harry feel emotions other than anger or sadness. The guy feels like a robot at times.

- And lastly, burn the steaming pile of dragon dung that is the everyman with Fiendfyre and let a dementor take away what's left. Let the Chosen One burn bright! This doesn't mean that Harry suddenly has to be running laps around Scottish lakes or whatever - just make him more intelligent and passionate towards magic and the wizarding world in general than the neanderthal he is in canon.

- Also, make Voldemort terrifying. Let him use that awesome magic he used in Book 5 - remove the HP nerf that was rampant in Book 7. The masses didn't learn to fear the Dark Lord's name just because he ran around throwing killing curses like Crabbe or Goyle.

I like to think of her using some more eccentric theories to help in wand making. I also think her father's betrayal of Harry in DH may have given her a crisis of faith leading her to question many of her father's teachings. while I would love to read a story like that, you're right, a lot of this would take away her Lunaness. I would miss that. You've got me rethinking my life!

*** I could happily accept Hinny, but Ginny truly needs deep and lengthy remake, because it is IMHO the worst written character in whole book series. Everybody is excited how Hermione is a feminist hero, but Ginny is like a joke on this theme: it seems to me that the whole point of her existence is to provide a female partner for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** Mostly define the worldbuilding up front and add foreshadowing.

I'd add in hints about the important magics earlier, so things like time turners and portkeys don't come out of nowhere. I'd mention the Triwizard Tournament somewhere in book one, perhaps in history of magic or Hermione's passing comment about historic things that used to take place at Hogwarts. Ron would definitely mention the three brothers at some point before book four, perhaps as a way to tease Ginny or something Harry would overlook.

** Kill the troll on Halloween. Bonk of the head ain't enough, in my opinion, but what do I know about trolls.

Back of the head thing was kinda cool, to be honest, but I like the idea of Quirrell having Voldemort /in/ his head, rather than on the back, trying (and ultimately failing) to fight him off, to justify the stutter.

Parseltongue completely separate from the Horcrux. Shut up, I don't care. His "getting Voldemort's powers" should have been more than just a free language on Harry's character sheet.

Diary tries (and maybe succeeds?) to possess Harry, maybe to perpetrate another attack.

A little more communication between the houses would be nice.

Rename the Chamber. God, that name was stupid. Good on a book cover, I'll admit, but bad in-universe. Call it "Salazar's Chamber" or maybe something in another language. Make it a translation of "reptile room" (my favorite is the Irish /seomra reiptile/) if you want to hilariously kill the mystique, because, hell, /Slytherin really liked snakes, what if he just had a place to take care of them?/

I know that last one might be considered big, given the details, but no, not really. The basilisk is still there, along with the (now admittedly wrong) legend (which no one seems to refute anyway), and Voldemort's still a dick. Canon still plays out as normal, as long as no one notes the Latin roots too early (hey, if we're not changing canon too much, we can assume not many of these students have taken foreign language)
