**** Yeah, you could give consent, but...why use the Imperius if you have consent?

Unless you want to go for some seriously flexible positions...maybe? It's sort of implied that the Imperius curse can give the victim abilities they otherwise don't have, according to this:

#+begin_quote
  Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.
