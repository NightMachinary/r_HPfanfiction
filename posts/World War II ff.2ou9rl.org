*** Altered Destinies is quite enjoyable. Harry raising Tom isn't quite as fluffy as it could have been which is nice. The plot is interesting, the setting is great and the original characters and exploration of canon characters is quite well done. However it has a corny prophecy and a few other niggles that turned me off it a little. All in all, there are not many WW2 fics and if you're desperate for one give this a read.

** Well not sure if it's for you or even fits but my first thought was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]]. In it Dumbledore loses the famous duel with Grindelwald and the story is set 50 years later. So a sort of long grueling continuation of WWII with a both wizard and muggle forces. The reason I mention is because it just /felt/ like a WWII that grinds on for decades more - the way I pictured it in my mind was the sort of rough and tumble WWII vets you see in old pictures/films with old guns but with wands to match.

The tone or something is much much different than typical fanfiction and tbh I didn't particularly enjoy it despite it being well written (probably because I wasn't ready/wanting that sort of tone). It does have some interesting Dumbledore in there so my recommendation would be read the prologue and first few paragraphs of chapter 1 at least and you'll probably know if it's up your alley.

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate by Firephoenix8]]. Harry is sent back in time as a baby and grows up in an orphanage with Tom Riddle. The author tries to be historically accurate, mentions important events of WW II and their impact on the wizarding world. It's not finished and hasn't been updated in a while, but it's 700 000 words long, so that should last you a while.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]]. Admittedly the war itself never gets a chance to come up, really, but a nice Grindelwald/WWII Magical Germany creation.

** Check out Resolving a Misunderstanding on AO3 (on phone so can't link properly). Not really about WWII, but it's in there.
