Harry might be Cut from the same cloth as his mother with that strange magical ability of theirs but as the boy's only living relations they had a duty to look after the boy to the best of their collective ability, just as his mother would had done if she was still breathing.

Philip himself might not think that magical abilities were entirely natural, on that he and His niece petunia agreed wholeheartedly. Just as they argeed the boy should be raised by family as was his birth right as an Evans of Surrey. But on one key point Philip and Petunia disagreed , Philip was of the opinion that there familial protection and duties extend to Harry's schooling not just to the months the boy little in Little Whingeing.

And so Petunia and he had reached a deal. She would raise the boy until his school years and then Philip would assume Guardianship over his Peculiar great nephew until the boy's majority. Philip had heard an Underlying sense of glee when Petunia has signed The transfer of custody papers that morning when she informed him the owl at the kitchen widow was intended for him.

A letter inform Philip his new charge had nearly died battling a Basilisk ,” A giant snake he had had to Google it.” But Harry was recovering quickly and there was no need for his to worry. This great nephew had nearly died and the woman had the gull to write him telling him not to worry and not to visit as the school term was nearly as an end.

Philip had practically growled and crushed the letter before phoning his schoolmate in the war office. To request a 713 level escort to the magical world ,”for family business “. Arthur hadn't even questioned his motives , the man just told him it was about bloody time he took charge of the boy, they had by far too much paper work from there Magical counterparts with Harry Potter's name in the file. Arthur helpFully informed him they had a room in the war archives dedicated to Harry's school the misadventures, Or near death experiences at Philip would call them.

But the name of the files did not matter the end result was the same, Philip had an armed escort of British soldiers and an Advisory delegation of Aurors accompanying him to perform a welfare check on his great Nephew. And perhaps help him tear the headmaater and Deputy headmistress a new one if the boy's condition was anything less then pristine. Philip was prepared to shot the man in the ass if his nephew even had a scratch from this latest incident.

The Hogwarts Administration were in for a rude awakening , as the Evans did not tolerate an unsafe environment for the Children in their family even if Petunia's protections before he had taken over had been lack luster at best.


** I had an idea. Hope you don't mind that I continued it for a bit? (not everything is accurate, but I wrote this whole thing for fun, sooo)

--------------

Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of Britain, Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, had a steely look in his face as he beheld the "escort" force assembled as the wardline.

"What is the meaning of this?"

"I am here to check on my nephew. I'm sure you understand, Headmaster."

"Surely that does not require an army?"

"That depends on you."

"I see."

The line would hold, Albus knew that - having been drawn by the Founders themselves and accumulated power for over a thousand years, nothing but the concentrated force of all the atom bombs in Britain would ever crack it.

"I am within my rights, Albus. You know the laws as much as I do."

"I beg to differ! The magical section of the Magna Carta clearly states that the muggle military has no juristiction on magical ground, and yet here you are, with them in your escort."

"If you'd actually read the section in recent years, you would know it has been amended in the wake of the first blood war, as an effort to promote muggle-wizard relations."

"Be that as it may, the Hogwarts charter does not recognize any alterations made after 1876."

"You are on british soil, Albus. The law does not care what your school recognizes."

"The Statute of Secrecy clearly establishes all land settled by magicals and nonmagical relations of the first degree to be magical land, separate from the british crown."

"It also states that the Statute can be lifted if the wizarding government was found to be tainted."

"Yes, by Dark Magic!"

"The letter of the law clearly states 'In the event that the wizards and witches of the Wizen-gamot become irretrievably corrupted, an emergency order may be put into effect that lifts the so-called Statute of Secrecy across the entirety of her majesty's British Isles before these corrupted mages become a danger to the populace at large, and allows military action to contain the spread.'"

"Do you mean to start a civil war, Philip? Have you gone mad?"

"Quite the opposite, Albus. I am in perfect health. It is you who allowed my nephew to come to harm within your school."

"You threaten my people with a civil war under the authority of the Queen, yet the Queen has no juristiction in magical scotland."

"Scotland is part of Great Brit-"

"Irrelevant! The treaty of Edinburough, signed in 1654, forbids any english interference in the magical scottish kingdoms."

"Albus, are you advocating Sedition?"

"Not at all. However, as you perhaps know, Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, Hogmoor, Hogswey and Hogburrow, as well as the surrounding Highlands, all belong to the magical Earldom of Gryffindor."

"Which was subsumed with all magical Earldoms in the early 18th century."

"Only those in England and Wales."

"Yes, because the scottish Earldoms were integrated into the Scottish crown before it was taken into Great Britain!"

"Only the muggle ones, Philip. The magical Earldoms still exist, if only in name."

"Without an Earl, the Earldom becomes defunct after three generations. You know this, Albus."

"Generations are defined differently in the magical world. It still persists to this day."

"You forgot, Albus, that this all hinges on the muggle force with me! If I send them away, I will be free to enter the school with my Aurors, and turn things around in there."

"No, you will not. I, Headmaster of Hogwarts, forbid you entry!"

There was a shift beyond perception, and suddenly, everyone present knew none of the escort force, nor Philip himself, would be able to cross into the school.

"You are escalating, Albus. This could be construed as an act of war."

"You mean to attack a school of innocent children?"

"This school is holding my nephew hostage. I will do everything in my power to get him away from you."

"Your nephew was attacked by a Basilisk. He requires magical care, because his is a magical injury."

"So he is injured? I am within my rights to attack anyone who attempts to maliciously prevent access to an injured family member, you know."

"You mean to siege the school?"

"If that is what it takes. Aurors! Wands up!"

Some hesitated to raise their wands against their Headmaster, but eventually, a series of wands were steadily pointed at Albus.

He simply raised a bushy eyebrow, and a solid curtain of energy rolled upwards, slowly but surely forming a dome across the school grounds.

"These walls have held against stronger foes than you, Philip."

*** I don't understand, what does Albus have against the guy entering the school with a bunch of Aurors? The Muggle Military I could understand, but what's the problem with the others?

It's no like Albus could keep Harry there all summer. That could be construed as kidnapping.

**** I mean, he's a schoolteacher, and the guy brought an army, then began threatening him with starting a civil war between wizards and muggles.

I wanted to take the piss out of this prompt, show that a grown man trying to intimidate his way into a school with military might isn't a smart thing to do.

***** Ah, well, in that case, it's very well done.

Still, said schoolteacher basically let a 12 year old kid face something more dangerous than a dragon with nothing but a sword and maybe a Phoenix(who stopped helping after gouging it's eyes, yeah, big help, but it was still a 20 meter long snake with a mouth the size of a car.)

I wish Hogwart's Wards are all we crack them up to be in canon, instead of the improvised shield two professors and a parent had to hash up on short notice and a bunch of armors that weren't that effective in the end.
