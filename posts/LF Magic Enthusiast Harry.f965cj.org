So, I want a story where Harry likes Magic. I'm not asking for genius/bookworm Harry, nor am I asking for Second Coming Of Merlin/Dumbledore Harry - just an average person who's in love with the idea that he can bend the rules of nature with a short wooden stick alone.

I'd rather he not treat magic as a tool or means to an end - so most "I must train to Overcome X" style fics wouldn't apply.

Basically, I'm looking for something like Geek of Magic by jlluh, only less crack and without Harry having some sort of mental issues.

Preferably without too much AU elements.


** Also is there any fic that you have read and liked and are looking for something similar cuz that would help us help you

*** As I said, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694) was really promising, until it went full on crack with Harry becoming stereotypical "absent minded genius", incapable of functioning without supervision.

Victoria Potter linkffn(12713828) is also quite good in that regard, although I wasn't a big fan of AU elements introduced in it.

Can't think of anything else at the moment. Most stories where Harry focuses on magical studies use it as a plot device to make him more powerful for the challenges to come, and that's not quite what I'm looking for.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** The Archaeologist by Racke has a fem!Harry picking up loose magic as a hobby. Very much in love with the idea of magic, and no 'I must train to Overcome X' vibes to it. Just "I found myself in a ruin, got a bunch of books, then read 'em all in twenty minutes because spells are cool, yo".

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
