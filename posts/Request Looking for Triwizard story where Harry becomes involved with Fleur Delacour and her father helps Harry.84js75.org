during the third task right after Harry returns Mr Delacour and the French DMLE specialists manage to track the coordinates of the port key back to the cemetery. The French DMLE team goes to the cemetery and using sniper rifles kills/shoots Voldemort, all death eaters still present and Nagini, Riddle's snake. several of the French notice the spirit leave both the snake & Riddle/Voldemort and are able to conclude he used soul anchors. I am not sure if the story involved other women with Harry (Gabrielle?),

** I was thinking it was one of the two (fem!harry/Veela+Harry fics) named the same [Heart and Soul], but nope.

Hmm... I know exactly the story. It turned weird on me, so I kind of fizzled out on me, but I know I have read it.

There we go. It's Harry/Gabrielle. linkffn(8358170): The Hero and the Veela
