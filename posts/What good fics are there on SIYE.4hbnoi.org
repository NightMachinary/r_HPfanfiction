** Most Harry/Ginny fics are also posted on SIYE. If you mean good fics exclusive to SIYE/phoenixsong:

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260&chapter=1&textsize=2][Curse Breakers: The Maya]]: Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.phpaction=printable&textsize=0&sid=12686&chapter=all#2][I Need a Hero]]: When Britain's vampires side with Voldemort, the Auror department calls in GM Weasley to take care of it. But she's not the only hero around, and sometimes, even heroes need to be saved.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12266&chapter=all][Counting To Five thousand]]: One decision leads to an army of consequences, and a lifetime is not too long to spend amending them.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=128876&chapter=all][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]]: â€˜Win a date with Ginny Weasley!' the advert in Quidditch Illustrated magazine announced in big, bold letters that were impossible to ignore. It was all a bit ridiculous, in Harry's opinion, but after a frustrating year spent trying (and failing) to work up enough nerve to tell Ginny he wanted her back, perhaps this was the opportunity he had been waiting for. Now all he needed to do was actually win the damn thing!

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129073][The Pros and Cons of Living]]: Six years after the disappearance of Harry Potter, the wizarding world has turned into a Death Eater's playpen and every member of the Order, Muggleborn, or Blood Traitor has been forced into hiding. How does one survive when they are torn away from everyone and everything they've ever known? And what do you do when the ghost of your past shows up again and forces you back into a world you've been desperately trying to disappear from?

** The Hogs Head: by MyGinevra is a Ginny's seventh year fic that is really well done. I took my own penname from this author as inspiration (GinnyMyLove) though I'd read fic before that (non romance) and not long after I started using that to post on other sites I fell in love more with Hermione than Ginny.
