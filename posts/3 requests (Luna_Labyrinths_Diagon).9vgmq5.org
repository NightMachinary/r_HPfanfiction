1. Fics that feature a labyrinth in any way?
2. New(ish) Luna-centric fic thats actually good?
3. New(ish) fics that feature Diagon Alley or its offshoot alleys?


** For 3) the gold standard has to be linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels. The first book isn't close to new(ish) but book four is still being written. I can't remember where it starts, but what the author calls "the lower alleys" feature prominently, with excellent detail and wonderful characters.

** 1) As a non native speaker: whats the difference between a labyrinth and a maze? 2) I did enjoy linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lords Diary) a lot. Others didnt.

*** Oh, I totally didn't think about the maze from the triwizard tournament probably counting as a labyrinth haha. Technically there's not really a difference? But I was thinking things besides the triwizard maze, I guess more of like an exploring mysteries type of theme that has labyrinths involved? And thank you for the rec!
