**** Here you go it's a copy pasta

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

** Typical fanon headcanon: Daphne Greengrass was a hot blonde (sometimes a brunette) that Harry overlooked much to his detriment.

My personal headcanon (or observation): it's super easy to develop Gryffindor, canon Harry into a Dark wizard. All the other bs is very unnecessary.

Fan fictions: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) and, just for the hell of it, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) unfortunately that's technically a staple. It's really just a great example of authors not reading the books and that part of the fandom that is incapable of not applying science and logic to something that typically doesn't follow the rules of science or logic.

Posts:

Two posts: that blog post that renames the series after Hermione (it's bs but it does explain /a lot/ about the fandom) and that essay ripping Harmony to shreds. There's also a Dumbledore post on here pointing out why most of the bashing is due to a comprehension issue. So three I guess.

***** I think what the Harmony destroying essay cemented for me was not that Harry and Hermione were fundamentally incompatible or not destined for each other, but that Ron and Hermione had a chemistry, a /frisson/ with each other in the words of a famous Britpicker, in a way that Harry and Hermione do not.

Whether a strong and stable marriage can be built on /frissons/ is something many fic authors have written for and against, but the essay really opened my eyes about that.

****** To be fair, that is actually a massive problem in real life, too: plenty of people marry due to extremely good sexual/romantic chemistry, but are fundamentally incompatible when it comes to living together, raising children, prioritising each other's career/leisure goals etc, then spend years trying to hold together the relationship, so it's not an unfair angle to take.

Whether that describes Ron and Hermione, I don't know. I think they could work, given enough time to adjust to each other in their adult roles.

** For Remus/Sirius, [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] is one of the staple fics. (Nice art, too.)

While I was an older fan and not quite this intense or personally invested, I thought [[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/12/10/harry-potter-and-the-secret-gay-love-story/][this article]] did a good job capturing the feel and impact of (some corners of) the early fandom. The R/Hr and H/Hr fandoms were also independently re-inventing close reading in their battles. I don't think it's coincidence that so many shippers turn out to be academics and lawyers.

**** Yeah, that article honestly hit me kind of hard the first time I read it, because it was so true.

It wasn't the first time that the story I thought I was reading (and wanted to read) turned out not to be the one the author was telling, and it certainly wasn't the last. In fact, I'm currently going through something nearly identical with Steve in Avengers: Endgame. However, it was one of the ones that had the strongest emotional impact and sure as hell gave me the strongest push into "death of the author" and "fuck canon" attitudes.

I'm generally a fan of authors planning out serial stories in advance, because lord knows they go off the rails nearly 100% of the time when they don't. But Remus Lupin's fate is a lesson in the dangers of doing so without ever reconsidering the decisions you made before putting a single word to paper. She wrote the epilogue first! Lupin /had/ to marry a woman, /had/ to have a child, /had/ to die in battle... even though the "boarding-school romance turned wartime tragedy, Maurice meets Atonement by way of Animorphs" she accidentally wrote between the lines is a far better and more interesting story.

***** It is somehow very freeing and comforting to divorce oneself from canon. If Endgame doesn't suit your needs, you have no responsibility to keep including it in your thoughts and stories. All stories are equal. Some might be closer to the canon, but the only canon is exactly what we see in the original story and everything else is equally fanfiction no matter the "canon compliant" tags. In such way, the canon really becomes a vague guideline. I'm much happier with this understanding and I am kind of grateful it happened this way and when it happened. I have never needed to be in any form of a shipping war even in my mind or anything else like it because to me, everyone is free to write and believe what they want.

Yes, same! Some younger fans I know were really devastated by what happened with Steve in Endgame, but while I was unhappy about it, it was also much easier for me to shrug and go "[[https://media1.tenor.com/images/1ab724b5f1bfd05aaf0a31ff652a5c36/tenor.gif?itemid=4747789][fuck that, time to read fanfiction]]!"
