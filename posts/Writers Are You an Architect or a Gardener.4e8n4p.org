GRRM gave an [[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/blog/the-geek/a-conversation-with-game-of-thrones-author-george-rr-martin-20110731-1i6wj][interview]] a long time ago where he said:

#+begin_quote
  There are architects and gardeners. The architects do blueprints before they drive the first nail, they design the entire house, where the pipes are running, and how many rooms there are going to be, how high the roof will be. But the gardeners just dig a hole and plant the seed and see what comes up. I think all writers are partly architects and partly gardeners, but they tend to one side or another, and I am definitely more of a gardener. In my Hollywood years when everything does work on outlines, I had to put on my architect's clothes and pretend to be an architect. But my natural inclinations, the way I work, is to give my characters the head and to follow them.

I was wondering how the regulars of this subreddit would define themselves. One of these two categories or a mix of the two? If so, which one do you emulate most often?


** Neither seems quite right. Maybe more like a mad scientist- I write various scenes as I think them up and then try to shoehorn them into a plot and sew them together like Frankenstein's monster. I usually have an idea of the plot beforehand but don't make an outline or map it out on paper, but it doesn't feel like the story grows organically or in order either. I'll write scads of notes on the worldbuilding or magic system though.

** I am definitely an architect. I'm an obsessive plotter, planner and researcher.

The whole gardening approach blocks me because in the back of my head I am always worrying about hitting an insurmountable obstacle in the plot.

** It depends on what I'm writing; if it's something serious, I'm very much an architect (or, at least, I try to be), and if it's something comedic, I let the characters take me where I need to go.

** Most gardener, with some architect. I like to have a /general/ idea of where things are going, but most of the time I start with a specific scene in my brain, write it down, and go from there.

In reality that means a lot of the fanfics I start never leave my hard drive. The up side is, I can participate in NaNoWriMo without too much issue, I just start writing.

** I'm an architect all the way. It's when I attempt a little gardening that my story grows unmanageable and characters go off in different directions than I had intended.

** I'm a natural gardener, but the architect approach matters a lot when setting up big, overarching plots, so I'm attempting it. Kinda kills my drive though.

** I'm definitely more of an architect. I need a goal, a place to head the story toward before I start writing. That goal may change during the story, but at least it prevents scenes from being directionless.

** I'm more of an architect. I usually have a chapter by chapter plan before I start and have an idea of how all the plots and subplots go. Things change as I start actually writing, but I know how everything ends.

** I am a garden decorator.

/“Oh, it is fun to plant a few seeds and watch the whole thing grow into a delightful display of nature as time goes. Sometimes, though, the whole composition benefits from guiding it a little, planting more seeds as time passes, and one definitely cannot start without carefully checking the initial state before the garden is left to grow.”/

** I am definitely an Architect. I used to write a long time ago, but I'd always get stuck and lose my interest in the story. So when I came up with my first idea for a fanfic and decided to start writing again, I decided to do it differently and try planning the entire thing out first. At first, this was very difficult, but once I got started, I couldn't stop. Ideas started flowing, I realized certain thing wouldn't work because of plot holes, and I also realized that if I want to write the story, it's at least going to have a sequel. I loved creating an outline for the story so much that I decided to do it for my original work too, and it's working!

** I've found that I plan out the situation / scenes that start the story and cause it to go AU and usually have a general idea in my head of some things I want to happen but other than that I just start writing and see where it takes me.

** I know a writer who defines the categories as "plotter" and "pantser". As in, "by the seat of". There's a certain appeal to those category names.

** When it comes to my novel that I'm writing, I'm a full blown architect. I know exactly when to write what and why.

When it comes to my fanfiction, I barely even have a rough idea of my plot. I just write ahead, hoping for the best.
