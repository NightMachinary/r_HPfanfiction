Just finished what's been posted of Albus and Harry's World Trip and the Accidental Animagus, and I'm desperate for a fic with a well-meaning, powerful Dumbledore who doesn't mess everything up like he's usually portrayed in those indy!Harry fics. I'll read anything except Snape/Lily & Harry/Voldemort. Grazie!


** Those are the two fics that come to mind when I think of good Dumbledore haha. Since you've read The Accidental Animagus, maybe you've read linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) by the same writer? Much shorter but I enjoy competent Dumbledore who takes the Basilisk very seriously. It's also a great use of For Want of a Nail. Dumbledore plays a fairly minor role in linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) but definitely a positive one. Also, if you're up for a Dumbledore mentoring young Tom Riddle fic, there's linkffn(Last Chance by Laume).

** I like [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/14602.html][These gyves on my hands set you free]] It's set after Voldemort's return. Snape's going back to spy and Dumbledore is worried about the war. He makes mistakes, he realizes that but he's so well-meaning and worried about saving other people including Harry.
