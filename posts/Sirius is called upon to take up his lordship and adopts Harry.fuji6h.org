:END:
He wakes up in a hospital and one of his family members reminds him that he is a Black. When he adopts Harry, they do a protection ritual that involves Hermione and McGonagall, and I think one of the Black ladies? Lily Potter's spirit ends up giving her blessing? An unspeakable declares it a “need to know” event? I believe there may also be a war effort with the head of the aurors, an unspeakable, and Dumbledore.

I read this fic not too long ago but I really cannot remember the name. If someone could help me out I would really appreciate it.

  Lily and James weren't as blind as most people might have thought and made plans for their only son and heir. This is their story and his.
