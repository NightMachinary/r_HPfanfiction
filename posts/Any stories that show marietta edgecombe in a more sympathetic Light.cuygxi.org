Mainly the over the fact that Kingsley memory charmed her so she presumably doesn't even remember why she ended up permanently scared.

Depending on how much of her memory was modified even if the she did regret her action and want to seek forgiveness she wouldn't be able to.(I assume that Cho couldn't tell her because when Marietta betrayed the DA she was Kicked out so Cho could not talk to her about the DA anyone because she was no longer a member).

If Kingsley really did wipe marietta's mind of Everything to do with the DA I feel even more sorry for her after all I am sure that at least some Members of the DA like the Weaslys twins probably Sort retribution against her.

Not to mention we also don't know just how badly Umbridge coerced after at minimum she threatened the girls mother who knows what else she could have done. At minimum I could see umbridge putting a minor truth serum in the girls drink the losses her tounge.(no veritaserm like she does in the movies to Cho).


** The only story I know of that touches on this is Justice, Justice You Shall Pursue: linkffn(11961978)

Not the main point of the story, but the second chapter focuses on Hermione learning Marietta was memory charmed, and is much more sympathetic to her while not excusing her entirely.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

*** I did too, although not to the degree you do.

Don't get me wrong, she didn't deserve to be scarred like that, but she was a traitor. Hermione was in the wrong for not bringing up that she's jinxing the parchment.

Her social ostracization is deserved.

** Marietta and Umbridge are the only times I truly applaud Hermione's viciousness.

2 points: Kingsley didn't modify her memory so that she forgot the DA as a whole. He modified it so that she would deny if they met regularly for 6 months. And Umbridge tried to give Harry veritaserum, but...

From what I remember, /Marietta/ went to Umbridge because she, and her mother, sided with the ministry and the only reason she was there was because Cho forced her to. I don't really have a sympathetic view of her and I can muster up sympathy for Draco, Fudge, Scrimgeour, and Pansy.

*** Yet, narratively, if Harry did the same to Malfoy, he'd treated as in the wrong and be in detention until the end of the year.

Marietta was a traitor, and I definitely agree with her being socially ostracized, but leaving her permanently scarred is just a bit much. Although if it was a preventative measure, it'd be great.

Can't remember if they know who jinxed the parchment and I think the difference is the severity. There's also the fact that Snape is an asshole and plot.

***** I fixed my post, forgot a phrase. It doesn't really change much, but I don't want to be one of those people who tries to retroactively make my stance better.

The children definitely know who cursed it. It's kinda odd she never went to Umbridge about that. Easily grounds for an expulsion after Dumbledore left.

Snape is an asshole, but it was self-defense against a cruciatus curse. You know, the thing that drove the Longbottoms insane!

It's not the measure that bothers me, it's that it's meant to be a preventative measure in the books, but it's never really said so.

... This must be how the ACLU feels defending Neo-Nazis.

****** Yeah, they know who cursed it, but the fear of being branded a "sneak" kept everyone's mouth shut, which was why Umbridge resorted to veritaserum with Harry. And I'm sure the majority were on Hermione's side of things

Harry could've defended himself against certain death or used a stunning spell. Snape would've given him detention lol.

I know that in fanfiction Marietta seems to have become the fanon ring leader of Luna's bullies.(at least I am pretty sure it's fanon).

And then They kind of just forget to Fix Marrieta's face once Umbridge was gone.
