I often find to like fics where there is a lot of interaction with magical and non-magical creatures, so now im looking for fics where: *Harry works with creatures - raising magical creatures, protects endangered creatures. Etc. *Harry lives with/adopted by creatures/animals (pre-Hogwarts?) *Harry is stuck in animagus form and seeks shelter among animals. *Harry as Dragonhandler, (speaks parsel with dragons?)

No slash please


** Linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim) Harry's best friend is Hagrid, and he is a Listener. He actually gets along with the Basilisk.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

** I have some one-shots that feature magical creatures. They're more Ginny-centric, but still feature Harry. :D

  Ginny undertakes a quest. This is a brand new one-shot set in my Reconnecting Potterverse. It picks up some time after "Just Friends" and features an adventure with Harry and Ginny in San Francisco. Many thanks to my beta-reader Doraemon for the inspiration.
