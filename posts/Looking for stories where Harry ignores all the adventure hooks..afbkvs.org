:END:
I've been reading a lot of fanfiction recently, and in many stories, Harry Potter might change as a character, but ultimately usually ends up going on the same adventures as he did in the books and movies.

I think I'd like to read some stories where Harry completely ignores the adventure hooks, for any reason, be it because he's lazy, or cautious, or decides it's not worth the trouble; examples of adventure hooks would be Dumbledore mentioning the third floor and giving him the invisibility cloak in the first year, or news of Sirius Black having escaped Azkaban in third year.


** Let's see what could happen:

Year 1

- Harry didn't get into that flying contest with Draco, so no seeker for him
- Harry didn't get into that duel with Draco, so no alienation with Hermione, no finding out about Fluffy
- Harry didn't get into that fight against Troll, so Hermione was either killed or she didn't cry in that loo because of the above point. Anyway, the Trio was not formed.
- No hint about Fluffy, no Hermione doing research, no Hermione pushing them on studying, no hint from Hagrid about Flamel
- No sneaking out under the Cloak, no visitation of the Mirror
- Finally, Quirrellmort got stuck in front of the Mirror and was neutralized by Dumbledore. Voldemort ceased to be a threat for a very very long time.
- Since no adventures together, no great friendship with Ron

Year 2

- No rescue by Weasleys after the Cake Incident
- No flying to Hogwarts in Ford Anglia
- Even if Dobby blocked the 9 3/4 entrance, Ministry officials would reopen it quickly.
- Lucius still planted the Diary on Ginny, but she broke free sometime in November and dumped it in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
- Since this Harry avoided that place like pest, it was not found again for years, or even decades.
- The CoS plot came to an abrupt halt, and nobody had a clue about what had happened.

Year 3

- Weasleys still went to Egypt, took that picture, and Sirius broke out.
- Harry didn't ride Buckbeak or simply didn't care, no saving Buckbeak episode.
- No close friends with Weasleys means no Marauder's Map.
- Sirius successfully killed Wormtail and went on the run.

Year 4

- Since both Voldemort and Wormtail had been neutralized, Bertha Jorkins was fine, and there was no sabotage attempt at TWT.
- Barty Jr broke free from his father's Imperius Curse during the Quidditch World Cup and went on the run.

After all that, two characters should drive the plot forward:

- Sirius who wanted to exonerate himself and be together with Harry
- Barty Jr who wanted to find his Lord and free his comrades from Azkaban

*** Oh I love this. A whole story taking place in three completely distinct threads:

Harry being all slice-of-life school drama with a generally fluffy tone that slowly turns towards romance/angst as Harry becomes a teenager.

A super-creepy behind-the-scenes thing where Quirrelmort is stuck in front of the Mirror of Erised for /years/ and Dumbles finds himself in the role of unintentional jailer working to help Quirrel's body survive the possession by Riddle. Meanwhile, Barty Jr., being both obsessive and a true genius, is slowly closing in on finding his master.

Finally, Sirius is on the run, and has comedic adventures trying to complete missions Dumbles gives him while dodging incompetent Ministry employees (think Johnny English/Austin Powers/Top Secret).

*** Well, Ginny would die, you could have vastly different character dynamics afterwards. From concerned parents and a Ministry intervention up to grieving Weasleys. Pettigrew is murdered, Harry does not learn about Sirius innocence. And Harry might be dumped into the TWT without prior "battle" experience.

Or you could write a slice-of-life fic which focuses on character interactions. Again, this can be anything from Harry the womanizer who puts Barney Stinson to shame up to Harry getting his wish for normalcy and happily finishing his Charms homework while pining after his latest crush but never acting on it. You can write Harry cuddling with his honorary sister Hermione after a run-in with the dementors and the resulting nightmares. You can have Harry the Quidditch Star. You can have almost anything you want without the adventure hooks.

***** I've written a few oneshots which are fairly character focused and ignore most of the overall plot. For example, in "Bad at This", Malfoy is still carrying out his plot somewhere in the background, but Harry and Hermione rather discuss their "failed" friends with benefits arrangement than worry about doom and gloom.

And I have a longer, ongoing story where Harry is adopted by the Tonks family after the Third year and while he is still in the TWT, the story is about family and friendship first and foremost.

*** I think that's not a bad thing. I'd be more than interested to get a more in-depth look at magical education than what was depicted in the books and movies, since education is more than just going to class and the library, ie, getting tutoring for subjects a student is poor in, going to a professor's office hours to seek assistance or clarification on assignments, etc.

Hell, I think a more vigorous look at the magical education system would be an interesting subject to explore; in the books and movies, it's hard to really understand what the Hogwarts curriculum is like because classes are shown only as fragments to further the plot, so I don't have a good grasp of the process through which students at the school actually learn magic in a step-by-step manner. Hell, even the way they teach magic seems kind of ineffectual, given so much of it seems some classes are a form of democratic education (Charms comes to mind, since, if I recall correctly, Flitwick demonstrates a charms a few times, then leaves it to the students to figure out how to make it work) while others are strict lectures (History of Magic, for example).

Basically, I think the day-to-day life of going to magic school is itself interesting, exactly because it's */magic/* school, and magic itself is interesting because, well, it's fantastical. It's like in /Almost a Squib/, where Harry Potter pays rapt attention to Binn's lectures in History of Magic rather than sleep through them because, to him, it's all new information and that makes it wonderful and interesting.
