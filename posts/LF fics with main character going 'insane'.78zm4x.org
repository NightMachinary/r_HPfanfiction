And we are taken along for the ride. Irrationality, obsession, visual and/or auditory hallucinations, memory loss, etc. Can be from a genetic disorder, abuse/neglect, legilimency, horcruxes/dark artifacts, dark magic, possession, etc.

Some non-fanfic examples: [[/spoiler][The Joker (Batman/DC), Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs), Alice (Still Alice), Nina (Black Swan), The Narrator (Fight Club), Gollum (Lord of the Rings).]]

An okay fanfiction example would be linkffn(9561455)

I'm using "insane" as a loose term because I don't know how else to phrase it.


** Equal and Opposite - linkffn(2973799)

Ruined In A Day (and sequels) - linkffn(982805)

What Lies Beneath - linkffn(3688693)

Harry pretty much goes insane in all of them.

** In the R trilogy Voldemort dies without the scar horcrux being destroyed. At some point (after Harry loses his "innocence") it begins affecting him - Harry gradually begins to adopt some of Voldemort's thought patterns, like paranoia, obsession with power, extreme fear of death, assessing others based on their potential use and so on. Later on it worsens to murderous impulses, violent revenge plans and the onset of full-on psychopathy. It's very well narrated.

All this happens during the second book of the trilogy, but I recommend you start with the first, otherwise you'll be kinda lost.

**** Undoubtedly - this is one of my absolute favorites. Unless you can't stomach /any/ incarnation of Snape. But this is a different Snape, not the dark sex god of the dungeons fanon version and not the creepy shitbag from canon. He's not as deeply flawed as in canon - there is enough human decency there, a sort of desperate "I fucked up when I was young and I'm still paying the price and I will keep paying it willingly". His motivations run beyond the creepy obsession with Lily.

Characterizations and plot are great too - but the writing style is what won me over so completely (I've read this 6-7 times). It's just /warm/ and /clear/, those are the only words that can capture my meaning. Just like drinking a hot cup of tea after being out in the cold all day.

Plus, Harry learns all sorts of super-cool magic.
