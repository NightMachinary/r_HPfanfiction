TIL that Umbridge's first name, Dolores, literally means sorrow or pain. (Now I'm wondering why that's even a name in the first place. Why would someone want to give their child a name with such negative connotations?)


** [[https://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Dolores][Dolores]] is a fairly common name and of biblical origin.

Pain, or endure pain, is a central theme in many religions and societies.

** And 'umbrage' can also mean 'annoyance' or 'to take offence', which Dolores Umbridge basically is/does for most of the time.

** Maybe it's like a preventative thing by parents. They wanted to name her that to prevent that from her life, why names for a time meant so much to choose the right one as people imagined it set out your child's path in life. Maybe it was to counter like a blood curse or jinx on the family. Like I watched a documentary I believe set in India about things like this where parents who hear from fortune tellers that their child's first spouse would be struck down by illness or something horrible would then marry their child to a goat and just wait if out believing they had vested the evil as they would lose their first spouse by the time they were old enough to be married off to a person. Some of Bollywood films use the same premise to marry characters off to animals if the spouse is cursed.
