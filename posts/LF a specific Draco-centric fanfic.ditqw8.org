Hello everyone. Figured I'd post this here just in case someone else has read this fic. I'm looking for a specific fanfic, it's about a Draco who's memories? I think are sent back in time to him being a child and he approaches his grandfather Abraxas Malfoy about it although he tells him it was a dream. This leads to Abraxas favouring him over his father and Abraxas works alongside Black Family to raise Draco to be a better heir than Lucius. I don't really remember much else except that at a later point during his Hogwarts years he befriends Harry who is then ‚Äúkidnapped‚Äù by someone as they know Dursley's abuse him and he spends the summer playing with Draco and living with his great aunt who is a Black. He is then memory-charmed to hide the memory of his summer by Abraxas before going back to school. Also Abraxas is then killed by an assassin who was hired by Lucius as he got tired of waiting to become Lord Malfoy.

Not the most helpful but if you've read it I'd appreciate the help. Thanks so much üôÇ.

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.
