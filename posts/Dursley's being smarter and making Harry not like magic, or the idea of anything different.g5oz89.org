Or any similar thing to it, doesn't have to be exactly that.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual.

It can be on ANY site. Anyone can be the main character. Am fine with any warnings.

No OP Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Would rather not have character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is usually a no go. It's okay if it's relatively minor, but would rather have none.
