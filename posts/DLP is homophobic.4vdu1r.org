** Please stop creating drama. This is the second time you've created a DLP-bashing thread in a month. While there are plenty who would rather just [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43ma1p/i_havent_been_on_the_dark_lord_potter_forums_in_a/czli5d9][shitpost insults]], there are also many decent users who have interesting opinions on the HP world, so you won't find much traction for this kind of idiocy.

They have their problems (I wonder if they'd consider sending something like [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=229328&postcount=220][this]] to their employer), but so long as they refrain from telling redditors to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zx0iw/a_very_long_rant_about_stupid_fanfiction_reviewers/cyqk5ch][kill themselves]] they should be welcomed here.

You bring up some good points, but to argue that the DLPer in that thread really truly wished for the redditor to kill himself is intellectually dishonest. It was a tongue-in-cheek response to a tongue-in-cheek comment. To suggest anything otherwise is making a mountain out of a molehill.

**** Nothing that redditor said gave Jon the right to suggest that they actually kill themselves. I know you aren't /trying/ to be an apologist for bullying, but please understand how Jon's comment looks to someone who isn't in DLP: a threat.

***** I should clarify I'm not part of DLP, I made one or two posts over there several years ago and then dropped out of the fandom for a while. I just don't see this as a threat or a genuine suggestion for someone to kill themselves. The OP made an exaggerated claim that he would rather drown (and it's not unreasonable to think that his statement suggests suicide) than go back to DLP, which is an inherently tongue-in-cheek comment. And then the other poster said that they have the right to self-determinate, also said in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It's a joke on both ends, not a serious suggestion for someone to commit suicide.

It's quite difficult to judge them as a group, but the bad apples are /really/ bad and shouldn't be whitewashed /or forgotten/, no matter the user's identity or the age of the post. I think people should be careful, though, to avoid painting all of them with the same brush.

** I have no idea why the comment section here doesn't agree with you, because being irrationally hostile toward slash is a founding principle, but DLP prides itself in being what it is. They aren't going to change and a discussion about them would probably not benefit anyone.

They have an actual sub forum to shame other members.

Treat it like [[/r/watchpeopledie][r/watchpeopledie]], pretend it's not there and you will feel better about the world.

This Quote stems from the slash recommendation thread linked in the OP.

  Slash recommendations? Start with your wrists... (I keed, I keed, but what happened to this forum to allow this post to remain here all day without a single GTFO?)

*** People are probably disagreeing with the OP because of their history on this sub. As for being irrationally hostile towards slash, such fics have a reputation (however undue) of being disproportionately bad. Given that DLP is a predominantly Harry-centric forum, and that a large fraction of fics where Harry identifies as gay present him as an effeminate character, well... That's very far from Canon!Harry. Note that they hold almost as much contempt for Gary Stus.

**** And it's also because he's just complaining about getting a negative response there. If everyone did that, we'd never actually discuss fanfiction here.

And talking about DLP here seems to always start a pointless shitfest. It has a distinct culture, and not everyone here would fit into or like it (Not a bad thing! If everyone agreed, life would be boring), and somehow on Reddit that leads to chaos.

I've found stories written by DLP members that I didn't like. Tastes are /subjective./ This kind of attitude is what makes non-members look down on your clique.

** I think this quote from one of the members sums it up. I'd like to preface it by saying that in my opinion, being anti-slash does not mean you are homophobic. I can't stand to read slash, not because I have anything against gay people, but as a straight guy, if I can avoid reading about 2 or more men having sex or being intimate, I will.

"My point is, there has been (for quite some time) a shift in attitudes on DLP, from homophobic Ginny-hating Nazis to appraising fiction for the standard of its literature and not for its position on homosexuals or red-heads.

I'd like to think so anyway."

This was in response to an Administrator writing,

"This site was founded specifically to cater to people who hated slash. There are lines, and this thread crosses it by a lot. It was a huge decision to let slashers even be on DLP without hiding it [Typa was the first]. This isn't a precedent that needs to be set."

** Honestly, I think this all stems from how we define slash. To some, slash means fanwork involving a gay relationship. To others, it entails /poorly written/, distasteful stereotypes of gay relationships. The way I figure it, DLP generally defines it as the latter.

It'd be a shame to generalize such a diverse group of dedicated fans as homophobes. I've seen slash recommendation threads there that were met with good faith suggestions. And if some DLP users wanna avoid slash discussion as a rule, that's their choice and we should respect that.

** I'm not a fan of DLP by any means, but can we please stop bringing it up all the time? I cancelled my membership there after six days because I realised that I hated it - other people are still there after six years. Some of those people are on this subreddit, and they love DLP, so all threads like this do is promote arguments (not discussion, *arguments*, as in pointless bickering). They don't change anyone's minds about each other or slash fic or anything else, they just create resentment. If you don't like it there, do what I did: leave, and don't look back. Don't spread your bitterness over that group's...existence far and wide, because you can't change them and you can't destroy them.

Hate is a huge problem in the world today. Don't be part of the problem.
