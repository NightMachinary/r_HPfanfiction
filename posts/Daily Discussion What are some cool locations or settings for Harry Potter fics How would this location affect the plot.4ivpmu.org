And it doesn't have to be something like "America! or Germany!" it can be something like... Underwater with the mermaids. Not necessarily a different geographical location.


** The Catacombs of Paris, /a la/ As Above, So Below. There is an Anti-Disapparition Jinx that covers it and Inferi all over the place. The deeper you go the stranger it becomes, with space/perception altering curses and mutated creatures that would make Hagrid queasy.

*** I found that movie surprisingly good! I liked the symbolism and occultism in it very well done and how the narration is constructed (like in alchemy).

** The Bermuda Triangle would be interesting given the infamy of the place: anything that goes in never comes out, at least that how muggles see it. Maybe the Bermuda Triangle could be the location where Dementors originated from and why nothing has ever came out of Bermuda Triangle. What if muggles aboard the ships/planes that go though the Bermuda Triangle get their souls ripped out, then the Dementors simply vanish the entire boat/plane along with all the soulless bodies.

The Muggle World only thinks of the Bermuda Triangle as a place which is known for its reputation of things and people never leaving when they go in. In reality, the wizards know the truth that the Bermuda Triangle is the breeding ground of Dementors. It helps that the Bermuda Triangle is called the Bermuda *Triangle*, as in trinity, or three. Given how three and seven (mainly the latter) are the main numbers of magical significance in the series.

Just think of other places with mythical or historic significance that could be connected to magic. Bermuda Triangle is already explained. Area 51 is associated with government secrecy/conspiracy so maybe a magical place is hidden there. Stonehenge is self-explanatory given what the place is. The Nazi death camps could work if its written during the Grindelwald war as a muggle side-plot for the main thing that is Dumbledore vs Grindelwald. The Amazon Rainforest would be a great setting given how big it is and how many magical creatures it could hold... maybe Voldemort could have went to South America to learn about certain aspects of magic he couldn't elsewhere, since didn't Dumbledore say Voldemort travelled the world to learn many things. Maybe he learnt about the Regeneration Potion and the dark ritual (bone of the father, flesh of servant, and blood of an enemy) from GoF on one of his journeys across the world.

Antarctica as a whole peaks my curiosity given how, IIRC, it hasn't been really brought up in canon or on Pottermore. I wonder what magical secrets could be hidden there.

** I'd really like to see a story take place in the wilderness, like a survival situation. Maybe [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA/featured][Primitive Technologies]] but in younger magical form. There was one that was a WIP and I thought it was really good but the author stopped writing and took it down. Besides that one, and ignoring the fictional Forbidden Forest, as far as the UK goes it's very hard to find a proper wilderness. It's just too small of a place. The story I mentioned above had to manufacture a location. Sure the scenery in DH during their walkabout was very well photographed but even those locations are fairly close to civilization. I'd like to see a massive coniferous forest with actual threats like fast moving streams, wolves, bears, and winter.

Other than that, though its been done before, magical settlements in the oldest human regions such as the fertile regions near the Tiger, Euphrates, Nile, Yellow, and Indus rivers. The history of those regions could be created and explored and be very interesting if done right.

Unfortunately, just being in those areas does not create interesting conflict, and at the same time, creating such conflict through external forces inherently takes away from the experience of the setting.

** I personally would love to read one where Harry grows up in the alps. Just because I grew up there. If we'd go that way, Harry's difference could start with the fact that he speaks German first and foremost. He would expect to go to Durmstrang. He would know about Nurmengard instead of Azkaban...... a thousand things.

How would it affect the plot? Well... Any plot that would be set in Austria, Germany or Switzerland would be affected by the location, now wouldn't it?

** This is ridiculous and probably also garbage since I'm not funny or a good writer but I wanted to write it so whatever. It's also not really related to this but inspired by the idea of an unorthodox setting.

--------------

COLD OPEN - a dark bank vault, shadows in every corner. Loud banging sounds come from the ceiling, and a loud drunken man slurs insults to no one.

The grate in the ceiling swings open, and STERLING ARCHER, master spy, swings down like a spider with his NIGHT VISION GOGGLES and a BOTTLE OF CHEAP RUM. The lights flicker on, and Archer SCREAMS LIKE A BABY, tearing the goggles from his face. His comlink drops from his ear to the ground, and LANA KANE is heard laughing. The world fades from oversaturation into normalcy, revealing a RICHLY-STOCKED VAULT, with GOLD and JEWELS littering the floor and SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES set in the walls.

The KING COBRA in the corner swings around to hiss at the intrusion. The OTTER pauses in its industrious loading of the TERRIER'S POUCHES with huge gemstones, hands frozen in midair like a deer in headlights.

--------------

Cut to LANA KANE in her RIDICULOUS SPY VAN. Krieger's WEIRD GIRLFRIEND watches the monitors and giggles while LANA KANE goes back to ignoring the comlink to continue arguing into her phone.

LANA KANE: "Abbiejean is /three/, she couldn't possibly have - No, Mr. Whitehall, I don't think there's a pattern here! AJ is not some kind of international secret agent or something that could orchestrate-"

The COMLINK lights up.

STERLING ARCHER: "Uhh... Hello there! Don't mind me."

--------------

STERLING ARCHER turns his back on the animals and begins rifling through the SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES. He pulls out a key and starts trying to match it with random locks. Behind his back, the COBRA shakes its head in a confused way, then hisses at ARCHER.

ARCHER: "Okay, so, just so you know, that'd be a lot scarier if you had your eyes open. It doesn't matter anyways, you three can have all this if you..."

ARCHER trails off.

ARCHER: "What do animals even do with precious gemstones? Are you animal... hippies or something? Returning nature to the earth?" ARCHER chuckles, unaware his joke WAS NOT FUNNY.

The comlink on the floor crackles to life as LANA shouts into the phone. "Toddlers can't make things fly! Fucking public schools!"

ARCHER: "And by the way, Chewbacca, your little bandolier is /adorable/."
