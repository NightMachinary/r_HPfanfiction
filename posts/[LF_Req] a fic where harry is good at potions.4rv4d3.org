Is there any such fic? There's Runemaster, the Arithmancer, et cetera, but is there a fanfiction where harry is good at potions? Or someone else?


** From what I remember, he has a fairly cordial relationship with Snape in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness), so his potion making had to have been at least above-average.

You might also want to check out the next-best Slytherin!Harry series out there, in which it certainly is above-average by the 6th book: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection)

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** Azoth is an awesome Harry is good at potions fic. The potions "world building" is better than any other fic I've read. Harry works with snapes portrait to become a potions master iirc. Only thing is that it's DM/HP slash. You could probably skip those parts pretty easily though. Linkao3(1049966)

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
