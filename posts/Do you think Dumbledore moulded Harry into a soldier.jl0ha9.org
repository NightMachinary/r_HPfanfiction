** I think lamb for the slaughter is more correct. He never really trained him to fight properly and encouraged a few habits that soldiers would never be allowed to keep because it's dangerous for them and others on the battlefield

** Dumbledore groomed child soldiers for decades. Harry is on another level, but he recruited many, many people right after they leave school. Is it a conflict of interest for someone to recruit soldiers from their own students? (Yes)

Harry in particular appears to be raised by some child soldier handbook. Harry was "raised" in a loveless, abusive environment, then immediately rescued by Albus Dumbledore (and co.). Dumbledore spends the first year dropping hints for Harry to follow (the challenges and all the school-year incidents were designed for Harry to follow the trail), culminating in Harry killing a man at age eleven. Have a candy, Harry. No need for therapy. His entire rest of schooling reinforced the "I must fight because the adults won't" mentality (third year wins an award for sending children into an extremely dangerous situation to prevent an unlawful execution WHILE HE'S THE HEAD OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM). Children don't normally instantly and without any second thoughts commit suicide on command. Something is very, very wrong with Harry, and the blame comes down to the person in charge of raising him to obey any order without question.

Furthermore, Dumbledore is responsible for Harry being placed at the Dursleys to begin with. (Beyond the literal LEFT HIM ON THE DOORSTEP WITH A LETTER TELLING SOMEONE HER SISTER DIED. IS THERE NO DECENCY?) Sirius Black handed Harry to Hagrid and loaned him his motorcycle. Not exactly something someone does when they're trying to kill said baby. Dumbledore left Harry on a doorstep in November two days before Sirius was arrested. You don't arrange long-term care for a child when there are already arrangements in place unless you want to bypass them. Beyond that, Dumbledore kept Snape, a man with evidence he was in a terrorist group, out of prison well enough that nobody had a problem with him teaching in a school containing his targeted minorities. Yet he did nothing to get Sirius a trial, or even an interrogation. The Statute of Secrecy was implemented centuries after the Magna Carta, habeas corpus likely (can't say for sure in canon, but I'd give fairly good odds on it) was part of their judicial system. Furthermore, Dumbledore provided evidence as to Sirius' obvious guilt. After learning about his innocence, Dumbledore took no action to get Sirius a trial (even going so far as to allow his pet Death Eater/spy Snape to make the situation worse for a person he claims is an ally).

There's quite a bit more, but those are a decent selection. Dumbledore is only shown as a good guy because Rowling doesn't think trauma is real. Otherwise, the books are about the grooming of a child soldier, and it is way too easy to read between the lines to get this story.

*** The thing with Sirius is pretty terrible. Supposedly, they arrested a Death Eater spy in the Order and Dumbledore never tried to find what he could have told Voldemort and co.? (I don't remember if is canon or fanon that Sirius didn't get a trial, but interrogations are still a thing hopefully, right?)

Especially after what happened to the Longbottoms.

I don't even know if this is incompetence or negligence.

** I think it's debatable honestly. On one hand the stuff that Harry goes through definitely feels like it but, on the other hand how much was dumbledore doing it intentionally. There are a lot of events that we just don't know enough about to really know for instance what would have happened if Harry wasn't placed at the Dursley's it's possible that the government would get involved and since they're portrayed at corrupt and incompetent rather often I doubt it would have gone well. That's just one possibility for you me event in the story and there are a lot of them. Personally I like to think of him as an old man trying his best in a lot of situations with no real right answers but we just don't know enough.

Note that if you say all the events in the story were planed by him I would say he did mold him that way. I just think that we cannot really tell if it was intentional or not.

*** To tack onto this, it is also important to remember that the HP books began as children's books and evolved into YA books. In order for Harry to be the hero of the story the adults can't solve the mystery/problem. Much of the events of canon seem very sinister if you try to apply real world logic and consequences to it.

** Yes, I think he did.

But I don't think he did it happily. I think he did it because he saw Harry as the last hope for the Wizarding World (and all the world, really, because Voldemort would eventually attack and kill muggle), and did what he thought has to be done.

I don't think he slept well at night doing it. To me, deep down, Dumbledore is a good guy, who had to do some horrible things to stop a monster.

He sacrificied Harry, for the good of everyone else. The way it is written, and with the prophecy, I don't think there were other choices. Or at least, that he found other solutions.

However, I think he did tried to avoid it, at some point. The horcruxes, it seems that he tried to do it on his own, until the cursed one happened, and he'd know he would die within a year.

** As a soldier, no. Does Harry have to deal with dangerous situations yearly? Yes. Does he have to fight to defend himself and those he cares for? Yes he does. But that's not the same thing as being or becoming a soldier. Becoming a Soldier involves a sense of discipline and drill that Harry distinctly does not learn, as well as a capability of doing your job as a cog in a larger machine. We also learn how to kill. By that I mean we practice killing as that is our job. I fired hundreds of rounds at silhouettes down range when I went to training, and while you could say the death eater targets in the Room of Requirement were similar, never did the DA learn and practice killing, or how to operate as a unit. They learned how to survive and escape.

Harry learns how to think on his feet and how to survive which is important and likely has it's own mental health impacts. But it's a different beast from soldiering.

** Dumbledore maliciously moulded Harry into a /sacrifice/ in the hopes that if he willingly martyred himself without knowing that he there's a chance he /might/ survive or if there's another way, everyone else might be protected. His asinine "plan" depended upon Harry being broken enough that he'd simply believe Dumbledore's word, through Snape of all people, but not broken enough that he'd simply give up.

After all that, the morons still say that he felt sorry about it and he doesn't believe in the "greater good". As if his feelings matter a whit. As if his actions can be /reasonably/ looked at in any other way.

** I do not think Dumbledore either tried to mould Harry into a soldier. I will not say that he never manipulated him (hard to say so when the whole plot of DH is Dumbledore's pulling the strings from the afterlife), but I believe that his main objective was always to protect Harry.

Dumbledore never forced Harry to join the war, but he did his best to give him the means to survive it.
