  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** This would actually be a cool fic. I love reading manipulative dumbledore, because there is just too much in canon that points to him being exactly that, manipulative. But this would be a cool sort of redemption fic for him in my eyes

**** I saved your comment to read it later because I'm about to leave and be driving, but do you have any where dumbledore is manipulative, but in Harry's favor? Like where dumbledore is manipulative, but everything he does is actually for Harry's bennifit, not to his detriment? Also interested in fics where dumbledore actually teaches harry how to fight instead of leaving him as a lamb for slaughter

***** Albus and Harry's World Trip;

Magicks of the Arcane;

A Beautiful Lie;

Sorry idk how to link but all of them have at least elements of Mentor!Dumbledore. They are all also generally good fics, so that helps too.

This one has something of the sort but it involves time-travel. Present-day Dumbledore is manipulative though, and past Dumbledore is good and they butt heads towards the end.

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.
