I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22706563/chapters/54267871][Can I tell you something?]] and now I want that kind of vibe. You laugh (kind of) and then you cry (almost) all while maybe shaking because of the bad memories brought up to the surface in somehow the best way possible. Preferably angst but not angst, just dark. I'm down with self harm and other triggering things. I prefer slash but I'm down with most ships (not Dramione or H/Hr though please) and gen works too. Any generation is cool.

Give me recommendations. Thank you.


** I'd definitely recommend GallaPlacidia's other fics, especially linkao3('Dad says'; Lessons in Grace and Decorum; Cassiopeia Lily Malfoy) for that laugh and cry and want to die factor.

I'd also recommend linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl) for some angst and H/C but do mind the TW.

  Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there.

  In Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy gives Draco lessons in how to manipulate people into loving him. When Draco is released on the condition that he is bonded to Harry as his prisoner, he finally has a chance to put his newfound skills into practice. Forced bonding, eighth year (eventually), a Draco driven slightly mad by grief, a furious, self-destructive Harry, a whole lot of angst and a proportionate amount of comfort.Inspired by an excellent story called Unexpected Consequences by Lauren3210.

#+begin_quote
  In eighth year, Harry had a toxic fling with Draco Malfoy. Ten years later, a little girl shows up, begging for Harry's help. Could the two be connected? And did Harry misunderstand what Draco was trying to tell him, the last time they spoke?Feat. angry 8th year Harry being truly horrible to Draco, Draco writing a lot of letters he never sends Harry, and the most Gryffindor-Slytherin hybrid ten-year-old you've ever seen.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)

  For a moment, she's almost giddy. Because Draco Malfoy's been ruined by this war and he's as out of place as she is and --- yes, he has scars too. He's got an even bigger one. She wonders whether one day they'll compare sizes.
