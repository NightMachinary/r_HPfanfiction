I've got a prompt that I'd like to share, but while it is a HP crossover, it takes place in the other setting (the Nasuverse, specifically Fate/Zero). Is that okay to post here?

If it isn't (or even if it is), could somebody recommend a good sub to drop a Nasuverse prompt/challenge? While I'm at it, any good subs for "A Song of Ice and Fire" fanfics (got about one-and-a-half prompts to toss on that front, crossovers with non-HP settings).


** Just go ahead. Worst case scenario is that it gets deleted or downvoted.

I'm also curious as to what you have in mind.
