** "Don't wake him, Hermione," Harry whispered, sitting up gently. "Are you trying to get me set on fire?"

"No, but-" Hermione looked down at the creature with wide eyes. "Why?"

"Hagrid asked me to look after him." Harry yawned and reached for his glasses. "I figured after Norbert, well, I could handle it."

"It's a dragon, Harry!" Hermione bit out. "Not a Labrador. It could burn your dorm to ash with a sneeze. And why couldn't Hagrid take care of it? You're not the Gamekeeper. This isn't your responsibility!"

As though she'd been summoning a demon, the tiny dragon twitched, letting out a sneeze of fire that set Ron's bed curtains aflame. Harry grabbed his wand and sent a few water charms at the blaze, putting it out as the tiny dragon peacefully slept on.

"What the bloody hell?" Ron sat up, looking around in shock. "Hermione? What're you doing in here? Harry, is that a dragon?"

"Go back to sleep," Harry said, waving his hands. "It's just a dream."

"Oh, okay," Ron said, rolling over onto his side.

"Professor McGonagall will hear about this," Hermione said, reminding Harry of a younger Malfoy.

"Tell me what she says," Harry replied, leaning back on his pillows. "Night, Hermione!"

** Harry opened his eyes, blearily. Last night was a blur - he remembered going to Hogsmeade, for a night of celebration that it was all finally over. Voldemort had been defeated - for good this time.

Slowly, more memories started to trickle in. He'd got into a drinking contest with Fred and George, something about their joke shop expanding into alcohol. After that, it remained a mystery - though he remembered something about a Felix Felicis based cocktail.

It took quite a while for him to register exactly what Hermione had said, and it took the remainder of his willpower to not panic. There, indeed, was a baby dragon curled up at his feet. He was in the Gryffindor Common Room, thankfully clothed and with no strange females anywhere in sight, but with a baby Norwegian Ridgeback curled up at his feet.

"H'rmione? Wha... Wha'happened last night?"

Hermione paused. Harry was clearly hung over, slurring his words and looking a mess.

"Well, I remember you getting into a drinking contest, and then going on a walk through Hogsmeade. I think at some point you hugged Ginny and serenaded her-"

Harry woke up even more at that. While at this point everyone knew Harry and Ginny were a couple, it would have still been extremely embarrassing.

"Merlin. Please tell me it wasn't that Weird Sisters song, at least..."

Hermione confirmed that, in fact, it wasn't - it was instead a song by Frank Sinatra. Harry didn't know which was worse, as sober-him knew /exactly/ how ill-suited his voice was for that - but at least the lyrics would have been classy.

"Well, could have been worse. Anyway, how'd I get a baby dragon?"

"That would be where I tell the story" said a new voice. The aforementioned Ginny Weasley. Harry blushed, stammering an apology, but Ginny waved him off. "Don't worry about the song, Harry. It was actually kind of sweet - nice to know you're still a loyal boyfriend even when you're ratted. Didn't even blink at Romilda and Cho Chang flirting with you, just headed straight to me."

Harry blushed even harder, but motioned to her to continue.

"Well, after the serenade, I realized you were obviously plastered - and given the kind of mood you were in, I thought it'd be best to keep an eye on you."

Ginny paused to sit down next to him. The baby dragon, miraculously, didn't respond - it was still fast asleep. Hermione took that moment to leave, making good on her promise to go get a professor - Ginny knew more than she did, in this one instance.

"So, you serenaded me, then tried to snog - emphasis, tried. It was by far not your best work, and I will have fun getting you to do better." Another stammer from Harry was her reward, he was pretty easy to tease in this state.

"After that attempt at snogging, we went off - I steered you away from the Hog's Head, but you managed to find a little pub that I'm sure wasn't even there the day before. I could stop you from buying more drinks, but you did end up playing poker with this bloke from the dragon reserve - did you know Norberta had her first clutch of eggs?"

Harry nodded, absorbing the information as best he could.

"Well, when you realized he was betting a dragon egg, you Stunned him and called the Aurors, but you refused to let the egg go cold so you put it in the fireplace, right there in the pub..."

"And well, it was a lot closer to hatching than it probably should have been. Next thing we knew, there was a Norwegian Ridgeback sitting in the fire."

So that was the full story, Harry mused. At that moment, Professor McGonagall came in, Charlie Weasley in tow - a panting Hermione Granger behind them.

"Well, Mr. Potter. I daresay even your father could not have topped this one - a dragon? In all my years..."

"What confuses me is how docile it's being. From what I remember of Norbert, baby dragons aren't normally this content to just... Sleep, when people are near them." Harry mentioned.

"Well, I think I have an explanation there. Did you, at any point, shoot fire at it from your wand?" Charlie Weasley supplied.

Harry frowned. He couldn't rightly remember doing that, but it sounded like something he would do.

"He did." Ginny supplied. "Said it looked cold, so he'd better warm it up - then cast a fire-lighting charm at it. Got us kicked out of the pub. The dragon kind of followed him around after that."

Charlie suppressed a snicker. "Well, congratulations, I guess. You are now the proud mother of a Norwegian Ridgeback - they imprint on the first thing to shoot fire at them. Professor, sadly I can't actually take this one - unlike Norberta, this dragon actually has someone to call mommy, and they don't like being separated so if I take this one to the reserve it'll destroy everything. All I can do is submit Harry's name for qualification, so at least the Ministry won't have to be on his case - dragons are illegal without a license..."

McGonagall frowned. "Well, Mr. Potter. You heard it, she- or he, is now your responsibility. It's lucky for you that I cannot actually assign a detention, expulsion, or even take points off - of all the dangerous creatures, it just had to be the one that is explicitly 'its own punishment' where the school rules are concerned..."

With that, she walked away, leaving Harry to wonder what exactly he was going to do about this - he supposed he'd have to actually raise a dragon. At least he wouldn't be alone in it - he could make Hagrid's dream come true if he asked the half-giant to help him out.

Harry supposed it could be worse - he could have been arrested. Or worse, expelled.

--------------

This was exactly the sort of nonsense I needed to be proceeding with at this moment, so thank you.

I'm not a fan of Harry/Hermione, personally (it feels like shipping siblings together), so while the prompt mildly suggests that ship, I elected to go in a Harry/Ginny direction. Also, Fred gets to live because a practically-offscreen death is not how we treat important characters (you may also assume this about Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and a few others).

** ‘Don't move.'

The words floated in Harry's subconscious as if suspended in honey. It took him a few moments to overcome the inertia of his grogginess and process what Hermione had said.

A dragon.

A dragon?

/A dragon./

Aha. This was it then. He cracked one eyelid and gazed down toward his feet -- swelteringly hot despite the fresh morning air.

Sure enough, the dragon was there. As advertised. As /planned./ Harry gave a lazy, languid stretch and shuffled up into a sitting position. He brushed a stray leaf out of his hair. Nothing like a little end-of-year camping out in the castle grounds to unwind before the term ended and make the most of the balmy weather.

Hermione's footfalls faded quickly. Harry counted to twenty, then stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled. A great, rustling sound came from the bushes to his right, and out popped the bearded face of Rubeus Hagrid. The rest of his body followed soon after.

‘I don't know about this, Harry...' he mumbled.

Harry just flashed his best winning smile and tapped his watch. Time was of the essence.

Five minutes, two stubbed toes and thirty-seven bad words later, they were set. Harry scurried into the foliage with Hagrid and found a suitable vantage point, peeking back out at the clearing he had recently vacated with a gleeful grin across his face.

They didn't have long to wait.

Hermione's voice reached them first.

‘Harry, nobody was awake! But I banged on Professor McGonagall's door until she stirred. She threatened to turn me into a turkey, but she's coming! Just hold on, she'll be here-- /aaaahhh!/'

Hermione had entered the clearing. Harry felt that his face might actually split in two, he was grinning so hard.

Where the small, juvenile Welsh Green /had/ been sitting when Hermione left, there was now a slightly larger dragon. Same colouration, same markings, only about two feet longer and much, /much/ fatter. Hagrid called him Porky.

‘/Harry!'/

Hermione's wail roused every bird within about a three mile radius. She collapsed to the ground, pulling at her hair. Her face was a mask of agony. Harry had a slight inclination that he just /might/ have gone a little far, here.

Porky, true to his name, simply cracked one eyelid and grunted, not fussed in the least.

‘How /could/ you?!'

Harry wasn't sure if this was addressed at himself, or the dragon. He and Hagrid had messed up his bedroll good and proper. A splash of fake blood and a ripped sleeve of his pyjamas. It just might have been his finest work.

‘You can't, Harry. You can't leave me.'

There was real grief now. An uncomfortable twisting sensation squirmed in Harry's gut. Behind him, Hagrid shifted his weight awkwardly.

‘Not after all we've been through. Everything that still lay ahead of us. I was... I'd been thinking. It was time for /us,/ Harry. Together. Truth is, it's /all/ I've been thinking about, lately. I'm almost positive I failed an O.W.L or two. And now...'

The wailing started again. /Oh, shit./

From behind, Hagrid gave Harry a firm nudge. Harry tried to shake his head. Hagrid tossed him bodily into the clearing.

‘/Aiii!/ What are you--? /Harry?'/

Harry swallowed audibly. ‘Surprise.'

Hermione's eyes darted from him, to his torn-up bedroll, to the fat dragon squatting on his pillow, and back. It didn't take Hermione Granger long to figure things out, and today was no exception.

‘Harry Potter, you little--'

/‘Oof!'/

Balled fist met solar plexus. On the list of all the things that she was good at, why did throwing punches have to be on it?

He doubled over, slowly sinking to the ground as Hermione elaborated in great detail as to the error of his ways.

She climbed atop him to further his education. A few finger jabs in the chest drove home points he barely comprehended. Little existed beyond the sudden, cavernous shortness of breath.

A bubble of coherent thought rose to the surface. He thought on Hermione's earlier words. A moment of daring followed shortly after. He snatched another finger jab from mid-air, leaned suddenly forwards, and kissed her.

And all his pains melted away.

** "Wha...?"

Harry blinked blurrily up at her, his brain still slow and fogged from sleep; the best one he's had in while. As his vision clears he notices the following: Ron is standing next to his bed, face pale and eyes wide and staring at something down by his feet; the baby dragon, just hatched it seems, curled around his feet, marron scales shimmering gold with youth; and Hermione's wide eyes, standing by the door, Professor Snowbell's forearm clutched firmly in Hermione's frightened grasp.

"Oh."

He looked down again and slowly draws his knees up to his chest, disturbing the sheets. The Firehorn whimpers and shifts. He pauses. The dragon curls into itself and settles. Harry moves again, this time not pausing until he has his knees firmly to his chest, his arms wrapped around himself.

"He's actually kinda cute, isn't he?"

Hermione blanches, although Snowbell--who had approached his bed but didn't dare get too close--looks like she's contemplating his words, then nods a knowing smile dancing on her thin lips.

"You, Mr. Potter, are one of the lucky few to experience a South-African Firehorn mate."

He chokes, shooting her a startled look. "/Mate?"/

Snowbell laughs, apparently having gotten this response quite a lot. He can't imagine why.

"Not in the way you must think. Much like Ashwinders, Firehorns are born from the remains of magical fires left to burn unchecked. Unlike Ashwinders, however, Firehorns are not wild nor free-spirited by any means. When they are quite young--this one seems to be not more than a fortnight born--they find a witch or wizard with unquestioning loyalty and a bounty amount of magical power and mate for life. You become their...well, there isn't really a word for it. Owner or master would be closest, I suppose, but not quite the dynamic. Partnership, maybe. You are theirs and they are yours. Quite remarkable, isn't it? No one has seen a true one for almost two centuries."

"Why?" Hermione's eyes are bright with curiosity and she has that look she gets when there's something interested to be learned.

"Because they die." The words were factual, yet remorseful. As if Snowbell felt this on a personal level. "When there isn't a powerful enough witchard near at the time of their birth and they are left unmated for any longer than one month, they die."

"Oh."

"Well we ought to let you get back to sleep, no? Big day tomorrow. I remember my own graduation..." Her voice trails off as she leaves with Hermione, presumably waxing about the grandiose occasion her own graduation had been.

He smiles back down at the dragon and lets his feet down. He allows the Firehorn--he thinks he'll name it Mushu--to crawl up his bed and settle in his arm. He closes his eyes, but doesn't miss the glance Ron throws him as his friend settles back into his own bed.

** "Harry, I don't know how it got there, but there's a baby dragon curled up on your feet. Don't move."

Harry opened one eye. "I knew about the dragon, Hermione. Why are YOU in my bed exactly?" He croaked and shifted to look at her sleepily.

Hermione's face instantly transformed from surprised and worried to red-cheeked and avoiding his gaze. "I... ah, you see... I... we... oh bother."

"I'm not complaining, Hermione. Well, now that I've woken up with you, I suppose I am complaining it won't be every day. So why exactly?"

Hermione's eyes widened and she tentatively looked at him. "I..." She sighed. "I was imagining what it would be like if you were my boyfriend. I'm sorry, Harry, I'll go." She tried to roll off him, but he kept her where she was by holding her thigh in place.

"So don't imagine." He said, looking back into her eyes.

Hermione's cheeks reddened even further, and she took several deep breaths. "Harry, will you... be my boyfriend?"

"About time, Hermione. Of course I will. As if there could be anyone for me but you. And Olive, of course. Isn't that right, baby?" Harry lifted the covers and hissed at his feet.

The dragon started to purr.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
