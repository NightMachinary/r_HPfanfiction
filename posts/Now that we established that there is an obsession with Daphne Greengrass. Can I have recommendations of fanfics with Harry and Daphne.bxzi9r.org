  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

** It's not really a /pairing/ in the first book, and unfortunately the sequel is incomplete (last updated 2017), but linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) has a lot of Harry/Daphne interaction and is a great read if you like good-but-dark Hermione. Forget setting Snape's robe on fire, Valeria responded to bullying by putting a Body-Bind on Draco, dousing him in deliberately misbrewed potion, and walking away. Threatened miscarriage of justice? The Minister gets bitten by one of her zombie rats bearing manticore venom, then after he falls unconscious, she force feeds him /unicorn blood,/ healing him but irreversibly cursing him.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Linkffn(A Subtle Approach) - I've recommended a good Harry Daphne after every chapter.

This is like a guide now-

First you need to fall in love with the pairing, so read anything by James Spookie-

linkffn( Things we do for love)

Then you need to explore the cliche's-

Linkffn(Paid in blood) Linkffn(Honour thy blood)

Then comes the quality fics-

Linkffn(Marriage contracts redux)

Once you're done with these, ping me for more.

*** Okay so am I alone in finding James Spookie's stuff perfectly readable but not particularly.. good? Like he's a competent enough writer, but the way he writes doesn't convey much emotion. That makes his characters seem a bit on the flat side.

Am I making sense? I /know/ something about his fics bother me but I've never been able to really figure it out it exactly.
