The Story: linkffn(Pawns and Lords)

I started writing my first fic about two months ago, but I find that as the story goes on it is getting a little difficult to keep track of the smaller details. So I'm looking for somebody to bounce ideas off of and someone who is willing to read over what I got have and to check for plot holes. If you're interested please PM me either here, or on fanfiction. Thanks.
