** Every post on this particular subreddit is required to have a flair, but I think "Discussion" is probably the more appropriate flair for this topic, unless you mean for us to write stories about our favorite authors resuming writing.

*** Wait it did? That was my 3rd fanfic, ever, after HPMOR and Backward with Purpose. I liked it, and was disappointed that it stopped being worked on.

Looks like it hasn't seen anything since early April though. Oh well.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Annabel has a bad day, and she tries to deal with it as best she can.The last thing she needs is to meet someone else who has hurt her, someone who she hasn't seen in many years. Or is it?Do people really change. Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up?

** When your favorite author starts writing again after 3 years what? Potato?

I kid. I wish JacobApples would finish his current lot. Seems he went legit though and is likely never to happen now.

Seems to be the only person out there who writes HP/AT. Really wanted to see the one finished where Harry and Andy get transported back already married with like 4 kids. He also has a nice one with HP/NB (Not Malfoy in this one)

Guess I'll just keep reading What We Lost repeatedly.

** While I'm not sure if I have a "favorite author", I always get happy seeing (previously) abandoned fic I liked being continued upon out of nowhere. Funnily enough, one time it actually happened right as I was in the middle of re-reading a long-dead fic (which had stopped updating before I even joined the HP fanfic community), which was kind of funny.

Apropos to the topic, books 1 and 2 have final post dates of 2013, but that could be just when it was ported to AO3 and may not indicate how long it's been on hiatus.
