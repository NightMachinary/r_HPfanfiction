I get that the people born in the timeframe would be afraid to say his name, but everyone else wouldn't be because they never met him face to face. (Until it happens). Bonus if Pureblood and Half-Blood kids start to call him Voldemort as well, though not mandatory.

Can be a minor or major thing.

Not looking for pairings, but am fine with het/slash/femslash.

NO Ron Weasley Bashing.

Can be on ANY site.

Anyone can be the main character.

No Harem or Lord Harry.

People can be smarter or more powerful than in canon, but make it believable.

Horcruxes can be a thing or not, I don't care either way.


** *Oh God Not Again!* linkffn(4536005) Crack Fic Humor Fest Time Travel

After Professor Bins was /mysteriously/ exorcised, Sirius Black takes over as the Professor for History of Magic. Besides the classroom /mysteriously/ being cursed to change the gender, color, and other random effects of people who sleep in class- Sirius instituted a policy of 500 house points to anyone who said "Voldemort".

â€‹

Does this count? This is more of a "training" to get people out of saying You-Know-Who though.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

**** It's a big part of third year. It pretty much effects all of Hogwarts when Harry is there, nobody calls him YKW after that year.
