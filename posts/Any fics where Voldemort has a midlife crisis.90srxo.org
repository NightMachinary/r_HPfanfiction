** Not a fic, but something I wrote a while ago fits...

Happy Birthday to me!\\
Happy Birthday to me!\\
Happy Birthday Lord Voldemort...\\
Mommy, why'd you leave me?

All my followers knew:\\
Those disloyal---I slew.\\
After /one/ bit of bad luck,\\
They were suddenly few.

How old am I now?\\
How old am I now?\\
Do my shadow years count?\\
I'll count them... somehow.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** In a crossover with Bewitched, Harry gives Voldemort a new body, not telling him that the body would be stuck in teenage form forever. He would permanently go through puberty.

So.. most plans of Voldemort have got to do with girls doing jumping jacks or wearing tight stuff.
