kinda just rambling but I hope it sparks discussion

1 gellert grindelwald being used more. Even before the fantastic beast series i always thought grindelwald would be a much more interesting character than Voldemort & now after seeing both films that's even more true imo. grindelwald is the equal to Dumbledore he's way more charismatic he's a seer & doesn't seem to screw around and actually acts like a knowledgeable dark lord and we get to see actual powerful spells. protego diabolica the tempest jinx the electrocution spell on newt. he seems much more moderate in his beliefs so would be a perfect leader for the typical grey faction /harry stories

I would love to see a dark harry story we're Grindelwald breaks out takes harry and trains him . so a 3 way war between Grindelwald Dumbledore and voldemort

1. opinion and yes I know plot but its still annoying\\

Voldemort is pathetic as a villan. if he's a 70 year old master of dark magic thier should be no way a 14 year old wizard should pose any threat. if Voldemort is so powerful we should have seen. more spells like fiendfyre or him using inferni or i don't know the flesh rotting curse on the ring in spell form show us why people we're terrified of him

3 more areas of magic that are barely in canon

I would love to see a great alchemy fic. or expand divination or astrology what about a good fic on the subjects in the department of mystery. eg time death prophecy. I know thiers a few good rune fics

4 fics on different characters or interesting time periods or places mentioned in the books

a fic about Bill Weasley being a curse breaker could be awesome. or focusing on Hagrids childhood. or hags culture (they're mentioned briefly in the books)

or idk. the ancient Egyptians hell you could do a unique take on the story of Moses in the hp universe .

a story with harry or oc which or wizard in ancient Greece or Rome the Salem whtch trials. the Golden age of pirates the Renaissance the crusades the American or French revolution the cold war . any time period of history could make an awesome story in the hp universe !

5.i think alot of people on here and elsewhere seem to forget that alot fanfiction authors do it as a hobby , are young (at least to my knowledge) and are not professional writers when giving criticism or complaining about stories .it seems people are expecting waaay to much from what I've seen lurking on here.

6 from what I understand some wizards are just naturally better with magic & or more powerful. Voldemort Dumbledore grindelwald merlin the founders ect. magical cores aren't the BEST way to explain this gap but its seems to be ok why do sooooo many ppl hate it

i hope this sparks a decent discussion!


** Magical cores are pure fanon that people usually use to make Hadrian Potter Black Dumbledore Prewett an unstoppable god.

I'll admit that I am one of these haters. This is because, in my opinion, "Magical Cores" are a terrible way to explain the talents of some characters, which doesn't fit (at all), with the Magical System created by Rowling, or her magical society. If I just had to take some examples among the more used in fanon :

- If a wizard "Magical Core" is observable at birth, then why are some children traumatized in an attempt to "force the magic out of them" (like Neville)?
- If "Magical Cores" are comparable to a mana pool (with a larger magical core giving more magic), when why did nobody in canon ever "ran out of magic" even in the worst situations? And why are some wizards using their magical reserve so trivially (Working on a spell for hours, Apparating around for fun . . .)?
- If the "Magical Core" of an individual was obervable, then why did the old PureBlood families never tried to put in place an eugenics program? To marry with people having large magical cores in order to have "stronger" children with time?

In the end, I hate "magical cores" because it's not only a cheap way to make the MC (usually Harry) extremely powerful without "earning" that power, but it erase any chance for a character to ever progress.\\
In Canon, Magic is an intelectual activity, similar to mathematics. 1st year student are learning the magical equivalent of "Additions" (or maybe multiplications), while NEWT level students are learning difficult equations. In such a world, Talent is important of course (a normal student could take 1 hour to learn a new concept, while Dumbledore could learn it in 10 minute), but it's also possible for someone to better himself why working hard. But if Magic is dependant of magical cores, then effort are useless because, no matter how hard someone is working, his spells will still be weaker than Harry and his "amazing magical core larger than anyone seen before", and this is an idea that I hate.

*** Honest question: how does Harry, a thirteen year old student that isn't particularly brainy, casting a stronger patronus spell than any adult ever has fit with your theory about "everyone is equal, it's just about hard work and studying"? Did no auror ever decide to spend a few months training with the patronus spell?

Why would magical ability be so egalitarian when nothing in real life is? Sure, everyone can study math, but some people's brains don't work in ways conducive to learning it easily, while others are able to grasp difficult concepts with minimal instruction. I'm not sure how 'talent' is all that different from 'born stronger/better', in which case we might as well be back to magical cores.

I agree with the rest of your post, but i hate the idea of magic being this limitless thing that everyone can use infinitely.

**** I may have failed to explain my opinion. I do not think that each Wizards are equal in ability (we clearly see it's not the case in Canon), but I think that the "Limit" of a wizard (determined by his talent) is more of a "Soft Lock", rather than a "Hard Lock". Of course not anyone can reach the level of a genius like Dumbledore, but it is always possible for a wizard to better himself. He can learn more difficult spells, work on his Charms to make them a little stronger, or Transfiguration a little smoother. His talent only determining "how fast" he is progressing. What I hate with Hard Lock with Magical Cores is that no amount of effort will help, if the reason why you can't use a spell is "Not enough mana".

Concerning the Patronus of Harry, was it truly "stronger than adult"? I know that people like Mrs Bones were impressed that he was able to cast a "corporal Patronus" when he was barely 13, but I don't remember anything about his Patronus being stronger than any other Corporal one.\\
Also, in PoA, Canon tries to sell the Patronus as some kind of very advanced spell that is too difficult to Children, and yet Harry has no trouble teaching it to the DA class in OotP, including "children" like the 2nd year Denis Creevey (though I don't think he was mentioned in the Patronus scene), and the 4th year Luna Lovegood (who definitively learnt to do a Corporal one).\\
In my opinion, the Patronus is not an advanced spell because it is really a difficult one, but rather because it's a spell that is usually only learnt by adult. If you forget its use as a mean of communication (which according to Wiki, was invented by Dumbledore and reserved for the Order), the Patronus is only usefull as a mean of protection against Dementors and Lethifold. So it makes sense that only people planing to confront this creatures will learn the spell, either during their NEWT level Defense clase or post Hogwarts. Patronus seem to also be pretty similar to the Dark Art, since its also focus on an emotions to be cast (though it's happiness rather than anger or hate), so I guess it will be easier for an happy child to learn the spell rather than a sad one.

***** Umbridge can also cast a corporal Patronus, so either she's much better at DADA than everyone thinks, or it's not actually that hard.

** If you want one about cool elements of magic, I recommend linkffn(the arithmancer) --- obvi about arithmancy but delves into alchemy quite a bit and also has some cool Bill cursebreaker stuff.

** The Salem Witch Trials I don't think would work because I think that it's like the red scare, no actual witches or wizards were harmed, only muggles whose stuff was coveted.
