**** I don't have an account, so I can't be sure that there isn't another search page available, but I too can't find it. I was poking around their search php and boy is their setup absolute garbage. Every single page is run off index.php instead of a sub page. And their search function has only one visible option yet takes anything from 1-68, and seems at least to me to give different results with each one. Without seeing the server side page, I couldn't tell you which number sorts by word count, if any at all, but you can try it yourself with this link, just change the last variable:

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=1][http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&*sortby=1*]]

edit: lol I figured it out now:

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=wordcount]]

I'm an idiot for not trying variations of that first.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=wordcount&status3=1][for completed fics add &status3=1]] and [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=wordcount&status3=1&ship1=1][for completed HHR fics add &ship1=1]]

** I'm going to to downvote hell for this, but... linkffn(6439871) - A Different Halloween by robst.

Yes, it's robst, so there's no tension in the story, but he gets this one done before it gets boring. It's long enough (125k words), it's H/Hr, it's complete, and everyone needs to read ONE robst story so they don't have to read all the others.
