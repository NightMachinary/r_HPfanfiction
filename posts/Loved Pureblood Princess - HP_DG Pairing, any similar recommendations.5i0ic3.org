So, the story I'm referencing : linkffn(6943436) I hope that works, it's the first time i'm using the bot.

In general, I really liked this because it was a slow growing flame of a romance, well granted it's the whole development of the "icy" persona from Daphne Greengrass and that we got it from her perspective, but I enjoyed reading the development of the relationship from her perspective as well as increasing number of clues that this relationship is actually going to be a thing.

I guess the biggest thing I enjoyed were the final two chapters, the Post-Hogwarts chapters of a relationships between these two characters I just found endearing and I reread those two chapters maybe 2-3 times within an hour.

I can't remember the HP/GW fanfic, but there was one similar where it was post-Hogwarts and Ginny had died and Harry had "moved" on taking care of his children that he had from Ginny, and I think that at the very end, it was some crazy thing that Ginny was apparently reincarnated or that her soul had transferred to a muggle woman's body and Harry had recognized her. But if anyone also remembers that, I'd love to read that again, the details are a little flimsy and I realize that's not too much to go off of as well.


** Funnily enough, while I really liked the fic I hated the ending of Pureblood Princess. Puts me off re-reading it every time.

**** Well different strokes for everyone, I mainly read fanfic in phases and I'm not scrutinizing them for representative events and what not. I read for the mindless sake of reading it. But any HP/DG recommendations that you did like then?

***** It's always been hit or miss for me, because Daphne is such a blank slate.

Having said that, I've been reading linkffn(10025439) the last few days. It's not too serious, but not too lighthearted either. YMMV, but I enjoyed it.

*** Oh I hated it too at the start, don't get me wrong. I was frustrated that I just went to bed that night, but when I got the chance to read through it the day after, I ended up liking it more and accepted it. Beats the traditional happily ever after, despite so many unanswered questions.

** I went through a H/DG phase for a bit and there is really only one fic that I still follow from then, though there are a few that I might revisit. I'm willing to read more if they are good but I don't search for them. But anyway, if you are looking for a slow developing romance between Harry and Daphne, might like The Legacy linkffn(9774121)

It hasn't been updated in a little while (June was the last time, I think), but it is over 700k words long and I have hope that it will be finished eventually. I understand why some people might not like it (it goes a little overboard early on with magical theory, for one), but its one of my favorites.

*** For sure!

I appreciate the reommendation, do you have any otherrecommendations on "OK-ish" and completed recommendations? I went through a big Harry/Ginny phase so I wanted to read a romance not revolving on those two. Regardless if it's a bad ending or not, I just need the closure from a completed story I suppose.

** My favorite HP/DG story is Partners: linkffn(5012016), I have only read it once, but that is because the ending hit me hard in the feels.

The start is a little fast (in the romance department) but it is good over all.

  Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG
