The entire Harry Potter novels always deal on the actual fight between Death Eaters who hate Muggleborns and people of muggle heritage and those who don't . There are no reasons given as to the actual cause of hate. Like for what reason exactly did certain Purebloods dislke Muggleborns? . There are some theories out there that it deals with the actual inheritance of magic. I remember even in canon or was it afterwards there is a Daily Prophet article which accuses muggleborns of stealing magic. What do you think might be the exact reason?


** I really don't think it's a plot hole. It's shown in canon to be stupid because racism in real life is stupid.

Why is anyone bigoted against anyone else? Fear of the different. If you're at the top of society, you don't want to lose your place. You make up plenty of petty reasons as to why you're superior and dress them up so they're more palatable to others.

Why do the blood purists hate the muggleborns? Power. They're afraid of losing it. I'd imagine that fear gets worse as muggle society starts to outpace them. And they'll use stupid excuses like muggleborns diluting their blood (i.e. weakening their magic, which there's no evidence for in canon whatsoever as that's eugenics- that thing the Nazis were so fond of).

It's meant to be a direct parallel to real world racism. Why did slavers not want their slaves to be able to read? Education is powerful. Give them too much and they just might rise up against you. Why don't purebloods want muggleborns attending Hogwarts? Give them too much knowledge and they might take over the government, and after many, many generations their descendants won't be at the top of the social ladder anymore.

There has to be no explicit reasoning for it in canon because it's just racism, plain and simple. There is no need to justify it. Ever.

*** That's really a narrow opinion. I like immigrants and feel that every country should welcome them but if an immigrant that only lived in my country for a few months/years told me how I should act in my own country I would be very pissed at him. It's the same in Harry Potter, purebloods lived in the magical world for a long time and some muggleborns think that they know better. Like Hermione who only after four years decided that all elves should be freed and that wizards are barbaric.

**** Having house elves isn't some grand cultural tradition; it's slavery. Hermione was correct to be horrified, she just went about it all the wrong way because she was young and didn't know any better. She wasn't trying to take away wizards' cultural identity, but trying to free an enslaved race, many of the members of whom were being horrifically abused. It's not like she was telling wizards they couldn't use spells for housekeeping or even have paid servants. It was unpaid labor and its associated abuses she was trying to stop. Your argument is one of the same one US southern slave owners used, that taking away their slaves would change their culture.

JKR didn't really give us any wizarding traditions to analyze and never showed muggleborns actually trying to change the fabric of society, so it's hard to argue one way or the other just how much muggleborns objectively changed things.

The thing is, though, that change isn't bad. Blending cultures can lead to beautiful things. Ideally, when an immigrant comes to a new country, they learn about the new culture and people already in that culture learn about theirs. It is an exchange of knowledge that can lead to better understanding, tolerance, and sometimes better ways of doing things for both parties.

The world is a big place, so I won't say it's never ever happened, but I have never in the real world met or heard of an immigrant who arrived at another country and demanded that the citizens there change their culture to better suit them. Usually, it's the immigrant who lets go of certain of their own cultural traditions or beliefs to better fit in with the host culture.

***** You certainly never met a lot of immigrant but that's not the point.

House elves isn't slavery, or rahter it's not this simple. We do not have enough information about house elves in the books. It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat, if you know the term. Does house elves need a "bond" to survive, like we see in some fics? In this case it isn't slavery. If they don't need wizards to survive, and wizards force them to work for them, then it is slavery.

My opinion is that is isn't slavery, remember in fourth/fifth book? When the house elves stoped going to the Gryffindor's tower because they were afraid to be freed? I am 100% sure if you ask a real slaves (like in US before) if he want to be free, he would jump on the ocasion. Meaning that the house elves DON'T want to be free. I remember somone here giving me the stupid counter-argument that the house elves were afraid that it was a trap or something like that but it don't work like this, once you take a clother your master isn't your master anymore (like Dobby who harmed his former master in the second books)

****** I went to a US college where over a quarter of the student body was from another country. Before and since then I've also met and befriended immigrants, so I have met many and from every populated continent on the planet.

The very fact that house elves have to be freed shows that it's slavery. They have to be freed, meaning they are not free to live their own lives. There is no house elf bond in canon. There is no official word that elves need wizards in order to live or have magic; fics that have that often are trying to excuse the slavery house elves have to endure. The fact that Dobby can be a free, paid elf seems contra to the existence of a bond being necessary for survival. He even powerfully blasts Lucius Malfoy away after being freed, so he certainly has magic on his own.

Historically, there were slaves who were offered freedom and didn't take it because they were suspicious that it was a trick, because certain sick individuals did try to trick some slaves. It is also perfectly logical to fear freedom because once you're free you have zero money, no home, and no way to support yourself. How many wizards would be willing to take on a "disgraced" house elf? What is the house elf supposed to do on its own? Hunt and forage for food with skills it never acquired? Sleep outside in storms and snow? In the real world, there are people in prison who fear getting free for those very same reasons. The show has its failings, but an early season of Orange is the New Black demonstrates this pretty well, with a newly freed prisoner who purposefully gets arrested again because she can't make a living outside of prison because no one will hire a ex-con. Slavery is complicated. Just because you, someone who's been free your whole life, can't see a slave not jumping at the chance to be free doesn't mean it never happened.

******* None of your points is an argument:

"The very fact that house elves have to be freed shows that it's slavery. They have to be freed, meaning they are not free to live their own lives" : free can be used in many context, after I am done with a job, I am free to do whatever I want.

"There is no house elf bond in canon. There is no official word that elves need wizards in order to live or have magic; fics that have that often are trying to excuse the slavery house elves have to endure" : There is no official word that elves don't need wizards. The only free elve, Dobby, died...

"Historically, there were slaves who were offered freedom and didn't take it because they were suspicious that it was a trick, because certain sick individuals did try to trick some slaves" : Adding Historically to a false fact doesn't make it true.

"It is also perfectly logical to fear freedom because once you're free you have zero money, no home, and no way to support yourself. How many wizards would be willing to take on a "disgraced" house elf? What is the house elf supposed to do on its own? Hunt and forage for food with skills it never acquired? Sleep outside in storms and snow?" : One word: Hogwarts. Helga Hufflepuff created the kitchen to give works to elves. Check Pottermore to check this information.

"In the real world, there are people in prison who fear getting free for those very same reasons. The show has its failings, but an early season of Orange is the New Black demonstrates this pretty well, with a newly freed prisoner who purposefully gets arrested again because she can't make a living outside of prison because no one will hire a ex-con.

May I remind you that Dobby was quite literally murdered for rescuing Harry&Co, and as such his death has literally zero to do with the matter at hand? Since, you know, it wasn't due to any sort consequence related to being a free elf.

Rowling basically states that the House Elves that work at Hogwarts are not slaves, that they are treated well. I find the "House Elves are slaves" argument to be almost the same black-and-white nonsense as arguing that "sex = rape". Its such a illogical, backwards mindset to think House Elves are enslaved simply for doing what they do. The entire lesson that Hermione learnt in GoF was that House Elves are not inherently slaves.

Obviously people like the Malfoys exist who abused their House Elf, but that doesn't make owning a House Elf the same as owning a slave. Owning a House Elf is no different than having sex. Yes, some people abuse their partner and rape them, but that doesn't make sex itself bad.

Abused House Elves are outliers, not the norm; a fact that fanon often forgets because of how popular the "backwards wizarding world" trope is, and how much of a poor cliche it is for muggleborns and/or muggles to be portrayed as the supreme master race of the HP series. Both of which are major peeves of mine given how hamfisted they are and how much some pretend it to be canon.

Never mind the fact that it is canon that muggleborns are genetically disadvantaged. Muggleborns cannot become parselmouths, or Metamorphmagus, or a Seer, or any inherited bonus that you must be born to have. Its no coincidence that the only Metamorphmagus in canon was descended from the pure-blood Black family. Its no coincidence that Grindelwald inherited his Seer abilities, or that Voldemort inherited the ability to speak Parseltongue, both coming from the magical sides of their family (in Grindelwald's case, he may or may not be an actual pureblood unlike Voldemort).

Its no coincidence that Hermione and Lily are the only talented muggleborns in canon (Slughorn even implies in his debut how rare it is for a muggleborn to be academically talented, and he would know how well his students performed over 50-60 years of teaching). Its no coincidence that the true top-tiers of the wizarding world either are all half-blood or pure-blood (e.g. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, Snape, Bellatrix, Slughorn, Kingsley, McGonagall).

** Well in the HP series, all magical-only areas are basically ghettos. Just think about in: in the HP series, there is no such thing as a true "wizarding world".

99.999999% of the world is the muggle world. The rest is basically magical ghettos where wizards are free to be themselves. Outside of their ghettos, they are forced into hiding by the Statute of Secrecy. The Statute of Secrecy is basically an international law that suppresses wizards and forces them into a metaphorical closet, while the likes of Grindelwald (and to a lesser extent, Voldemort) want wizards to come out of the closet and be free to use magic without fear. Its very easy to see how muggles, despite Rowling's narrative, were never the underdogs in the HP series because they vastly outnumber wizards and own almost everything in the world.

To some pure-bloods and half-bloods, muggle-borns represent a muggle influence on what few places that wizards can actually call their own. Muggle-borns would try to make the wizarding ghettos more like the muggle world, thereby erasing wizarding culture over time. Imagine if over 99.99% of the world was dominated by one race and/or one culture, and any other race/cultures were at risk of erasure via assimilation with the majority race/culture, it would be understandable why those endangered cultures would want to survive.

In Britain, the only magical areas are Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Hogwarts, and St Mungos. Everywhere else in Britain is the muggle world. Meaning that those ghettos are the only places that wizards can actually express themselves freely, use magic without being suppressed by the Statute of Secrecy and more importantly, to be themselves.

Yet muggleborns, by being raised in the muggle world, bring muggle culture with them such as sexism, racism (based on skin colour), and homophobia. Meaning the only wizards who display sexism, racism, or homophobia will either be muggleborns, muggle-raised wizards or to a lesser extent, wizards who lived in a time before the Statute of Secrecy existed.

This isn't even accounting for the witch hunts which, despite what fanon says, did impact wizards. Children couldn't just apparate or make Shield Charms, or use Disillusionment Charms on themselves. Especially not muggleborn children who would be at greater danger of being exposed due to more contact with muggles.

From the perspective of someone like Grindelwald, wizards have been forced into hiding in magical ghettos to appease the muggles, with muggles hating wizards enough to want to commit genocide against them. Even to wizarding children. Wizards are forced into supressing themselves by not being able to openly use magic, lest they enrage the muggles into trying to eradicate their kind. There is no way that Grindelwald or Voldemort's view of muggles wasn't influenced by Hitler's actions, especially in the former's case. If anything, Hitler's actions would have just reinforced their views, since either of them could point to the Holocaust as an example of what muggles would try do to wizards if they knew wizards existed. If anything, it would probably help Voldemort get further support from wizards who had been raised in the muggle world.

*TL;DR: Muggleborns are hated because muggles literally rule the world while wizards are forced to hide in ghettos because of the Statute of Secrecy. Muggleborns are seen as a representation of muggle imperialism against wizards. Muggleborns are hated because they are so associated with muggles.*

Grindewald, so far as I know, did not distinguish between the bloodlines, he just cared if you were magical. He wanted power rather than purity. Voldemort is basically Hitler-lite. I can imagine he probably found copies of books written by the Thule Society or former wizards and witches that were members in his quest for power.

** In my mind I always reasoned it was either due to witch killings in old age or muggleborns trying to change everything in the Wizard Culture to suit them better. However I do think at one point Wizards/Witches were being killed off which is why they keep their world secret and their numbers are low but that is a discussion for another time. When you think of it in the sense of some random person who is new to your culture is coming in and trying to change things it becomes easier to understand why many pure-bloods hold prejudice against muggles and muggleborns. Not justifying but I can see why and how it could have potentially began Humans don't have a good track record with things they do not understand. Evidently, Wizards would have a pretty solid reason to hate muggles depending on past events (I find it very likely in the past Muggles slaughtered wizards and witches) and honestly if I was a Wizard born into a powerful family I would feel superior too, muggleborns are at a immediate disadvantage when entering the wizard world. That's simply their circumstances and the cards they were played some like Hermione will do well but most will not.

** Prewritten rants to copy-paste are the best.

The rise of beliefs in blood superiority in canon has its reasons. The division between wizarding world and the muggle one existed before ISOS as proven by things like Wizard's Council rules on playing Quidditch afar from Muggles (Quidditch Through Ages), The Tales of Beedle the Bard being written in runes in XV century (DH), the various cases of Muggles not knowing that people living near them are Wizards (ex. Pottermore: Potter Family, Pottermore: Hogwart's Ghosts). In Early Modern Europe, came the waves of witch hunts, which created hostility to Muggles. The Wizard and the Hopping Pot had new, anti-muggle version created (The Tales of Beedle the Bard). In the end "the widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for muggle ends", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic", "increasing numbers of witch-burnings", "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches" and "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (W.O.M.B.A.T.) led to creation of International Statutes of Secrecy in which British side played significant role (W.O.M.B.A.T.).

"The International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.

Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles. Increasing numbers of wizards now preached that marriage with a Muggle did not merely risk a possible breach of the new Statute, but that it was shameful, unnatural and would lead to 'contamination' of magical blood.

As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent ('I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.

Several works of dubious scholarship, published around the early eighteenth century and drawing partly on the writings of Salazar Slytherin himself, make reference to supposed indicators of pure-blood status, aside from the family tree. (...)

Successive studies produced by the Department of Mysteries have proven that these supposed hallmarks of pure-blood status have no basis in fact. Nevertheless, many pure-bloods continue to cite them as evidence of their own higher status within the wizarding community.

In the early 1930s, a 'Pure-Blood Directory' was published anonymously in Britain, which listed the twenty-eight truly pure-blood families, as judged by the unknown authority who had written the book, with 'the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines'." (lazy quote from Pottermore: Pure-Blood)

This provides certain background for existence of Muggle-hating (and by proxy muggleborn-hating) part of society, but what led to the support Voldemort got for his rebellion?

Let's look at the political situation

"Ignatius Tuft 1959 - 1962 Son of the above. A hard-liner who capitalised on his mother's popularity to gain election. Promised to institute a controversial and dangerous Dementor breeding program and was forced from office.

Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest. Has always denied having anything to do with England's 1966 World Cup Win. Left office after contracting mysterious illness (conspiracy theories abound).

Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, but was soon confronted with the first rise of Lord Voldemort. Jenkins was soon ousted from office as inadequate to the challenge." (Pottermore: Ministers for Magic)

First we had two Ministers that resigned before getting full seven years. One was generally controversial and was forced officially, the second one was controversial among pure-blood faction which may had something to do with his resignation. Then we had Squib Rights marches, which were met with rioting and are another indicator of the general social mood being against opinions supported by pure-blood faction.

So we have pure-bloods for whom the world is falling apart. Muggleborns get elected, squibs demand rights. And here arrives Voldemort with promises of making Britain pure again. He perfectly capitalised on the feelings of then marginalised group and used them as their followers. The moods and events in timeframe of original books are just follow-up to the first rebellion, so the sides are already clearly marked.

Also there is "immigrant" part in the books which I forgot to mention. Draco says in PS "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families".

Wow, that got really big even with some large direct quotes. Still, I think I've proved that there is background in canon for conflict, it just mostly not shown in the books.

** That's probably one of the biggest PLOTHOLES :( - Rowling is great at world-building (sure: Her world could be more detailed, but she still did well especially if you consider that it was supposed to be a story for children and it was written in a damned cafe and on trains if I remember this correctly!), but she isn't the greatest story-teller - that's why her story has huge plotholes and contrived circumstances (like how Voldemort was beaten...damned, that plan was so stupid and contrived...I still hate the ending, not only how the war was won but also that somehow the hate-group (the elitist purebloods!) escapes punishment (especially douchebag number 1: Draco Malfoy!), the wiz-world doesn't change much and Harry ends up with Fangirl Number 1 and has tons of kids he gives CRINGE WORTHY NAMES TO...Albus Severus - Really Harry?

Call me an ass if you want, but if I were Harry I'd piss on Dumbledore's grave and Snape's, too...and I'd keep that nice wand (the Elder Wand) and the stone, not just the cloak!)

Thankfully many fanfictions filled that hole! Some use the "they are destroying wizard culture because they don't fully assimilate (and they don't, Hermione is a great example with her houself crusade - something a pure- or half-blood would probably never think about!), because they bring their own holidays (and don't celebrate wizarding ones like the solstice etc.) and traditions (no wand-lore, no special inherited magics like parseltongue or metamorph-magi-abilities etc.) and keep in contact with their non-magical relatives (which endangers the wiz-world more and more, especially with cellphone-cameras etc.)!"...others paint the purbloods as morons who believe that muggleborns steal a pureblood's magic (personally I don't like this explanation, but then again: My education makes a good case for that kind of being impossible - biology-wise etc.!)
