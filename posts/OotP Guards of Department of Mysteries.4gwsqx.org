I was having a think the other day and I can't ever remember this being addressed anywhere. Given that the Order was guarding the Department of Mysteries during OotP how were the death eaters and Harry et al able to get in? I thought about the guard perhaps being killed but there is never a death attributed to that in the books? Thoughts?


** Mundungus was on guard duty that night :)

*** Haha I also thought about that two but surely if Mundungus was on guard duty and fluffed it again it would have been at least mentioned? I just feel like it was something not registered if you know what I mean :)

** Infer that after Arthur was attacked, Fudge (prompted by Luscious) increased inspections of the entry to the DoM, sweeping for cloaked observers, etc. Thus, it wasn't safe for the Order to undertake regular guard duty and it was easy for Luscious to influence Fudgey to make sure no one was there that night.

*** I like that idea that old Luscious arranged it, probably the most fitting idea :)
