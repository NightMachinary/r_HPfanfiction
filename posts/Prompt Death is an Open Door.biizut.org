The title "Master of Death" essentially translates to "hotel manager" in the realm of the afterlife. When one day there's an enormous influx of patrons - /none/ of whom have reservations - Harry simply says 'no,' and sends them all back. Thanos is less than pleased. Bonus points for including Mr. Moseby and "No running in my lobby!" or back-and-forth with the dead people, but the goal of this is to see fun stuff pop up.


** Extra unnecessary crossover crackfic credit: By sending the dead back in one swoop, Harry causes Blackest Night from DC.

...and then they realize that /this/ is the bad place.

** I imagine that there are many afterlifes that people have to board a train/airplane but it gets clogged up so there are so many delays thus the need for a hotel for the souls to stay since their case is still pending thus couldn't board the train/plane.

Sorting through people's faith to know whether they would go is a whole beaurocratic mess. Like hey didn't subscribe to a faith so their case is still pending thus the need for a hotel until their paperwork is finished.

"Mr. Peters... It reads here that you are atheists so I have here a list of forms on different kind of afterlifes and the qualifications to enter it. We will need to review your life to see which ones you qualify and thus give you options."

"So what happens now?"

"Well, there is an afterlife hotel which you can temporary stay while we sort through your options"

Meanwhile, Harry is wishing for that moment of peace yet looks at the guest book wondering if he could accidentally drop them in hell if only they were bad enough. The problem is that the people are just annoying, grating on the nerves, obnoxious and loud, equal opportunity assholes, or snobs. Not bad enough for hell but enough to make his job feel like it.

A bell boy knocks on his office door.

"Uh.... Boss, we have an issue at the lobby." The kid nervously shuffles

"What is it? Please don't tell me it's those brats again."

"No sir.... Just new customers."

"Reservation?"

"No, sir."

"Do we have vacancies?"

"No."

"Then kick them out."

"But sir..? They are to many."

"So what, if there's an issue blame it to the ones who process where they go. We can't deal with too many dead people since it's not a scheduled disaster nor an apocalypse. Just shove them back where they came from."

"Okay... Sir."

** “Whars going on here?!” Harry demanded, hands waving in a vague gesture that probably meant ‘I'm so done with this job. (And it has only been 50 years)

“Harry! Long time no see. I have to say, it was nice of you to organise this party for us all. And it's a spiffing party, if I do say so myself, only second to my annual deathday party! Or perhaps I should say ‘hip', eh? That's what young people these day are saying, ain't it? Nearly Headless Nick said, eyebrows wriggling as he did so. (I think someone missed the memo to Hogwarts ghosts that ‘hip' went out of fashion /centuries/ ago.)

“Oooohh Harrryyy!” Myrtle crooned, sidling up to Harry as she spotted Harry. “I was so disappointed when you didn't appear in my bathroom after you died, but spending eternity in this hotel with you is a much better situation,” she giggled, fluttering her eyelashes at Harry. (Harry inched away slightly, because between non-living and dying, Myrtle has aged to her true age, and it's highly disturbing to have a 200 years old /granny/ flirting with you.)

Harry sighed, turning to the wide-eyed assistance beside him. (He is so not paid enough for this job.) “So, which of my grandson did this?”

In which the marauders tradition continued in another generation, and they somehow managed to exorcise the whole of Hogwarts ghost population.

Crackfic on the go, unpolished.
