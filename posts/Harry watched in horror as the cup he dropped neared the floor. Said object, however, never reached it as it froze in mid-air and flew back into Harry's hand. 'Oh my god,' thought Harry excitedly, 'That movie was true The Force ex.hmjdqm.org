** Heh. It'd be really amusing if that realisation happened around Dudley and it was the impetus for the two of them actually becoming friends. Like "You're a Jedi, Jedis aren't freaks! They're the heroes!" and "I'm gonna train you. Let me get on your back like Yoda."

That could be a really fun little redemption arc for him and perhaps Petunia (seeing the kids bond over magic where she and Lily split would have to bring something out of her, maybe that could be a shred of human decency?).
