** Poly/Harem:

linkao3(2062614). Hermione's Furry little Problem has been popular enough to inspire multiple novel length reimaginings. There are good reasons for that, among which is that the actual story hangs together better than canon a lot of times.

linkao3(14376795) HP walks through the veil to defeat Voldemort. Right into an accidental pervert moment with Bellatrix. Lots of sex and relationship stuff, along with an actually interesting AU setup.

linkao3(863889). Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived and son of General-Obsessed-With-Making-People-Kneel, bones his way through the HP and DC universes. Hilariously bitchy commentary on the HP world combined with a gleeful perversity. I'd avoid the second book though.

Erotic Romance (might not be as porny as you're looking for but do have great sex scenes):

linkao3(18196214). Wonderfully written, great characterization, and a good mystery for the Auror pairing. I've reread this one three or four times.

linkffn(11767791) The only complaint I have about this one is the promised seques were never written. Cost me a lot of sleep after reading.
