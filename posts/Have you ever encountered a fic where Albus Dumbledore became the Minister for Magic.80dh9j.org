In canon, Dumbledore had this weird fear of power which was why he never became the Minister, which is ironic because of all the other positions he held. Maybe the titles were just ceremonial without actual power?

Anyway, this made me wonder if anyone has ever thought to write a fic where Dumbledore loses this weird fear, accepts the Minister for Magic post and becomes actually good at it?

And if that kind of story isn't available, I guess I can accept any story where Dumbledore becomes the Minister even if he's bad at it.

Probably, yes. Being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot seems to have more to do with watching over the proceedings and regulating the other Wizengamot members' behavior, than it does with being the leader of the Wizengamot; I'm assuming being Supreme Mugwump is kind of the same thing.

On the other hand these kinds of positions are usually some of the most highly regarded in a state. For example the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Bundestag][President of the German Parliament]] is nominally the second highest rank in Germany, even before Merkel (who is 3rd). Political capital/influence is not merely defined by executive powers.

**** True, but Dumbledore only restrains himself from direct power; he's all for holding influence. (And uses it too.) The point is, he's afraid of putting himself in a position where he's one speech away from becoming a dictator, because he doesn't know if he'd resist the temptation.

***** Well, I guess this is where my Dumbledore bashing begins, but I don't think that's a valid distinction. In fact it is way harder to make yourself a dictator with executive power (because it is rarely built into the system) you absolutely *need* the influence to do that, and can do without the formal power.

IMHO Dumbledore is just afraid that he's going to fail (because he had more failures than successes in his life, in short, he sucks) so he doesn't want to take responsibility. If he doesn't hold any formal power no-one can blame him when everything goes to shit. He wants to be seen as this great legendary figure that can do no wrong, even though he knows he's wrong a lot. So he stays out of the limelight.

******** Yea except the little detail that the manipulation continued after this and even after Dumbledore died. There's a reason Snape had to give Harry those memories, because otherwise Harry might not have survived. When I say he had no problem, I mean he routinely did it, even after admitting the manipulations nearly caused Harry to nearly die in book 5.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
