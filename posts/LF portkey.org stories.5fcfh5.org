I'm looking for copies of some of the nc and r rated top stories on Portkey like "O" or "Envy" or any other. I tried the archive.org route but cannot get past the age verification (Story does not exist). Any help would be appreciated.


** I was able to recover a story from archive.org but I think it was old enough that there was a capture from before the age verification was added.

** I have lots of Portkey stories, but I've never read any of them. I've got one called "Envy" by Twitch E. Littleferret, and one called "O" by cheering charm. Both are NC17. Are they the ones you mean?

For any others, I would need titles (and preferably author names) to search the mess of my collection.

*** Those are the ones I'm looking for. Aside from those two I don't have any specific fic in mind. Just any story from the site would be great.

**** If you PM me your email I can send you those two. Unfortunately the rest are mixed in with a bunch of other fics I have downloaded and I have no easy way to seperate them out, and the folder is huge, so I can't share all the portkey stories I have. But feel free to let me know if you think of any specific ones you're after and I'll see if I have them.

** I have a request for three stories by Twitch E. Littleferret. The Problem is I don't know their names, but in the first story, I believe Hermione is a princess and Harry is a knight or a prince. All I know is that it was the only story I believe he/she made a sequel to. The third story I want is, the one where they are stranded on an island and they are divided into two groups. If you still have access to these stories could you please send them to [[mailto:Dillinger910@gmail.com][Dillinger910@gmail.com]] Thank you.
