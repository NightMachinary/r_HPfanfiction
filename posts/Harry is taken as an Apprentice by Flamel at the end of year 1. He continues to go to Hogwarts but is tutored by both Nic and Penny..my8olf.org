I don't mind if it's it's grey or dark Harry. Would imagine that most would be grey as after living for as long as they have I highly doubt that the Flamels would be neglecting so much useful magic/ rituals in the name of being 'light'. So yeh. Don't really want a pairing, unless it's a Fleur-Harry one -which I highly doubt there will be as it's a rather small following in comparison to others-

Would prefer one that's holds nothing back gore, violence, language ect.

Thanks


** There's only one Flamel apprentice story I know of from the top of my head. Relationship is with an OC, has elemental powers.
