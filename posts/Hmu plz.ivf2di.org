Any good dark Harry stories. Or dark lord Harry? Incomplete or complete is fine. Preferably atleast 40k. No harry/Ginny or hermione plz. And slash, not against it just don't like Harry with another guy. I'm ok if Sirius or someone else is gay, just not Harry. Doesn't even have to have any pairings at all


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

Warning - its extremely dark and has some pretty disturbing content
