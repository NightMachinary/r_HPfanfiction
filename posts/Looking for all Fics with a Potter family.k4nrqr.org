Like stated all things potter family would be great, plus points for h/hr and the story taking place while Harry is in Hogwarts

I dont mind bashing or a brother or lord etc

Thanks in advance


** Ok, so what triggered the stupid automod this time? Usually it is some dumb shit like "was muttering" where this genius of a bot sees the word "smut". But this time I can't see anything.

And to make the comment on topic:

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

**** Weird. Slightly off-topic, but are you guys now removing any request threads looking for smut? Because there was absolutely nothing against the rules in this thread:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k518o4/nsfw_need_help_finding_a_smut_fic/]]

Yet, it got removed by a mod. I guess my reply is against the rules, since I directly linked. But then my reply should be removed, not the whole thread.

****** Then you need to rewrite rule 8. Because as it stands now it is not against the rule to do a "Whats this fic?", for anything really. Only providing a direct link to a fic that violates the rule. I thought that was by design, to avoid full on censorship.
