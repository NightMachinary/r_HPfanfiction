The night Voldemort comes to kill Harry, happens to fall on the night of the full moon. The wolfsbane potion was just created by a star pupil of Horace Slughorn half a year prior. Remus has taken the potion, and decides to spend the night at the Potter home in the comfort of Padfoot.


** Except it isn't. At least according to [[https://everydaycalculation.com/moon-phase.php]] (and Emacs calendar) October 31st, 1981 was the moon in “Waxing (Young) Crescent” and the next full moon was in eleven days.

**** 1. sure, do whatever rocks your boat,

2. one of many differences between the Harry Potter universe and almost all other fantasy (and one of the reasons why I claim HP is not a fantasy) is that it is planted in the real world. Yes, JKR is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books][complete crap with dates]], but I a way prefer stories which introduce more of the real world rather than less ([[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] has tendency to do it, and it is the only saving grace of otherwise rather awful linkffn(10556030)).

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** Don't write but love to theorycraft.

I don't think it'll give significant edge to Potter & Co., but having 2 extra combatants is definitely good. Werewolf Lupin might surprise Tom but I'm sure he has spells in his arsenal to get rid of him quickly, especially considering Lupin can't cast spells (that we know of) in wolf form.

Sirius though, will hinder Voldemort quite a bit, even giving James a chance to pick up his wand and join in the fight. I don't think 20 something's will have a chance against Tom no matter how talented, but it can buy them time either to call Dumbledore (Lily sends a patronus) or for Lily to disapparate with Harry (unlikely) or to Join the two and fight 3-on-1 with Tom.

In the last case, most likely all 4 will die (as put by Capt.Sunshine below) and things will proceed pretty much like canon except yr 3, Peter might or might not be exposed as traitor but the DEs will definitely know and he will hide as a rat again. And in yr 5 Tom shows someone else in Harry's vision.

First two cases, I can easily see one or more of the Potter & Co. surviving, Lily having more chances of living, and after that is pretty much fanfiction territory.

-Tom runs away, I mean I can't see him defeating Dumbledore or catch Lily once she disapparates.

-War doesn't end, and the Longbottoms might also live if Tom doesn't go after them.

-Peter is caught.

-Harry grows up as a balanced individual, and doesn't have a martyr complex but still has a saving-people-thing.

-He also embodies marauder spirit, I'm sure even Lily would instill some rebelliousness/prankster tendencies in him.

Edit: I'm also pretty sure the war is lost by the order, it's been made quite clear that the DEs lost only cause Tom vanished, if he's still present, the ministry takeover would complete. There are a number of fics that cover this territory where Potters are in America etc, and one I remember clearly is linkffn(the dark lord never died)

***** Friendly reminder that it doesn't take being much more powerful than someone else to kill that person, just one lucky shot. Voldemort is powerful but he's decidedly not "five against one, the one wins five-nil" skilled.

At best, I think Remus would die because werewolf = biggest threat and then someone will get Voldie with whatever curse they deem necessary because it's still 4 skilled wizards against one, regardless of if the one has Horcruxes.

****** Yeah, important thing to remember. Horcruxes don't stop you from being killed. They just make being killed impermanent.

Voldemort can be killed by sufficient force, it's why he is leery of Dumbledore. He just won't stay dead.

If it weren't for the Desth Eaters, the Order could off him every decade or so while Harry grows up and figures out how to end him for good.
