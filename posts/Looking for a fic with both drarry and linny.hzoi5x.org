So I've been doing not so great lately, and I'm desperately trying to find a wholesome fic with my two favourite pairings to make me feel better. I'm struggling to find a fic with both Draco/Harry and Luna/Ginny- if any of you guys know any good fics with both of these pairings in them, I'd be in your debt forever ðŸ’–


** The only one I know is linkao3(Nearly Lost Things Carefully Tended) but the Luna/Ginny is quite minor.

#+begin_quote
  Three years after the war, Harry is lost, drifting, and feeling left behind. In an effort to get control of his life, he commits to cleaning out Grimmauld Place top-to-bottom and forcing it to be a home, whether it likes it or not. The rotten old house is stuffed full of antiques, and Harry is shocked to discover none other than Draco Malfoy running the local antique shop. Malfoy is polite -- too polite, and Harry soon finds himself with a mission: to annoy and bother Malfoy with the most hideous, absurd antiques he can find. But along the way, Harry comes to appreciate Draco, his work, and the power of connecting to the people who came before him. It's a hard lesson, but Harry learns that if he wants to build a future, he has to reconnect to his past, and Draco might just be the one to help him do it.

** You might want to post this to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic]]

I can't think of any specific fics to recommend, but ao3 is the home of the slash and femmeslash fics and you can filter the fics to contain both of these pairings, if you want to go searching
