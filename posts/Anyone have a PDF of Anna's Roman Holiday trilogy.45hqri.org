The website where these fics are posted is down and i'm very concerned. This is my very favorite fanfiction series and I'm devastated to think that they may be gone forever. Please let me know if any of you have PDFs of the stories you could post or send to me.

*** thank you for this, I adore this fic and was so disappointed when I realised the website was down. It's only Roman Holiday not the other two books though, are they not available?

**** Just redownloaded that zip and checked. It contains all 3 books - Roman Holiday , Jewel of the Nile and Last Tango in Paris.

What other two books are you referring to ?

***** Sorry my mistake they are there, using my partners macbook and didn't realise I'd have to scroll down to find the folders... stupid!

However, I'm reading Roman Holiday and there's no chapter 7!! The story does seem to flow from chapter 6 and chapter 8 so it's not a massive loss...

** Have the address? Go to archive.org and punch it in.

Also, if you know the file name but can't get it on archive, you can type filetype:pdf filename into google search and see if it's hosted elsewhere.

*** Thank you! I've tried all of this and have come up with nothing. I believe they were only hosted on the one site, [[http://www.witchfics.org/]] which is down :(
