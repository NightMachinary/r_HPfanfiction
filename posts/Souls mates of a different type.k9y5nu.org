Harry is the soul mate of Kara-El. As she is resting in her ship she is witnessing his years at the Dursleys and they both feel their times at hogwarts and on Themyscira.

After seeing Cedric die and the first day he's told he's delusional for 1 Voldemort being back and 2 a 'celestial' being his soul mate [yes a kryptonian is a Abberation but their solar powered and can fly so Harry calls her an angelic creature] he decides to prove she exists by tracking her down.

With his broom, his wand and cloak he's looking for her. With hits about Themyscira's star pattern he uses what he learned in Astrology to find her exact location.


** WTF is Kara doing in Themyscira?

*** training in a controlled enviorment i would imagine, since her only potential guardian carries the weight of the world and he's friends with the crown princess of the Amazons.
