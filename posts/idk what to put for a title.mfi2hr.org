:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey ya'll! so i'm looking for a few different fanfics similar to one i read a while ago here it is: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12575273/1/Suspicions]]

(i'm not sure if this is how i'm supposed to show links n stuff cuz i'm new to this sight but whatever)

anyway if ya'll could help me find fanfictions like this one that would be great! doesn't have to be Bill x Harry (can be any ship i just want one of harry and someone getting caught together by the order and stuff)


** If this was an actual fic search ("What's that fic?" is for when you are looking for a specific story), a hint about what you're looking for would make a great title... so people who, for example, don't read that pairing wouldn't have to click your post to see what it was about.

If you're looking for fics similar to this, the correct flare is "Request". An appropriate title would be "LF fics like Suspicions by XxXxDarkVampirexXxX, and then in the body you tell us what you liked about that fic (as you did) so we can better help you.
