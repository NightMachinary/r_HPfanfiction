Harry really likes DADA (maybe Quirrelmort becomes his mentor?)

Dumbledore is varying degrees of upset, vary and suspicious.

(Also, if you know a fic like this, could you recommend it? I'm sorry if this already exists, as I haven't seen it anywhere.)


** There was a story, where Quillermort decides that the world domination is boring and that he would actually rather really teach DADA, somehow merges himself into Quirrel and starts to teach seriously. Also, Hagrid was Slytherin, and he somehow saved the situation by his cunning. I cannot find the story at the moment.

** YES AN EXCUSE TO TALK ABOUT MY FAVORITE FIC

"Methods of Humanity" Is a wonderful collection of one-shots (with an over arching plot) Where Voldemort/Tom/Thomas/You-Know-Who/....names are strange, decides to retire from Dark-Lording and become a teacher.

He does /not/ plan to become a mentor, and he was certain to never be a parental figure.

Harry has other plans.

"Methods of Humanity" Is a wonderful collection of one-shots (with an overarching plot) Where Voldemort/Tom/Thomas/You-Know-Who/....names are strange, decides to retire from Dark-Lording and become a teacher.

Without too many spoilers, Dumbledore is portrayed brilliantly along with the subplot he is involved in. There is no bashing but since it is from the perspective of, well, you know who, there is a reasonable amount of assuming the worst of Albus.

**** I'll put in my two cents about reading HPMOR as well.

You've already received a good few comments about how HPMOR may be worth your while under certain circumstances or if you like Z or Y. A link has also been shared that reviews and criticises the fic as it goes along. A lot of the criticism and even hatred towards the fic centers on the writer. I'll try to stay away from that.

The fic is technically well written, you will not find a lot of spelling mistakes. The characters are not written to be like real 11-year-olds, this is both partially in-universe explained (at a late stage for some, spoilers) and explicitly out-universe waved away as a means to make the story interesting to read to an adult audience.

The main character is written to be a child prodigy who does not act like a child at all a lot of the time. This may grate on your nerves. It is also part of the story. The main character is also specifically written to make mistakes, at least that much is mentioned in author notes. There is a tendency in reviews to take everything the main character does as being either perfect, something to emulate, or as the author's best effort at seeming smart. This is then used as a basis to criticise the author. There are probably a lot of good reasons to criticise the author but that hasn't been my way of enjoying HP fanfic. I prefer to read the story instead of trying to analyse author intent etc.

If I were to describe HPMOR in the most concise way I can, it'd be this: The fic is more of a puzzlebox than a character study. It does espouse an ideology but you're generally free to ignore it (if you can, as it is front right and center). If you don't like some of the characters, especially the main character, that's probably a good thing and speaks of your good character.

I had fun with the fic and there're things (thing?) in it that I actually look back to in my work life as good rules of thumb. It is a finished fic which is always a big plus. I even re-read the whole thing a while ago just to relive the experience. I still found the ending as exhilarating as when it was originally published.

You mileage may vary.

***** Ok, thanks! Yeah, bashing the Author of this fic is apparently very popular, but I don't think it's right. I mean, propably every person had this 'IAmVerySmart' phase once, or there wouldn't be an audience to such fics.

Yeah, I get the type of character you mean. I used to read a lot of it at like, 12 or something. While I stopped actively seeking it out, it doesn't really bother me as much as it probably should, to be honest.

Regarding fanfics that portray characters that act in a way that would be generally not acceptable in real life, I have this 'philosophy' (if you can call it that) that it's still better to read about someone doing something crappy than actually doing something crappy yourself.

So, I think I'll just try a couple of chapters to see how bad it actually is and propably ignore some of the worse stuff in it.

Or I might just skip over the parts I don't like and read about Voldemort as a teacher. We'll see.

Thank you for the advice.

**** The fic reads like it was written by a young teenager who thinks being on the Middle School Honor Roll makes him the next Einstein.

Then you learn that the author is an adult who writes that sort of pretentious dreck for a living, along with such hits as "I would rather torture someone than have dust in people's eyes," "Why is everyone appalled at me, that's just utilitarianism," and my personal favorite "If you read this sentence a god AI will torture you forever.

(And an important part of the thought experiment is that human minds can't properly comprehend really huge numbers, so it's unreliable to use gut feelings to decide.)

*** Thanks! Abandoned doesn't matter, it's basically the same difference as work in progress, 'cause I just read it to the point it is at at the time and never look back. Idk how people do it, like remembering the details of what you read last week in order to not be confused out of your mind every new chapter? nah. As long as it isn't abandoned after like the prologue or something. I have yet to check it out. Anyway, thanks!

**** it's absolutely fantastic but it's so good that it genuinely HURTS getting to the ending and realizing it's not done, make sure to read it on ao3 rather than fanfiction though, there's several more chapters there

** That's a lot like linkao3(Resurrection by Spork_in_the_Road). Voldemort takes over completely in the body time sharing, Harry thinks DADA is wonderful, and Quirrel is just his favorite teacher.

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after “dying” in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
