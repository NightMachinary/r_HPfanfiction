I love time travel fanfics a lot but I can't seem to find any good ones that are currently being updated or are already finished that have more than just Harry and maybe Ron and Hermione time traveling. I'm looking for a group up from 5 to 10 people. I don't care about ships or overpowered characters as long as it's a good read.

  When Luna is approached by ancient magicks for help with a particularly pesky problem, she sets in motion a prophecy involving a Werewolf, an irate Goddess and four marauders that will turn the Wizarding World on its head. Otherwise known as: How Luna tore apart the fabric of reality so that her friends could get decently laid, and accidentally saved the world in the process."Time Travel. Could there have been anything worse? After the past thirty years of war? It was finally over, but no. Not for Hermione Granger! Hermione Granger has to deal with space-time anomalies and causal loop theory and the consequences of others' actions."Time-Turner, EWE/AU, Wolf!Mate fic with all that follows in its wake. Previously named The Prophecy That Should Have Been.

  “So,” Hermione begins, with a tone that belies her nervousness ever so slightly, “it's 1994. As far as the three of us know, we are the only ones from the future. Our present.”“It's madness,” Ron says.“Bonkers,” Harry adds.Or, the Golden Trio find themselves with the chance to make things right.
