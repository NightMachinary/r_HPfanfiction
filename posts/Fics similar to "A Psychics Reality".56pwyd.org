I was looking at imjusttryingtofindmyway's fics, and noticed this. I watched an anime with really badass scenes using telekinesis, so I really want a fic that has Harry using Psychic powers.

*** Eh, i'd rather Harry only being able to do one thing. Telekinesis for example. He can use it, but he can't do anything else like summon fire or something.

malfoy the bouncing ferret is the closest you will get to telekinesis and even then he was lighter as a ferret.
