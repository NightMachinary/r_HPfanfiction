We don't see much of wandlore in canon and I'm no expert so feel free to provide contrary evidence.

In the Philosopher's Stone Ollivander stated "Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great.

I believe one interpretation of this is that one's wand can predict the wielder's potential. Another possibility is that they can predict personality traits or magical aptitudes similar to astrology with their woods and cores combining and having significance based off their own meanings.

A more fanciful take on wandlore is that the crafting process itself takes a form of divination to perform. You're taking random animal and wood pieces and putting them together and expecting someone to be able to use it.

I believe that the crafting process itself requires the divination to find parts that compliment each other as well as compliment their future wielder.

Let's look at two of the best known wands in the series, Harry's and Voldemort's. Voldemort used a yew and phoenix feather. Harry's wand was holly and phoenix feather. They both shared a matching phoenix core coming from Fawkes' tail feathers.

The odds of the two having matching wands and no one having matched with the holly wand during the 50 year gap between their first years is minimal. That is, unless when both wands were crafted they were created specifically for Harry and Voldemort.

It popped into my head and I thought it a fun idea. Does anyone have any thoughts on the idea or possibly a fanfic that explores it?


** Idea for a beginning: Hermione (or any character) wants to become a wandmaker apprentice. Is informed that without Divination NEWT thats not gonna happen

*** What about Luna? In the story her maternal grandfather is Ollivander and parts of her expeditions are collecting wand ingredients, possibly trying to find new ones. Can you imagine a zebrawood and snorcack horn wand?

**** That would be so good. Luna apprenticing as wandmaker and then taking over for him. Generations after Britain is known as the nation with the, by far, weirdest wands.

** Totally acceptable as a reasoning, especially since the weighing or the Wands Olivander delves into wand Lore a bit more and we get to see how he reconciles the "personality" he places on a wand and it's core vs it's owner.

If this was the case, why didn't Ollivander have Harry try that wand first? If he knew the wand was special, why have Harry test a bunch of different wands? Between whispers of Voldemort's return and Harry coming of age, it would seem fairly obvious to have Harry test the wand immediately if divination was involved. In this case, I think it suggests that it's not the wandmaker who divined the pair of wands, but actually /Fawkes/. It could also have been Dumbledore, but I doubt it given how he treats Riddle. That is, assuming there was divination involved at all in this particular case.

*** Maybe the wandmaker is just a medium, like an oracle. He crafts those wands, never knowing what destinies they hold, guided by the forces of magic.

Or something...

*** Possibly as [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] stated or it may be that the wand makers simply do not wish for that part of their craft to become known. After all, divination is viewed as a useless class, if this were known, then it would be considered as important.

#+end_quote

In Britain and only by people who know the current professor. One could assume that because of Trelawney, not because of the general uselessness of the magic, Divination got the bad name it has in Hogwarts. And Trelawney /was/ right several times, she just didn't interpret the signs in the right way, being so stuck on her death predictions, telling us that there is some truth in the subject (next to the prophecies). A competent Divination professor may have turned the subject around for good (and Harry's life, for that matter).

***** Don't forget that prior to even her application Dumbledore wanted to cancel the class  "I did [hear the prophecy]," said Dumbledore. "On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head Inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all."

I'm not saying it's kept a secret because of the opinion on divination, but instead it's kept a secret which helps keep that opinion prevalent.
