One that I have tried to read several times is Basilisk-born by Ebenbild. I literally cant make it to the 3rd chapter.

** I've tried reading Limpieza De Sangre like three or four times and just can't get past the first couple chapters. Which is a shame, cause everyone seems to love it and the story sounds genuinely interesting, but something about the dialogue and the way character interactions are written takes me straight out of it.

** Can't get into WBWL, I just hate the premise and it doesn't make sense to me to turn Jily into worst people than the Dursleys.

Mega-powerful Harry is also a turn-off, it's just not interesting.

I also dislike any fic that makes Tom a likeable guy that can 'normally' fall in love with the first witch or wizard he meets. They could swap Tom's name with anyone else's and it'd the same. Give me toxic love, possessive and manipulative Tom instead!

Also, I can't stand incest or minor/adult relationships. Don't know why many fetishes it.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. I can't do any WBWL story no matter how it's done. The same goes for Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived.

I agree with Basilisk-born. I tried it but couldn't really get into it. There are definitely some cringe moments and tropes that I don't like in there (i.e. super helpful goblins, Dumbledore being 'put in his place', etc.), not to mention quite a lot of typos across the fic (which, itself, is so long).

Oh, and then there's HPMOR.

*** HPMoR is definitely divisive. I enjoyed it myself, and I think /some/ of the criticisms miss the point, but I can definitely understand that people might not enjoy reading about a smug and condescending Harry, even if it does come back to bite him.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions. It see it recommended everywhere but I just can't get into it. It's really well written, but I don't like the way Harry is portrayed, and I can't ignore that if he's meant to be the central character.

** If you want to give Basilisk-born another shot, you might want to skip to chapter 5 (which is chapter 6 by FFN's numbering, because of the prologue). For most of the story, I found the parts in the past pretty interesting, but I couldn't stand the stuff happening in the present, so I just skipped or skimmed it all. That lasted up until the past sections reached around Grindelwald's time, which is when I couldn't stand them anymore, but the present chapters got interesting enough to read.

*** Hah exact same. Really enjoyed the past chapters up untill Grindelwald, which I mostly skipped.

Current stuff is a bit over the top, but I really do enjoy some courtroom wank.

**** No, a lot of things get explained along the way. It's been written over a long period of time, so the author's writing has improved drastically now compared to 3 or 4 years ago when he started it. I personally didn't like the first chapters and skipped ahead I believe to chapter 10 before reading from there up to where it is now. Everything in the first chapters that I didn't get made a ton of sense afterwards. It's totally worth it though, one of the most unique fics in both storyline and the way it tells the story, and it's lore is super interesting and better developed than 99% of fics.

****** Like there probably will be some stuff your confused on, but honestly as much as I love the fic I 100% agree that the start of it is a bit messy. I have heard that some people have enjoyed it a lot more in the in story chronological order, but that does require bouncing around a fair bit. Hope you enjoy

**** Reading the prologue chapter probably does help, just to see how Harry got sent back in time. But after that, the story splits into two timelines, which are only now getting close to convergeing. The present timeline, at least in the beginning, seems to rely on being intentionally vague and confusing, probably so that it doesn't spoil what happens in the past. The past timeline can be read and understood completely without reading anything from the present.
