Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc, doesn't have to focus on pairings.

NO Weasley Bashing. No stories where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** Here's some. Most of them are complete.

  Some things would not go away; just like the scars on their bodies, there were scars in their minds. They may fade or they may stay there forever but they also would heal. Harry & Hermione. Complete.

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

  Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the trio find themselves separated and struggling in the aftermath. When Harry and Hermione are reunited after years apart, neither are where they want to be. Neither feel capable of meeting the expectations set upon them as children. Together they saved the world but can they save each other from the scars the battle left behind?

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  He glances at the boxy too-uniform numbers flashing on the face of Richard's radio. It's nearly noon, and he should be getting ready to leave; but there is still a harsh tension in his shoulders and neck that he wants to work out before Hermione finds him. It is, after all, Tuesday; and while his Tuesdays were designated ‘tea with Helen' days previously, they are now ‘lunch with Granger' days, ever since the chance meet-up with the Weasel's wife and the insufferable swot herself.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he *had* expected to be okay.Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** not actually HP or fanfic, but "What Unbreakable Looks Like" by Kate Locke is fantastic if you ever get a chance to read it.
