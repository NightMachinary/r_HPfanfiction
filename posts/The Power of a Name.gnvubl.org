This idea came to me after reading Ebenbilds latest work (Lay Down in Potter's Field), and is as such inspired by it

Names hold Power. That is a fact.

The goblins know this, and they abuse it, giving False Names to their Patrons.

The Old families know this, and so they keep their True Names secret from all but the closest family.

The Centaurs know this, and so they use the Names of the Celestials to strengthen their Sight.

But none remembered the power of family Titles, even the ones so old that Title became Name, and Name became Legend.

But the Names still hold Power.

Longbottoms have always been stronger while at sea.

Greengrasses have always had good harvests.

Malfoys have always acted selfishly, in bad faith.

Weasleys have always had a pit of jealousy buried deep down, paired with the stubbornness and pride of Gryffindor.

And Peverells have always had a connection to death.

A Name holds Power. But when a Name changes or a Title is Earned, the Power of the Being changes. The Essence of who they are is altered.

As Peter Pettigrew was given the Name of Wormtail, his courage faltered, his cunning grew and the Seed of Betrayal was planted.

And as Harry Potter, The Boy who Lived, disarms Draco Malfoy, unwitting Master of the Elder Wand, he is granted another Name, another Title. He does not realise it, noone does. Not until much later, in a forest in the Scottish Highlands, when a bright green spell strikes true and fails.

EDIT: I should have mentioned this when I first posted, but this isn't necessarily a prompt for people to actually write a fic from - everything except the last paragraph is worldbuilding to try and make the bloody HP magic system make SOME sort of sense. The setting for the prompt itself is in the last paragraph, the prompt is written as it is to make writers think of ways to work within a trope they're comfortable with while twisting it to something new.

It has been pointed out to me that I may have been needlessly ambiguous in my comments on this post, for that I apologise, the added ambiguity was based off feedback from a private discord server of close friends and the minor flood of PMs I've gotten since posting with people going "what is this" and variations thereof combined with my desire to try to light a fire under well-known tropes and make something new spawn from them.

Happy world-spawning

** Huh, ties in well with magic words. Say Wingardium Leviosa, you're telling the world that this thing floats. Say Crucio, you're telling someone that they're in quite a lot of pain.\\
Maybe Gilderoy Lockhart changed his name to try and seem more heroic; Gilderoy to try and raise his luck with women, Lockhart to be braver and tougher (or seem that way).

...Random thought; Super!Harry, unlikely to be able to get people to stop calling him Harry Potter, seeks to get 'Potter' developed as a slang term meaning something along the lines of 'totally awesome', 'like a superhero', 'invincible', etc. So that when Dumbledore does something cool or Harry himself pulls off a major feat, people call it 'Pottering' or 'doing a Potter' or something like that.

*** Yup, they're not so much "spells" as they're True Names IMO - a lot of this could then be extrapolated further, for example the stronger magics requires a longer incantation (Avada Kedavra possibly being the Name of the phenomenon of a Soul leaving its Vessel or the Patronum being a Spirit Protector etc) and weaker magics can be made specific by lengthening them by for example adding the Name of an item to "Accio" or "Leviosa" added to "Wingardium" specifying that you want the item to Float instead of Fly or similar. A lot of lore can be done using this idea and I see almost no fics using it - it's mostly adding duo, tria, maxima etc to the spells and not really digging into WHY it all works. Would also add difficulty to wordless magic, which we see a hell of a lot of in the later books and movies while being told that it's exceedingly rare to be capable of wordless casting.

It's a logical step to make for a fantasy universe with magic and a decent way of establishing a core set of regulations for how the magic works. Understanding a concept, knowing the name of the concept and having the power to then "command" the concept to do as you imagine. That's a lot better than "wave your wand, imagine the result and remember to swish and flick"

The Names you show are thus:

"Harry" - A common english male name. The word means to harass, pester.

"Potter" - One who creates pottery and shapes clay (I don't really know what you were about with the other family names though).

"Boy-who-lived" - One who lived against something that always causes death.

"Unwitting Master of the Elder Wand" - One who masters the unbeatable wand without knowing it.

"Draco" - Latin for Dragon.

"Malfoy" - As you said, French for "Bad Faith".

You've excluded Master of Death shenanigans and Boy who Lived shenanigans, what remains?

Harry is "granted a title, a name". What name? What do you mean? There is nothing staring me in the face. The rest of it is just a descriptive sentence that alludes to nothing but what literally happens. Do you want me to put together the names into a chimera?

** I don't think true names are supposed to apply for characters though, especially not in that way. The way you described makes it seem like everyone is submit to the whims of fate and none of their actions matter because of their titles.

That is also a contradiction in itself since titles can be lost or gained and if for example malfoy's always act in bad faith than there's no true gaining or losing of titles but rather just fate acting it's course. That's like the writer making it so none of the character actions matter due to fate.

And names holding power as they are seem stupid, it is better to tie them to actions because motives and circumstances matter. Blood forcefully taken from a foe, willing sacrifice from a servant.

I believe a better system is for names to not mean anything normally but tie true names to destiny to fate in rare circumstances as prerequisites.

For example as long as this realities Voldemort believes in prophecy and that his power must prove supreme and Severus Snape only will get to hear a partial prophecy, than as the prophecy is announced by trelawny, fate is fixed because as long as the factors are such because Voldemort has already been set and due to his actions from the time he was Tom riddle, due to knowing the partial prophecy his character will always choose to act in a manner to launch an attack on the chosen one. That is fate but linked to free will as a requirement as it is due to willing actions that a fated event comes into existence.

For example as long as Merlin in the TV series is born with great power, he will be granted the title Emrys. Due to being born with great power, he will lack control and because of the willing actions of his mother, will always be sent to Camelot to learn from his ex sorcerer uncle Gaius to learn to control his magic. Due to Emrys being in Camelot, he will always protect Arthur with his free will because thats the person he is. As such, as long as king Arthur is under the protection of Emrys, the most powerful sorcerer, any variation of the legends of Merlin will occur because foes will always rise to combat the great defender. This is another fated event but linked to a titled Magical true name (Emrys) linked to destiny. Don't apply it to characters as a fate that is fixed and actions don't matter but rather more like destiny and that the name is gained through actions.

Destiny is something that one must work towards but can be defied. Draco malfoy's destiny is to be a typical malfoy, he is destined to be like a malfoy but he has to work to reach that destiny, it is his actions that make him one, each and every choice he makes. Choices that can be changed in different realities. Free will and willing actions are important to a story making a name true for everyone from birth just seems arbitrary. Tie it to actions, fate, destiny, titles, things that can be gained or lost, through willing actions of every character, a cascading butterfly effect in a story.

The power of the name is through willing and great actions, righteous great or terrible great. As long as they impact great amounts of people to belief and actualize the power of a name.

*** Might be more accurate to say that the characters gain a tendency to act in the way their name suggests or an affinity for a specific type of magic etc. Free will would still be a thing, I'd say - but knowing someones True Name might grant you a certain amount of power over them, though probably not complete control. A Malfoy would probably be more inclined to take profit over friendship based on the influence of the Malfoy name, but could consciously choose not to - it's akin to having a desire and not acting on it, I'd say - can be easy, can be hard but is ultimately doable

One of the reasons MoD would be a powerful title would be that it's known throughout the wizarding world as a legend - thus the Name to Title to Legend bit was formed and dammit, I love the idea of True Names in fiction, it makes an arbitrary kind of sense for a magic system. Or a religious system. Or pretty much any system that deals with the supernatural

** Oh Harry is the master of death. He already has the cloak. He has the stone. He's a Potter from Pervrells And he gets the Wand. Why is that dark?

*** He's still a horcrux. It's all about time and place with this prompt. Harry gains the Title of MoD before his death, the wording of the last paragraph is important - he is hit by the killing curse, so it strikes true, but it fails so it kills nothing.

It's dark when you think of the consequences of this event - Harry is still a horcrux and cannot die, Voldemort is still alive and cannot die. In canon, the war ended because Voldemort died, but here he's still around and still has at least one horcrux by the end of the day.

It is not dark because of what happens in the prompt, but the logical consequences of those events makes it dark.

Though TBH we might have different opinions on what makes a fic Dark, that might be a decent discussion to have...

**** My question in this is why are we assuming that Voldemort doesn't die (or at least go back to 'spirit form'). There are two examples in canon of the killing curse not being able to kill someone and rebounding on the caster, so to me, it seems likely that the same would occur.

We know that Voldemort took 10 years to recover from the first killing curse that he took, so it's safe to assume that a similar time frame is needed once again. And we know that he would have a hard time finding a way to return to his body, as the ritual he used in canon required a bone of the father, and Harry knows where Voldemort's father is buried and can easily destroy the remains.

And this isn't even taking into account the amount of preparation that could be done in the meantime, namely giving the dementor's kiss to all of the Death Eaters so that Voldemort would have a hard time gaining followers even if he managed to come back.

And even if Voldemort survived, the way you've set out this scenario means that Harry literally cannot be defeated. Anything that would kill him would fail. So defeating Voldemort would just come down to a series of suicide runs, where Harry could cast an extremely damaging spell (Fiendfyre for example) and hope it killed Voldemort. If it doesn't, who cares, just try again next time.

***** The difference in circumstance for the immunity - the first was the sacrifice Lily Potter did for the sake of her child, probably causing the curse to rebound. The second is a person simply being UNABLE to die. And let's be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that Voldemort was using the Elder Wand during the fight for Hogwarts, Harry would have lost. Badly.

****** Fair enough, I suppose with the prompt being AU I can't really say that the killing curse would act in the same way. Though I would still maintain that since Harry literally cannot die in this scenario, and the fact there is evidence of Voldemort at least being vanquished, Voldemort losing is the only scenario I can personally see.

******* Being unkillable doesn't mean you can't be captured, though - I'd imagine that the title doesn't come with the know-how for using it, but would boost magical power and grant some not-so-normal benefits as well, like the immortality. So while they would now be in a - theoretically eternal - stalemate, my guess would be that Voldemort would capture Harry, lock him away and go on to killing pretty much every character we know and love. Might give some time for a breather for everyone in the castle, but calm before the storm and all that

There exist some similarities, even if the Fic is ostensibly about something else.
