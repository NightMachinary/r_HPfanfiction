They freak out and cast a spell in front of the crowd.


** Or does a trick that the auror can't figure out so it must be magic and calls in the obliviators and casting spells to make everyone stay, but fucks it up and everyone just thinks it's part of the show. The auror gets more and more panicked and keep casting more and more noticeable spells.

** Yeah, I really can't see an auror flipping out and throwing curses all over the place in this situation.

1. Unless you're extremely hearing impaired it's pretty impossible to mistake abra cadabra for a avada kedavra, so they'd know the curse was "mispronounced." the most they would do is privately lecture the person about not casting killing curses into crowds.

2. Even that's unlikely because the audience being amused rather than terrified would give the auror a heads up that it was muggle entertainment.

Fudge or Arthur weasley might make a mistake like this, not that they're stupid or anything, just that being less trained for this sort of situation might lead to the panicky kind of reaction you're suggesting.

Edit: also it occurs to me that the crowd is likely to mostly believe it's all part of the act unless a spell hits a member of the crowd. Stage magicians can pull off some pretty impressive tricks.

*** Voldemort has ruined the chances of enough actually good aurors because of the curse on the dada teaching job. Of course, if you study hard enough, you can still do it and be good, but bad teachers can stop interest as well as knowledge in a subject.

****** yeah the aurors are the elite,

got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great... Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking." ---Nymphadora Tonks regarding Auror training

You having special auror training, then a mentorship with a fellow auror Tonks mentored with Moody though the mentorship might have just been moody taking a new auror under his wing and not something thats built in
