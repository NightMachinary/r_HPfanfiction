So I think I was looking for either book 4, 5, or 6. I can't remember much of the book except it was long and very chinese. It wasn't the emerald dragon one I see on here though.

Anyone know what else it might have been? What other books were put in place?

This isn't much to go on but I figure might as well ask.
