*** Who doesn't secretly love Muslim genocide and comparing them to Nazis?

Honestly I'm not one to hold back when criticising Islam (the religion, not the people), but that is a bit much isn't it?

**** You're talking about a fic where Harry's personality manifests itself as a garden in Wonderland that Luna/Hermione have to physically prune to fix him, and the part that stuck out enough for you to bring up was criticism of Islam?

It's a guilty pleasure because that entire fic is insane.

***** Of course it's insane, but the author makes it very clear that those parts represent his honest political beliefs. I'm pretty sure it's not a parody.

Sorry if I came across as too judgemental, no-one can take your enjoyment away of such a story, but I think it's fair that I might assume you could be sympathetic towards the messages. If you think it's endearing because of it's ridiculousness all the better.

You think the message behind Partially Kissed Hero is Islamophobia? Wait, sorry. You think there's a message behind Partially Kissed Hero? It's obviously the author's Gary Stu wish fulfillment.

I think you might be projecting stuff that isn't there. How do YOU feel about Muslims?

******* From the Author Notes of Chapter 99 from Partially Kissed Hero (sorry everyone for reposting this shit):

#+begin_quote
  Now, I still have people complaining about my treatment of Islam. Again, that subject is so vast that it could easily equal the rest of the volume of this story if I were to post my evidence, and still they would not agree.

  So I'll just point out that Muslims have a great deal in common with Nazism, including the fact that, prior to WWII, the press in the Western world LOVED the Nazis and did everything in their power to aggrandize them!

  But they have the same declared goals of conquering the world and extermination of the Jews.

  Now, a great many will immediately protest that not all Muslims are like that. I will reply by saying I just read a very moving article by a German survivor of WWII who earnestly and sincerely pled that not all Nazis were like that. In fact that the real hate-mongers were a tiny percent of the population.

  You know what? In this man's own words, in spite of being the vast majority, the moderates didn't matter. They kept their heads down, didn't make waves, and let the radicals select the course of their nation.

  And he sees the same thing going on now in Islam.

  Would now be a bad time to bring up the historical FACT that Adolph Hitler and the Muslims got along great together? Or that both sides admitted they had a common cause? Or about the addition to Hitler's army, a full division of Muslim volunteers organized by his close friend and associate, the grand mufti of Jerusalem?

[it goes on longer but I think this is enough]

If that isn't racist rhetoric then I don't know what is.

#+end_quote

Nah don't worry about me. I have some opinions on Islam (similar to those on Christianity), but my personal politics are certainly quite far removed from those of the author.

******** The author is a well known online crazy person, but I didn't know that when I read it the first time. I don't even remember the anti-muslim stuff being there. Probably because I'm an atheist. All religions are equally as silly to me.

********* I didn't even get that far into the story when I first read it. I jumped ship much earlier because of all the crazy stuff.

I agree on the all religions are silly part, but there are some dangerous messages in that story, implying genocide is acceptable. I'd rather not have someone read that without reflection. I'm a firm believer that books aren't dangerous - at least if you have the right media competency.

(In that A/N I posted he even makes it sound as if genociding the German people during WW2 would have been acceptable... seriously messed up. That's just as racist as killing all the muslims.)

Meh, I was a depressed teenager once too. I can understand where that came from. I read it for the lulz anyways.
