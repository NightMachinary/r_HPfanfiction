** I definitely wish talented people would pick up all those stories I don't feel up to writing. I'd say go for it; perhaps ask to beta-read their chapters, have a sort of consulting position over it, if you like?

A thing you should keep in mind is that this reader is doing you a bloody nice favor asking you in the first place. He has just as much right to write a fanfic of your story as you had a right to write your story in the first place, and we didn't see you addressing personal messages to Rowling.

** Fanfic authors write continuations of harry potter books. I don't see why another fanfic author can't do the same for a fanfic authored story. Otherwise it'd just be major hypocrite status going on.

*** I personally don't mind if this person wants to use it as a source of inspiration. It's more flattering than anything else. It's just the underlying thought that my fic - of which I'm rather proud of - may be turned into something that isn't...as good :/ either way, I sent this person a message stating that I'm perfectly okay with it and hope they'll acknowledge me in the first chapter.

**** I'm sure JK Rowling is proud of her work too. And probably sometimes also gets bothered by the thought that her work is being turned into crap too. Like all those bullshit misogynistic harem fics, or fake BDSM rape fics, or Nazi/Anne frank relationships, or torture porn crap, or underage rape presented as a healthy consensual thing.
