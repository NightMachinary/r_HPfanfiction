  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** Weeeell it's a gender bender and the relationship is very very slowly developing but linkffn(11653847) is decent.

Hasn't updated in a while though, i'm not sure it's worth reading if you just want the relationship since that hasn't really happened yet.

*** Even though it's unfinished and the relationship bits haven't started, I'd still recommend they read it.

Fem!Harry femslashes are relatively rare, especially with such niche pairings, and in my opinion this one is extremely well written and enjoyable-- the relationship has a nice buildup going for it even if it isn't there yet.

*** I love this story, even though it turned out to be one of those things with a fake ending. Marked complete, but the ending felt like it was abrupt and a lot of things carried over.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

*** I was having a rather enjoyable time reading that until

"a liger with wings and basilisk fangs"

I just couldn't continue...

EDIT: Sigh wrong story - I messed up, carry on.

**** Funny; I don't remember writing anything like that... but many have suspected that interesting pharmaceuticals were involved during the publishing process, and I've never been able to prove otherwise.

***** I paraphrased a rather good few descriptive lines that described the animal in a way that would highlight how I read it in my head.

Alas I do forget that there is an author behind the story who reads Reddit and I want to make myself clear - I really enjoyed your story and thank you for writing it. There just isn't enough Tonks in the Fandom and I enjoyed your take on her.

Fanfiction has a whole has got me through some rough times these last couple of years and I'm indebted to the authors that spend their time writing stories for free that I can read. Due to that I get rather mad when I see negative comments being fired at authors and yet in the attempt to be witty I've done the same no matter the lack of intent.

My apologies.

EDIT: That horrible moment when you also realise that it wasn't even this story, I seem to have messed up on so many levels here...
