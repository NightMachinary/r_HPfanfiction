I asked this on Tumblr last night(12/21/2020) and creeped some people out, but also got some very confused answers. So I bring the question to Reddit. If you can, please explain your thoughts. This is just for discussion and no idea/belief is wrong.

EDIT(12/22/2020): A lot of people are curious as to what prompted such... thoughts.

It was late at night and I was thinking about the idea of being an Animagus. What would I want to be? To determine this, I had to decide what I didn't want first in order to narrow it down. So, nothing conspicuous because I don't want attention. I'm not that kind of person. Then, nothing that can be considered useful on the Black Market. No thanks. And then nothing that can be considered livestock anywhere in the world. I don't want to be confused for food.

So then my mind decided to list animals usually considered to be worth eating, certain birds, fish, deer, etc... which narrowed things down a lot tbh. When Animagus and Deer are in my mind at the same time, James Potter comes to mind obviously.

With that fresh in mind, I was like, man, imagine he was out there effin around in his deer form for some laughs, and he gets shot by a hunter. Bullets/Arrows, whatever it was, he is now deceased and never saw it coming. His carcass is being dragged across the forest now.

And I was thinking about how unlucky that is. He'll either get stuffed or be eaten. So in my mind, this justified why being a deer was NOT a useful Animagus form. It took about a minute before my mind came back to the 'be eaten' bit. Which is how the main question of this post came to be.

It took less than 3 minutes to get from start to finish tbh.


** It depends. There are some theories that if an Animagus dies in there animal form they transform back into there human form. So I think it would depend on that. And if it was a known Animagus or not.

So they take the cuts they want and leave the deer on the forest ground. Later he transforms but the hunter remains non the wiser that he ate fake deer.

***** Would it though? I mean, it's no longer connected to his magic. Who's to say that the transformation isn't just temporary, and it takes a conscious effort to switch between?

Sirius spent weeks to months in his dog form to conserve energy in 3rd year (I'm pretty sure, but don't @ me if I'm wrong), as well as years in a prison with dementors to keep his sanity, which means it's more than just a /human/ brain in a /human/ body that is /shaped like an animal's body./ The process of becoming an animagus does seem to be carefully monitored because of the dangers (and probably also the possibility of it going wrong and someone gets stuck).

If it were just a temporary body transformation that could be reversed later, then it'd be like Krum's shark-head transformation: easy to undo, and you could choose any animal to do it with, */choose/* and */any/* being the key words there. The fact that canonically, it seems like people only get one animagus form ties it closer to the soul, with magic making it possible to change the body to match the nature of said soul.

To kinda go deep with it without really going into it, it's the unchanging permanence of the physical body conflicting with the fluidity of the soul and its susceptibility to change. The only reason they're able to transform their body at all is because of magic bridging the gap.

Sirius did mention how the dementors didn't affect him as strongly in his dog form, hence why he stayed in it during his imprisonment. The body---and therefore the brain---itself is different, animalistic.

So if an animagus died in their animal form, I don't think they'd change back. They're in their most basic, soul-defined form. It'd take conscious thought and exertion of will to change back. Dead people don't have that.

*** This is a really interesting point. At first when I read it I thought "na, no way, it doesn't matter if it's intent or not, you're still eating a human therefore committing cannibalism."

Then I thought about it a bit and it reminded me of some urban legends I've heard about cannibals, mainly one story about a guy who cut up his victims and made soups and BBQs with them and would feed his community/neighborhood.

When he got caught he was the only charged cannibal in this and everyone else was treated as a victim. Even though they took part in the consumption of a human body they had zero awareness of it and no intention and were therefore not considered cannibals.

It's kind of crazy but I think you're 100% right when it comes to intent. Cannibalism isn't like killing someone where one can still go away for manslaughter when there was no intent. I think there has to be intent for someone to be a cannibal.

  If you fall pregnant whilst under the effects of the polyjuice potion, can you actually carry the baby to term? What happens if you're normally a man?
#+end_quote

Shit, that's interesting. So if I recall correctly, pollyjuice potion not only makes you look like someone but completely transforms you into the person, internal organs and all. So if our subject is pollyjuiced into a fertile woman, obviously the conception itself should be possible. Here I begin to wonder whether the expiration of the potion reverts the consumer to the pre-pollyjuice state or transforms them into the person they are, with added effects of time and whatever may have affected them while pollyjuiced, like an injury or pregnancy. Former would leave us pregnancy-free. The latter, in theory, could have the fertilised egg remain in the uterus, given that our subject has one in their original body and the embryo survives the stress of its surroundings transforming.

So our female subjects is now basically a surrogate mother! Or is she? I'd assume the genetic material would belong to the person she'd pollyjuiced into. Assuming the baby, biologically speaking, belongs to the person they're imitating, we are left with some interesting implications of Pollyjuice misuse (as if any use of it wasn't morally ambiguous at best already...)

As for a male-to-female pollyjuicing, I'd say either the embryo would get stuck somewhere in the organism (I won't even begin to speculate what that would imply for our subject, medically speaking.) or his magic would magically magic it away.

#+end_quote

Assuming they can get pregnant, in order for them to carry the child to term, I think it would /need/ to transform in utero. Seeing as werewolves aren't above maiming themselves if lacking prey to hunt + have a taste for human flesh + have excellent sense of smell, I think a werewolf with a human baby in its belly would sooner claw its own gut out to get to the baby then ignore it. If the baby is also a little werewolf, then she-wolf might have the expected mother instincts to keep it safe.

Or the fetus could just not survive the transformation, which I think may be more likely.

#+end_quote

Love it when fanfics explore this! As for the canon, I'd assume JKR meant for vampirism to be akin to lycanthropy in that it is un undesirable condition. I imagine she didn't/wouldn't ascribe them special abilities. Feeds on blood, can't be exposed to daylight, the like. Immortal but unable to /live/ kind of thing. (Why didn't Voldie just become a vampire? Would he lose magical power? Or is it just bigotry?)

#+begin_quote
  If you raise an inferius for the purpose of manual labour, could that be considered slavery?
#+end_quote

I'd need a refresher on the inferi. I wouldn't be hard-pressed to call it slavery if they have no will to begin with ㅡ They are created in a way where they can only act upon the will of their creator, if memory serves. Of course that isn't to say that raising an inferius for manual labour in itself isn't unethical, but I'd say a ^{soft} no for the slavery label.

#+begin_quote

Both? Sexual slavery. (And some emotional rape, if that could be a thing.)

#+begin_quote
  With potions capable of imposing emotions on their imbibers existing, what happens to someone drugging themselves to be able to cast the Avada Kedavra at will? Are they turning themselves into a Berserker or a sociopath?

Berserker would imply that not only they cast it at will, but that they cast it furiously and indiscriminately, no? Casting "at will" should still leave you with control to cast only at whom and when you wish, not make you go on a green-lit killing frenzy. So I'll say b) sociopath.

#+begin_quote
  What substance would be considered a narcotic in the Wizarding World anyway?

Any potion with narcotic effects really, but probably without negative connotations. There doesn't seem to be many things you're /not/ allowed to do. Maybe because it's easier to reverse with magic an' all.

** If it's intentional on the part of the hunter, it's cannibalism. Type of meat aside, if you're eating deer flesh you know was a person, then you are still eating a person.

If, however, it was an unwitting yet tasty accident and the hunter has no idea, then it's not cannibalism.

The caveat to that one is that, should the meat revert to human flesh, then the person eating it has just performed accidental cannibalism and likely now has a cut up human corpse in their fridge.

Oh, and good luck explaining James Potter's head mounted on a wall buddy. You'll need it when Lily finds out.

Severus's new career as Park Ranger sure came with an unexpected early payoff alright. Pity that the dude who asked him for tips earlier turned out to be a cannibalistic killer, but Snape couldn't exactly fault him for his choice of target, though he did criticise the man's sense of taste.

*** Cannibalism only refers to species eating other members of that same species. So by the definition of cannibalism it wouldn't be. The fact that James is human most of the time is a technicality in his stag form, because his body, at that point in time, is entirely stag with a human mind controlling it. I think that would also entail a stag brain, reflexes, and unconscious urges.

So it probably isn't cannibalism unless his body somehow reverts back, which I highly doubt it would since magic is what allowed his body to change and magic is heavily dependent on exertion of will, not only to change things, but also to change them back.

But if those scientists making lab-grown meat decided to grow some human meat, eating it would still be cannibalism, even though it never belonged to a person.

Eating animagus meat is basically the same as eating a goblin pie: it's not cannibalism, but I also wouldn't exactly trust anyone who knowingly does it.

** Technically? No As far as I'm aware an animagus will stay an animagus as long as they don't transform. There is the spell, of course, but I doubt someone would use it on the meat. So, at the time it is eaten that piece of James Potter is a piece of venison that was butchered of a deer that happened to have James Potters consciousness. Of course, I mean if a another deer were to eat him, then yes. That would definitely be cannibalism.

MORALLY, though? Well it depends on intent. If it was a muggle hunter, then no, but like, if you were informed of the person that was a deer that you ate, then yes. Ignorance is bliss and all that.

Though this does remind me of a fanfic I read a while ago. It MOD Time-travel-fixit fic where every time Harry died he would revert back to his seventeen year old self when he walked into the forest, though that part isn't that important. The important hit is that whenever he dies, /whatever / state he was in, he will always reform. You can probably guess where this is going. I don't remember the name of the fic but it was described in detail. Every detail.

(basically he reformed in a guys stomach, if that needed clearing up)

** Wouldn't it be a little similar to eating transfigured flesh? In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/68543/chapters/90504][The Innocence of Wolves]], Lupin accidentally kills Snape in Hogwarts (i.e., James doesn't save Snape in time). The Marauders transfigure a bit of Snape and each eat some (so Mooney isn't the only cannibal). Even though the flesh is transfigured into cake, it's still cannibalism. I think the same principle applies here. Also, as others have said, intent and foreknowledge defines whether or not it's cannibalism.

** I guess it would depend on if animagus are made out of human meat or their animal form meat. And if they retain their animal shape after death. If he was made out of venison and not human meat and stayed in animal form after death I would say it wasnt cannibalism.

Now I would still classify it as murder and wrong if the person knew he was an animagus. And while not technically cannibalism I would say intent wise and legally it would be cannibalism. Because while not actually consuming human meat the person did consume the animal knowing it was actually a person.

***** But if I give you two unlabeled stag carcasses, can you pick out the one that used to be an animagus? If it's completely indistinguishable from venison, I'd argue that it's now venison, regardless of what it was before hunting season.

It's a bit like if you eat corn that grew over a site which is later found to have paleolithic bone fragments. Sure, some of the molecules involved used to belong to a different human, but that doesn't mean you're eating people meat. It's all corn now.

***** Not really a disguise if the physical transformation goes all the way. That's what an animagus transformation is. Everything but the soul changes into an animal that represents the nature of the soul.

The soul's what makes James the Stag technically human. If a dementor were to somehow suck out the soul of James Potter from his stag body /(something canon seemed to imply was highly unlikely if at all even possible, because dementors probably don't sense or care about souls in animals)/, what's left is just Mr Brain-Dead Stag. There's no James anymore.

Similarly, if you shoot James the Stag in the head, he's not James the Stag anymore. His soul's gone, he's not alive enough to be sapient. He's just Dead-Stag-That's-Now-Dinner.

The issue I think you're having with this is that implicitly, you have to kill James the Stag in order to eat Dead Stag's venison /(because it is venison at that point, there's no life in that carcass, and any sign of James's soul being in there left the moment he died)/. It becomes a moral issue about murder, and that's an entirely different debate.

**** It isn't necessarily stated either way in canon. Alchemy is a transformation magic that is permanent and actually changes something from one thing to another. But transfiguration only changes what something looks like. It stands to reason that it's not permanent.

I'd also like to reference Gamp's law from the books. There was a reason they couldn't just transfigure rocks into chickens, kill them, and eat them. "Food is the first of five Principle Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration." That said, he can't become food of a different kind for someone else because not all of him is edible and able to just be made into food. Especially if his magic is what was sustaining the stag form.

****** Based on what was written, yes. We don't know for sure about these things since it's an unreliable narrator in Harry's perspective. But J.K. Rowling didn't just come up with all these terms. She based it off of a lot of pre-existing lore (such as the philosopher's stone) and whatnot. To transfigure (the actual word), means to transform into something more beautiful or elevated. That's fairly superficial, pointing towards it being only in looks like I stated previously. To transmute (the act of performing alchemy), means to change the substance or nature of something. That points towards it being deeper and more substantial than that of transfiguration. These words exist outside of Harry Potter and there's only so much that can be changed about their meaning before one would have to use a different word.
