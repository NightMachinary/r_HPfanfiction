I hadn't really considered it before, but nobody knows what Hermione's wand is made of.

"Vine" is not a wood, unless there's such a thing as a vine tree that I'm not aware of.

Ivy, grape, clematis, morning glory, kudzu, honeysuckle, cucumber, some beans, and even poison ivy are all vines.


** After a Google search I found various woods called "vine wood" intended to be put in terrariums or pet cages, though I'm not sure specifically what wood they are. Maybe it doesn't refer to a specific wood, but just any wood considered a vine - they might have similar or the same magical properties. Or JK Rowling just didn't think of that which is more than likely.

*** That's my point: saying she has a vine wand is like saying everybody else's wands are made of tree.

**** Maybe to wizards they just consider all vine wood the same wood. I don't know. It really is a bit weird though

That pretty much sums up most of fandom's issues.

**** I suppose at least it makes for interesting opportunities for fanfaction to fix and explore these ideas (at least, the larger ones)

** When English Ivy, or 'Vine' as its called in the potter verse, gets old and big enough the main trail gets very thick. It's this thick woody bit that I always thought the wand was made of.

** Nobody said it's a wood, it's just a vine wrapping around it's length

**** You do realise that the answer to your question is in the wiki page?

"The druids considered anything with a woody stem as a tree; this, combined with the fact that vine is thought to produce wands of a special nature, means that whilst vines are not actually trees they continue to be used in the production of wands to this day (at least, by Ollivanders)."

***** My point is that "vine" is not specific. That quote doesn't address that at all. "Anything with a woody stem" doesn't clear anything up as far as WHAT, exactly, her wand is made of.
