He's a double agent, like Snape.

After the end of year one, Ron the great strategist, makes a long term plan. He'll do all those crappy things in Ron!bashing stories, but it's all an act. To make people believe he's having a falling out with Harry and going dark. He's just doing that to get close to Voldemort's inner circle and get the needed information to defeat him. The best way to do that is to make Voldemort and everyone believe that he hates Harry's guts.

Even better if literally no one knows about this. Not Dumbledore, not Hermione, not his family. Only Harry's sees through his act(you know, 'Best Mates' and all).

***** Kim Possible is the perfect example of *end the series when people would say 'Oh I wish it had gone on longer' instead of 'Yeah it's about time they finished it'*. I was so surprised that the final season was made in response to massive fan requests because nothing in that season felt out of place like an after thought. Seamless, through and through.

**** why /s? It *is* way easier to do so, but not because his chararacter is /actually/ predisposed to those things, but because that path has already been trodden very, very often, and writers who bash characters aren't the most creative bunch.

Think about it - if you wanted to bash Ron, you can look back at thousands of stories that do so, and just copy their plot points (such as 'he's a glutton', 'he's holding them back', 'he doesn't have any emotional intelligence', 'he's stupid', etc). Meanwhile, if you wanted to write a competent Ron, then you'll have to be creative and use your own imagination.

I mean, I certainly don't know any stories that make him a competent character off the top of my head, but I could name like 5 off-hand that include the classic formula for Ron-Bashing.

** I guess my question is, why would this be what an eleven year old who doesn't actually know all that much about Voldemort comes up with? Especially since they've only been friends for less than a year?

Better suggestion, this takes place in 4th year. Harry's name comes out of the goblet and Ron connects the dots between this and and the events of third year. He thinks fast and realizes that a spy must be at the school, except there's no way to know who it is, what with magic being magic. So he distances himself from Harry, who he loves like a brother by this point, and gets to work. It doesn't work out as planned and while he does get close, he doesn't find out what's happening until it all comes out at the end of the year. He's kept his cover and only Harry knows it's all a ruse, so he decides to keep going. Fourth year has taught him the benefits of working undercover. So when Percy starts getting ahead in the ministry in year five, Ron writes to him for advice on how to succeed at the ministry, since Percy is â€˜obviously the most talented and intelligent of all the Weasleys'. Percy eats it up and through him, Ron meets others who will go on to join Voldemort when he regains full power. He maintains a pseudo-friendship with Harry to convince Voldemort's people that he has an in but makes it clear that he doesn't care for Harry. By the time seventh year rolls around, Ron has convinced everyone but Harry that he is prepared to go against The Order. He stayed behind at school and has weaseled (if you'll pardon the pun) his way into the Carrow's good graces. He collects intel and sends it anonymously to The Order via the confundus charm like Snape did with Mundungus. All the while he is threatened by his former friends who believe he has betrayed them and by Voldemort's true supporters who either don't trust him or don't like him because of his family's history. But as dangerous as it might be, he knows it has to be this way, because he can't let anything slip. His family remains alive and well only because everyone is convinced Ron will sign up with the death eaters when he graduates. If there is ever any doubt of this, then it will all have been for naught. When Harry comes back for the diadem, Ron realizes they're in the end game, and is relieved to finally let down his facade in greeting his friend with a hug. Together they destroy the last of the Horcruxes. Harry destroys the Diadem while Ron holds off Malfoy and Ron goes on to pull the sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting hat, with which he will slay Nagini. In the end, Voldemort lies defeated, one dead body amongst dozens.

Though Ron and Harry are back together, almost like nothing ever happened, things don't go back to normal. There have been too many lies told over too many years. The Weasley clan has been too badly hurt. It will be years before they can form a new bond of trust, and it will be fragile when it comes. But for now, it doesn't matter. They've won and they're alive. There will be time for all the rest.

** I'm sure I've read a fic similar to this, I think it might have been in Rorschach Blots Odd Ideas anthology. Ron, Harry, and Hermione are hyper-competent and Ron does his whole "jealous of his best mate" routine in year 4 to try and get intel from the people planning on murdering Harry. It was only one chapter if I remember rightly, and knowing Blot it's bound to be full of other plot points too, but if I find it I'll update.
