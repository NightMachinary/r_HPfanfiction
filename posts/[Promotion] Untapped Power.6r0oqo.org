I've just started writing my first true fan fiction and would love you all to check it out. I'm trying to update it at least every other day if not daily.

Summary: Set mid-OotP, Harry finds a ray of hope in vanquishing the Dark Lord. He and his friends set out to meet with a mysterious man promising to make them more powerful than any wizard alive.

Thanks so much!

** It was alright.

Your grammar is near perfect, but your plot wasn't able to take me in.

**** The concept of the story itself - and the resultant plot, simply didn't grab my interest. It was neither unique, nor a captivating and engaging spin on an old concept.

Perhaps it could be your style of writing, or my lack of taste in stories with similar plots. However, the story is only 3k words at the moment. Many stories have started out bad(sometimes the first couple tens of thousands of words) but end up quite engaging for in the end.

Somebody else's mileage may vary, of course.

***** Still pretty new to the fan fiction game to know what's been done so much, and I've obviously got a lot to learn. Thank you, again, for letting me know what you think!

** I'd have to agree with EpsilonDenarius' assessment. Grammar is fine, but the story didn't really engage me. I think the pacing was off. On a formatting note, try combining those three chapters into one longer chapter with some scene breaks. That might help a bit. A chapter should generally consist of multiple scenes working together to create a short self-contained plot arc. What you've got so far are essentially three separate scenes that flow into each other and create such an arc, in this case 'beginning the quest.' Think of a chapter as like an episode of a TV show.

*** Thank you so much for the feedback!

I agree with a lot of what you said, and I hope to improve it in the coming chapters.

** The technicals are good, but thematically, it just felt unoriginal, for all the lofty language.

Basically, when you wrote "make /them/ more powerful" and had the whole trio set out on the journey, you gave the impression that all three of them are getting the power-up. /That/ you don't see done very often, and it creates some interesting possibilities. [1]

Instead, the only reason for Ron and Hermione to even be there was to witness Harry get singled out and be made Very Powerful, like a thousand other fics where Harry and only Harry gets an arbitrary, unearned power-up that no one else has access to. That's disappointing. I can see why it didn't grab the other commentators either.

--------------

[1] Some interesting plot possibilities of the Powerful!Trio:

1. Consider that each of the trio ultimately wants something different out of life. Harry wants a family and a normal life; Hermione wants to make the world a better place, whether the world wants it or not; and Ron wants to be respected and admired for himself and not be in anybody's shadow. When the power-up makes it so that the only thing that can stop one of them from doing what they want is the other two working together, how will their relationships shape the world?

2. If the power-up worked for three people, there is no fundamental reason it can't work for more. Do they share its secret and usher in a new age of greater magic, but potential for greater evil and greater destruction? Do they try to control access, only letting their friends in on it? How do they know whom to trust? Do they try to lock it away, so that no one else can have the power? Which option will each of the trio advocate?

*** Thank you for the writeup! I was working on chapter 6 but ultimately abandoned it. The chapter switched perspectives back to Ron and Hermione and covered their pov. I had planned for Hermione to read about a hidden use of dragon's blood, and they would use it to become more powerful. The three would team up short term with internal conflict controlling more of the plot later.

**** Thanks for the reply. That the rest of the trio gets a power-up is good, though thematically, I would suggest either giving all three of them the same kind of power-up or giving each of them a different, but equally effective, power-up.

As it is, it sounds --- though, of course, only you know --- that Harry is singled out for the Extra Special Power-Up of Destiny, while Hermione and Ron have to settle for something that anyone with access to a dragon could do and doesn't come with cosmic wisdom or whatever it is that Harry gets. Basically, all three of them go on the journey, but only one of them gets the benefit. It feels unbalanced.

More generally, I don't know whether you intended this, but the fic seems to be subtly elevating even the pre-powerup Harry while putting down his friends. For example, Ron is constantly shown as food-obsessed. Hermione is shown to have poor judgment (with lines like "Hermione added as if it starkly put the teacher into an unfavorable group that you certainly did not accept food from."), and even that's done a bit ineptly. (For example, why did she just whisper to them, rather than, say, get up, have her wand ready, and actually /ask/ the man if he had given Harry the seizure.) Harry, meanwhile, is having uncharacteristic, forward-looking, philosophical thoughts like "end of the tunnel only meant the start of their true journey" and how his spells "moved just too fast" --- that Snape could block Harry spells at the end of HBP before he even finished casting them notwithstanding.
