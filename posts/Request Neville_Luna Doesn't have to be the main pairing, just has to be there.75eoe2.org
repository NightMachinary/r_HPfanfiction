I love Neville/Luna, when I first started reading fanfiction years ago I got into Harry/Luna, but then ended up reading a fic ages ago that had Neville/Luna as the pairing and ended up loving it.

They're both outcast in different ways, and they're some of my favorite characters in the series as a whole.

I could just really see them together so I was rather upset when Rowling had Luna marry Rolf Scamander and Neville married Hannah Abbott.

So I'm looking for any well written and believable portrayals of Neville and Luna together, note they do not have to be the main characters, they can be secondary/minor characters in the story I just want to see them together in the story as friends and romantically.

For any other pairings am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione just because I don't like them together, but if it's believable enough I'll allow it.

Would rather not have character bashing, I tend to dislike character bashing.

Would rather not have stories where Harry is insanely smart or insanely powerful. A little bit more powerful or smart then he was in canon is okay, just don't have it be a lot.

Would rather it be completed.

Anyone can be the main character, just as long as Neville and Luna are together.

Can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible or anywhere in between.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1019294/chapters/2027039][Emancipation]] linkao3(Emancipation) by Badgirlgoesworse has Luna and Neville as a pairing. They are tertiary characters, but they do have their own scenes.

Harry 'wakes up' to evil!Dumbledore's plotting after Sirius dies, and becomes the 'Lord of Dawn and Dusk'.

Explicit sex scenes. I don't recall one being Neville/Luna but it's possible.
