** Check out D&D for some great horrors. I particularly recommend the Aberration and Abomination categories of creatures.

The Worm That Walks could be interesting, if you pulled a Rowling and turned them unintelligent (a la her Dragons). Imagine a quadrupedal dog-like thing made of swarming maggots.

Ahuiotzls and Flumphs are also fun.

**** Glad I could help. If there's one thing Tabletop Roleplaying Nerds are unequivocally good at, it's coming up with fun monster-things to toss in to various situations. :)

** Don't even. He has them learn crup obedience training (the fourth years hand raise puppies, teach them to be calm and good so they get certified to be therapy crups for the Janice Thickly Ward), how to groom and pamper knezeles (the fifth years spend the year raising the kittens who go to be adopted and help squibs), the 7th years have a joint herbology project to create a garden plan that helps pixies, bowtruckles, and gnomes. Everything his benign and banal. Unicorns, bumblebees, and little fish that glow in the dark.

His students see all that is fragile, fair, and friendly.

They are then taught about how muggles test chemicals and drugs on the helpless animals. How they use vivisection to study. How monstrous those beasts are to the world.

Voldemort doesn't even have to ask them to take the mark.

**** If your Barty went through anything close to what the canon/typical fanon Barty did, I'd definitely agree with you. A guy who's basically been mentally tortured in his dad's cellar for a decade isn't going to be in the sort of place you'd need to be to show sunshine and puppies and such.

***** Everything that happened to him in canon is the same, he'd just the creatures teacher since Remus didn't have his secret revealed in my fic

****** Fair. Yeah, I'd definitely say no sunshine and puppies, if I were writing your fic.

Also, I love how the most upvoted answer on this entire thread is the answer least relevant to your actual question. Ah, Reddit. :D
