Additional fandoms optional but I'd like if it's said how much you need to know about the other fandoms. Prefer NewWho Doctors


** Linkffn(Count To Four) is pretty good, featuring Harry as the Master! It's on ao3 as well, and the sequel is up there, but I believe it had a different name for whatever reason.

Also, Linkffn(The Boy Who Waited) is good, if you're okay with slash and Harry/Doctor as the pairing.

I can probably find more, I had a bunch of them bookmarked.

  Harry always knew he was different, he just had to count to four to prove it. [Part 1 of The Master (of Death)]

*** Brilliant! I hope you can find more, or the story on AO3! The Doctor and any human mortal is a bit.. weird, but I can deal if HP is, say, immortal or .. well, probably as long as he isn't a kid I think.

EDIT: why the HELL would the Doctor fall in love with a twelve years old?! He agonized about girls twice Harry's age because of the age difference! He'd never fall for a twelve year old.

That said, it's... not as squicky as I feared, although I think the Doctor isn't the marrying type, and I might end up liking it after a reread. Whatever the result, I want to thank you for sharing! Pls don't interpret my reactions as a necessary bad thing

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** One very good one (at least to me) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/424901]] by blackcatkuroi - it hasn't been updated in a long while but it is incredible and was one of the first fics I reread several times - you don't really need to know anything about either fandom and it's mainly 10th doctor with Rose and Jack Harkness joining later.

** Visited by a Doctor by Tangerine-Alert is probably my favourite, it has both Classic and New Who elements in it, but more New Who than Classic
