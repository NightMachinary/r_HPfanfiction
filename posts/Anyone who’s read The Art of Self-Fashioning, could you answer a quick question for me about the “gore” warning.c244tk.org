*** I'll give it a chance. From what others are saying it seems that most of this gore comes from Harry doing it to himself so I can handle that a little better.

**** Some people do die in relatively graphic ways, just fyi, but it's not drawn out descriptively if I recall correctly.

** It's not /too/ gorey, but there's still a little gore involved. Harry's constantly experimenting on himself, there's a little bit of torture, but nothing like the extremes you've described.

** I stopped reading that one. The author has good ideas but most of the works I can't take. Something about the writing?

From what I remember, Harry self-transfigures himself and it fucks up his brain chemistry? I stopped reading around the time Regulus showed up.

**** Admittedly I think I read somewhat past Regulus' first appearance. I don't remember exactly, but I stopped reading sometime after his kangaroo leg fight with (Remus?). If that was the prologue, it was too long.

​

I just don't like Lomonaaeren. I got through World in Pieces, which I thought was decent if occasionally slow and clunky, but I thought Art of Self-Fashioning took too long to stop being annoying and pointless.

*** For me I find that all that author's works are about 50% longer than they should be, and tend to really drag in the middle.

** Harry mostly uses combat transfiguration so there's lots of people getting maimed by claws or wolves or stuff. It's not too gorey.

*** So it's nothing like causing someone's skeleton to explode out of their body in a shower of blood and meat, right?

** Mostly just losing fingers and limbs

The only bad part was a brief description of some guy screaming as transfigured bugs killed him
