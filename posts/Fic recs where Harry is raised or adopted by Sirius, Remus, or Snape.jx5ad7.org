Preferably looking for long fics, but I'll read anything that gives me some good ole family vibes. Bonus points if it's angsty and full of hurt/comfort. I read Stealing Harry and absolutely loved it. Any age is okay! No deaths of the parent/parent figure preferred, please.


** No mention of linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) yet? I'll throw that in, then.

Sirius accidentally escapes from Azkaban five years early, but doesn't have any leads on Peter, so he instead comes to check on eight-year-old Harry, and finds him unhappy, so offers him another home - while the Wizarding world is in an uproar, assuming he's kidnapped Harry to bring him to Voldemort. I like it because it's focused on the people, not on any secret Black family magic or politics. It's about Harry getting a parental figure and a childhood, Remus getting caught up in the search and meeting Tonks much earlier than canon, Harry and Hermione being at the same primary school without knowing that the other is magical.

Books 1-4 are complete, with 1 being pre-Hogwarts and each book after that covering a year. Book 5 is in progress. Recent chapters have been getting a bit dark; Voldemort is a nasty evil little monster-baby.

** My favourite adopted by Snape ones are these:

Linkao3(Harry Potter's Second Chance)

This is my favourite thing ever.

Linkao3(A New Place To Stay)

This one is highly recommended by everyone.

Linkao3(Nobody Cared)

I have good memories of this one but haven't read it in years so sorry if it's not as good as I remember!

Linkao3(Never Alone)

Also have good memories of this one.

Linkao3(Amethyst)

This is book one in the A Very Slytherin Harry series, which is just wonderful.

Linkao3(A Brother To Basilisks)

Dash is probably the greatest OC in the history of fanfic.

*** So I started reading A Brother To Basilisks, and I'm OBSESSED. I love Draco's jealousy, Snape starting to warm up to Harry, and best of all, DASH. He's so sassy and cheeky and devoted to Harry and UGH I love him. Thank you for this recommendation!!

*** Premise sounds interesting, I like dimensional travel type stuff, which is I assume what happens from the summary, so I'll give it a read. And gen fics are my favorites.

Not sure if you are cross posting or not, but the premise sounds like it might appeal to FFN readers moreso than AO3 ones. Though I figure at this point most readers probably use both sites.

**** Great! And yes there are two universes in the fic, but I'm not going to spoil what's supposed to happen in the rest of the fanfic haha

I'm surprised gen fics are your favourites! Lots of people are put off by gen fics unfortunately and they bypass fics like mine.\\
I am cross-posting, but I usually just link ao3 bc it's sort of annoying to link both sites. And promoting through ao3 is a little easier, they have a feature that connects ao3 to tumble!

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
