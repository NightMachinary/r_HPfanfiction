** Fenrir Greyback is the leader of the werewolves as a faction, and he is an object of fear and disgust for humans. Even Draco was horrified when Fenrir got into Hogwarts. There are some clear pedophilia shades in the reference to him attacking / preferring children . So generally my opinion of werewolves is pretty negative.

Lupin is a likeable character, so I guess becoming a werewolf doesn't make you join the faction. It's implied that being a werewolf isn't common. But after the war, with Fenrir empowered by Voldemort, there are probably a few more than there used to be. I'm sure there are fics on that topic.

Fic wise, there is something for everyone. Humor or action or really dark stuff . I dont' mind slash in general but of the werewolf-specific slash is not my deal at all, and there is a lot of it. If you run into the alpha / omega / MPREG stuff, be aware it is not a Harry Potter thing, it is fanfic trope. I think it came from Supernatural. It's not always werewolves, though. I'm sure there is "normal" werewolf slash too. Like I said, something for everyone.

** I liked Dudley Dursley and the new normal a lot, its not on ffn anymore but you should be able to google it. It deals with muggle kids being bitten during the war, for example
