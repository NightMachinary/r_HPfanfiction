** If you take a look at the hpff wiki on the sidebar, our wiki mistress has compiled a list of people willing to beta. One of our writers managed to hook up with a really good one from the list. Check it out and maybe you'll find someone you click with. Good luck with your writing! :D

** Sounds like those ideas have some potential. I'd be happy to bounce ideas back and forth. I'll leave the actual beta work to [[/u/Deathcrow]], but I'm more than happy to discuss plots, implementing them and so on.

** This sounds right up my alley... feel free to pm me. I'm not sure I'm a great idea-bouncer but I think I'm decent at editing/betaing.
