- Hermione gets infected by Lupin during the time loop. Harry and Hermione realise the implications but she urges them on, they have an innocent man to save after all. During the wait for the Dementors/Sirius/James, they talk about the issue but Hermione is adamant that it will not affect her much. She stubbornly refuses to acknowledge it as anything but a chronic illness with which she can live a mostly normal life, already making plans for dealing with the issue. Harry promises to stick with her. Once they are back in the hospital wing, Pomfrey finds out and everyone makes a big deal out of it, like her life was basically over. Some Ministry bloke shows up and starts rambling about registering her alpha, her joining a pack and so on.

- Hermione says that she won't need all of that, thank you very much, and leaves the room, dragging Harry with her. They have a friendship moment and Harry says that he was worried she'd deck the Ministry clerk like she did Malfoy. Lupin offers his help as well, but understandably, Hermione refuses because she sees Lupin as the personification of everything she does not want to become (self-pity, shabby clothes, unemployed or doing just odd jobs)

- Most students don't take Hermione's illness well, either afraid due to the stigma (purebloods) or because of Muggle literature. There is one notable exception, namely Lavender Brown, who makes up with Hermione and does her best to comfort her roommate. Over the course of the fourth year, they develop a deep friendship, Lavender and Harry stay with Hermione when she transforms, harmless due to the wolfsbane.

- The friendships with Ron fizzles out. He and Hermione have been fighting for the entirety of the third book and suddenly there is the whole werewolf mess. The one with Harry goes by the time he is entered into the tournament. There is no huge fight, no name-calling or insults, just a lot of awkwardness. This story should not bash Ron, but he has some issues when it comes to empathy and I really don't see him handling these situations well. He is to be redeemed eventually, even if things never are the same as before. Ron's biggest flaw as a canon character is the lack of consequences from his action. Harry fucks up, Sirius dies. Ron fucks up, he get's the cold shoulder for a couple days.

- During the TWT, Lavender comes up with crazy plans for Harry to get through the tasks like overpowered beauty charms to fight a dragon, some general light-heartedness.

- 5th year would still have Umbridge at Hogwarts. While her bigotry campaigns would make life for Hermione difficult, the fact that Hermione hasn't mauled anyone yet would serve as living proof that she is wrong and not all werewolves are monsters. It would also be hilarious to see Umbridge cur her teeth on Hermione's stubbornness This would also be a good time for Ron to pull his head from his arse.

- The overall goal would be to follow years four and five while showing that it is perfectly possible to lead a normal life as a werewolf. At the same time, there would be no attempt to whitewash werewolves, acknowledging Greyback and his atrocities. Maybe even touch on the issue of the Ministry driving werewolves into Voldemort's camp due to their policies. Pairing wise, this could go anywhere form Hermione/Lavender or Harry/Hermione up to a triad.

** I like this alot, I would love to read a were old story like this its just a Hermione thing to do to overcome her lycanthropy.

The problems I personally have with it is I don't think lavender brown would be the only person to accept Hermione besides Harry. She just doesn't seem like the type from what little I know about her character. She actually seems like she would make the most problems about sharing a dorm with her.

Also I 100% think Dumbledore would hush the entire thing. He would of course not kick Hermione out of school, but he would hide her lycanthropy from the other students like lupin

*** I'm not saying that Lavender 'd be the only one who wouldn't hate her, but I chose her specifically for two reasons. She has a bad rep in fanfics despite giving her life for the cause and there's a severe lack of positive depictions of her. And while she admittedly is a little air headed, she is definitely not hate- or spiteful. Also, Hermione was quite rude/mean about her bunny and I think them making up would be a cute scene.

And a Hermione-Lavender reconciliation is more realistic than one with a Slytherin girl, and there are plenty of those fics around.

  “Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.”

  “Oh, Ron!” Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.

  “Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . ,” she sobbed.

  “Oh --- well --- he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly re-lieved that she had let go of him. “And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.”

Ron is the one in the trio you think has some issues with empathy? Not Hermione, who doesn't care about her best friend's pet rat being killed by her cat (a cat she bought /after/ seeing it attack Scabbers btw), and who doesn't have any issues keeping a journalist trapped in a jar, or disfiguring teenage girls? Ron has some prejudices in the books, but he gets over them when he learns they're wrong. And Harry and Hermione had been fighting in the third book as well, just saying...

And lack of consequences??? When Ron left after his fight with Harry in DH (after Harry yelled at him to leave, I might add), he immediately wanted to return, but he ended up splinched and attacked by snatchers, and by the time he got free and apparated back to the campsite, he was unable to find Harry and Hermione. And when he was finally able to get back to them weeks later, he had to live with the fact that the girl he loved had yet to forgive him. If anyone in the books lack consequences for their actions, it's Hermione. She never has to apologise for anything, not even when she physically attacks her best friend.

Other than the Ron characterization, this sounds like a really interesting prompt. I've never really read a Werewolf Hermione story before.

But she did forgive him. Harry lost Sirius when he fucked up, the last link to his family. Ron didn't get his dick wet sooner. And him not believing Harry in GoF had even fewer consequences.

The one situation where she fucks up is the Firebolt incident, where she was actually right (even if she did the wrong thing). Other than that, there is very little you can blame her for. Umbridge got what she deserved, Snape deserved a lot more than torched robes, the beetle jar was certainly more pleasant than a couple years behind bars.

I have, they are horrible. In fact, so bad that I wrote this prompt as a response. The best story with Hermione and werewolves is that one smutty one-shot where Harry is turned and they have some rough sex (both as humans) once Hermione checks up on him. Everything else is just werewolf fetish 101.

**** I don't get how this is a flaw in his character. Ron suffers the consequences from his actions and learns from his mistakes. It doesn't have to be permanent consequences-in real life people don't have permanent consequences either all the time.

Hermione screws up too-she angers the centaurs, she panics in high-stress situations, Gildory Lockhart, most of Half Blood Prince. But like Ron none of it's long-lasting. Harry's screw up had the misfortune to be a life or death scenario.

Snape's robes weren't torched. As I git to know she used illusion fire spell on him.

Hermione permanently scared Marietta's face. This action had no justification and was borderline dark.

***** Usually, betraying a resistance group (they even call themselves Army) has the same consequences as any treason. Like I said, the only reason Marietta didn't drop dead is because Rowling hadn't invented the necessary spells yet (and because it's a children's book). I mean, the very same Hermione who set up the DA list later lead Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest where the three outcomes were squashed by Hagrid's half brother, rape by Centaurs or giant spider dinner.

Except they are just children who decided to play in “resistance” with their school administration.

No ones life was in danger, no one threw Killing Curses. They just didn't like new school rules.

Permanent body damage for telling something to a teacher is very out of line and a serious crime itself.

No, they listened Harry and joined his club in order to get their OWLs. Thinking that Harry will teach them some “magic” magic that allows them to beat DEs is stupid.

Under psychological pressure Marietta told school administration (and the government representative) about an unauthorized school club. Nothing more.

Using violence and permanent body damage is something to be expected from young DEs (Malfoy and Co), yet it's OK, because it's Hermione who did it.

The OWL argument is bullshit since Marietta is in the sixth year. It might have been an argument for a couple of its members, but not for her.

And if she had issues with the DA, she should have gone to a legitimate part of the law enforcement, not a psychopath who gets off from torturing children.

- A werewolf protagonist works to undermine Greyback's propaganda and promote smarter, more responsible management of lycanthropy.

- Lavender Brown is friends with Harry, and brings her zany schemes to bear for the Triwizard Tournament.

- Muggleborn and werewolf Hermione vs Umbridge, using politeness judo and rational arguments against her bigotry.
