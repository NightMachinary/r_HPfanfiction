** Only skimmed, but quick notes:

- Spelling. A lot of names are not capitalized, a lot of random words are capitalized (this also happens in the post you made).

- Chapters are too small. Consolidate chapters until they are 2-3k words.

- Sentence structure is all over the place. You leave spaces before commas, which isn't needed.

If you fix all that it will make the story a lot more readable.
