In fanfiction Wizengamot is almost always portrayed as a council of 'Noble and Ancient Houses'. But I don't believe that is accurate as, if memory serves, we see oh-so-noble-pureblood Lucius Malfoy outside the courtroom when Harry's trial happens. If all families like Malfoys got seats in the Wizengamot, we'd see Lucius in the court.

Umbridge is there. Does that mean her family is as prestigious and/or noble or is she there because she works for the ministry? Is being noble is the reason she is there and her working for the ministry is just a coincidence? Or is Wizengamot a mix of 'noble houses' and government employees? If so it is dumb that regular people can get to a similar position as a 'noble pureblood wizard' if they know how to climb the ladder at the ministry.

Same issue with Amelia Bones. The fact that the trial was supposed to be in her office suggests that she is there as a Ministry official. But usually Bones family is portrayed as a 'great house' too. Is it coincidence that these two noble ladies happen to be working for the Ministry? And why are high and mighty nobles working for the Ministry anyway?

Also Amelia Bones is a woman. If she represents her 'house' in the Wizengamot that must mean there is no one else more suited for this. After her it can be assumed that Susan will take her place. As they can't continue the Bones line in name, what happens to that position? Does the Wizengamot get smaller and smaller with every wizarding war where some families are wiped out?

Also how much of it is fanon?

If anyone can explain these things and share any other information that I couldn't imagine to ask I'll be extremely thankful.


** The canon Wizengamot has nothing to do with family lines, nobility, or other inherited privilege. All evidence suggests that it is an oligarchy where elder scholars are offered a seat after proving their wisdom. The rest are senior officials of the current elected government, including the directors of Ministry departments.

*** This.

And while Lucious Malfoy no doubt had the money and the political savvy to wrangle a seat for himself, that'd mean he'd only have one vote. And which way he was voting would be a matter of public record.

If he simply bought or won-over or blackmailed as many sitting members as he felt he needed, he'd have a bunch of votes. And it wouldn't be publiclly known they were voting a praticular way because he wanted them to.

Far better to stay in the background.

**** This is why I think, had the Harry Potter series been written for an older audience, Lucius Malfoy would've been a very interesting primary antagonist.

** What we know for sure:

- The Wizengamot has [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin][legislative and judicial]] powers, functioning as "a combination of court and parliament".

- However, only serious crimes are tried before the full Wizengamot.

- The Wizengamot has a position known as Chief Warlock, which is Dumbledore in the period of 1991-1995.

- Either the Minister for Magic or the Chief Warlock (impossible to say as Fudge was both at the time) has the power to decide that a crime be tried before the full Wizengamot.

- The Wizengamot includes some members who are also Ministry employees, but it is not clear whether or not they sit on the Wizengamot by virtue of their Ministry position or if this is merely coincidental.

- At the end of the first war, it was /not/ the Wizengamot who tried the Death Eaters, but rather the "Council of Magical Law".

- There are at least two forms of Ministry legislation: Acts and Decrees.

- Decrees appear to be passed by the Minister for Magic.

- It is unclear how Acts are passed, but they are drafted by Ministry employees (e.g. Arthur Weasley).

What might be concluded:

- The Minister fears being removed from his position. This implies there is a body which has the power to remove him, and the only body which we know of which fits the bill is the Wizengamot.

- The Wizengamot likely passes legislative instruments known as Acts.

- From the fact that the Wizengamot can probably remove the Minister, it would appear that the Wizengamot has constitutional superiority to the Minister. Therefore we might conclude that the Wizengamot's Acts are primary legislation (alongside, perhaps, Statutes of the ICW), and Ministerial Decrees are secondary legislation made under either by prerogative powers or empowered by primary legislation.

- There are likely judicial sub-committees of the Wizengamot which hear trials of lesser crimes. It may be that the Council of Magical Law was a special sub-committee set up for the purpose of the expedient trial of suspected Death Eaters.

- By comparison with (Muggle) Parliament, the Chief Warlock likely has a role similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons.

*** From that we can imply that the Wizengamot acts as a counterpower to the ministry, but this aspect might be limited in part by the fact Ministry employees can sit there. It depends if it is due to coincidence or design.

*** Umbridge's and Bones' seats are probably /ex-officio/ of the post that that they hold, i.e., all DMLE heads have a seat; all Senior Undersecretaries have a seat.

** Canon does not really give any information about the Wizengamot, but pottermore does. Considering only 2 Potters had a seat, we can assume the position is not hereditary. I always assumed the members of the Wizengamot were elected by the current members (with maybe the need to be sponsored by a member to even apply ), with several seats reserved to high members of the government (which would explain why Bones, Fudge or Umbridge are there ).

** Bonus question: If the seats are hereditary and Albus Dumbledore supposedly represents the ancient house of Dumbledore, does that mean goat lover Aberforth Dumbledore now gets to take his place in the Wizengamot?

*** indeed he would

but if aberforth never had kids, house dumbledore's seat would die out with him unless the wizarding world takes it very seriously

and would trace backwards the dumbledore family tree to find a living heir

** I think most have a mix of elected and inherited titles. Like Amelia Bones being the head Auror would have like an “elected” title as a head of a department

*** Amelia Bones is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, not the Head Auror. The Auror Office is a sub-department of the DMLE (as Arthur Weasley's office is) and for most of the books the Head Auror was Scrimgeour, who would report to Amelia Bones.

****** I think that's what I love about the Harry Potter universe though. There is so much stuff that fanfics can come up with because it's so open ended, you know? It makes for some amazing stories because we just don't know.

Universe hopping? Why not? I mean nothing is stated against?

Harry Potter is an animaguas (sp?) ? We don't know because it's not explored in the books.

All I know is that the government seams to have elected seats in canon, but there is nothing about “Lords” having seats. Honestly, Harry Potter Canon seems to be a mixed between aristocratic society and corrupt politics who use money to get what they want

** Almost, all of what you wrote is a pure fanon. We know it exists, it is a mix of legislative and judicial supreme power of magical Britain (poor John Adams rolls in his grave), there are some people sitting /ex officio/ (Umbridge, perhaps Amelia Bones, Minister), and that's it. However, we know quite certainly (contrary to 100% of fanon) Lucius Malfoy is not a member (he has to wait outside of the courtroom hoping for some information to leak). That's it. More or less.

For example, we don't know whether the body as such (aside from ex officio positions) is elected or hereditary.
