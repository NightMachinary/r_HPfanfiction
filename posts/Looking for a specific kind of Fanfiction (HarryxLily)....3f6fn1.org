** If you don't mind a story that has this but it is not the central theme, I have a recommendation.

Its rather famous, but if you haven't read it, try Delenda Est, by Lord Silvere.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

Basically Harry goes back in time and ends up plotting with Bellatrix. For a while, he ends up as a professor at their school and Lily ends up 'crushing hard', as you put it, on Harry.

Its mainly a Harry/Bella story, and the section where the Harry/Lily action ends up is so small its like a sub sub plot. But the story itself is really good, just probably not what you're looking for if you want the story to be centered around HarryxLily

In a bit of an AU situation, Harry uses a time turner to go back and save his parents from dying. But he ends up too far back, and gets stuck in the Hogwarts of the 1970s alongside his teenage parents. Can he get home without altering the time stream, and possibly give Lily and James the nudge they need to finally end up together? (I'm not Rowling, nor do I own Back To The Future)

** On the front Lily/Harry fics: I remember thread on DLP about it (mostly people discussing morality of incest) with few recs.

Most of Harry/Lily incest fics are really, really (really) badly written and you will end up trying to claw your eyes out. The fact most of them are straight up smut/erotica does not help. I should have some of the better ones on my kindle, but they were mostly shit overall so I might've ended up deleting most of them.

The only one I can recall from memory is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=2101][Oedipus Flower by Vash]], but it's tad disturbing for most people.

There was one that came 'highly recommended' with Lily coming back from dead to take care of teenage Harry, but it ended up being poorly written smut Harry/multi so I won't even look for it.

One Harry/Lily fic I actually enjoyed reading was with his daughter named Lily, so it's not exactly what you are looking for, but I'll try to find it anyway. It was either one-shot or few short chapters long fic, but I read it on the go and forgot to download.

I'll try to remember and find some other readable ones I've read and edit/post new reply.

** There aren't a lot. This was a pretty (worrisome) fetish of mine a while back, and I remember scouring the fandom but not really finding much.

Aside from Vash, there was a DLP poster who wrote a story in which Harry stumbled into an alternative reality where James is dead and Lily is performing wetworks for the Order. Don't remember the title, author or whether the story was completed, but it definitely had H/L overtones. (I don't think it was posted on ff.net, cause I don't have it in my follow list.)

Then there's this one. Like most of the author's other stories, this didn't really go anywhere either - though once again, H/L overtones. linkffn(5900495)

Ps. There is some stuff where he goes back, all evil-like, makes a harem and all that, but that's mostly boring, and you've probably already stumbled upon it via the ff.net filters.
