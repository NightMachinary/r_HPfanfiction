Would love it if there was a marauder fic where it follows them through they're last years of school and then keeps going after they graduate. Don't know if there is one like that though. Also the story has to have depth. But if there's a really good story that you know of I'll give it a go, thanks!!!


** If you could could break it down, is it the coming of age style that you like, the humour that most marauder fics try to have or is it the stories of the characters themselves that you like? I don't really many marauder fics but I think most of the subreddit could find you fics that are either filled with easy humour and banter or coming of age style.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]] All about the Marauders, James and Lily in particular, lots and lots of plot and character. One if my personal favourites.

** Thanks!! But I've read a lot of marauders stories so I feel like I need a non popular one that's still really good ðŸ˜”
