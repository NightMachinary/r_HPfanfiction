I recently found a fic that says the killing curse is a memory charm so strong it wipes everything away.

Your body forgets how to breath, forgets all it's functions, including the heart. Which means that their heart would just stop beating.

What do you think?


** Nah then when the curse backfired how does Voldemort become a spirit

*** I've given this a lot of thought, and I'd say MAAAAYBE Horcruxes? They keep him alive, yes, but his heart would stop beating and his spirit leaves his body.

*** Keep in mind that him becoming this confetti like thing was only in the movies. In the books, Voldemort's body was just a body.

***** I think you two are thinking of different scenes. righteous and you seem to be refering to the night of July 31st when he went to kill Harry while "harrypotterisamazing" seems to be refering to the Killing Curse being reflected by Harry's Expelliarmus in Deathly Hallows, hence the "confetti thing" that happens in the movie.

** The idea is not Canon Compliant (if the Killing Curse was just an overpowered Memory Charm, I don't think it would need the "lot of hate and will to kill" but rather just a lot of concentration.

Apart from that, it's a pretty interesting idea for an AU, and one of the (very few) things I didn't hate in Harry Potter and the Daft Morons.

** Takes a little bit of the bite the spell has. Even dark harry almost never use this spell, and when they do is almost always a dramatic scene. It would lose this narrative power by being just a memory charm
