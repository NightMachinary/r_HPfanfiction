Hello All,

I'm just wondering if anyone has come across any HP fanfiction with a couple of specific other crossovers.

I'm unfortunately a terrible writer, but, I can't get out of my head 2 ideas that I feel would be hilarious.

Firstly a Snatch based HP, where two young Ravenclaws are starting out in the underground dueling world. Gryffindors' take over the role of pikeys, the philosophers stone is being chased around Diagon Alley by some criminal wizards.

"Gryffindor's" Cornor exclaims, "I Fucking hate Gryffindors".

"Well calm down Micheal, Malfoy has lent us little gorgeous Greg here for a bit of protection, just take him with you and I'm sure the Weasley's will behave now."

Secondly, a Maurader era Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas style fiction.

After their Newts, Black and Potter hit the muggle world of the 70s. They 'borrow' a car and hit the roads, only to find the car filled with all sorts of psychoactive drugs, and no idea what effect they have on people...

Anything you have found that could be similar to either of these would be greatly appreciated.
