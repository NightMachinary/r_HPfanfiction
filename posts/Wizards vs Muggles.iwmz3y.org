As the title says, I'm looking for fictions that really properly take on the idea that wizards and muggles will inevitably go to war when the muggles find out what's been going on. I'm also interested in any fictions that deal with international origins or really, anything that doesn't start in Hogwarts.

​

I've seen a couple fictions that have the MC go world wandering later on after school, that's not what I mean, although I do enjoy it.

​

I'm also interested in fictions that explore wizards magically utilizing muggle technology or just even using guns and bombs by themselves. The reverse could also be fun, watching muggles try to use magic via technology etc.


** this may be what your looking for. theres no muggle wizard xonflict till about halfway ro three quarters of the way through linkffn(rise of the wizards)
