i will be honest and say that i'm a sucker for good slash where harry is either the dom partner or equal partner.

having said that, i'm not against fem!harry. though avoid the too girly types.

independent, smart and powerful harry. bill w/hp or severus s/hp and sometimes draco/hp.

godlike is okay but not something outrageous like bringing back the dead. MoD is good.

bashing is always interesting to read. especially dumbles. tbh that is a character i have a lot of difficulty accepting any reasons.

x-over pairing that i love are tony stark/hp or edward cullen/hp, though not a big fan of twilight, oc or au is acceptable especially with bella bashing, i hate that character.

due to lack of tony/hp, i started to write one. and trying my best to make it a good one at least. not having written a fanfic before i'm kind of having second thoughts about a scene. i will share the link here and as for a easy type critic or anything that will help me calm my nerves.

and do share the above mentioned types of fics if you know any. pleeeease.

** Turn by Sara's Girl is amazing. It's HP/DM. Basically anything by her.

One of my personal favourites is Linkao3(With Eyes Wide Open by suitesamba) It's HP/SS but a slow burn. It has really good characterisation and is quite moving.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.
