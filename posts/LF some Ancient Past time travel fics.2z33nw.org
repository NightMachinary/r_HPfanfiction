** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/844334/1/Amulet-of-Time-1-The-Age-of-the-Founders][Amulet of Time]] is pretty good. It initially send Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny back in time to the Founders in the first story, then 1943 in the middle of the Grindlewald War in the second story, then to Harry's Parents era in the third, then back to where they started in the fourth. It's very good and the slowly jumping back to where they started is cool.
