Yep, so the title says it all. This is my story... linkffn(12177140)

It's on 39 chapters with 270,000 words, so it'll probably take a bit of catching up if you're interested. I'm not currently looking to re-do the whole thing (although if you're happy to point out ways I could improve the earlier chapters I'd try to make time to fix some of the stuff) but I'd prefer it if you were familiar with what I've written so far.

My earlier chapters have been reviewed at average at best, but I've improved a lot over the course of a year and I'm now getting pretty decent feedback (so if you could endure the first and second years especially it would be appreciated). So if anyone's willing to give it a shot please reply or send a message or something.

Thank you!


** Does it have a pairing? Just that some pairings make me drop a fic...

*** Not any real pairings at this point. Harry was OC'd for a bit and there's the Ron/Hermione tension, but haven't really decided what's going to happen there. There is a Ernie McMillan/Sue Li thing, but haven't had a chance to explore it much.

Can I ask what pairings you would absolutely object to?

**** Unless it is brilliantly done, I struggle with Harry/Ginny. Weird? I know... Slash doesn't interest me unless the story is done well enough. Snape/any student makes me refuse to look at it, especially Snape/Hermione. Hermione with any of the marauders or anyone too old has no appeal either.

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_reader]]

#+begin_quote
  An alpha reader or beta reader (also spelled alphareader / betareader, or shortened to alpha / beta), also pre-reader or critiquer, is a non-professional reader who reads a written work, generally fiction, with the intent of looking over the material to find and improve elements such as grammar and spelling, as well as suggestions to improve the story, its characters, or its setting. Beta reading is typically done before the story is released for public consumption. Beta readers are not explicitly proofreaders or editors, but can serve in that context.

Basically: An "editor lite".

** Now that I know what a beta is I would like to be your beta! I am /very good at/ spelling! I won spelling contests and also my sister always asks me how to spell things because I am so good at it! :)

*** I asked about betas last week on here myself - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7hlbi8/question_about_betas/]]

I could definitely use someone to check over my work before I post it, but I'm hoping for someone who'll be able to point out stuff that doesn't work and stuff like that.

Just wondering, have you read my fic?

***** Ah that's a shame... Well as I've pointed out, I've already written quite a bit and someone who was already a reader has sent me a message saying they might be interested.

Still, I'd like to hear what you think of it so far if you can spare any time to read it!
