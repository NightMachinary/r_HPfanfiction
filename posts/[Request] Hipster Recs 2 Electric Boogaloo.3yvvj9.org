A couple of months ago, I submitted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3iyjnn/request_give_me_your_hipster_recs/][this]] thread looking for diamonds in the rough, or top-notch fics that didn't have a lot of reviews/favorites/follows. With the end of the year, I thought it was appropriate to create another thread for people to promote fics/authors who they think don't get enough praise. Same rules apply as last time: fics should be over 40k and have (at the very least) less than 300 reviews. Can be drama, comedy, angst, whatever genre or pairing you like, so long as the fic tries to avoid shitty tropes associated with that genre or pairing, and reads well.

Thanks in advance!


** Why the 40k requirement? There are some lesser known one shots and short stories that could be interesting.

Regardless here are a few from my 4-5 star list that meet both criteria, all of which more people need to read:

linkffn(4508751; 5201703; 6919395; 5562313; 7186430; 11226787; 5442675)

By the Divining Light has a sequel which brings it over 40k.

*** Mostly because that was the rule in the previous thread, which was probably because the original thread was made to expand my reading list, and I just prefer longer stories. Then again, you're absolutely right about one-shots and short stories/novellas; if you've some worth recommending, I won't complain.

Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU.
