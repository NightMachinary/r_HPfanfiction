** Without harry Voldemort would have had an easier time coming back. But Snape would probably be imprisoned revealing that he has a dark mark. So naturally they think he was trying to bring Voldemort back. Dumbledore also probably faces charges for knowingly hiring him.

They don't have any proof that he's back so it's a mix of paranoia and denial.

Anyway IDK

*** Snape was a known death eater, we find out in Karkaroff's trial that he was let off because he turned spy for Dumbledore.
