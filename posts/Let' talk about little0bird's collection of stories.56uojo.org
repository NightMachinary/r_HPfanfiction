As someone who wanted to continue Harry's story after the battle and focus more on him and Ginny, I naturally was pointed in the direction of little0bird.

Having completed a re-read of her works, I was wondering what others think about her stories. What do you all like? Dislike?

I liked how little0bird was able to tell a compelling series of stories without actually having much of a plot. The character development was mostly spot on and I really felt like I was reading an accurate tale of life after the war for these characters.

In a weird way, the very realistic portrayal of life after the war is also what I didn't like about the stories. With some minor bumps here and there, the life of Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and all the others is rather typical and mundane. Soon after the kids start coming, the focus of our favorite characters' lives turns to them. It's like all the exciting lives we read about cease when the new generation comes into their own. I guess it's how it's supposed to be, but it is a bit depressing in a way.

As a big Ginny fan who always wished we got more about her (though understanding a story from Harry's POV made that difficult), little0bird knocked it out of the park. The depth of exploration into how this character would live her life after the war is nearly unmatched in fanfic. IMO, Ginny is the most compelling character to focus on after the war and it comes across in little0bird's writing.

Little0bird clearly loves these characters and can't seem to say goodbye, which might explain why her epic, "Questions and Answers" runs nearly 500,000 words and meanders through dozens of plots of varying degree of interest. I sympathize with her for not being able to or not wanting to finish it. Once its done, then it really is goodbye to these characters who we've learned way more about than in the original series.

Overall, I'm a big fan but totally can understand why others aren't.


** I read little0bird's work before I read any of Northumbrian's. I hope Questions and Answers does actually get "finished" - I check for updates every few months. Once in awhile, there is one, and it makes my day.

I like the personalities and stories that have been created for so many of the "minor" characters. My favorite books in general are the ones that follow the lives of many interconnected people and complicated families, so I think these fall right in with my interests. I reread them when I'm in the mood to just read, for hours (or days) without a worry of finishing. I like to be able to immerse myself in a story, but I read quickly, and it's rare for me to find anyone who writes with the volume that allows me to do that.

I would love recommendations for other authors out there who write in a similar way. I'm currently following Put Your Curse in Reverse by frombluetored, which is Cursed Child canon-compliant. I didn't love Cursed Child, but I'm enjoying this story for the family interactions and personalities. It's all maybe a bit less plausible than liitle0bird or Northumbrian, but I'm still glad when there's an update.

** As with Northumbrian, I find Little0bird's stories to be somewhat hit-or-miss. I really like Questions and Answers, but The First day is very much the formulaic After-the-Battle story, and I couldn't really get into More Than Words either.

Her Dudley fic is pretty cool. Check it out if you can.

*** Northumbrian has always felt OOC to me TBH. His characters don't always seem to react in realistic ways, especially when their OOC behavior is exactly what's needed to advance the plot.

I will admit that Strangers is a fun read though.

**** Northumbrian is a terrific writer but I agree about the OOC stuff. His first story was amazing simply because I dont think I've read a story so engrossing without much actually happening (I believe it covered just through the summer).

I forgot which story it was but I remember one based on Ginny being given some poison that made her act OOC and it was a tough read, good but just difficult to deal with her so OOC. And then to find out it was all because of a poison was a bit of a cop out.

It really depends on what you want out of fanfic. Some people want adventure/mystery stories akin to the original series, so Northumbrian might be the preferred choice to little0bird. I personally want more character exploration that imagines what realistically would happen next, which is more little0bird's ballpark. But they are both fantastic writers.

***** I will say that Northumbrian is better at creating more adventure/mystery fics, whereas little0bird consistently focuses on more episodic character-driven conflict.

He's a good writer, but some of the OOC drives me nuts. It just takes me out of the story.

*** This was my biggest problem with little0bird. I had already read Grave Days and this story was so good that I couldnt really move onto another "universe" like those two created it.

** I don't LOVE these but I do always recommend them to people who ask for stories that pick up right after the last battle. Not to be too nit-picky, but one thing that always bothered me (and shouldn't be too hard of a fix, but I am not an author on ffn so who knows) were the lack of breaks between scenes/chapters. It happened CONSTANTLY and always took me out of the story because I would need to figure out where we were and who was in the scene.

As for the writing and story in general, I think she does a good job but not great. At first I liked the realism, but after awhile it was just too sad. I might have been ruined by reading too many "8th year" fics where everyone is sad but reasonably well-adjusted, because the amount of sadness (from everyone other than george) started to feel a little unbelievable after about 6 months or so.

For canon-compliant fics, I typically read next-gen stuff that picks up after the epilogue, because the stuff right after the war is just too sad and also too mundane, like you said, to keep me reading.

*** Yeah, of all the fics, I think I like her first one set right after the battle the least because it's too depressing at times. I know a lot of people really don't think Harry would be such an angsty mess, and I won't argue that point. But I think its fine to show that happening as no one can really know what he'd be like. But at some point, it does get a bit much with that fic specifically.

I think the other ones, starting with More Than Words, are a bit more uplifting as they characters really start to move on. It's fair to show that the scars of battle don't immediately go away.

I really liked how she delved into Ginny's feelings for Harry the person versus the hero. I found that to be well-handled and realistic.

Ultimately, when it comes to post-Battle fics, it really depends on what you are looking for. Do you want another adventure/mystery fic, a pure romance one, or a realistic account? IMO, the best fics accomplish all three with a heavier bend towards romance and realism. It's tough to do a mystery/adventure story that rises to the level of the original series.

** They are honestly still my go-to canon compliant fics. As a matter of fact, the story where Harry goes undercover during Gin's second pregnancy still emotionally resonates with me years later. The tension and angst was so palpable it seeped a bit into my real life ;)

She's great, and while her stories weren't my first fics, they are my foundation pieces.

I've since moved on to enjoy Harmonies and more, but lil' b will always be my Ginny source!

*** God, I loved the angst of the second pregnancy fic. It felt very real.

I think one of the things that makes Little0bird so excellent is her willingness to create genuine conflict between a couple or within the Weasley-Potter family, and to allow that conflict to progress naturally. Little0bird's characters are no less lovable because they occasionally give their partner the silent treatment, hold grudges, or have petty arguments that aren't really petty at all.

And rather than sweeping that conflict under the rug after a single chapter, each of these conflicts is a learning experience that ultimately alters the relationship for better or for worse.

**** For sure, some people critique how "mundane" her stories are, but I think that's what gives them staying power. These are real conflicts that many of us go through, and seeing our heroes go through them and overcome is greatly beneficial.

***** Ultimately, this is what makes her a great writer. While yes, I sometimes get bored with the lack of a plot, in the end I appreciate the subtle build up to a true revelation within the character. Truthfully very few fics will be able to match the original series in terms of plot, especially the post-battle fics. But character development is where the author can go far beyond Rowling and little0bird clearly shines here.

And another thing, which I've sort of mentioned before, I love how little0bird chose to address Ginny's issues that I can't help but feel she must've dealt with, specifically 1) jealousy towards Harry, Ron and Hermione's close relationship (which Cursed Child even alluded to but of course failed to pursue) 2) asserting her independence, 3) dealing with the aftermath of her sixth year 4) dealing with Harry not trying to protect her 5) her quidditch career and quitting when she did (although here i wish we got a full story)

** I'm on mobile so I want to comeback and add to this later but I really love them. I know what you mean about them being more mundane, and to be honest I prefer the idea of them living relatively mundane lives. The conflict still exists, but it's character-driven rather than external forces.

I feel like she portrays Ginny/Harry very realistically, they're imperfect but they're making an effort. I do think that the extra next gen kids seem like a bit much.

** Little0bird's big draw is that she tries to paint a very realistic picture for what these characters would experience after the war.

I know there is a lot of pushback in general to the idea that Harry would have been a mess right after the war, which little0bird writes as happening to him in "First Days." Personally, I feel that by the time she got to the kids all going off to school, she had made all the characters typical parents, give or take some idosyncracies.

So let me ask a question: As it relates to Harry and Ginny, who are the primary focus of her writings, how did little0bird do? Not just in whether they remained in character, but the internal conflicts they both dealt with, too.

For example, in one of the first stories (not sure if it's Grave Days or More than Words), Ginny has an internal struggle with whether she loves Harry the person or the savior. Did this ring true for people? For me, it did. Ginny grew up idolizing him, then discovers the real Harry, but he is still this larger-than-life hero. They get back together after so much death and grief and I could see a 17 year old Ginny questioning if what she was feeling was actual love or just a byproduct of everything that happened those last several years.
