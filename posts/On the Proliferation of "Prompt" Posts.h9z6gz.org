I can't be the only one who has noticed that prompt posts seem to be greatly increasing in number.

The problem is that the vast majority of these prompts are pretty low effort. They are not genuine prompts (in the sense of threads designed to generate fic writing) nor are they fleshed out plot bunnies.

Rather, the vast majority of these prompts amount to little more than the HPfanfiction version of "shower thoughts". And there's so many of them that this sub is becoming [[/r/HPShowerthoughts][r/HPShowerthoughts]]. People don't seem to be engaging any kind of filter. Any idea that occurs to someone, no matter how trivial or crackish or nonsensical, seems to go straight from brain to prompt post.

My proposal:

1. Eliminate the "prompt" flair.

2. Create a "Plot Bunny" flair for threads where people post /substantive/ plot bunnies. Non-substantive plot bunnies (i.e. single line posts) get removed by the auto-mod.

3. Create a "Writing" flair for threads aimed at hosting writing sprints etc.

4. Once a week create a pinned thread for silly ideas that don't deserve their own post. Like: "Silly Ideas Saturday".

***** I feel like the word 'prompt' is perhaps less of a pressure word than 'discussion'. I know I have found as a fairly prolific poster that there seems to be more relaxed discussion under prompt posts than discussion posts which seem right away to attract more longform, structured discussion points, at least as top level.

However, I can also see how people who like a prompt to be a specific kind of discussion may be frustrated. I think ultimately there is a split between users who read 'prompt' as 'story prompt', and who read it as 'idea for your thoughts on'.

Perhaps one solution might be a sidebar post explaining which meaning of 'prompt' the mods expect a prompt post to start off.

1) Ideas that already exist in stories, usually multiple popular stories.

2). Ideas that aren't nearly as clever or as interesting as the person who posted them think they are, and are probably just looking for an echochamber to encourage the person to write it into a story anyways.

I say leave it as is or at best post a Wiki page on "how to clean up your prompt" so the prompts will be worthwhile, otherwise it'll just be a deadly spiral of "X happens too much, curb X. Now Y happens too much, ban Y" until we run out of allowed topics.

1. Delete all prompt posts Monday-Friday

2. Allow prompt posts at the weekend.

This way, moderators do not have to be reading threads to decide whether or not they are substantive plot bunnies or not. They can just delete everything that is a prompt without having to ask any further questions.

** A good comparison would be the situation in [[/r/europe]]. That subreddit had to ban photographs because when they were permitted they completely overran the subreddit and displaced all other content. Even though photographs of Europe are prime [[/r/europe]] content, the volume of that content was such that it became a problem. So now you can only post photographs at the weekend.

*** I think rather than limit the amount of prompts, the better idea would be to set a minimum required word count (eg 250) to weed out the low effort posts.

So rather than just a title like "What if Andromeda was a mafia don?" (an old prompt of mine), you'd be required to give a broad outline of how you imagine the prompt to look like, any related ideas you have and so on.

Prompts are prompts - they come in abundance from all corners of the internet. But conversations, LF, etc., are widely more unique and individual in their choice of content.

** I agree with you.

And somehow they're nearly always written with poor grammar, as if these users couldn't even be bothered to pass their random bursts of unordered thought through any filter whatsoever.

This needs to stop.

** I personally like them, but I agree they aren't really prompts. Maybe start moderating those posts and directing them to [[/r/hpshowerthoughts][r/hpshowerthoughts]]? It doesnt look like that sub is terribly active right now but it seems like there's a demand for it.

** A month later: The only thing left on the sub is low-effort prompts.

GOOD WORK, MODS! YOU'VE KILLED YOUR OWN SUB!

** Perhaps we could limit the number of times you can post a prompt. Perhaps one a week or two a month.

** Yes on distinguishing between flash-fill prompts and ideas for longer stories, although there are some ideas that work for both.

Yes on a thread (daily or weekly or biweekly) for story ideas, or for both of it proves impracticable to split them.

A silly stories thread might be fun, but I don't see that it would have enough content to be more than monthly.

** I enjoy the variety of prompts. Even if they aren't fleshed out, they make me think about the fandom, different interpretations of the story and characters I love.

I'd rather have more posts with lower quality posts get through rather than less posts but a neater subreddit.

** How about you live and let live instead?

If people think some threads are lazy, they can vote with their replies (or lack thereof) or their downvotes. If you don't like some threads, nothing forces you to read them, either.

I don't know what you're trying to achieve, except enforcing your own preferences on this subreddit.

If we have to make new rules and change everything every time people get lazy, we'll never bee done, and we'll only make things difficult for everyone.

I'm against your idea.

Edit: On the same idea, there are a lot of lazy request thread, with very unoriginal stuff that has already been asked over and over again, sometimes several times a week. Yet I don't see people asking for a pinned thread and banning these types of threads.

It's also true for pet peeves, some discusion threads (the infamous core/no core debate comes to mind), and I'm sure many other topics.

If we make a pinned thread for each of these thread types, we'll soon end up with only pinned thread and very little else on the subreddit.

I've seen what happened with the pinned request thread over at [[/r/makeyourchoice][r/makeyourchoice]], I used to reply to these threads, now I never go to the pinned thread (and I'm sure mny people are the same), the result is it's become hard to get more than a couple responses, and no discussion arises like it used to.
