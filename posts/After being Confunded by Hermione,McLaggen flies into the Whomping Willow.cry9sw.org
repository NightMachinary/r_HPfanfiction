** Her left hand flew to cover her open mouth. Shock was etched into her face, with regret slowly filling in behind the wide pupils of her eyes. Bile was starting to bubble into her throat as she saw McLaggen's body twist and contour into an unnatural position from the tree's branches.

She took two steps down on the bleachers before dropping to her knees and vomiting over the weather wooden benches. Her body shook rapidly as her stomach clenched trying to ride of nonexistent food. After a few minutes of dry heaving, she was able to look up from her sick.

Around the Whomping Willow were several fliers. Harry had risked himself to save McLaggen. It was too late, though. His body had become a tangled mess of blood, bone, and organs leaking out. She could hear sobs and screams from the new fliers around the tree.

Harry was attempting to hide the body from onlookers with little success. Ginny had flow around and started to hex anyone who ventured to close. Ron and several others had gotten off their brooms and were using their robes as a curtain to hide the scene.

McGonagall was running down the wet grass with Snape, Pomphrey, and Dumbledore following closely behind. They quickly ran past the line of students holding robes, dropping to their knees at the mangled body. There was no saving him, Hermoine concluded with snot and tears running down her face. There was so much magic could do but this? This couldn't be fixed even with the darkest and unholiest of spells.

She couldn't hear what Harry had said but she had been able to guess when the teachers all snapped their attention to her. Snape and McGonagal had stormed toward her crumbled form on the bleachers. She was in such a state of shock that they had to hook their hands under her arms and drag her back to the castle. Her feet had followed uselessly behind her as she passed the body.

Oh, god.

/She was a murder./

Part of her mind was trying to justify that it was an accident! She didn't mean for him to get hurt. She didn't know he would veer into the murderous tree. She didn't know!

But she couldn't say anything as Harry followed yelling at Dumbledore about the tree. He screamed about how if the man didn't encourage such lenient behavior to his friend she might have thought before acting. How he should have known she didn't regard a person's life after setting Snape on fire first year.

That had Snape digging his fingers into her upper arm painfully.

She turned around one last time before being dragged into the castle. She had hoped to see the body. A punishment, she thought looking for the mangled mess. All she caught was the enraged and murderous face of her best friend.

"You always preach about rules, yet, you think they don't apply to you," He spat, "You went too far."

He was right. She had.

Her opinion of how she could do no wrong turned her into a killer.

*** This was written exceedingly well!

I'm currently writing a series and the theme is based on fate vs. choice as well as reincarnation. Hermione is such an interesting character and she's one of the harder one's to write for me (along with Snape, and Dumbledore). I want to be as true to her as I can get but also, give her the consequences for her (and others) actions that they deserve... The interesting thing about the Hermione I'll be writing, is that due to the reincarnation, she has a stronger self awareness that she doesn't in canon?

Basically some of her past life experiences have made her aware of how easy it is to cross a line and never come back from it... My point is, your piece has given me some inspiration!üòä‚ù§

** "Professor McGonagall, I know who did it." Harry said to the unusually somber professor. "It was Hermione. She overheard McLaggen talking trash coupled with her crush on Ron..."

"Be as that may be, that does not excuse her actions in the slightest. Where did we go wrong?"

Harry, annoyed with everyone this year, snapped. "Maybe it's because you've been coddling her too much. Maybe it's because she's got this idea that anything she does is alright because it's for the greater good. Despite her being an excellent student, she keeps hearing how she's the brightest person of her age and has internalized the hype. Maybe it's because you're such a shitty head of house and administrator. You gave her a time turner to take more classes, confiscated a broom on her testimony alone, and most of all, do nothing. She scarred Marietta as a supposed measure to stop snitching, but never told anyone. I admit I thought it was justified at first, but she doesn't remember anything, and she would have never told otherwise. You let her be vindictive, but oh, she's a model student. She's easily broken more rules than Ron or I. I could see her one of these days attacking someone outright for doing something she didn't like. Yet, see that, you do nothing at all."

Harry paused, gathering more steam. "She isn't the only one you've failed. You left me at the Dursleys. I had a cupboard for a room for 10 years. 10 years I endured, all because you were too much of a coward to do anything. So yes, this is partially your fault. You, who does nothing."

Part 2 with Hermione coming in the afternoon.

*** ‚ÄúFor causing the death of Cormac McLaggen, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As your wand was used in the crime, it has been submitted as evidence to the DMLE.‚Äù

Professor McGonagall looked like she was in mourning. Dumbledore looked like he swallowed a particularly bitter lemon. The aurors looked on neutrally.

Hermione was in hysterics. ‚ÄúIt was just an accident... I didn't mean to.‚Äù

McGonagall replied back. ‚ÄúIt's because you disregarded another student's safety for your own selfish desires. I mean really, where's your integrity? Confunding a student just so your crush would be guaranteed the spot. It's shameful.‚Äù

Hermione had no reply. The aurors came and took her through the floo, to await her trial and sentencing.

******* Fanfiction just doesn't have many stories where Hermione is treated properly. We either have fics that overhype her, or we have fics that bash her for nonsensical reasons.

A fic where she is an intelligent student who gets called out for some of her actions is rare.

******** There is Amortentia by excentrymuse, which deals with it very well. Although McLaggen doesn't die, it just goes as in canon, until she's found out. It's a very interesting Harry/Romilda with a slightly OOC Harry (more intelligent and less moody).

It's been removed, but I have it saved. It's kind of easy to find.

Also, I kind of liked the different POV, it was kind of nice. Since Romilda was made to be a perfectly normal teenage girl, if a bit romanticized.

**** Dumbledore sat in his office with his head in hands.

"How could everything go wrong? Hermione was supposed to join Harry on the journey. Without her, Harry might take a proactive stance and never sacrifice himself to get rid of the soulpiece. And Malfoy. Am I right to let him come to school, even though he might take desperate measures? Is it alright to risk student safety for the redemption of one?"

Dumbledore sighed. "It's time to come clean with Severus and Harry."

Edit: The third one always fails huh.

****** I just wanted to make a trilogy joke.

And I'm a bit kinder to Dumbledore than his canon actions deserve, because Rowling meant for him as a flawed, but good man, and you see that often.

Snape on the other hand, is actively a dick. I liked the two fics I've read that used his movie personality, because it really is more nuanced, but people take it too far.
