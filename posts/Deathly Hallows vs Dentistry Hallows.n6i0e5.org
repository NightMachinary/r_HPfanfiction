So I went to the dentist this week and noticed that they had an [[https://www.google.com/search?q=official+symbol+of+dentistry&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR-6Thj7TwAhUgMlkFHeJ2B1QQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=579&dpr=1.5#imgrc=A8S6-OLehgjc6M][odd sign]] in their window. At first I thought my dentist was a overly enthusiastic HP fan, but the symbol was just a little off. Apparently, the Rod of Asclepius surrounded by a circle and a triangle is the "official" symbol of dentistry, but it looks like the deathly hallow symbols with a snake thrown in for fun.

I think it'd be pretty funny if Hermione is tasked with figuring out what that symbol means and she becomes very confused about why Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Xenophilius & now even Voldemort are so interested in the art of muggle dentistry. She might feel some regret that she can't ask her parents about it as they are memory-erased in Australia at this point.

I don't know what direction I would want this fic to go- the trio off on a wild goose chase over some dentistry mythology that still somehow still gets them the upper hand (just imagine the confusion on the magical people's faces as Harry explains in that final duel that the Power He Knew Not was muggle teeth science) or somehow the hallows are connected to teeth and Hermione's parents (and all dentists) are in on some conspiracy that involves Death, magic, and adequate flossing practices.

So basically, the Quibbler was right about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

** To the alternative powers Tom knows not, I wrote this dialog between Harry and Ginny (from linkao3(22663204)):

#+begin_quote
  ... or about the ‘power that the Dark Lord knows not'. I had to suffer the half-an-hour Hermione's rant about the mess the Hogwarts Library catalogue is two weeks ago, and so I guess I am one of very few pureblood witches who knows what the Dewey Decimal Classification is. I think it is the safe bet that Tom, who grew up in an orphanage and very permanently left the Muggle education when he was eleven, has never heard about it either. What if that ‘power he knows not' is knowledge of the Muggle libraries, where you will be able to locate necessary information, whereas he could not? Crazy is it? Why it is crazier than the Dumbledore's love? Or some random Muggle weapon you have heard about and Tom has no clue.”

  Ginny was happy to observe that it was the first time in a long time when Harry really laughed thinking about the library catalogues.

  “How do you know? I was hiding from the Dudley gang often in the school library, so I heard about Mr Dewey even before I started at Hogwarts. That's a weird coincidence. Perhaps you found the power which will conquer Tom!”

  Ginny face hardened when she heard about Harry's hiding, but she managed to smile in the end at least a bit.

  “Can you imagine the Hermione's face if she found out that managing library defeated Tom?”

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).
