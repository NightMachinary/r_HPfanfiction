Especially her friendship with Ginny and life in Hogwarts outside of Harry and Ron.

I just like hearing about her normal daily life in Hogwarts and the things she and Ginny chat about, confide in each other about.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: granted it's set in an extreme non magical sci-fi AU, this Hermione is however very well characterized and her friendship with her dorm mates is very well done. Lavender and OC Euterpe Spinks are fun.

  Shared joy is a double joy, shared sorrow is half a sorrow.' The development of Hermione and Ginny's relationship, a friendship left mainly off the page in the novels.

** Unfortunately I can't recall coming across a fic like this....I think because her relationships with other women aren't really emphasized in the books and she doesn't seem to exactly be close to or get along with a lot of her female peers?
