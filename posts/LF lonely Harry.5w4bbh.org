I dont know why but i really want to see Harry have like no friends. Either because hes an outcast or he does something that they cant stand. I think i just like to see him at rock bottom and rise up out of it in the end for a really good wholesome ending.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) starts out like that, but it has been abandoned (I think?).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I'm reading linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and this is a plot point near the beginning. Not quite done with it yet, so I can't say whether or not its ending is wholesome. Good luck with your search.

*** Didn't that fanfic had the stupid scene where Katie wants to go to the Yule Ball with Harry but declines because she already said yes to a dude she can't stand?

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Black Zetsu had always been paranoid. After Obito failed to heed his warnings about attacking Konoha, Black Zetsu decides that it was time he took a few precautions. How will Uzumaki Naruto, the pariah of Konoha deal with the devil itself especially when it offers so much. Rinnegan/Slightly cold Naruto.
