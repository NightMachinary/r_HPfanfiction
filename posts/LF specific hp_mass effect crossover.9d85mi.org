I cant remember much of it, i remember harry having built his own fleet, (with nanites, mining ships etc) and his ships became legendary after helping win the first contact war. I think he built 12 kilometre long ships. Might be a !mod harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Where it goes? ...That's still a mystery. But hey! "Chase that flighty temptress adventure," right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.
