** Voldemort forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand...

The door was flung open---the hinges screeched as they were torn off the wall---the words were already formed on his lipless mouth---

The nursery was empty. The cot was there, in the center, a canopy of glittering golden snitches spinning in the air above it, strung up on a mobile above the child's bed. There was a lump there, wrapped in a blanket from head-to-toe, silent and unmoving.

/Strange./

The one thing he hated most from the orphanage was the constant whining of the children.

/"Avada Ke---"/ he began.

Something in the air shifted. The snitches began spinning the other way around, throwing a constellation of golden flecks against the walls and ceiling.

Then something struck him, right in the back of the head. Something /crack/ed. His skull felt cold and hot and hot and cold, all at once; it felt like the first time he had held his hand over his school diary and willed a piece of himself, an inextricably profound piece of his being, his existence, to leave his body forever.

"Nothing personnel," said a woman's voice.

That was the last thing he heard.

** It was finally time.

Potter had fought well, just like he expected from a proud pure-blooded scion, but ultimately it was futile. He would not be denied. Could not be.

The prophecy child was the only thing standing in his way; Dumbledore was weak and old, his time long passed. It wouldn't be long until all of his opposition faltered. Then they would bow in the face of his brillance. He, Lord Voldemort, would prove to be the greatest wizard to ever live. He would take the isles and shape them in to his vision before moving on to the mainland. And then the rest of the world.

He could almost taste the victory.

The warding placed upon the nursery door was impressive but nothing he couldn't handle. It took him only a few moments to bring them down before a flick of his wand flung open the door. The room was dark; the only light coming from the window. He scanned the room with suspicious eyes: where had the woman gone? He had personally seen to it that the Floo had been down and set up his own counter-measures to insure that there were no unwanted guest. The woman would have to run quite a distance before she would be able to leave the grounds for help. Did she run in terror and leave her husband and child to their fate?

No matter.

/At least I don't have to deal with Severus' whining/. The Dark Lord thought with narrowed eyes. Perhaps he would kill her anyway someday.

For now his focus was on the crib resting against the back wall; the bundle inside moving ever so slightly.

A small smile crept on to the demented warlock's face; this was his moment of triumph. With swift steps the man regally came to stand before his would-be adversary, staring down with contempt. To think fate would try to prevent his rise to glory with this pitiful creature. It was insulting to say the least.

He reached out with his left hand as he simultaneously raised his wand in the right. He would look the pathetic child in the eyes before he snatched the life away. Then he would parade the corpse before his followers; showing that not even prophecy could stand in the way of his conquest. It was all too perfect.

Except....

"What?"

He couldn't help his less than elegant response; the bewilderment he felt was genuine for this was no child. It was an abomination; as poor an example of transfiguration as he had ever seen. The creature even still seemed to be part fabric. It was not the work he would have expected from the Potter man and his woman given their reputation. It was almost as if the job had been rushed-

The realization came a split second too late.

"HAAAA!"

Voldemort hadn't even managed to turn around when the first blow hit him; striking with enough force to send him crashing forward in to the crib. Only a quick grasp helped him from falling completely to the ground. The man moved as swiftly as he was able, rage beginning to build up from both his embarrassment and the woman's audacity-

CRACK!

The Dark Lord barely managed to stifle his cry of pain as the second strike landed perfectly on his outstretched hand; snapping his wrist and sending his wand flying away. The next came just as quickly. And then another before he found himself slumping to the ground. Desperation rose up as he forced himself on to his back and lashed out with his free hand; the wand-less banishing charm catching the woman mid-swing and sending her flying in to the wall as her weapon of choice, a frying pan of all things, fell to the ground. With a groan Voldemort forced himself to roll over as he quickly searched for his wand. Disgust overtaking him as he was forced to crawl on his knees.

There! His good hand reached out to summon it-

Only for his world to go white with pain as something slammed painfully in to the back of his head. The Dark Lord tumbled back on to the ground as he struggled to clear his head with Occlumency. The pain receded enough for him to realize what had happened; she had banished the damn pan in to the back of his head. With considerable effort the man cleared his eyesight and tried to rise again- Only to be sent back down as she returned with another hit. Again and again she struck hit until he was barely conscious; all the while the great warlock screamed out insults and hissed threats in Parseltounge. He would make sure this bitch would suffer.

Then she stopped and stepped away giving him a moment to breathe as he fought to focus himself. But before he could even move again the woman returned and rolled him over with a foot; leaving the Voldemort to stare up at her from his back. He glared hatefully with his glowing blood red eyes only to see equal disgust reflected in her own emerald green. The sliver of moonlight touched upon her at an angle leaving the expression of utter loathing clear to him.

In one hand she had the child; a mirror image of the man he had murdered minutes ago with the exception of the wide green eyes that matched his mother's. And in her other had...

It was in that moment that Tom Riddle knew he had fucked up.

"You whore." He barely managed to grind out. "You stupid mud-blood who-"

"For my James you son of a bitch." The woman hissed through her teeth. "And for everyone else you've killed."

A pinprick of light began at the end of her wand. It was green; a green he knew all too well.

For the first time in years Tom Riddle knew fear.

"Go to hell bastard."

In that brief moment a funny thought occurred to the man.

At least he went to his first death at the work of his favorite spell.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort approached the small cottage slow and methodical, soaking up the atmosphere. It was Hallow's Eve, and the Autumn air was crisp and chilly. Children skipped and screamed with their parents, hounding strangers for chocolates and lollies. It annoyed him. Frankly, if he wasn't already busy today, he'd have set the entire town aflame

  But he was busy, feet silently gliding across a cobblestone path. Were he to give the Potters any credit, he'd have said that their garden was immaculate, and that the little cottage had its own rustic charm. It wasn't like the Malfoy Manor, of course. Rustic and small, befitting a small family. Maybe, after the War, he might take the Potter homestead for himself. A little retreat from the nagging sycophants that were his followers.

  Food for thought, perhaps. Before that, though, the Potters.

  At the end of the cobble path stood a tall and wide door. Oak, from the looks of it, with a stained glass design depicting a deer and doe standing proud in a meadow grass and flowers. /Okay/, Voldemort thought, /that'll be the first to go after renovations/...

  With a flick of his wrist, he probed the door. Voldemort knew of the Fidelius Charm, but Rat hadn't mentioned anything else. He didn't know anything else. So better safe than on the wrong end of some curse. The Potter boy might be too proud to delve into such magic, but it was the Lily he needed to watch out for.

  A few seconds later, and Voldemort was sure the door was just locked. /Well, we can't have that!/

  He flicked their wrist, and silently cast the /Alohomora./ The door clicked, and opened ajar. Child's Play. Through the threshold, Voldemort peered around, searching. He knew the Potters weren't a match for him, but he wasn't going to take any chances with the couple who thrice defied him.

  The entryway was empty. The lounge room adjoining was similarly empty, though it was clear someone lived in there recently. Odd.

  Hmm... Voldemort glid over to the lounge room, casting his eyes around. "/Homenum revelio,/" he hissed.

  The spell did its magic -- a faint and transparent energy filled the room like a wave. And like a wave crashing against a rock, the energy splashed against something vaguely human-shaped a few feet away, leaving whoever it was sparkling red in the well-lit lounge.

  Voldemort barely had a second to realise what he saw before the figure moved lightning fast.

  /CRACK!/

  Pain exploded in his hand, and Voldemort couldn't help but cry out. The yew wand flew across the room, falling behind the couch. All the Dark Lord could do, was look up and stare at his attacker.

  It was the Potter boy, standing at the ready with what looked to be a bludgers bat, if longer and made of metal.

  Voldemort sneered, opening his mouth to curse the reckless Gryffindor, but before he could, he swung again, striking the Dark Lord in the face.

  /CRACK!/

  White exploded into Voldemort's vision, dancing lights joined by throbbing wet pain, before the cold, hard floor met his face. But the Potter boy didn't stop there. Instead, he continued laying into the fallen Dark Lord, righteous fury and hatred fueling each of his powerful swings.

  "STAY!"

  /CRACK!/

  "AWAY!"

  /CRACK!/

  "FROM!"

  /CRACK!/

  "MY!"

  /CRACK!/

  "FAMILY!"

  With a final swing of Lily's baseball bat, an old gift from Petunia, Voldemort's head popped opened much like a watermelon. And, when he finally returned, Voldemort continued to harbore a severe phobia of baseball and all that it entailed.
