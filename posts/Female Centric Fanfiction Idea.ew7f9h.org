Just a quick question- what female characters do people feel are underused in fanfiction? I was thinking of doing a fem-centric fic with Ginny, as there isn't much about her... what do other people think?


** Lavender Brown. She's an awkward girl who substitutes gossip for social skills, and throughout her time at Hogwarts basically only manages to make two friends -- Parvati and Seamus (who everyone seems to forget was friends with Lavender). She spends the beginning of book five super conflicted, because Seamus pressures her to disbelieve Harry, but she's still one of the first to show up and one of the most eager to join the DA. She's also mentioned in the same breath as Ginny and Luna and Neville in book seven, being one of the most important members of the reconstituted DA. Then Greyback kills her more or less off-screen, and random people on the internet write several millions of pages of fanfiction where she is portrayed either as stupid and ditzy or as a minor antagonist, because what people remember her for is a disastrous relationship where she acts highly insecure as she realizes that her boyfriend is in love with another woman, told primarily through the lens of her romantic rival and her romantic rival's best friend.

  AU. Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to go back, she can't resist getting involved when she realises her memories may be the key to thwarting Voldemort's plans. But can staying lead to anything but heartbreak for her?

** I highly recommend checking out The Changeling! It's a Ginny-centric fic that centers around powerful women supporting themselves and each other. Definitely one of my favorites of all time.

****** *The Mists of Avalon*

The Mists of Avalon is a 1983 fantasy novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, in which the author relates the Arthurian legends from the perspective of the female characters. The book follows the trajectory of Morgaine (often called Morgan le Fay in other works), a priestess fighting to save her Celtic culture in a country where Christianity threatens to destroy the pagan way of life. The epic is focused on the lives of Gwenhwyfar, Viviane, Morgause, Igraine and other women of the Arthurian legend.

The Mists of Avalon is in stark contrast to most other retellings of the Arthurian tales, which consistently cast Morgan le Fay as a distant, one-dimensional evil sorceress, with little or no explanation given for her antagonism to the Round Table.

** Id love to read a Ginny-centric story. Loved Annerb's The Changeling and its sequels. Go for it, and if you need any help, check out the Harryand Ginny discord page. A lot of greatg writers hang out there, including Annerb and FloreatCastellum and the DistantDusk and they are all great to ask advice from.
