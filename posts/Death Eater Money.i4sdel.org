After the debacle that was the Department of Mysteries battle, Voldemort devised a cruel scheme to both punish his followers and string out a higher degree of effectiveness from them.

Under fear of torture and death, the Death Eaters were forced to deposit all of their monies and assets (as well as sign over their properties) to the re-established House of Slytherin, its empty vaults reopened at Gringotts.

With access to all they own, Voldemort freely doled out their money (and allowed them to stay in their own homes) for good performance. Leading to a stint of horrific crimes and brutal efficiency on the Death Eaters parts...

...all before Harry (with the aide of a bemused but smug Dumbledore and a slew of hysteric Gringotts goblins) utilised anciet Rite of Conquest laws to claim full ownership over Slytherin house and bankrupt the Dark Lord and his followers in an afternoon.

All part of the plan.

This was a plotpoint in an older fanfic of mine called "Redgrave" in which, as a retaliation for tricking him into thinking Sirius was in danger, Harry incepted the idea into Tom's head, knowing that the powertrip would be too enticing for the Dark Lord to refuse.

This also horribly backfired, as the Death Eaters (with nothing left to lose) opened up a full scale, open conflict with the Aurors and Order before fleeing into Europe and beyond as the tides turned against them. Evading justice for years after the fact.


** I like the idea of only being able to take the Lordship if you are one hundred percent human. Use the Pureblood's own laws against the so-called champion of "purebloods". I wouldn't call book 5/6/7's Voldemort human, he's more of a necromantic homonculus. Even then, with Dumbledore saying Tom looked "remarkably different" when he showed up for the DADA position, he could have lost his humanity then with rituals and whatnot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1/Ah-Screw-It][Ah, Screw It!]] uses the fact that Voldemort had the Death Eaters swear fealty to Slytherin House. Harry pulls rite of conquest and effectively becomes their leigelord/owner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] also has the rite of conquest + fealty oaths. But it's more of a post-war society rebuilding fic.
