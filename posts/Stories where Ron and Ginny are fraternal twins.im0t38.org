Is there anything out there where Ginny and Ron are fraternal twins? I mean, Molly has 7 kids and one set of identicals already so it doesn't seem like a stretch. It would be interesting if Ginny was in the same year as the Golden Trio.

  Harry had never had friends, so he imagined one: a red-haired girl he kept forgetting to name. Ginny imagined a shy boy with untidy hair and bright eyes, a boy who knew nothing of magic, so she told him. He dreamt of a world of magic and of a girl who wanted to be his friend. She dreamt of a boy who loved to hear her voice, no matter what. Then dreams became a reality when Harry met Ginny.(on indefinite hiatus.)

**** At least teenagers (or older children, which is what they were in the beginning of the story) behaved like mentally healthy older children, not paedophile's dream (fault of most soul-bond stories).

Orphaned account. Even bigger F.

I've seen fics come back from 4-year hiatuses (hiati? How do you even pluralize "hiatus"?) and go back to updating regularly, but once an account's been orphaned/deleted there's no coming back from that.
