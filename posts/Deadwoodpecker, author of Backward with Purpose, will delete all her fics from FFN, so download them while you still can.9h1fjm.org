** I don't understand why authors do this. It happens a bunch with game mods as well, they get tired of the work and somehow deleting stuff is an answer to their problem?

The internet means it still exists, all that is accomplished is making your work less accessible to those who wish to enjoy it. Instead of linking someone to fanfic.net we resort to bootleg .epub file downloads which may not work in a few years when someone stumbles across them.

*** As someone who has deleted works off FF.net, for me the reason was simply that I no longer liked those works. I don't mind them floating around the internet, but I don't want to advertise them either.

It's essentially the same reason as why people don't upload awful pictures of themselves and set them as their profile pic on social media. Some might call this vanity; I prefer to think of it as image management ;)

**** Hm. Personally, I am staunchly against the "right" of artists to keep their works from the public. If you put it out once, you have no right to take it back and deprive people who /did/ enjoy it of it. This goes for fanfiction as much as for movies, television, books, etc.

(I believe there ought to be a law where if the copyright-holder of a book or movie or music hasn't made that item available to the public in fifteen years, they'd lose the right to do so for a year while some government agency would make them available online for a small, set price. If at the end of the year they're ready to rerelase it /themselves/ it'll be taken off the government site.)

I have a fic I wrote years ago that is /terrible/, but it's receiving some positive reviews even now and out of respect for the posters thereof, I've kept it up, with an added Author's Note at the beginning saying "I'm keeping this up because of my principles but yes, I know, not that great... here are the titles of some other, newer fics of mine you should probably be reading instead".

***** I know this is an older post, but I can assure you that no one wanted her to take anything down üôÅ. Everyone is in agreement that she is absurdly talented and an asset to the fanfiction community. Deleting fanfic was entirely her choice, and it doesn't look like she's going to do that anyway. (And it's just my opinion, but I feel she welcomed everyone into her personal life by inviting the entire H/G subreddit to friend her on Facebook. If she'd intended true privacy, all of this could have been avoided.)
