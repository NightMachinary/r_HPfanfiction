/" 'Sorry harry, my hands are tied' his sapphire orbs twinkling like millions of stars in the night sky"/ what the actual fuck? Not only did it have the over-used "my hands are tied" line and dumbledore bashing, but it described his eyes in a sorta... romantic way? Huh?

*** Oh man, this one gets me.

There was a story I was reading a bit ago (Lord Mortis), which had an interesting premise, but the author would.not.stop using "Avada Kedavra" to describe Harry's eyes. Everyone in the story would use this description when taking about Harry.

I had to nope out by the 8th chapter because it was just so overused by that point.

Per Merriam-Webster: "amoral implies an awareness of moral standards, but a lack of concern for them while acting."

***** I am not entirely sure that he is "aware of moral standards " with this particular issue. I just saw it as Harry having trust issues so crippling (for good reasons) that he has to literally raise/teach his wives/servitors from childhood. He goes to some lengths to ensure that they are loyal to him. It will be a brilliant writing exercise when/if it backfires on him in some way. Seems unlikely so far.

Edit: The situation in this fic is actually a lot more complicated than It appears at first sight which is precisely what makes it interesting. Harry's age for one- he is physically a child, but mentally anywhere between 13 and 90. Unlike several other fics this Harry is quite honest about his origins and intentions. His grooming is neither malicious nor sexual in nature. The worldbuilding and magic system are excellent enough to give it a chance.

To be immoral is to have or subscribe to a moral code, and then act against that, to do something that you know is 'wrong'. The a- prefix means 'without', for example 'asexual'.

**** I took a stab at that fic just due to the controversy and interest it generated, and I'm convinced the author was going for something other than some kind of twisted power fantasy Harry. Sending somebody dreams is a very Morgana or Nimue thing to do, and that fits both with the Harry Potter aesthetic, and the age of the wizarding society as depicted in DPSW. Where it gets weird, from a writing perspective at least, is how that led into a shounen anime filler episode where the side characters train their new ninjutsu or something.

Normally, that's the sort of thing you find in the 95% of fanfics which are painful to read for their technical failures, but DPSW isn't a mess. What technical problems it has are pretty minor, and compared to fanfic as a whole, that alone puts it way ahead of the pack. For example, the not-ninjutsu side character training chapters (plural) are like 15k words long and exist at least as much to establish character as they do to justify later magical feats. By the time Ginny, Luna, and Alex arrive at Hogwarts, it's incredibly easy to picture how they carry themselves, what motivates them, and what they think of each other. Half the fics recommended here can't accomplish that.

I don't really know what to make of it. If I do a mental tally of everything I read, it sounds like it would be a trainwreck written by somebody who would have been institutionalized 60 years ago. That mental tally is almost an [[/r/HPfanfiction]] allergy list, word for word, down to /twinkly-eyed manipulative Dumbledore/ and /punching bag entitled Potter brother./ Despite that, I found it easy to read.

But who knows, maybe the author will turn out to be a psycho. I just hope his manifesto has well-written filler episodes.

Any single one of these tropes would be a huge warning sign. Yet the story is quite well written even if it does lead to some ridiculous situations.

** One fanfic crossover started disguised as wholesome kids' adventures in Hogwarts, but then, out of blue, sh*t river of Dumbledore bashing just flooded the narrative. Apparently he mind-controlled Dursley into brutally beating Harry. How brutally? Well there is medical checkup Harry undergoes because of crossover characters' intervention. Results of check-up are never shown to reader, but it works as bashing activation agent every time some character looks at it. It works like this:

1. Character X learns what Dumbledore did to Harry.
2. Character X goes berserk even if it is completely out of character for them and they have no fighting potential what-so-f*cking ever.
3. Character X brutally beats shit out of Dumbledore.

Rinse and repeat. But cherry on the top is that author claims that his portrayal of Dumbledore is completely canonical and that Dumbledore deserves this cycle of torture, to the point of author claiming *to speak with three criminologists that said that all signs show that Dursleys definitely brutally beat Harry off screen*! But I was too invested in the characters introduced in the first arcs to just drop this malarkey. So what made me flip my lead?

Also, in this particular example I got pissed off because author spend chapters torturing Dumbledore for flaws that he doesn't have hiding behind claim to objectivity, yet went out of his way to give Bellatrix "free out of jail cart". This fic also contained "Narcissa was good all along and secretly love with Lupin since school" Apparently author doesn't care that they had only three years overlap, making creepy image of 15-18 years old Narcissa secretly dating 11-14 year old Remus, but simply ignored it as it was on far background. But the second most morally repugnant character getting scot-free? Nope.

** I was reading a romance fic, I think it was Harry x Daphne and Daphne had just finished explaining that she was named for the Sea Nymph Daphne from Greek Mythology.

For those unaware, due to curse reasons the God Apollo became obsessed with Daphne, chasing her against her wishes, just before Apollo forces himself upon Daphne she begs her father (a river god) for help. Her father turns her into a laurel tree, and henceforth Apollo adopts the symbol of a laurel wreath.

Harry's response upon being told this was to comment how "romantic" the story is. That was the moment that I realised I wasn't that into this story and left.

And Dumbledore holding onto Harry's Gringotts key until he's escorted to Diagon Alley just /makes sense/. Who else is gonna hold onto it? The fucking Dursleys? Remember that Dumbledore trusts almost /nobody/ and justify that.

Also- THE GOBLINS CAN'T REMOVE SOUL PIECES FROM THINGS, /OR FROM HARRY/, WITHOUT HARMING THEM.

And while I'm at it - Harry /does not/ get beaten. Vernon all but explicitly says this with his "Nothing a good beating wouldn't've cured-" comment. He sleeps in the cupboard under the stairs, where he is occasionally confined as punishment, he is given chores /as punishment or on special occasions/ such as making breakfast on Dudley's birthday or being made to work for hours outside for scaring Dudley with "magic", his cousin beats him up (when he can catch him) while his parents turn a blind eye, and he is occasionally denied meals as punishment. THIS IS STILL ABUSE. THE DURSLEYS STILL DESERVE TO PAY. I just hate when a fanfic presents a Dursley family that regularly calls Harry "freak" (The first time Petunia says that word in Harry's presence is in the Hut-On-The-Rock) to the point where he doesn't know his own name, or a Vernon that beats Harry up when he's drunk. It implies (to me, anyway) that the author doesn't consider what we actually see evidence of to be 'real' abuse, which is just /wrong/.

** “They opened the door and walked into see Mcgonagall, Dumbledore, Fred, George, Ron, Percy, Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley. Mcgonagall sat behind the desk, Dumbledore near to the Weasleys, and the Weasley family were huddled together crying.

It was Mcgonagall who was the first to notice the new arrivals. ‘Mister Potter? Miss Weasley!?'

It seemed like the entire Weasley family apparated, as they were almost surrounding Ginny while her parents hugged her at a strength just below being too tight to breathe. Harry was noticeably excluded from the family reunion. Harry heard Ron quietly mutter under his breathe, ‘Potter probably decided not to follow through with his threat'”

From: Ablus and Harry's world trip

I can't tell if it's satire or not. If it is, please tell me.

There was also a fic where Snape adopts a dying young Harry, and it somehow turns into a Dumbledore and Mcgonagall bashing fic???? I clicked off the moment Lily's ghost just started to bash her out of nowhere.

*** I'm currently coming up blank on how that logic works here. Well, specifically the vague "somehow" part. Like, I could see a fic bending thing such that Ron otherwise paid the Slytherins to call Hermione a mudblood to win favor by standing up for her, but I more see this as something Molly or Dumbledore would do in those kinds of fics, not 12y.o. Ron personally...

Unless it's like with how he calls Luna "Looney", but that implies that the Slytherins overheard him making the insult and liked it, which... Actually makes more sense if the rich pure bloods are more sheltered because high brow aristocrats/nobles/etc. are expected to be well behaved and thus wouldn't be exposed to such foul language so early in life. Still questions why they would have a chance to hear Ron using Mudblood, because even in first year before they were friends he only called her a know it all... Unless this is one of those "Harry wasn't there to hear how horrible his friend was talking about someone else"...

Yay\s, I figured out some ways it counts as Ron's fault for why Slytherins called Hermione Mudblood. I'm stopping this rabbit hole now.

He speaks like that the whole time and tries to negotiate as if he knew anything about finances, though the fic starts with a canon-ish Harry so it's weird how he suddenly speaks like that.

***** Got to admit, it does get more than a little old seeing every wife in the series introduced as <name> <surname> nee <maiden name>. I mean why do we as readers care what family these people used to belong to before their marriages?

Same can be said for the amount of Harry (or 'ennobled' version) Potter, Heir of several dozen dead houses. I mean I can see him being heir of the Potter family and the Evans family because they're his parents' families, I can stretch to Black, or at least what Sirius gets, but the rest.... They should all be dead by this point. Heck /most/ of the Purebloods need dope slapped accepting Riddle's claims of being 'Heir of Slytherine' in spite of the family being disolved and the only known remnant being the Gaunts. Presuming they're not BSing.

** This one I got only a few paragraphs into before I noped out:

I had asked for recs on H/Hr fics that followed the “deleted” premise where the Potters lived on an island, the Grangers on the shore nearby, Mr Granger see an explosion, rows out finds Harry, he grows up alongside Hermione, etcetera etcetera.

Anyway, the writer had moved the timeline up from the story beginning in 1991, to 2009. Harry and Hermione have been “exposed” to the Internet. I stopped reading only a few paragraphs in. When it mentioned them exposing to each other about knowing about the other's hentai collection.

No, just no. Just my luck that writer turned out to be a weeb. Did I mention that they were supposed to be First Years at that point? It may have been an H/Hr fic following a premise I was looking for, but shit like that just ain't worth it. Makes me afraid to know what else there would've been. And it was only Rated-T??

A creature fic that covers the reaction of whoever the MC is as well as the reaction of their friends/family, and attempts to realistically portray how the MC deals with it? I would be all for that.

That said the vast, vast majority of the creature fics I have looked at use the inheritance as an excuse to pair the MC with a completely arbitrary other character of the writer's choice because reasons. For some reason it seems to always be either Malfoy or Snape, not sure why. I guess Sturgeon's Law applies to creature fics even moreso than to regular fanfiction.

Maybe I'm finicky, but hate it when authors keep changing pairings in a story. I don't like harems/multi for a reason. If you pair A with B, then you have to stick to A/B throughout the story and not insert character C somewhere in the middle. I hate jealousy tropes.
