For those of you who aren't aware of this charming, heartfelt and insane TV show currently airing in America (in Season 2 now), Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist is a show where Zoey goes into an MRI machine and some kind of weird glitch happens. When Zoey comes out of the MRI, she can hear people's deepest and darkest secrets and desires in the form of large-scale, highly choreographed musical numbers. The catch being that Zoey then HAS TO help the person who sang her a 'Heart Song' resolve whatever is bothering them OR, they will KEEP SINGING the song over and over again until Zoey decides to act.

It's bonkers.

So I thought, what if:

(1) Severus Snape got Zoey's power, including the caveat that he MUST act or be bombarded with hormonal teenagers singing songs at him that he wants NOTHING to do with.

(2) Snape is a very good legilimens, I imagine he uses the power so well and refines it with practice such that he opens his mind up to other people's minds almost unconsciously and can no longer keep a lid on it even if he wants to. OR something weird happens with his legilimency powers OR just whatever, something weird happens AND NOW Snape can hear the innermost thoughts and feelings of everyone around him in the form of song.

(3) I see this happening in Order of the Phoenix, or better yet, in HBP (when all the romantic entanglements were happening for our trio).

(4) I would love to see chapters dedicated to HarryxGinny / HermionexRonxLavender / LunaxMagical Creatures (because why not?) And the author has full freedom to go super weird.

(5) Like can you imagine Hermione and Lavender singing 'That Boy Is Mine' or Harry singing 'I would walk 500 miles' or Dumbledore, for whatever reason, giving Snape a rendition of 'All By Myself,' and when Snape leaves in disgust/horror, he bumps into Draco who sings the second half of 'All By Myself' and Snape is like UGH WHY? Snape goes for a Death Eater meeting and Voldemort leads a rendition of 'All I Do Is Win Win Win No Matter What' and generally, the entire Hogwarts population singing 'Satisfaction'. The possibilities are endless and only limited by the author's imagination.

Admittedly, this prompt cracked me up for a good 10 minutes as I imagined Snape running around pulling his hair out, horrified at everyone singing at him and being forced to help them with their issues OR ELSE.

Will be a total crack!fic of course.

Thoughts?
