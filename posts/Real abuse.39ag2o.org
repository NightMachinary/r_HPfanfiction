So I was wondering if JK really wrote about physical abuse in her books. I mean, I read in almost every second fanfiction how horrific the Dursleys are and that they beat Harry for virtually nothing. I'm having trouble believing that JK would state something similar or at least hint at it in a children's book. I only remember the chores part of the whole deal.


** Real abuse is sort of saying neglect isnt abuse....

Petunia tried to hit him with a frying pan.

They locked him under the cupboard without food.

The bits with Marge and her dog... threatning to stamp out the magic, etc.

*** Maybe I didn't ask my question right. I didn't mean to say that neglecting a child isn't abuse, but it's more psychological I think. Getting no love etc. doesnt physically hurt, but emotionally. My question was aimed strictly at the physical part.

**** In canon there's very little that's concrete about Harry home life and you have some wiggle room in interpretation. I think the sum total of explicit physical violence between the Dursleys and Harry is when Harry is being bodily thrown into the cupboard. Well... and then everything that Dudley and co. do to him.

But it's worth pointing out that Harry didn't seem to think that Petunia trying to hit him with a frying pan was unusual, and just casually ducks it like he's had practice doing the same. There are hints there that paint an ugly picture for a children's book. The early books kind of gloss over what really should have been some fairly mentally traumatizing events such as Quirell's death. It's not until book 4 when the target audience had grown up a bit that Harry starts to react poorly to his terrible life. Given that this is also when Voldemort puts a chip in the blood protections, perhaps lily's magic was helping Harry hold it together?

******* The problems with the pairings were much more obvious in comparison, Harry marrying a girl that looks just like his mother (with a different eye colour), whom he only gets interested in after his main link with his origins (Sirius) dies.

Ginny marrying her childhood (and we're talking pre-puberty here) celebrity crush who's first real contact with her was him saving her life. Any other real contact has been with him teaching (DA) her or leading (quidditch, battle) her in some manner. Great basis for an equal relationship.

And I'm not even going to touch on my issues with the Ron/Hermione ship because I'm still actually angry about that, even after all these years.

********* I'll try not to focus too much on how much I dislike Ron in this description, but I do realize my opinion of him might further color it.

I consider Ron the kind of guy that wants a wife just like his mother, a stay at home mum who runs the entire household and has dinner on the table when he comes home. Hermione obviously does not fit this profile. The only thing that really has him passionate is Quidditch and it's one of the few things that hold absolutely zero interest for Hermione.

From Hermione's POV, Ron seems frantically opposed to the idea of learning things as well as having to work to achieve something, whereas gathering knowledge is vital for her and she absolutely throws herself at her goals. He has bullied her regarding this basically since they met and he only relents on it when trying to get her to allow him to copy her homework.

I honestly don't see anything that they have in common aside from some shared friends and proximity.

I'm not sure if you're joking or not but any way you cut it, it's rough. There's definitely a psychological component with physical as well so there is more to it than getting physically hurt, although that should be be bad enough.

** They were absolutely abusive, their behavior is enough to get children removed from the home where I live.

As for specifically *physical* abuse as in Petunia or Vernon hitting him, I don't believe that's canon. Threats, sure, but I don't recall it being followed through. Though it's implied that Harry may have been hit with kitchenware before.

Though if he was actually thrown into his cupboard, that does qualify as physical assault/abuse, even if it only happened once. Again, may be regional, but CPS where I am certainly thinks that qualifies.

*** Not everyone forgets. That's actually something that's used frequently in stories centered around developing Neville's character- his family treated him questionably, and the small hints and few events we know about are often expanded on. Regardless of fanon, it's canon that at least part of his family didn't treat him properly.

*** That bit is a perfect representation of the common wizarding mentality: better dead than a squib. It's not abuse because Neville wasn't a person- he didn't have magic, so he didn't qualify as one. It's the exact thing that Harry suffered inverted- Harry was a freak, not a person. All of these things do not a healthy psyche make.

If we judge by what the text says, there wasn't much physical violence from Vernon and Petunia. Just moderate to severe starvation, imprisonment, and neglect.

** Personally I think the fanDOOM has taken the abusive!Dursleys to an extreme flanderizing them to ridiculous levels.

Most writers don't get that the whole point of Harry's crappy life was to make Hogwarts feel even more amazing that it already was, and I'm not talking about an in-universe evil plot by Dumbledore to control Harry but something J.K. Rowling decided.

Have you ever watched Disney's Cinderella? would that story have been the same if Cinderella wasn't "abused" by the stepmother and stepsisters? is the same in Harry Potter!

a lot of people talk about that one time petunia swung a frying pan towards Harry's head. its called slapstick

What about the starving to death for days and days?!

I'll just leave this quote here from Philosopher's Stone

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. Page 98

We also need to consider that Harry, for all that is worth doesn't act like an abused traumatized child.

** JK definitely wrote about abuse in the series. Abuse has many forms, from neglect, manipulation, physical and verbal. The problem is that the magical world is set in the Victorian era. For that era the abuse everyone goes through is acceptable socially. Neville is abused by his family. What kind of family throws their kid out the window? Snape was abused as a kid. Snape verbally abuses children in his class. Sirius was abused as a child, his family thre dark curses at him so he ran away to the potters. Remus was abused by the magical world for being a victim. And we all know Harry's abuse. While JK doesn't blatantly outline the abuse in her books. You can see its there. Abuse is present in her books by modern day western standards.

***** Overindulging a child isn't the best way of upbringing either.

One could further develop the quoted line of reasoning by saying that Vernon was trying two opposite, yet equally skewed, parental role models. One where he always resorted to punishing the child even if that would be the “unfair” thing to do, and one when, no matter what, he always indulged the child's whims and caprices because he didn't want it to go through the same harsh childhood that he himself did.

  I've always had quite a high pain-threshhold and an ability to brush off mild to moderate pain and just keep going which I attribute in part to the fact that I wasn't hit as a child, with the result that pain has no negative emotional associations for me, other than being painful. I find being hit by somebody during an altercation no different, emotionally, from stubbing my toe.
#+end_quote

"I, an adult, have a high threshold for pain and am not affected by it emotionally, therefore that should be our standard for what is abusive treatment of a child."

#+begin_quote
  And if you're under stress and you tell someone who can't do anything practical to help but who instead gets terribly upset about it and starts going "Oh you poor thing", it just adds another burden on top of the original problem, because then you feel responsible for having upset them, and they just get under your feet.
#+end_quote

Wat.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys make Harry sleep in the understair cupboard but it's big enough to hold Harry, Vernon and a bed at the same time without apparent difficulty. We know that an actual off-the-floor bed is meant, not just a matress or bedroll on the floor, because Harry loses his socks under it and when he finds them there's a spider on one of them, which would be most unlikely if the sock had been pressed flat against the floor. So it's a proper bed, and even if it's a small child's bed it'll be at least 55" by 27" and if a camp bed, 6ft by 2ft, plus space to crane over and rummage underneath it.
#+end_quote

Now you're just making terrible fucking excuses for neglect. There is no way that Harry, Vernon "Fatass" Dursley and a bed that size fit in a /cupboard under the stairs/. And even if it were, it's still /fucking neglect/. It's still a cramped, dark hole they stick Harry in because, as they constantly remind him, he's not good enough for a proper room.

#+begin_quote
  It sounds as if it probably resembles the understair cupboard... blah blah more personal anecdotes excusing an unacceptable situation.

  Lots more creative interpretation of canon to excuse the Dursleys' behavior

  Harry's stoicism to Blood-Quill is not a sign that he's used to being severely physically abused because if he /were/ abused, he wouldn't be able to demonstrate such stoicism in the first place --- the traumatic emotional pain combined with the basic physical one would've been too much to bear.
