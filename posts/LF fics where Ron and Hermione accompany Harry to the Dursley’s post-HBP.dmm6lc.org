I feel like this was a popular thing pre-DH but I can't seem to find any.

Finished, unfinished, just in the first chapter, give me anything that shows the trio showing up on the Dursley's doorstep.


** I've always wanted to see this too because I was sure it would happen before DH came out but I've never been able to find one :(

** Well, it is Harry & Ginny, but the first four chapters (which really should be a separate story standing on its own) in linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) are this. Also, linkao3(An Unexpected Meeting by ballerinaroy).

  Harry and his friends finally know who killed Ginny and Luna's classmate, Colin Creevey. It is 2001, and the search has been ongoing for a year. Will those final few foes who escaped justice at the end of The Battle ever be brought to justice?

  Harry had not intended to ever see the Dursleys again. Their parting at Privet Drive felt like a proper close to their relationship. That was until he'd viewed Snape's memories and suddenly he'd been burdened with questions of his mother that no one else could answer.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
