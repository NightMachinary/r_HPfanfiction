I read Altered Destinies recently, and I got hooked on the whole war thing. I'm looking for the realistic stuff with possible deaths, either a resistance-type guerilla or full-on war, whatever. Anybody got more? Ship doesn't matter. I heard jbern's "To Fight the Coming Darkness" is pretty good, any word on that? Thanks!


** Can't get much better than linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined]]), in my opinion. In this AU, Fudge decides to try 'appease' Voldemort rather than ignore him in 5th year, and this means lots of Nazi Germany-style laws against Muggleborns. This leads to Hermione becoming a fugitive and starting a Muggbleborn Resistance that fights both the Ministry and the Death Eaters, muggle style.

*** Sounds fantastic. Looks like a lengthy war judging by the word count. Thanks for the rec.

*** I concur, it's my favorite war fic. Both good and bad guys are portrayed competently, and reactions of people caught between the two sides are interesting.

***** Following stories all have some great war actions, but they all have some problems:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is generally very good, but its writing quality varies. The battles and politicking were really nice, but some later battles felt like animes, and I think Magicals were depicted as too weak vs Muggles.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has many excellent small-unit actions and Ops, but it's set in a non-magical AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), was actually written by the same author of "Divided and Entwined". There are lots of good fight scenes and strategies in this one, but I think the protagonists had it too easy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]], linkffn(5435295), has some great war actions in the last 10 chapters, but most of the stories dealt with a Harry/Ginny soul bond.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is a highly entertaining civilization building and war story, but it's extreme sci-fi featuring techs from both SW and SG universes.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** It's realistic if the story wasn't set in the 1980s, years after Grindelwald and his support of Muggle Hitler.

**** In the story, which is an AU, Hitler wasn't supported by Grindelwald. There, the wizards generally don't give a damn about muggle politics - there's still Magical Prussia, no united Magical Germany. Magical France never had a revolution, and no one in magical Poland gives a damn about how often muggle Poland was split.

Incidentally, in the story, Grindelwald recruited a lot of disenfranchised muggleborns for his conquest of Magical Europe, which caused a backlash against them in many countries. Dumbledore pretty much was the driving force for making Britain the most welcoming place for muggleborns - which worked as long as no one could stand up to him.

**** Technically, it's set in the 90s, and, also, we don't actually know anything about the relationship between Grindelwald and Hitler, whether in canon or in /D&A/.

In any case, how would either of these make the warfare in the story unrealistic?
