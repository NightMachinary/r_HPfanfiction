A plot bunny hit me today, making me want to write a fic in the point of view of a very minor canon character like Kevin Entwhistle and just explore the Hogwarts life, the lessons, the Hogsmeade weekends, just life in general. Do any of you know a fic like that out there? If not I might consider writing one, as an experiment of character building in an established setting.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/3/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] by Blu Taiger. (If you accept that Calvin, of /Calvin and Hobbes/ fame, is a canon character). 90k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Calvin is eighteen and living in England with his folks. Now, he's faced with the task of telling Susie what he's been doing for the past seven years.

(Seriously, a great many stories follow this minor character POV script.)

*** That was amazing, a little silly at times, but a good read. Thanks for the suggestion :-)
