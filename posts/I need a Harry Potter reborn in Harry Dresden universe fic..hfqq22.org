Anything related is welcome, but the perfect fic would have Harry reborn in the HD universe without the HP universe magic (so no wand or blood protection or animagus form or anything). However, since Harry did manage to pass his classes and go on to have a successful wizarding career in his original life, he'd have a talent/understanding/familiarity for magic that other humans in HD don't.


** There sadly aren't any good HP/Dresden crossovers that aren't abandomed at a ridiculoudly early point besides The Denarian Renegade and sequels. At least ones that I'm aware of.

** I don't know any stories like this. I sure would like to read about Harry and Harry though, I think they would get on well. I don't have the writing chops to do this and haven't read Dresden in years.

** There are few enough good Dresden Files fanfics, much less crossovers. Your best bet is probably to write one yourself.

â€‹

One challenge is that even with his knowledge of magic, Harry will not understand how Dresden magic works- its quite a different system. What he will have is experience dealing with very dangerous situations- he knows how to think on his feet, and not freeze up in a crisis.

*** The problem is I didn't finish the HD books, or get very far in them. I liked the world but not the plot, unfortunately.

**** That's fair.

If you don't want to read the books all the way through, you could try listening to the audio books. They're narrated by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and he does an excellent job of voicing the characters.

** Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is the only good crossover that isn't abandoned after about 2 chapters

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

**** It's a fusion, both universes exist in the same world. Wand-wizards know next to nothing about Dresden magic, White Council-type wizards know next to nothing about wand-wizards.

***** I want one without HP magic - Harry Potter (the character) is in HD world without his wand. I personally dislike fusion stories.
