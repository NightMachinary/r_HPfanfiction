With the way the Dursley's were, I'm just thinking it'd be difficult to show things like love and support to young kids, and being all awkward about it.

No Weasley Bashing.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. The story doesn't have to be focused on romance.

It can be a major part of the story, or a minor part.

It can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** I think there is one named Harry Potter ad the Cursed Child...

** This fic is very, very long, and the author is rather fond of angst and dramatic monologues. That being said, for some reason I find her stories to be extremely compelling. You may bemoan the lack of Harry in most of the fic, but if you manage to keep reading there are some very emotionally satisfying scenes with him in them. This author has always fascinated me. She seems to have very little interest in the magical aspects of the world of Harry Potter, and the characters she writes about are basically all OCs because of how little we get to see them in canon. However, she is one of the most prolific fanfiction authors out there, with /millions/ of words written. She is extremely diligent, and has been on the site for nearly 20 years. I myself sometimes get exhausted just reading her fics, (I have the bad habit of rushing through books without taking the time to let chapters process and digest) and I can't imagine the time and dedication it took to write even one. Despite all this, I found this fic immensely enjoyable even if it did drag at times.

  This is a story about a boy entering into his final year at Hogwarts, determined to make it his best yet. A boy who lived and breathed Quidditch and craved that elusive Quidditch Cup more than anything (or so he thought). A boy who only ever wanted to find his place in the world and had to go through a lot of twists and turns to get there. This is the story of James Sirius Potter.
