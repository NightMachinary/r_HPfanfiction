Had a thought based off this one dbz fanfic idea and based off canon snape's view of harry, anyone know a fanfic where harry in fact does let the fame, money, glory etc go to his head and he becomes selfish, vain, mean and greedy? also it'd be great if harry isn't a mary sue and in fact his new behaviour isn't treated as a good thing at all, extra points if there's no bashing of other characters but not required


** I've seen plenty of stories that invoked this accidentally which usually act like Harry is justified in his behaviour.

I've never seen something like this done intentionally aside from the evil twin in WBWL stories.

It might be an interesting premise though.

** linkffn(Stange Reflections) has one of the Main conflicts be between post-war Harry and an alternate who had let his fame go to his head and listened to Lockhart.

  A fallen warrior. A revered mentor. The reflections of a comrade and friend. Is much better than it sounds.

** The closest I can think of is linkffn(6050866)

Then there are fics like /Black Comedy/ and /An Old and New World/ where Harry is sort of a selfish jerk, but it's played off in a comedic way.

It would be my favorite characterization, but unfortunately in most such fics Harry is either always right or so overpowered that there are never any negative consequences for being an asshole to everyone.

** While not exactly what you're looking for, I could recommend "The Devil's White Knight" on ao3 - kinda canon Harry suddenly wakes up in a world where his family is alive, Voldemort was defeated ages ago, and life should be perfect... only he took the place of a Harry who was absolutely spoiled terrible human garbage, and pretty much everyone acknowledges how awful he was.. and are very confused with the change :)

** Hey, come on. You know growing up with the Dursley's gave him a backbone, a healthy self esteem and self value, a good idea of who he is and where he comes from and the loving home to ground his character. How could this even happen?! /s

Interesting idea, I would love to read something like this.

** I think all the fics that have a character like this are WBWL fics. Just replace Harry with a jerk pretender.
