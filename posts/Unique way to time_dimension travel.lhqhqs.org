Now you could do this in various ways.

It could be a post-apocalyptic, or it could be a Rick Grimes type scenario, or even just canon compliant Harry, Ron and Hermione (at whatever age but post Deathly Hallows) dicking about with the Deluminator, and then they end up teleporting away to this alternate time/dimension.

It could be another alternative to doing so rather than falling through the Veil, for example, or being kissed by a dementor which has become quite popular.

And it kind of fits with the lore of the Deluminator being an apparition guide for its user, albeit a bit more powerful than it should naturally be.

Just a thought I thought I'd share with you all 😁 happy writing!


** Every Alchemist who had earned the right to call themselves an Alchemist had something that was uniquely their own. The Flamel's had their stone, the San Ticonderoga family had their Sun Gold, and Albus Dumbledore had... the 12 uses of dragon blood?

Oven cleaner? Seriously?

Press X for doubt bitches.

So when the trio as a group was gifted his Deluminator they were smashing the proverbial X button.

Something more was going on here and they wanted to figure it out.

Ron was sure it was something secret hidden somehow.

Hermione had been examining it for hours trying to pry its secrets.

Harry figured there was one way to know for sure.

Hermione and Ron both reached out to stop him when they realized what Harry was about to do.

""NO""!!!!

They managed to each grab his arm as he pressed down on the button.

Nothing happened and they all let out a collective breath as Hermione got ready to start an epic rant.

Only to stop as she heard the distinctive sound oh Ron's voice breaking in terror.

"Uh Harry, I don't think that was a good idea!"

They all turned to look only to feel their eyes widen before all they could see was a brilliant white light.

The last image that they would remember seeing was the sun growing exponentially larger in a few seconds before it impacted the porch they were on.

(ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ :｡･:/:･ﾟ'★,｡･:/:･ﾟ'☆

( : ౦ ‸ ౦ : )

They woke up roughly at the same time and looked around. They were in a library of some kind and the light of the sun was slanting into the room from the many windows.

Harry winced as he heard the long drawn out voice of Hermione speak his doom.

"Haaaaarrrrryyyyy James Potter! You just had to play with the powerful device left by an Alchemist of world renown."

Harry of course had a perfectly reasonable and eloquent reply to this slanderous accusation.

"Uh... I guess yeah, that seems about right."

Ron of course as his best friend had a perfectly solid back up for him.

"Bloody hell mate, you could have come up with a better lie than that!"

This required an immediate response from the inquisitive hero.

"Oh really Ron! Well you come up with one then!"

This got a long blink in reply before a more verbal reply came about.

"Sure mate here you go. The clearly magical thing must have triggered a compulsion after you kept poking it Hermione!"

Ron threw his hands in front of his chest as if to motion that it was that easy and he was handing such a simple answer to Harry.

Harry desperately grabbed onto the lifeline cast to him and turned to Hermione mouth already opening to agree with Ron's excellent excuse.

Only to stop and promptly shut it as he stared down the end of Hermione's wand.

"If you're going to make up an excuse to blame me boys don't do it right in front of me! How thick are you two? Honestly!"

Ron and Harry shared a sheepish glance together at her point.

"Sorry Hermione, I am not that good with boredom and we all knew we were going to push the button eventually. I just sped up the process is all."

Hermione started to huff before they heard an exclamation of triumph.

"See Wills! It's a perfectly legitimate excuse! Just skipping past the boring stuff and getting to the point!"

They turned to see a taller boy slightly younger than them with wild black hair as messy as Harry's. He was wearing clothes that were clearly of Dumbledore approved variety. Brightly colored button untucked over bright yellow shorts.

Then a female voice snorted and let out her reply.

"Clearly he subscribes to the Xander Harris school of Donuts and Rocket Launchers."

Ron mouthed Rocket Launcher as he tried to make sense of the clearly muggle word.

Hermione snorted as well back to the short red haired girl.

"Oh yes, we call it the Harry Potter Sword First, Wand Second style."

Harry shouted in indignation at that.

"Hey! Don't be jealous that the Sword of Gryffindor always answers my call! Not my fault I'm the only one of us that is a 'True Gryffindor'."

You could hear the smug and air quotes from his rant as Hermione huffed again.

Ron of course felt it would be best to point out something along those lines.

"Harry mate, speaking of the sword could you resheath the bloody thing! Also not all of us think the answer to everything is 'Hit it with the indestructible sword of instant death' and then use magic."

Harry was going to reply before the one named Xander beat him to the punch.

"Probably because he is the only one with an indestructible sword of instant death. It sure would be mine if I had one."

Hermione and Willow both sighed while giving each other looks of sympathy.

Harry of course sheathed his sword and reached out to hug his newfound brother in arms.

"See, he gets it! Nice to met you newest brother of mine!"

Xander recognized a brother in arms in the art of being a silly goof, prankster, and the one who does all the real work while everyone else over complicates things.

"Right here waiting for you to finally show brother! Welcome to Fabulous Sunnydale, home to the Gate to Hell!"

"Nice, where is this gate exactly. I thought Hell was just a Christian concept."

He turned to Hermione and Ron real quick.

"Either of you know anything about hell being real? As far as I knew only the Underland and Deepwood were real."

Their negative head shakes let him know what they were all already starting to suspect. They were a long ways from home.

None of them could feel the familiar pull of a ley line anywhere near them, or at all in fact. Adding in the strange sense of oppressive and restrained magic flooding from a well of power below their feet. Well that was not something any ministry of magic would have allowed to exist.

"I am guessing that well of violent and hate filled magic below us is the gate then?"

"Yes, so before this continues as the Watcher and Slayer we must insist we take this outside. Along with a much better explanation of who you are and how you arrived in a flash of light."

They turned at the sound of another British voice to see a middle aged man standing with a crossbow beside a younger girl holding a mace.

Hermione was only slightly more tactful then Ron, who was only better than Harry simply because Harry had spent his childhood either being ignored, worshiped or fighting some disaster.

"That sounds perfect, I really don't like the feeling of what is below us. How can you stand it?"

Giles smiled in a depreciating manner as they all stepped out the library.

"You never get used to it but you learn to ignore it."

** To be fair, the time travel method doesnt really matter.

Just have the protag waking up already in the new place instead of making a pointless first chapter.

*** Very true but if they did want to write it, it's always there for them to do so, and maybe the first chapter can be there as a sort of motivator or as something they can use to kickstart their writing muscles. And if they don't then they don't, they can just get the protagonist to wake up as you say, in the different reality and proceed from there. Either way, I'm sure the story will want to combat how and why the protagonist is in this time and place, and it would potentially help them down the line if they reached that point in the narrative.

Sorry for the late reply lmao
