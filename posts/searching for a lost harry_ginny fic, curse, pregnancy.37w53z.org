Hi everyone, I'm looking for a fanfiction that I read years ago (thinking around 2008 yikes!) in which Ginny and Harry are subject to some kind of curse that forces them to sleep together until Ginny becomes pregnant in order to save her life. It's unsurprisingly pretty angsty and dark, and is less about the sex more about the impact of the situation on all of the Weasleys etc. If anyone knows of this story and can remember what it's called or can provide a link I'd be really grateful!!


** Is it the one where Harry literally trades a piece of his soul for a piece of Ginny's in the CoS, and H/G have to couple until they conceive? And they get help from Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel?

I can't remember what this fic is called, but I know it as been rec'd in this sub; I'm posting my thoughts in hopes that someone else will be able to remember the name!

edit - read a bit more of Bonds of Blood, already linked, and realized it was the fic I was thinking of.

** Was it this? Harry and Ginny become soul-bonded after CoS.

**** Are you sure, because that fic is pretty much exactly what you described.
