** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] is probably one of the only ones I've read and enjoyed. That being said, the author slowed down drastically at the beginning of third year, and has been posting once every few months since. The story feels like it's been getting too complex and big, unfortunately. The author is still keeping it together, but I started feeling like I had to keep track of so many moving plot points at a time, with such a slow update cycle affected the quality a lot.

That said, it's an interesting fic, fun characters, one of the best Lockharts I've seen too. Give it a shot if you want to, but it is incomplete.

Edit: fucking hell, that opening paragraph is rougher than I remembered. Harry is not that swotty in the actual fic, and hasn't been called Hadrian or whatever yet either.

*** Well, Hadrian is the bullshit formal name he never actually goes by.

However, I'm ~90% certain this isn't actual WBWL. Rather, I think it is [[/spoiler][BWL and his Horcrux-Twin]] with Harry as the [[/spoiler][Horcrux-Twin]].

*** I'm hoping that when the story actually gets to the point of the prologue he's just going to rewrite the prologue scene completely. I haven't actually read any of year 3 yet, since I'm waiting till its done first, but it would be a shame if all the character development towards improving Harry's and his twin's relationship in year 2 gets thrown out the window between then and the end of year 4. But yeah at the current pace it will probably take a decade or longer to finish, and it's very rare that hobbyist authors stick with a story that long :(. The Pureblood Pretense series has a similar problem.

** Linkffn(unknown relations: the philosophers stone) Harry Potter died as a child, leaving behind his twin and younger sister. Orion Black has a happy life with his father Sirius, but there are things they don't talk about- such as his missing memories before he was adopted, and why his dad and James Potter hate each other.

The kids act like kids, and Orion is his Head Auror father's protege, so there's plenty of action.

*** I'm fairly sure, though not 100% sure, that this fic is at least somewhat inspired by Prince of Slytherin. Though where Prince takes all the terrible WBWL tropes and tries to subvert or explain them, Den of Snakes plays them all straight. Which makes for an interesting comparison when looking at the two fics. Unlike most fics with those tropes Den of Snakes is pretty well written so I agree its enjoyable even with them. The constant bashing does get a bit grating though.

It's that Harry was born with a sibling who everyone thinks is the one who was marked and made into a Horcrux, but it was Harry all along. :) Kind of like Frozen!
