May 1941

The Kreigsmarine and Royal Navy are engaged in one of the most important games of 'hide and seek' in history, with the RN desperately looking for the KM Bismarck, while the German battleship tries to make it's way back to friendly waters. This all comes to a head on the 27th.

BATTLE OF THE NORTH SEA\\
26-27 MAY, 1941\\
RUNDOWN OF EVENTS - 26 MAY 19:00 TO 26 MAY 20:00

/19:10 - Bismarck/ spots RN carrier /HMS Ark Royal/\\
/19:16 -/ /HMS Rodney/ spots the /Bismarck/\\
/19:19 - HMS Ark Royal/ launches 10 Swordfish Torpedo Bombers\\
/19:21 - ORP Piorun/ transmits it's famous 'I Am A Pole' message to Bismarck before opening fire on the battleship\\
/19:35 - Bismarck/ opens fire on what it believes is the British battleship /King George V/. It instead is shelling Azkaban with HE rounds, causing fires to break out across the building.\\
/19:37 - HMS King George V/ opens fire on what it believes to be a German heavy cruiser escorting /Bismarck/. It is instead shelling Azkaban with AP rounds, doing devastating damage to the structure.\\
/19:45 -/ The entire British fleet begins shelling Azkaban after reports of sailors dropping dead across all ships are linked to that island, which they still think is a German ship\\
/19:59 - Ministry of Magic/ forces arrive on the island to find the prison mostly destroyed. Both the German and British fleets turn north, away from the island.

In total, 133 prisoners are dead, and Azkaban is irreparably damaged. The Royal Navy reports that a German heavy cruiser, possibly an /Admiral Hipper-class/, was sunk. The Kreigsmarine reported that no heavy cruisers, especially not an /Admiral Hipper-class/, were missing, and that all KM ships were accounted for. The truth would only reach the Muggle government until after WWII was already over, and by then it did not matter much.

The island where Azkaban once stood was used for nuclear testing in 1962, finally ending the story of the once grand prison that housed all the criminals of the Magical World.

It's a story featuring both RN and KM shipgirls, postwar. quite a nice read if one likes old warships.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
