I've come to realise that it's extremely difficult nowadays for writers to know if a fic they publish is good or not, but this isn't because no one reviews their fics or the reviews they do get barely qualify as a sentence. It's because you can have 1000 reviews, all of which are extremely positive and it still won't change the fact that your fic may be complete Hippogriff urine and you just happened to attract a very ignorant/stupid group of people.

I of course ran into a situation like this again today, with a fic that I honestly don't know what possessed me to read, but curiosity molested the cat and left it scarred for life, as they say. I won't spoil anything in the 7000 words of hell that this was, cos it was too much of an experience to spoil. So here's a link instead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5805977/1/An-Inconvenient-Truth]]

Of course, it was no surprise that the Reviews were treating the Author like they just cured all the world's diseases and while running into stupid people on the internet is about as original as Harry releasing a breath he didn't know he'd been holding in, I find that it's far too common to come down to just that.

The classic example that I will always remember is a review from the smut that was so over the top, it soared past the trenches, into space and over the moon. I am of course talking about Cuckolding at Shell Cottage, where one reviewer gushed about how in character everyone was. Personally, I wasn't aware that Harry, Hermione and Fleur discussing the idea of bestiality was in character, but I guess I need to reread.

Actually, I think those are the worst kind of reviews you can get; the ones where someone mentions how in character everyone is. The problem with that though is when someone does write a good fic where everyone is in character, by that point you're so used to stupid people claiming what is in character and what isn't that you don't know to when to take anyone's word for it or not, even if they're right.

I've noticed that shipping plays a huge part in this issue and admittedly, I used to be part of that problem back in the day. For example, let's imagine your OTP is Snape/Harry, you strange, strange person. All you'd really have to do is write a fic of Harry in Snape's arms while they gush about how much they love each other and you'll be rolling in positivity, because hormones are the fancy word for mind control.

Now when anyone questions why this constantly occurs, the knee-jerk response is that some fans are so cut off from canon, that they have a completely different feel for the characters, but I feel like there's more to it than that. Because while there is plenty of crap in the Fanfiction community, they come in several different breeds and if one was to experience every breed and realise that the characters they supposedly know and love act differently in each crapfest, just to make the intended situation happen, then something has clearly gone wrong here.

But the realest of the real problems is I don't slightly know what needs to change either. It's not exactly a shock that this stuff happens and because it's so predictable, solving the problem isn't easy. I suppose this subreddit shows that there are plenty of HPFF readers who don't have a a bicycle pump lodged through their brain, but we're simultaneously divided and united in our opinions. The fact that I recently made a topic requesting smut fics about the giant squid and that got more upvotes than the vast majority of requests here proves that.

That got rather passionate there.

** The last review I received (yesterday) was, quoting:

#+begin_quote
  lets put my cock in your ass
#+end_quote

This was on a 1000+ review story that's been generally well received over the years.

I just roll with reviews, good or bad, informative or not, taking from them what I can. Some are great and make me wish to write more, some are attempts to rip me down and make me wish to take down my stories. Some are astute, yet some others so completely missing the point that I wonder if the reviewer has even read the piece. I've a handful of cherished reviews that completely changed how I approach the craft of writing (nonjon, e.g., left a two-thousand-word review several years back on one of my stories when I was new to writing that was probably the most substantive I've ever received).

My best writing is lightly reviewed and not well received. (Hell, my very best writing is an original fiction novel that remains unpublished.) One of the schlocky, bog-standard, fanfiction pieces I barfed out early in my fanfiction writing has a million hits and thousands of favorites. I've a story with one review per 2.2 words.

But none of it matters in the end. Reviews are part of the dialogue, of the culture, of what makes fanfiction special and distinct from original fiction, but they really aren't all that. (See MoR.)

Strangely enough, the last review for my story was:

I mean... as soon as you put something up on FFN, you're opening the floodgates. I think "Reviews" should really be called "Comments" or something, since that's essentially what they are.

I've gotten, hm, maybe a dozen-ish reviews that made me actually tilt my head and re-think something in my story? I.e. "useful" reviews. The rest is just... gravy. Getting a really motivational review where I can tell the reader really felt something, really enjoyed what they read and wanted to reach out, that's cool, I like it, it's motivational. There's tons of chaff, too. The odd "wtf" comment. Really, though, reviews are just kind of ... there.

Like, if I were counting on the reviews section of a FFN piece to provide actual insight for a) the writer or b) a potential reader as to "is this story good", lolno.

** The best reviews I have gotten in fanfiction are for my worst stuff. People LIKE thinly veiled torture porn that became rape porn between a sorcerous villain of great power versus a completely mundane human, written while drunk and tired.

People don't apparently like cerebral battles of wits between two wizards.

People like memes.

People dislike deconstructions of canon decisions.

People like romance.

People dislike romance that actually acknowledges their character nature and how they think.

On my part, I only leave a review if I see I can provide feedback that would be useful and would be more than “great story, update soon”. I don't do it often, I admit, but there were people who made changes to what they wrote because of my feedback; the sad thing is that this seems to somehow place me in the minority of reviewers because giving a useful review isn't really all that hard if you can use your head.

You're right of course -- it's kind of the standard reaction. People that love the idea / pairing / etc, will gush about it and you won't generally get good beta/editing feedback from the average reader.

** If you're writing fanfiction to improve your writing skills, I guess reviewers who don't help are absolutely worthless for you, but if you're only writing fanfiction because it's fun and not for skills, reviewers who point out every flaw in your writing must be quite annoying. I see authors asking for criticism, and authors who tell us they don't want criticism. Both are okay. Both should be okay. You're getting great feedback and improving, good job. You're having fun and other people who read your story had great fun too, good job.

I think it's a simple matter of telling people what you want, and people being polite about it. If reviewers are going against what the author asked for, then they are stupid, yes.

I personally refrain from reviewing when I read anything by someone that seems to be serious about reviews. Surely the author wouldn't want a review from such an uneducated reader like me. Seriously, I haven't enough grammar in my head to write a review, let alone criticize a story. I will, on the other hand, try writing what I liked about a story, if the author is okay with simple reviews like "hi I liked how you described this".

But seriously, while I hold every review on my fics in high regard, since it simply means someone read the bull I produce, I do not think of them as valuable criticism. I may take some pointers from them, but that was about it. Some reviewers take a lot of time to put out feedback worth a damn, but those are the almost non-existent minority.

Problem solving? The Dark Lord Potter forums do that. They'll take your story, lift it up and then try to break its spine over their knees over and over again. If it holds, its deemed worth a second glance. But honestly, I wouldn't even be able to deliver on this level, so I'll stick with my simpler audience.

I think your experience has been twisted by the fact that you wrote a Hermione wank fic. Of course if you take every positive attribute Harry has and give them to Hermione, in addition to her many pre-existing strengths, then people are going to review your fic as lacking an insufficiently strong Harry.

#+end_quote

Because DLP does not go for the idea that all opinions are equally valid. You have to justify your opinion with argument, and if you don't, someone will call you out on it - vigorously.

When I review a fic I never say "this is bad because I don't like it". I always give /reasons/ for why a story element is bad. By explaining the reasoning, you don't need to take my word as an authority, as you would a professional critic. Rather, you can see that my reasoning is either good or argue the point.

An example from the Cadmean Victory thread:

#+begin_quote
  The criticism is "why would the author choose to make that part of the story in the first place?" not "that doesn't make sense within the story world". Any author can justify something within their world, because they have complete ability to arbitrarily determine people's beliefs, knowledge, character, magical law, etc. But that doesn't make it a good decision from an out-of-universe position.

  For example, with regards to Harry's jump in skill: yes, you can justify it in-universe by saying he was like that all along and this is an AU, but that doesn't explain the out-of-universe question: "why you would choose to declare your character as more skilled than canon rather than show them developing into someone who has more skill?". Character by development is simply superior writing to character by declaration. Whether or not the character is logical given that fictional universe's arbitrary axioms is irrelevant. It's the choice of axioms we're criticising, not the logical deduction that follows from them.

  Similarly, having Hermione be shallow and one dimensional and completely renege on her friendship with Harry. Sure, you can justify that in-universe with sufficient events and AU changes to her character. But again the question is: why would you want to? Why would you want to turn a reasonable, relatively 3D character into an antagonism machine that doesn't act like a human? Again, having characters who act like people is simply superior writing to having characters who act as plot devices.

  Also, with regards to clichés, there's another misunderstanding. People don't dislike clichés because they're common, they dislike them because they're bad. Some ideas are just intrinsically not good, because they require certain conditions to persist. For example, the idea of portrait!Salazar in the Chamber of Secrets tutoring Harry. It's not bad because it's been overused, it's bad because:

  1. If portraits had enough knowledge and sentience to teach magic, Hogwarts wouldn't need teachers.

  2. The story doesn't explain how Salazar Slytherin can speak modern English.

  3. The story doesn't explain how the books are written in modern English.

  4. It's too convenient for Harry. Good hero stories create conflict; convenience for the hero is anathema to good hero writing.

  5. It requires significant amounts of backtracking/reinterpretation of previous events which definitely happened in this AU (events of CoS).

  And here's the thing: even if you create in-universe reasons to explain all these points away, it's still not good writing, because the very fact that it's going to require heaps of exposition to justify means that it's weighing the story down. General writing maxim: if an idea is so at odds with the rest of your story that it will require a load of justification to shoe-horn into the plot, you shouldn't include it. If a writer is trying to justify something to the reader, they've already failed. Good writing doesn't need to justify things to the reader, because everything already feels right.

I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xldgx/book_club_alexandra_potter/cy62wq0][a review]] of one of your stories indicating that I had several problems with it. I also made certain to tell anyone reading my review that my criticism only reflects my own taste. My review was just as scathing as 'Frantic Author's.' I just chose to stick with criticizing the story's lack of merit instead of descending into a personal attack.

The Cadmean Victory review you posted comes across as logical and coherent. I have every reason to believe that this is the normal flavour of review on DLP. It's all well and good to say that Starfox had been trolling for a long time, but the fact that you're all here dogpiling on him a year later just comes across as an obstinate 'He deserved it.'

I suppose the best of this subreddit is roughly equal to the best of DLP. The difference is in the average. DLP has a rule against "shitposting" whereas this sub does not. That means that DLP members who consistently post using bad English (unless it's their second language) or who consistently just write one-line opinions without any novel point of view or justification get banned.

There are two other main differences.

The first is that of focus. DLP moderators are very active in keeping threads on topic and substantive. Posts are regularly deleted/moved if they are too tangential to the thread topic. Threads are regularly closed if people are just repeating the same opinions without adding anything new. Arguments, while they're allowed to go on for a while, are broken up if they show no sign of stopping. The result of this is a high "density" of substantive content - you have none of this phenomenon on other forums where threads get interrupted for pages at a time by personal conversation between individual members. This thread, for example, would not exist on DLP. The whole discussion about DLP's standards and culture is a massive off-topic tangent and would have been shut down by a moderator early on.

The second is that of atmosphere. The liberal attitude towards insults is not culture-neutral. It helps generate an atmosphere that encourages people to speak their mind. Where a site has a "be nice to people" rule, it inevitably leads to people pulling punches with regards to content.

Actually, a site without a "be polite to other posters" rule (or at least a "attack an opinion, not the poster" rule) tends to discourage people from speaking up. It very often leads to a very homogenized culture where differing opinions are shouted down by a mob.

Because it sends a certain kind of message to people, you know. For all the insulted party knew, the person doing the insulting did not get punished at all, and it's not their fault that they think this way.

And yes, I know there's more to this argument. But it's the wording that is the issue there, not the context. Though honestly, as someone who is not a member of that forum I really don't care one way or another.

************* I'm going to preface this with: I'm not by any means saying 'your opinion is wrong, so shut up' so if I at all come across like that I apologise.

I think it boils down to DLP being a different culture than what you and others who share your opinion are used to. Frantic was perfectly within his right to be an asshole to Starfox based on what that specific user had done and posted previously.

The very point that people 'thumbed' his post in agreement speaks to that much. The staff didn't agree with how he said it, it was a basic consensus that he went too far and we made him aware of that via infraction and discussion with him about it.

You guys keep talking about 'how it sends a message'. But, that's the thing that's hard to get across to people who don't understand. DLP's Culture is self moderating for the most part. Incidents like this are significantly far apart and few in between, it simply isn't worth publicly lambasting a user for their behavior.

You argue that it needs to be done to 'inform other users whats unacceptable' but in regards to DLP you're wrong. The average member is smart enough to know what will be tolerated and what won't.

The members who aren't simply don't last. You may say 'that's horrible!' and that's an opinion that you're allowed to have, but it works for us and our members.

That's whats important---not attempting to appease people who wouldn't fit into the culture anyway.

DLP has never pretended to be anything it wasn't. When people join they know exactly what they're getting into, and if they don't then they soon find out and can decide they like it and stick around, or that they don't, and leave.

Then you have the other type of users like Starfox who stubbornly go against the forums culture, and then get upset when the user base lashes out against them.

I'm using 'culture' as a catch all term for expectations of behavior. People have repeatedly spoken of Starfox and the issues he had with the forum and the members, so I'm not going to rehash them.

************** And I am going to preface with this: it's not “you guys”.

Because you replied as if I was a uniform part of the whole that is this subreddit. I am not, and though I did agree with the other side this time that something is off, it kind of throws much of your reply into the metaphorical garbage bin due to it being directed not at the person you were replying to but rather at the unseen masses that probably aren't even listening.

That being said, I assure you I took no offence in any part of your message.

And this is because I am used to harsh critique, to both giving and receiving it; even more so, giving harsh critique to new workers is a fairly significant part of my work. So I know that sometimes strong words indeed are the best way.

However, there's one thing that serves as the line between giving harsh but fair critique and being a self-entitled jerk: making it non-personal.

What Starfox did do or did not do aside (and seriously, the situation with him here is a no-win for you anyway unless you were to basically link the highlights of his alleged troll career from your forum so you are probably just wasting time reacting to it anymore now), the thing with the message this is about is that the insults made it personal and the fact that the one getting insulted did not at all learn that the one doing the insulting got told off (the infraction, that is) means it did not stop being personal. And that's just bad.

Now, I do get your policy of not deleting or changing posts unless they are really out of place. And you know what? I can respect that; even more so, I think /that/ is a good policy to have. And, I like to think fairly obviously, Starfox's words about how you not deleting that means that you condone it are just a display of inanity to be ignored.

But if you want it to be harsh but not personal, as I think it should be if you are liberal with what words are being allowed and what words aren't, then the one who got insulted should be informed that the one insulting them got told off; that the whole situation was noticed and there was a response at all, in other words. It doesn't have to be public, even; heck, it's way better to just send a pritave message saying that there was an infraction and that's it, and if the public doesn't know what's acceptable and what isn't without public notifications then the public is stupid anyway. Now, if the one being insulted basically goaded the other person into insulting them? Tell him to not do that again while you notify them of the other's infraction, or better yet give them both an infraction and mutually notify the other to let them know to either stop fighting or shut up altogether (something which, if Starfox really has a history of trolling and really goaded the other party into insults, should probably have happened anyway, and to be honest if he refused to learn for however many messages then I'm not sure why people continued to waste effort on teaching him when he didn't want to learn).

Because it's not about thick skin, really. And it's not about not appearing as something different from what you are. Well, that is unless you /are/ a bunch of elitist self-entitled jerks (and “elitist” in a decidedly non-positive meaning), because subtle things like that make many people see you like this. Which, I hope, is not really how you want to be seen.

And the message I was talking about was about how the fact that the one insulted didn't know about the one doing the insulting being told off gives them a (false, but they don't know that) message that nobody cares if it does get personal, either against them or in general. That was my point; it's not about appeasing people who wouldn't fit (although I'm sure you could make a case about why Starfox wouldn't), but about telling someone who got hit with insults “yeah, we saw that, told them to back off, don't provoke them or something”. Because if you don't, some of the insulted ones will just shrug and get on with it but some others will decide that it had to be personal due to the forum being “elitist self-entitled jerks” and then basically try to annoy you the way Starfox does.

But, once again, I really don't really care since I'm not a member of your forum and honestly I'm only on this subreddit by chance (led here by Google while searching for something). It's just that a small thing like that makes people's opinion about it much worse, which may spur people into doing things like plagiarisng works from your forum, excusing it with how allegedly horrible you were because of stuff like that. Basically, those who have thick skin don't care either way, but those who don't ... some of them probably badmouth you just because they experienced something like that and thought that getting personal is allowed, and this does make some people act contrary to you just because.

Also, no insults were intended in this message either. Sorry, I couldn't find a place to put it near the beginning so it's the very last thing in the reply.

Unless the person who is having the issue with another member personally brings it to the attention of staff, then no I disagree that they should be told. Members for the most part are mature enough to deal with these issues on their own without needing a third party to slap them on the wrist.

There is an expectation of members these days of a certain amount of maturity. I always find a small little amusement when I see people refering to a DLP that for all intents and purposes stopped existing when the membership grew out of their teens. All that 'Dark!Harry edgelord' bullshit that's more of a stereotype by people who pride themselves on being ignorant of the forum and its content. DLP stopped taking itself seriously a while ago, though there are still users who exhibit that type of 'personality' and that's their choice. To be honest the reputation that DLP has probably benefits us more than it is a detriment since it does prevent people who would otherwise find the culture to be a shock to the system due to the expectation by the staff for the membership to deal with its own issues like an adult.

With that said, when interpersonal issues arise on the forum do arise from time to time---semi recently we had an issue of one member harassing the other on a regular basis. I brought them both aside and had a personal chat trying to get to the bottom of the issue. The instigator of the attacks said 'it was just a joke' and was warned that if it continued then they'd be removed from the forum.

They since have been removed from the forum due to directing this behavior at other users.

With THAT said, even if Starfox had straight up come to staff complaining---and he might have, it's been a while and I can't remember if he did---it's unlikely that any serious effort would have been made to 'correct the issue' due to Starfox's own behavior. If I'm being honest the whole situation was that Frantic said what everyone else was privately thinking, perhaps with significantly more vitriolic then most would have used.

By DLP's standards the members were obscenely patient with tolerating Starfox when he made a concerted effort to reject every effort they made to help him with his story and seemed to be 'proud' of the fact that he had.

Like I said above, the reputation does have some small benefit for all parties involved. It keeps those who are unsuited for culture away. Of course occasionally you have people slipping through who aren't prepared to be thrown into the deep end---people who are used to homogeneous safe spaces. 'There is no war in Ba Sing Se.' so to speak.

I don't personally consider myself to be 'elitist' though I imagine some members might wear that as a badge of pride. I'm pretty inclusive and I encourage other people to be open minded when dealing with new members who don't 'fit in', even if they wouldn't be a traditional fit (eg: see syed). Most of the time it works out with either a new person deciding they like being treated as an adult, or simply deciding they just don't like it---either of which is perfectly fine and within their right to do.

Occasionally however, there are cases where someone will have an adverse reaction who decide to stick around and make a nuisance of themselves out of spite.

Because despite all the decade old evidence to the contrary, DLP is a big softy at heart who wants nothing more than to help people who come to DLP seeking help. With that said, DLP is definitely a firm believer in tough love and is against coddling, both at an interpersonal level as well as a writing level.

I'm pretty sure I probably repeated myself a few times on certain points and sorry if I did. I'm in the middle of painting my house so this was more of a stream-of-consciousness post than anything.

Certainly.

In the end, though, the "culture" is pretty simple. You can go anywhere by being a) intelligent b) rational c) using common sense. The problem is that nowadays, especially on the internet, the general IQ seems to have decreased to protozoon level.

Or to bring it back to the OP: Those kind of reviewers are exactly the kind of persons who will be run off the site within a day, and I couldn't be happier about it. "Being stupid" is a ban reason (while "using offensive language" is not), and this simultaneously shows in the level of the discussion and makes me miss that kind of regulation when I'm elsewhere.

Starfox didn't quit the site, he was banned (a ban that has now expired). He now makes it his mission to seek out conversations about DLP all over the internet and talk about the injustice of it all.

That's completely different, as it may not be about the fact that they agreed with his assessment of Starfox5 as a cockgargling faglord, but rather that they agreed that he was a mindless tool, a gibbering ignoramus or too dumb to figure out a revolving door.

But, perhaps when you consider that Starfox5 has gotten banned multiple times... you start to wonder.

I realise you have a differing view, but we just simply /don't/ censor people by deleting their posts - deletion is a tool for when there's little alternative. If someone insults you, it's not getting deleted. If someone insults a mod or an admin, it's not getting deleted either.

How it /was/ dealt with was by the usual, typically very effective method of infraction. Perhaps because /you/ personally disregard infractions and continue shitposting until you get banned, you consider them ineffective - for normal rational people, however, they get the message very quickly.

So no; we're not going to delete the year old post insulting you just because you're complaining about it now. And no, repeatedly claiming that we're 'condoning' certain behaviour just because we're not going to bend over backwards and retroactively rip down posts for you does not magically make it true.

If you do stupid shit, they are going to laugh at you, if you say dumb homophobic slurs in ways that offend people, they are going to call you out on it.

In this case, someone called you out on doing stupid shit, but broke the rules by doing so too harshly, and was therefore infracted. I can't see what the problem is. Generic insults are generic insults, I don't understand why you consider it homophobic to leave them up as a "this is how you don't call people out".

Refer to the thread where Giovanni calls out another guy for a similar case that saw no infractions coming his way (AFAIK). Calling people out for being dumb shits is what happens when a bunch of people with high standards start a forum and expect those standards to be upheld.

************* DLP's harsh criticism /is/ what makes it more valuable than what you would find here. Unlike in the majority of the fandom, stupid shit is highlighted and called out as being stupid rather than being buried beneath three dozen reviews of "more" and "I love Harmony XD". Bad writing and poor characterization are called out as well. If the criticism is bad, then it too is called out. And anyone who shows a genuine desire to improve and respond to feedback is welcomed.

As for the quality of DLP, it has always held itself to high standards and DLP authors produce a great deal of the best works in the fandom because of those standards and in large part because of their attitude of honest, blunt critique. As for credentials, I'm fairly sure there is an actual editor or two among the active users, but its mostly people who have read a lot of fanfiction, know what good writing and story concepts are when they see it, or are good authors themselves (usually all three). It might be subjective, sure, but when its almost universally agreed that DLP produces extremely good fics, provides useful feedback, and only praises solid works, then there is considerable weight to be lent to the opinion of DLP users.

And of course, most of the people who you find disagreeing with this are usually people tiffed at the caustic attitude of DLP or are unable to take criticism if it isn't strawberry flavored and sugary.

The latter (QQ) also allows NSFW content, if that's what you are writing.

They are not dedicated to HP, but they (especially SB) have active HP fanfic discussion threads, and you can start your own story thread to solicit feedback as well.

** Personally, I only give my reviews a cursory glance because I don't really care about them. And because most are just iterations of "I like this" (which is why I love that AO3 has a kudos button because it limits these inane reviews to a minimum). I look to my beta readers to give constructive feedback.

I'm convinced that this is partly a problem that was created by the desperate fanfic writers that go on and on in their author's notes about reviews, practically begging for them, if not outright demanding reviews in order to continue the story. These people only really care about the number, not the quality of reviews. They just want you to stroke their massively misplaced ego.

In my experience, most of the fandoms I'm interested in are saturated in fanfic written by people who act like this and so most of the fanfic in that fandom as a whole appear to be subjected to shitty reviews.

And /that's/ the way the cookie crumbles.

I don't even bother to read reviews except for stories that I've seen recs for multiple times. Even then I only look at reviews relevant to spelling, grammar, structure, etc... Opinions are subjective by definition and going back to the quote I mentioned, most are provided by less than competent people.

** I think that part of the problem is that there is a review system, but there is no rating system, and review count gets used as a proxy for endorsements --- how popular a fic is. This is not intentional on anybody's part, I don't think, but it just emerged this way. So, someone who doesn't like a fic might be more reluctant to leave a review, since once it scrolls off the first page of reviews, it'll just add to the total "popularity" count.

Add to that that there is a sizable constituency that regards any negative comments about a fic as bullying or worse, and it's easier to just move on and look for something better to read.

I think FF.net might benefit from an Amazon-like way of displaying them: let the reviewer indicate whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral, and then show

1. How many of each kind there are.
2. The top (or the most recent) reviews of each kind.

Such as system would not be immune to being gamed, but it'd be better than nothing.

*** I'd argue that, for fanfiction.net itself, adding a rating system is a bad idea.

FF.net is a good place for first time writers, often young people, to try out creative writing. It'd probably be really demoralising receiving bad ratings on the first ever thing you made, and would put a lot of people off writing more! The current system is much more 'positive feedback only' - the people who review are the ones who care enough to leave a genuine comment about it. It's much more of a friendly environment for writers to develop in, even if it isn't the best for readers.

**** Perhaps it's my self-interest as a reader speaking, but reader time is precious. There is, currently, more HP fanfic on FF.net that could be read in a human lifetime. A system that does not provide some useful way to figure out what /not/ to read is a system that is failing the readers. Some rudimentary filtering is possible, of course: 'ships, summaries, word counts, but they are only indicative of the subfandom in which the fic resides, which still leaves too many.

And, I don't think that it helps beginning writers that much: I know I have come to rely on either personal recommendations or favorite lists more than reviews --- and I know that I'm not the only one --- and this means that rich get richer: the better a fic is known already, the more likely it is to be recommended here and elsewhere. A robust review and rating system would allow a reader to draw on the proverbial wisdom of the crowds as well, perhaps even control for such factors as how long a fic has been around.

Furthermore, I've outlined how the current system discourages critical reviews --- so how is this hypothetical new writer going to improve without feedback as to the areas that can be improved?

I don't know exactly how one might set up something like that on FF.net, but I believe the benefits would outweigh the costs.

****** I don't need faith when I have data: HP section currently has 732 thousand fics, which, if one is able to read fanfic for a very generous 90 years of one's life, comes out to a bit more than 22 fics per day, every day. Assuming one can dedicate 16 hours a day to reading the fic (with sleep and bodily needs taking up the rest), that's 1.4 fics per hour. Unfortunately, here, I don't have data on what the average length of a fanfic is. It might be doable in theory, with very generous assumptions.

Of course, can a person who does nothing but read fanfic still be considered "human"? Discuss.

At 200 words per minute, I estimate on the high end it would take 30 years just doing some quick math.

***** I completely agree with you - as a reader, having some sort of rating/review system is invaluable. We actually do have this, if you didn't know - at DLP there is a forum called [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][The Library]]. Readers submit stories they think are worthwhile, and then reviewers rate them and leave typically fairly extensive reviews.

You don't need to be a member to browse - come have a look if you're interested. The only downside is that there are definitely certain types of stories that you may enjoy more that the community at DLP doesn't - you'd very rarely ever see slash recommended, for instance. But overall it's an excellent place to get find a lot of truly excellent stories, or the more fun [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=41][guilty pleasures]] if you're interested in those too.

There's a pretty cool feature worth mentioning - there's a system that learns from what ratings you give stories and uses this to recommend you other stories that people who share your tastes really enjoy too. You can find that [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/recommended.php][here.]]

I'm a moderator the the DLP forums, so feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any questions.

Now, if I am really into the story, I will tend to use the review button as a way to give the author on how I feel about where the characters are going, my own personal way to rant at the characters stupidity, kinda like yelling at the telly when your team fucked up or trying to get the idiots to get the fuck away from the crazy people. I will give critiques when I feel the absolute need too, like really shitty stories that I gave a shot or stories that pull you in and you are dying for more. Though nowadays, I tend to leave a note for those authors that are being completely lazy and sticking with Dorea & Charles as James' parents, ugh, the evidence pointed away from these two even before the truth came out.

I read the fic you linked, out of curiosity, and I don't know how someone could read it and not cringe. I was optimistic for the first two sentences and then that went away very quickly.

If I don't like a story's concept or basic plot, I rarely post anything, since that's a matter of personal taste in my opinion. If I like the plot/idea, but dislike some part of how it's executed (grammar, plot hole, etc.), I may add that to a review, though depending on the exact criticism, I might as well write a PM - if I notice for example a spelling mistake or a weird translation, I don't think that should be left in a public review.

If it's not "this is great" it's a flame and you should die. Or if you truly think it's awful, you shouldn't comment anyway, because why waste your time? Some people hate when their misspellings are pointed out, others don't and will correct it, and others don't care at all. Some people don't like having their characterization or dialogue or plot or setting or any other little nuanced part of their story looked at askance. So what you see in the comments is people who want more of what you got, or hate it so much they want to flame you. Everyone else can't be bothered.
