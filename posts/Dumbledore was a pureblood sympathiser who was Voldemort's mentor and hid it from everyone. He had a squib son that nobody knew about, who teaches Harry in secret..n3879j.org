I am kind of writing this type of story as 'The Brightest Star' on Fanfiction and Wattpad, and I honestly haven't read more stories like these. I feel that these type of stories are good, just for adding more to the culture.

If anyone wants to read my take: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13848997/1/The-Brightest-Star]]
