Hey ya'll hope ya'll are staying safe with covid. 1)Do yall have any good Hermione/Ron fics that are kind of longer, or that are completed. I have never really read fics about them as the main ship, so could you please give me some of your must read fics? 2) Any fics about Percy as the main character, or just that dives into his character and possibly his relationship with his family and any romantic, or platonic relationships he has? One author I love who has not updated in a few years, that writes really good fics about Percy is, Linkffn chemical violets

Thanks ya'll and happy reading and writing.


** One author who has written a ton of Percy-centric fics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/likehandlingroses/pseuds/likehandlingroses/works?fandom_id=136512][likehandlingroses]]. Here are a few of their fics, but there are seriously a bunch:

linkao3(20353639)

linkao3(17503841)

There's also a beautifully written Percy/Hermione by calebski, called Reflector:

linkao3(11803497)

Percy Take the Wheel is good as far as I've read, which admittedly is only a few chapters in, but it's always recommended around here:

linkao3(14033613)

If you'd permit me a bit of self-promo, most of what I write these days is Percy-centric, and I've associated it all under a series called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1543966][Perfectly Imperfect Percy]] -- but it's not a series as in connected stories, just a way to put them all together.

Despite Ron/Hermione being my OTP, weirdly enough I don't read a lot of Romione fic these days, and if I do they're not novels, but one that does come to mind is Memory Dust by shadowycorner:

linkao3(10987734)

If any others occur to me I'll come back and edit this post!

  Percy ignored her sudden stiffness, he didn't care what the state of her injuries were, Hermione was so tough, so brave, he almost couldn't focus on something as every day as skin when he was blinded by her radiance, the beauty that shone from her eyes, from the set of her mouth, in all the little noises she made.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. COMPLETE. Sequel now in progress: An Inch To The Left.
