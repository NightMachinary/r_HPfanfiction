Not just those characters who are mentioned in canon but never fleshed out, and thus are freely pillaged for use in fic - Daphne Greengrass being one of the best examples - and not OCs used by one author for their story. I'm talking about OC characters that have taken on fanon life of their own, used in multiple stories by many different authors.

Constance "Connie" Hammer, Master Auror and arsekicker. The Carrow twins, Flora and Hestia. What other OCs have taken on a fandom-wide life of their own?

*** For the longest time, I thought Dan and Emma were canon. When my use of the fanon name was pointed out to me, in every story I've written including the pair they end up named for famous couples, which annoys some people to no end.

**** /Hear, hear/. Also, having James' dad be Fleamont violates JKR's usual naming pattern, where firstborns have the middle name of their appropriate parent. Harry /James/ Potter, Ginevra /Molly/ Weasley, Sirius /Orion/ Black... but James /Charlus/ Potter is named for an uncle or distant relative?

** Theodore Nott is very close to a blank slate, but is a popular supporting character for many fanfics. (Rowling on the old site said she had a ton of notes about him but wasn't able to fit a scene into the books.)

Sally-Anne Perks and Su Li, when they rarely pop up, are always shy.

We see a bit more of Blaise Zabini, Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones in canon. They've definitely taken on personalities of their own in the fandom though.

For some reason, Lisa Turpin is always the go-to Ravenclaw girl, but we haven't agreed on a personality (or even a blood-status) for her yet. Odd since we see a lot more of Padma Patil in canon.

I am regretful that JKR didn't take a page from Stephanie Meyers (bleah) and write alternate views of canon occurrences. Go back over the seven years, each from the perspective of a different canon, background character. Could have been a lot of fun, let the readers see more of the wider world, added some interesting perspective on what happened.

Ah, well, that's what fanfiction is for.

*** Really? I feel like if a story has anything to do with Aurors, even if they are only mentioned once in 400k words, Master Auror Connie Hammer makes an appearance. Has to be in hundreds, if not thousands of fics I have read.

And to add to the topic, her first appearance in HP fanfiction has to be pre-2004, because I read a fic from back then a few months ago and she featured in it too.

**** Most Auror related fanfiction I read are mostly post-Hogwarts, maybe she died on the battle of Hogwarts? :))

Honestly, four auror that I noticed to always appear are Dawlish, Savage, Proudfoot, and Gawain Robards; either on Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts stories. All of them are canon though, so that's understandable.

Can you give me some example where she showed up?

Her. She seems to fill the role for a non-Order aligned, but also legitimate, Auror. She's generally described as hard as nails, and nearing retirement - sort of like if Amelia Bones were still a street-cop.

** Regulus Black and Blaise Zambini Both of these characters have really consistent chatacterization even though you get very little chatacterization on Blaise and like no characterization on Regulus minus his note and the story behind it.

I like both but i think its interesting. As opposed to say Theodore Nott who gets more of a variety in his depictions.
