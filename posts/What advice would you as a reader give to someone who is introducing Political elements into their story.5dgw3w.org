** - Don't take a real political issue and replace all the nouns with magical ones. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue and orange morality]] is more interesting to read about than a black and white [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract][author tract]] (warning: TV Tropes links, may [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropeswillruinyourlife][ruin your life]]). The political wings of the Wizengamot will not map perfectly onto Tory and Labour, or Democratic and Republican, or certainly not Good and Evil. House-elf rights is a good example: it's not an analogy for historical slavery because they genuinely want to work (and there can be good-faith arguments about whether that's cultural conditioning, biological necessity, magical binding, or what). Or you could go into a /lot/ of detail about goblins without simplifying it into "they're oppressed because they don't have wands" or "they're a danger to wizards that's tolerated because they control the gold".
- Show the best of both sides. Sure, some of Voldemort's support came from unthinking sadists and fellow Dark sociopaths; but what were his more reasonable arguments, to persuade Wizengamot members and Unspeakables and anyone who wasn't already an aristocratic blood purist? (Almost) nobody is the villain in their own imagination. As the author you probably share the opinion of one of your characters, but don't turn the other side into a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man][straw man]]---it won't persuade readers to agree with you.
- Actually, scrap that "both sides" phrase. There are more than two sides to every argument, even if it's easier to boil them down to two. Take a look at [[https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz][ISideWith's quiz]] for the recent US election. For questions like "Should the U.S. expand offshore oil drilling?" there are two /main/ answers, "Yes" and "No", but the "Other stances" show a variety of disagreeing policies that come from a variety of disagreeing principles. Do the same thing with magical issues.
- Let everything about a character inform their politics. Like, what's Remus Lupin's opinion on werewolf issues? He's not a Dark wizard, he doesn't want to curse people. But he's a werewolf himself, a Dark creature. So either "Dark" is a natural category, so he shares /something/ with Dark wizards; or it's a political classification, so he knows that what the Ministry says is Dark might still be /good/. Maybe he knows a werewolf who can't afford Wolfsbane because they can't find a job, so they bit someone by accident and hate themselves; or another werewolf who /can/ afford it, but bites people anyway because it's fun.
- Compromises can be interesting. What if the Ministry offers a bunch of make-work office jobs to all werewolves, giving them a steady income but putting them where the Ministry can keep an eye on them? Is it a trick, to lure the werewolves in and have them all arrested or killed? Is it throwing away taxpayers' money /and/ setting Dark creatures among innocent wizards? Could this ever get passed, and what would be the consequences if it did? IMO this would make for a much better story than "Lupin became head of the DRCMC and werewolves all get free Wolfsbane and everyone lived happily ever after now that Malfoy isn't around".

** “People who go into politics may be arrogant or greedy or have other flaws, sometimes even crippling under certain circumstances, but they are almost never complete morons” is what I'll say. Because there are quite enough stories that introduce “politics” only to immediately bash almost every character bar the protagonist by making them utterly incompetent in every single aspect of what they are doing.

Take Cornelius, for example. Despite what some people write him as (and as entertaining as it sometimes is, I admit), he is not completely incapable; rather, he has a fairly important to us flaw of being insecure (only got the post as the minister due to /Dumbledore/ of all people not wanting it, and he did not really have a chance to achieve anything great), a flaw on which Lucius played in order to make him distrust and doubt Dumbledore. So we know that he got manipulated by Lucius fairly easily, but again, it's only because he trusted him already. Likewise, the fact that he employs Dolores quite likely has to do not with her character but rather with what kind of person she is trying to present herself as.

*** And real politics (not Slytherin teenage cliques playing teenage games) is done by adults. A child will have to overcome a very large conscious and subconscious "don't take him seriously" attitude to achieve anything in politics. That doesn't mean that you have to be old to enter the field, but I'd say you should at least be of age and have serious clout or resources to be a player, and even then you'll have to deal with older people trying to advise or manipulate you.

** The key to good politics is remembering what it is all about, which is putting yourself into a position where other people are willing to do what you tell them. That can be from holding political office, but it can also be through holding the personal loyalty of a number of powerful people.

To make this relevant in the Harry Potter world you need to make sure that your worldbuilding reduces the extent to which individual wizards are powers unto themselves. In canon there's little indication that any number of Aurors could have taken down Voldemort or Dumbledore. That's a problem for a fic with a political focus, because political power is all about commanding the collective power of the people who recognise your authority. But if there are wizards who are completely beyond that collective power then there's little point in spending the entire fic gaining and maintaining it. So you can still have Voldemort and Dumbledore be exceptionally talented wizards, but you can't have them completely beyond the Ministry's reach.

Another important aspect to remember is that politics is ultimately all about de facto power. Titles, laws, constitutions... they only mean as much as influential people are willing to recognise their authority. In far too many fics Harry gains some political or legal powers as a result of an inheritance and that's that. He just flashes his title and people back off. But of course that power is paper thin. Without a significant number of influential people willing to take him seriously (rather than laugh him off as a kid), his legal (or "de jure") powers can be ignored by those with de facto power.

If you haven't read/seen Game of Thrones I encourage you to do so. Two particular scenes illustrate the above: firstly, Cersei ripping up Robert's letter at the end of the first series; secondly, Tywin's "the King is tired" moment. Both of them illustrate perfectly the difference between de facto and de jure power; both feature characters who possess the actual loyalty of influential people completely ignoring the legally correct source of power.

*** Well, I slightly disagree there - I think that even with Dumbledore and Voldemort being too powerful for the Ministry to face by itself, you can have politics play a role. Just consider them both superpowers, and the Ministry the third world country both are trying to control, with the ICW a sort of UN. With the important difference that in this case, neither superpower wants to avoid war long-term.

** Understand the base ideals of politics. You need to know where someone is arguing from and why, what would they compromise on. The idealism vs pragmatism is going to play a part too. Politics and politicians are very different things. One is a set of ideas and the other is a group of people playing with the lives of others often for personal gain but not always. How ate politicians chosen, are they elects or is it heritage based, this matter to how much self interest they are allowed. I cared most about politics when I was in early teens and I know alot of my friends did too, I cared a lot about ideals, I knew nothing of the world and have grown more cynical as I have grown up. I assume you're English so we don't need to have a quick history chat about politics but think about what caused change, would the left be nearly as popular in the wizarding world when they originally grew around factories etc? This affects the make up of existing politicians. Always remember that the left is all about safety and it wants everyone happy and safe. The right is about freedom, doing what you want and having the right to make mistakes, not being told what to do etc. How much freedom can there be in a secret society with a potion that forces you to tell the truth, where people can follow you invisibly your loose hair can be used to impersonate you. How strict would that make privacy laws etc, what about the right not to self incriminate. These are probably very big issues in the wizarding world.

*** Given that the original Witenagemot was a political- not a judiciary- body that acted to appoint and advise the King on laws and administration, I don't mind it having extra non-judical duties.

It was also a sort-of-meitocracy as it comprised of the most powerful clergy/nobles and while Thegn-dom was heritable, it was also bestowed on anyone who met the wealth/service requirements while the more powerful Ealdor position was by royal appointment only
