It has been almost two years since Samvelg last updated and honestly I can't stop re-reading her work. I miss it like hell. Not only for her creativity, for the Harry she created, how she involved runes and old traditions (which yeah I get it, it is not everyone's cup of tea), or how neat her writing was; no this fic was simply so heart-warming and comfy to read.

Samvelg received so much side-eyes and sparked controversies for some of her themes: Fem!Harry, Threadmagic, Indian Harry, like seriously guys the ethnicity of a character ? But also the characteristics of Voldemort sparked many eyebrows: the fact that he was a character with many layers and not a manipulative psychopath. It could have been a cringe fest but every and each of her decision in the alternance of canon made so much sense.

I loved the work she did on Harry. She was a simple girl who was so funny and interesting to read. But also she took so many risks with her character: she wasn't straight, had PTSD, insomnia, was an abuse survivor, was not neuro typical and there was so much more to say about her. She was brave and compassionate and kind.

Also her relationship with Voldemort felt so natural and rational. She didn't fell into Stockholm syndrome, there was no unearned forgiveness, Samvelg did a fantastic job to make the relationship seem as natural as possible and to be honest it was so realistic that I could actually picture two people like this falling in love in such a natural way in my head. Getting to know each other, needing each other but not in a way that is unhealthy, manipulative or codependent. Even though Voldemort is an opportunist, when he finds her as broken as she is, he doesn't try to corrupt her or make himself someone she can trust through manipulation , and in his own asshole way he really does give her the support she needs as much as he knows how. Although he does have goals in mind he wants her to be happy.

Ever since the first chapter it was set on that she was dealing with the aftermath of Sirius' death and experiencing insomnia and depression. We got to see the good the bad and the ugly of her and then see her clawing her way back to health and happiness in such a beautiful way.

I loved every bit of this fic and I can't stop praying my head off to see an update one day. I know she made minor edits this month and that it's not abandoned but on hiatus, but still it hurts. She also left tumblr a while ago and I miss her posts there too.


** Definitely! This fic is amazing and I live in hope that one day the author will update. Until author says "discontinued" and not "on hiatus", I'm just gonna keep my fingers crossed for a new chapter.

That story is soooo original and awesome!!! I LOVED the thread magic and the stuff about parseltongue (the fangs and poison). It was so cool to see a different aspect to it! The fic really went all out for originality! And I adored how the author utilized House Black!

And you're totally right about the romance between fem!Harry and Voldemort not feeling rushed/weird or Stockholm syndrome-y.

Ugh, such an amazing story! I'm off to go re-read lol.

**** YAS, EXACTLY!!!!! I loved the traditions and the backstory author gave for House Black, it was truly imaginative and wonderful. And Sirius! Ah, lovely Sirius!

Wish there were more fics like this! You know, that utilize House Black well like this story did and incorporate unique traditions. Made the magical world more a world of its own, with it's own customs and etiquette.

*** She said so many times that this fic will never be abandoned, I even recalls that one time she said she is already working on the sequel, I feel sad for all the controversies she got. Really she is a gifted writer with all these themes going on it would have been so easy to feel into a cringe fest but she handled everything with such an amazing grace.

***** Yeah apparently people were not happy with the fact that Voldemort was not canon-ish enough for them. He was apparently too much a man with moral, was a man with trauma/ptsd, too kind, too sweet the list goes on. Which is dumb as hell because I feel like in fanfics people always wants to see him depicted as a inhuman psychopath genocider incapable of love. Like everyone is entitled to their own opinion but that's not entirely who he is, he has many layers is someone incredibly smart and manipulative and I really don't know why people read fanfics and then bitch about the fact that everyone doesn't have the same vision as them.

Also the fact that Harry was indian and bisexual, the many, many accusations of plagiarism... I could go on and on lol. But then again she is not the first nor the last. Itsjustsilver (author of Corruption another Tomarry with female Harry) has been gaslighted so bad for her last chapter, has had such negative reactions over her work, has been accused of plagiarism that she literally never updated Corruption again which is incredibly sad.

**** The "controversies" were accusations of plagiarism. Kinda difficult to verify given that /Ichor/ has been wiped off the face of the internet. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byh1vl/does_anyone_remember_ichor_by_nocturnememory_its/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][thread]]. Apparently pretty serious.

***** I did mention that there were accusations indeed.

I've read both Ichor and Samvelg's work and really I haven't seen a single resemblance in the writing or /allegedly/ stolen lines but it was my own vision I guess. Honestly even the lines that were paralleled in the thread were not THAT similar especially since given both contexts of them. In Ichor it was more about Voldemort's jealousy of the loyalty/love/home feelings that Harrie had over her loved ones whereas she hated Voldemort and rejected him for VERY valid reasons. In samvelg's I felt like it was Harry's acceptance of him and their souls "rejoicing" in her for lack of better terms.

Honestly idk how to feel about it.

****** The fic itself has some good worldbuilding, FemHarry is sweet and the relationship is handled somewhat well. But the whole fic simply feels /slimy/, for lack of better terms what with all the Voldemort-Apologism. So many of Voldemort's arguments break down at the slightest scrutiny and Harry just goes along with them. All of his past atrocities seem to be kept out of mind. The entire "preserving noble houses" doesn't make much sense when Voldemort personally wiped out so many of them.

******* Yeah I know about the whole morale crusade thing to save bloodlines and the world was not everyone's vison but again that's what fanfics are for, I mean there comes a time where you need to bend canon in order to move along the story to your vision because that's fictional. Also it has been so long since I've read the actual HP canon that for exemple I didn't even remember the fact that he has wiped out houses before you mentioned it again lol. God I really need to catch up again with what actually happened in canon.

Yeah that's why I said it's not everyone's cup of tea, just like Ichor's was to many extents. Many people were calling it over-angsty and a hard to read (which I agree, not many fics have made me cry but she did). I loved it and especially all her original characters (idk if you remember but he had this counselor/friend/sidekick whatever you want called Samson and he was my favorite thing in the whole world but again canon!voldemort worked alone and was lonely as hell), she was a very good writer and all her metaphors to religions and mythology were delicious so I kept going through it but it was the saddest, heaviest thing I've ever read honestly my heart broke for Harrie.

Then there was the issue that he was an overly sexual person and people were complaining because they always saw him as asexual, (which was not once mentioned in the book so total fanon) like guys do you all know that fanfics are made to create your own story based on someone's else story so you can totally incorporate your own stuff??? Like why read fiction if you want an almost carbon-copy of canon.

******** Canon!Voldemort was a /sick/ bastard who revelled in his own inhumanity. Historic Warding justifies that as some kind of daytime mask. Then you have Voldemort just being a handsome cool dude lounging in the library and feeling out 16-year olds at night. The dissonance kinda creeps up on you especially given that the fic is post-OOTP canon divergence without any explanations for Voldemort's partial sanity.

Heard that Ichor is available again on WordPress. Sounds heavy, probably won't read it.

******* Thank you! omg, i 100% agree, Historical importance is so so so overrated and i do NOT understand the love it gets. It wiped away anything and everything morally complicated/complex/dark about voldemort and made him into some romance hero.

Harry doesn't seem to have an original thought in her head.

******** Maybe that's the point! Harry in this fic is apparently just an extension of Voldemort's soul, so naturally he will be able to influence her mind into trusting him. That's not how it is really written, but one can always assume a heavy dose of Unreliable Narrator. She never wonders if her thoughts are her own, which is very suspect. Marrying a puppet version of himself with the proper body parts sounds exactly like Voldemort. One can always wish...

I also dislike how Dumbledore is handled in this one. Yes, he kept a large secret which would have been of very little use to her except to increase her misery. At no point does she actually consider /talking/ with Dumbledore to get the other side's version. Then again, she is a puppet..

********* Yeah, I totally could actually see that reasoning working way better than what was written. at least that would make harrys trust and 'like' of voldemort more plausible.

I honestly do not understand the need to vilify dumbledore, and the fact that Snape does it as well? What? What? Harry spends more time simping for voldemort than she does considering the things he's done. She pays it lip service in the first few chapters... but that's it. and it's weak at best.

And don't get me started on the whole narcissa/snape buddy/wine mom relationship that was going on there... that made no sense.

Like you said, so much of this story falls apart with any critical thought. But people like it because it's easy and all the 'problems' of the characters are swept away. (or just blamed all on dumbledore. becuase yeah, he's totally to blame for voldemort choosing homicide and genocide... ðŸ‘Œ)

****** Samvelg literally had multiple lines taken from ichor, and one whole conversation that was verbatim from one of nocturnememory's other stories, it wasn't even from ichor, but it was literally word or word.\\
Samvelg also took a lot of stuff ellory and another author and didn't credit anything until nocturnememory called her out for all of it.

I don't think borrowing ideas is a terrible thing, but being honest about things is the right thing to do, especially when everyone is doing this for free and for fun.

There is literally nothing original in Historical importance, it's all stuff that's been around for ages. Every cliche and trope that's been popular for decades, it's just all in one fic. Blood adoption, roman ties, pureblood culture, voldemort being 'good' the whole gringotts thing. Magic dying. All of it.

******* Wow I had only seen the thread in Ichor, I had no idea she took so many lines. Apparently there are links available for Bittersweet on the Wayback machine , think I will try to give it a side by side reading to Samvelg's work and try to see any connection one of these days.

As for the ideas being basic I don't really know. Honestly it was the first ever Female Harry work I've ever read which is partly why I've been attached to it for so long. This fic was really soft to read and I feel like Tomarry is made most of the time from very angsty fics.

I think to each their own. Many people will see it as a flawed work or not credible (I respect everyone's opinion) others said it was a pristine work. I am not really sure how overrated would work in fanfics considering it is simply people leaving kudos/comments so it's kind of hard to judge.

******** Nocturnememory is back on ao3 qith other work and on wordpress for ichor, I think you'll only find really old stuff on the wayback machine if you even can.

I honestly believe that's its different strokes for different folks and all that, but people who like historical importance act like it's this wholly original entity, and its really....not. which is cool, that's what fanfiction is, it's like this perpetual cycle of ideas and concepts and what not. But a big part of that is reading and participating in fandom. Most authors, a lot of authors will talk about their inspiration. Nocturnememory did. Cybrid did. Obsidianpen did. Off the top of my head. Authors who only mention their ' inspiration ' after being called out....kinda sus.

But yeah, anyway, I can see how and why people enjoy the fic. Its easy, theres not a lot of critical thinking involved in you know, the handling of some of the core concepts and beliefs that /should/be part of the death eaters and Voldemort. I mean, they're literally murderers and racists...theres not a lot of wiggle room for what they represent. And yeah, fanfic is about changing things....but everything in canon still happened up until fifth year in this fic. Wars still happened. People still died. The death eaters literally killed and tortured and hate people. Hermione is still a muggle born and still Harry's supposed best friend. But...you know, voldemort's Harry's sugar daddy so it's cool? I'm mostly kidding, I'm sorry... like I said, I can see why it could be fun. I just dont think it deserves the title of being this massively unique original flawless work.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]
