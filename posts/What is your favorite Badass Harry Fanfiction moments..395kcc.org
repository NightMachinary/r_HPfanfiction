My friend sent me the song Badass by Saliva, and it made me think of a Badass Harry Potter. So tell me, what are those moments in fanfiction that you read and said in your head or maybe even out loud, "That..was badass/epic/amazing/ect" It can be a battle, that long awaited ending to the best arc/sequence/fiction, or even an entire work. My favorite Badass Harry moment, is a tie between three different things. The first is Harry vs Allarius in Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero. Next was Harry and Dumbledore vs Vesper and Voldemort in the Denarian Knight. Finally, its the Entirety of the work Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor. Harry vs. Allarius was epic because of how impressive the battle was. For the entirety of the Hero trilogy, Harry rolls over opponents, and its THIS fight that showcases how bad ass BOTH characters are. The next one is Harry and Dumbledore vs Vesper and Voldemort. As I read this the first thing I equated it to was Naruto. Specifically when Madara entered the war. It was this fight that proved to everyone including the reader, that Harry was more than just talk. It was this fight that made it clear that Harry was able to as Madara would say "Dance with the best." Now the last work is Renegade Cause. I am just going to say.. OMG. From the first paragraph to the last sentence I marathoned it. I could not stop reading the work. And when it was all said and done, I said that was a badass story. So tell me guys, what is your favorite badass Harry Potter Fanfiction Moments? (sorry for the monster post)


** The entirety of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]].

Oh yeah.

Absolute highlight is the beginning of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/30/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][last chapter]]. Super spoilerific obviously. [[/spoiler]["I AM HARRY POTTER -- THE LAST LORD OF ATLANTIS! FOR THE CRIME OF INVADING THIS UNITED KINGDOM, I CONDEMN YOU ALL TO DEATH!"]] Hhhnnrgh, I need to reread this again.

** Favourite moment? Something from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], no doubt. The closing moments of chapter 39, I think. Doesn't get much more awesome than that.

** The very end of the last chapter (so far, fingers crossed) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/32/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] easily wins for me

** Forging the sword is one of the best fanfics I've ever read and in the first chapter is one of the saddest most epic decisions Harry could've ever made.
