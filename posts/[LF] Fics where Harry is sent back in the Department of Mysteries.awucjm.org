What the title says. During the fight (when the time turners explode or through the Veil) or later/earlier, I don't care. Also, an alternate dimension works as well.

Thanks!!


** Commenting mostly to remind myself to check back later.--I remember one that has Harry fall into some sort of pool or sludge in the DoM battle and end up in an AU. Been looking for it for ages, but can remember nothing else (not even if it was any good.) If someone knows this one, I'd appreciate learning the title.

--It isn't Harry, but you might like /Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass/. Same sort of scene as you describe, but it's Tonks who travels back. (Harry is a principle character, though.) linkffn(12188150).

*** Maybe in linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) - In the interlude (chapter 17) he falls into a stone pool in the time room and ends up in a different universe for (I think) one chapter. Really no idea if it is the scene you've been looking for, but it's the one I had to think of, when I read your comment.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

**** Thank you so much! I had to reread some to get there, and this was the scene I was thinking of. Nice to lay that question to rest.

***** I am not quite sure, what exactely you understand as the premise of the chapter. Maybe you could specify what you mean? Also I haven‘t read the story in a year and a half - apart from reading the first few paragraphs of this chapter to see, if it was what Paignion‘s been looking for - so I don‘t have the content in the forefront of my mind. You could also post a request thread, if you‘re really interested.

******* Quiet a few people like linkffn(*0800-Rent-A-Hero* by brainthief), but that premise is generally not really my cup of tea, so I'm afraid I won't be able to help you much. You might want to look for other "Harry summoned to another Dimension" fics (just search for "summoned" on the subreddit) or really make a specific request thread. Sorry!

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** I have recently read two fanfics with this setup;

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13145491/1/A-Timely-Development]]) Is weird, poorly written, and a bit insane, But I can't help but love it. We are seeing the after effects (or lack of?) of Harry, Hermione, and Neville being sent back to the 60s during the department of mysteries from the perspective of the Drs Granger.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13221168/1/Me-Without-My-TARDIS]]) Not a doctor who crossover, This Fanfic has Harry, Hermione, and Neville sent back to 1947 by the time room explosion. Featuring a Moody fresh out of training, and 11 year old Mcgonagall.

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.
