Bonus points if he and Draco are enemies, too.

Double bonus points if he befriends people outside his House who are not Ron, Hermione, or Neville. /Definitely/ not Ginny.

And just to be clear: I do /not/ want reconciliation between Harry and Snape.

Thanks! I know this is a rather specific request.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

** I have a good one for this, but I can't remember it. I'll keep this post in mind though.

Unfortunately, I went through a foolish stage of subscribing rather than bookmarking and now struggle to search for anything on AO3. Whoops.

  Harry, tired of trying to get along with his housemates, spends his Christmases at Hogwarts with Hedwig in the Owlery. There, he makes a friend who will stay with him for the rest of his life, and eventually become so much more. HP/NL, other side pairings.
