:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for the giant crossover fic that is essentially pure smut. It was a Harry Potter / Star Wars/ Buffy the vampire slayer/ stargate?/ more. It was a good read and I need the name. If anyone of you wonderful anon's know it please let me know.


** Linkffn(beginning a new path) i only remember it because the authors name stuck with me (stargatesg1fan) i tried the fic myself years ago, but couldnt get over how badly it was written xD
