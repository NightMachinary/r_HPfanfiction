Today I found this fantastic fanfic, it's a shame that this is not complete.

I really liked his romance and the pairings, especially the Harry with Narcissa as well as their interactions and how they progress in their relationship. Harry and his lack of confidence in himself and how she helps him, advises and trains him, when in the beginning she approached him for a mission given by Lucius and thus have a bargaining chip for Voldy. Only later to realize that he was falling in love more and more of him, in large part thanks to his monotonous life with lack of love in her and especially by a homosexual husband who does not love her...

Something that I liked, is to see Harry face his little deprecion and hit his confidence when he does terribly in the first task of the tournament (Harry went into the field and just started the task, a fist of stone came out of the floor and knocked him out, not lasting for 5 seconds in the task) despite being much stronger for his age group and having a lot of magic potential. Harry feels ashamed of himself and avoiding Narcissa, so that she later reaches him and talks to him. I really liked the talk she gave him, his support and comfort, how silly it was to think that I would not want it more just for a bad doing in a tournament.

Later Narcissa and her lack of self-confidence, because of her age and fear that a younger girl would take Harry away from her... Harry's jealousy seeing Cissa avoiding him and flirting with another... the internal conflict Of her, not knowing what else to do for her to talk to him.

Ufff... I just loved the way this fanfic is written with his little dramas. I just wanted to know if anyone has a good story that you could recommend that was a bit similar.

You do not need the same pairings, but I would like romance and interactions to be as good as in this fanfic. If it is possible Harry/Narcissa, I really love that pairing.
