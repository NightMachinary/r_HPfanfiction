When Harry learns of the prophecy; he sees a loophole. Either must die at the hands of the other. True immortality is there for the taking. If either can only die from the other's hand, then the prophecy dictates that they cannot die by any other means, until one kills the other. What if Harry proposes in the graveyard an unbreakable vow, on life and magic, to not harm or hinder Voldemort or his followers, in exchange for a vow similar? What if Tom agreed to not harm or hinder Harry Potter? Or his friends? Or his friend's friend's, acquaintance's, ally's, associate's, pal?


** Voldemort: ‚ÄúHa ha, no.‚Äù

/obliviates Harry into a vegetative state and sticks him in a man-sized jar/

** "Neither can live while the other survives" sorta shoots that down.

*** It's also insanely stupid. If neither can live while the other survives, then neither are actually alive.

Basically, both have always been dead.

So, both are zombies/vampires?

**** I always took it as the difference between just surviving, or truly living. While the other survives, all they do is survive. They cannot truly live out their life the way the want to until the other person is dead, as they cannot help but keep fighting each other.

***** Or maybe 'to live' is to be able to die and since whike they are both alive, neither can die, they are not living. "What is life without death?"

***** it uses both live and survive which implies theyvare different. I agree and say surviving is just not dying where living would be achieving there dreams. Voldemort could bever take over England and get rid of muggleborns if Harry is still there to fight him. Harry could never have a family because he refuses to have them become a target for Voldemort. In the spirit if the post though. If Harry could get an unbreakable vow fir Voldemort to remain in the borders of England and Harry jumps ship to France or something they could both get what they want. Everybody who doesn't want to die in a war can abandon England and Voldemort can have his pure blood society.

** I doubt Voldemort would agree. If he isn't allowed to harm his friends but his friends keep on fighting him, he has lost. If his goal is to rule the UK and kill all muggleborns, he can't agree to a deal like this and he seems to have the upper hand so he wouldn't feel the need for a deal like that. If Voldemort's only goal is immortality, he might agree, though ü§î

** I've actually thought of this before. Put Voldemort into some sort of indefinite stasis and you solve both the Horcrux problem and your own mortality! I can think of quite a few methods you could use.
