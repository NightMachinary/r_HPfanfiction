:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everyone, I need help finding a fic I was re reading. It's set after the war, Harry won but damaged his magic similar to an obscure and is exiled to the muggle world. Hermione receives a crystal ball from ex-boyfriend Ron at her birthday party and she and Harry are sucked into an alternate world with strong family magic. As in, the heads of house can sense where their family is etc.

Anyone have a link/know the title or author? Would be greatly appreciated!


** No idea how to use the bot cause I'm too lazy to learn, but it sounds like 'A Step to the Right' by CatsAreCool.

  Redo of my popular story. The Order of the Phoenix is sent a certain series which depict our heroes exploits. Reads like mysecretthought's 'Under a Watchful Eye' in which the characters respond to the books as they read without the actual book quotes being stated. Helps to have a copy or just be extremely familiar with the stories.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

** I remember this story, except I don't remember the title or author. Grrr.

Harry's Magic was broken so he had been exiled from the magical world. I think there was a gathering of friends in a pub to celebrate something (possibly Hermione's birthday) and Harry had been invited, but some other people objected to Harry being there and then Aurors came to chase him away over the objections of his friends?

I do know that it was traditional to pass on crystal balls from mother to daughter. They're supposed to show who you will marry? But Molly had more than one, so she'd spelled one to show Ron to Hermione and given it to her as a present except it opened a portal that she and Harry fell through.
