:END:
It is surprising how few times I read about somebody doing something about that curse on the DADA post. I dimly remember there was some story, where Bill Weasley (finally somebody noticed, that skilled and experienced curse-breaker could be useful) teaches DADA and he immediately starts looking for that curse and finds the first Horcrux, which apparently governs it.

Does anybody know what story I am talking about and do you know about some other stories where somebody did somebody something about that curse?


** I've read a bunch in which a time traveler knows that it's anchored by the diadem horcrux, so destroying that breaks the curse. The books never made it explicit that that's how the curse is maintained, but it's plausible. It could have nothing to do with the horcrux.

*** I really like this theory. I first remember seeing it in Wind Shear.

*** Canonically it should be that as long as Voldemort is still alive, the jinx will not be lifted. For example if I remember correctly Harry was freed from Dumbledore's restraint in HBP after he was dead.

** I've seen 3 common interpretations, but you're right in that it's far rarer than what one might expect to see it disarmed:

- Tied to the Diadem
- Tied to the Trophy for Services to the School
- Tied to the master copy of the Defense contract itself. The typical premise is that the hiring papers use a Protean charm from a master copy -- which propagates the curse -- and signing your signature activates the curse on you.

*** I've also read a fic where it's tied to the animal skeleton in the classroom. Can't remember the name though. Pretty sure it was a good fic. Might have been the sequel of What We Lost.

** *The House of Potter Rebuilt* linkffn(11933512)

It's a taboo activate curse in this one. The Voldemort solution is pretty neat too.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
