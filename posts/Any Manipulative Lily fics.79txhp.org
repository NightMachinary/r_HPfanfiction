So a pretty common theme you see for when Lily/James comes up is where James is a bit of a jerk/selfish/pureblood, not evil, but not exactly 'good'. Lily is usually portrayed as a tempering force, usually smart/Dumbledore's apprentice/force of personality. (I suppose this is a logical exaggeration of Snape's view of the word in Cannon.)

I'm wondering if we have seen any inverts of this, where Lily is shown as the less-than-ideal one. Given the memories people have of her, it would probably be her as a manipulative bastard. Ideally cast with a innocent James for a full role reversal.

I am looking for something that fits with the characters from cannon. After all, you don't have to be an angel to tell your kid 'we love you, we are proud of you', which is about all the surface area she gets in the books.

A few ways I could see this going:

- Lily manipulating James/Marauders as a way to try to friend-zone Snape.
- Lily developing and retreating behind a shell at Hogwarts, so what is presented in Canon is the mask she puts on. Could work in her sister here with the whole 'Hogwarts stole my sister' thing.
- Lily, being a smart/ambitious muggleborn, being the one to drag the marauders into conflict with Tom's group.

Or if you really wanted, double down on the teachers-pet/DD Apprentice and * Have Lily be an apprentice to Manipulative!Dumbledore, learning how to be just like him. Maybe have the whole Tom killing her thing be her failing a test.

For James, I'd imagine it'd be pretty easy to frame him like Harry, a character things happen to instead of one that drives the plot. With that, you can set up for the people around him to get him into the situations described in the book (Sirius/DD/Lily)

Anyone seen anything like this? Most everything I've run into is Pure!Snowflake!Lily, Badass!Lily, or so AU it has nothing to do with HP anymore...


** linkffn(Firebird's Son by Darth Marrs)

Lily is pretty manipulative in this - before dying, she basically manufactured Harry's extremely shitty situation, in the hope he will fix the world's problems in the future. From the way people speak of her, her personality was driven by pride in her magical skills and self-righteousness.

linkffn(Deathly Hallowed Shujin1)

The other end of the spectrum: Lily is so determined to protect Harry that she doesn't hesitate in taking /any/ measure; dark magic, soul magic, dangerous alchemical creations, endangering innocents, even sacrificing them. She just doesn't give a fuck about anything as long as Harry is safe. Have to say this is one of my favorite portrayals of Lily ever.

*** Firebird is such an odd duck.

Like the premise of the world is interesting. It's a...I don't want say good but...the magic system there works.

Until, like all Marrs fics, it goes batshit insane and everyone dies.

Like Marrs really wants to give Alan Moore a run for his money.

Except he didn't have the nuance to weave the story in such a way you don't realize he's batshit insane in until the end like Moore does.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  Not all is as it seems in the life of Harry James Potter. Lily Potter was not the person everyone thought she was and her child pays the price. Some secrets are hidden under a thin layer of lies and sometimes we carry our prison with us.

** Are you totally against Snily? If not, I have a few for you; the first is a shorter (8 chapters) piece called Winter by terri_testing. It's absolutely great in the worst way.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5728357/chapters/13199185]]

And maybe it's poor form to rec your own work but mine, Puzzle, definitely fits the manipulative mold as I get further and further into it--its from her point of view so it might be a softer take than you are looking for but Lily isn't the sweet girl so much fic makes her out to be.

***** Haha well I would think that if your characters are taking on personalities of their own, that's a good thing and means you did a good job bringing them to life! Plus I think it makes sense that they keep fighting. Lily wouldn't forgive Severus right away after the things he's done. It makes sense that it would take a lot of time spent working together to build trust before anything romantic can happen between them. That said I /am/ excited for the eventual smooching!

*** Well, I was looking for a characterization that fit into Cannon, so that excluded much Snily, but I don't object heavily to it. It would totally fit the request if it was something like 'so and so went back and time and through their interference the relationships change', as the author would still have to present a believable character that would have worked for the main story and then explain why things go different. Well done divergence fics also do this, and would fit.

**** Yeah, both of these are canon divergent but without time travel. I forget how Lily gets scooped up in Winter but basically the only difference in Puzzle is that Snape grabbed her before she could refuse to stand aside.

However, I do think you managed to find a Dramione story I don't mind reading. I generally reject school-age Dramione as unreadble, but this doesn't really fall into that category...
