I remember it being kind of Smutty, Harry/Hermione and Susan/Hannah and it kind of ends up a foursome if I remember correctly. I've done a bunch of searches and haven't been able to find it, hope it wasn't deleted.


** I think I must have read the same fic, I have really vague memories of that sort of dynamic somewhere. I hope you find it for both our sakes.

*** I remember a couple different scenes, one where the two couples were crammed in a broom cupboard and when someone was about to open the door, two house elves popped hermione and Hannah away and Susan and Harry were left barely dressed inside to sell it. I also remember All four had a scene in a bathtub or a hot tub either in the prefects bath or ror. Plus there was a scene where Harry didn't have glasses on and hermione was tending to Harry while he looked at Susan (blurry) to create a memory in case snape or another leg looked at his memories.

Edit: it was Susan/Lisa Turpin

#+begin_quote
  Harry formulates an innovative taunting-based Occlumency barrier inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Snape retaliates by threatening to reveal Harry's perviest memories and fantasies, including those involving a certain bushy-haired best friend.
