Sirius was minding his own business as he ate. Prongs and Lily were arguing and last night was full moon. When the doors burst open and an angry young man around 21-23 came in.

“ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, WHAT IN THE NAME OF MERLIN DID YOU DO???”. He yelled.

Immediately all the professors had their wands trained on the man. Dumbledore looked shocked for a moment before looking like himself again. If Sirius didn't know any better, he would say Dumbledore looked amused. “Ah Harry my dear boy, how about we continue this conversation in my office”.

Sirius gaped and so did most everyone else in the room. This man had more or less invited himself into Hogwarts, yelled at the Headmaster and Dumbledore doesn't even seem concerned? What if he was a death eater?.

“But Albus he could be a death eater.” Said Minnie. Dumbledore's voice was a little sharper when he replied “He is not a death eater Minerva. Harry was my apprentice and I think I would notice if he had a dark mark on his left arm. Besides Harry has his own vendetta against Voldemort. We just had a little problem”

If the great hall was shocked before they were extremely shocked now. Sirius could swear some of the looked jealous. After all this man they knew literally nothing about was someone Dumbledore had as an apprentice!

Harry snorted at the looks on the professors and other students before he glowered. “Yes /little/ problem”

“Well we might as well have this conversation in your office Albus. Lets go”

And with that they both left the great hall completely ignoring everyone else.

------------------------

What do you think. Sirius is kinda OOC but I don't want to fix it now. Also I'm sucker for Harry as Dumbledore's apprentice.


** Ok, it might be good, why has no one ever thought of something like this? Maybe in a moment I will write something similar to this in the comments and think if I want to take another ff with potential.

**** I recently went back to my old fics sketches because I had a terrible creative block, took a break, but recently finished chapter 12 and start 13. I'm not publishing it yet, but once it is translated from my native language into English I will definitely post a link here.
