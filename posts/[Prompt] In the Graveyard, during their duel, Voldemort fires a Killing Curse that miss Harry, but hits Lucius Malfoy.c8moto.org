*** For those who want to read the scene in question

"What's the Potter boy doing here, then?" one of them finally asked.

He received a bout of the Cruciatius, just for the principle of the thing, before Voldemort explained. "We were just about to duel to the death."

I blinked. "Weren't you trying to recruit me?"

"Yes, but you said no, so now I'm going to kill you. Dear Merlin, Potter, keep up."

"I'm not fighting you," I said. I didn't particularly want to kill myself, and he was probably protected by the Horcruxes, anyway. So I couldn't even kill him properly. Besides, I just put in so much effort to resurrect him. I bled.

Voldemort scowled, and a flick of his hand sent the Death Eaters hurrying to circle us and block my escape. "You don't get a choice in this."

"Fine," I grunted. I would play along, for the moment.

We bowed, raised our wands, and began. "Avada Kedavra!"

The following fight can best be described as very green. Avada Kedavras flew wildly through the air. His were weaker than mine as he was still cheerful after gaining a new body while I was carrying a grudge over his sabotaging my time in the tournament.

We effortlessly dodged each other's spells. But they found targets easily enough.

One by one, Death Eaters fell. A few realized what was going on. Lucius, for instance, was using Crabbe as a human shield. Yet their numbers kept thinning.

Voldemort's spells took out more of his people than mine did, which was surprising because I was actually aiming.

Eventually, I maneuvered myself close to a wide gap in the ring of my former and apparently current followers. With one last Avada Kedavra in Voldemort's direction, I sprinted away, headed towards the graveyard's gates.

However, I took a small detour to grab the Cup because it was mine. As I snatched its handle, something tugged at my navel and the world began to spin, eventually solidifying into the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.

Greeted by the surprised faces of my teachers and classmates, I knew immediately that I had to tell them. After all, I knew something incredibly important, something that mattered. I could not allow them to wallow in ignorance for a moment longer.

I held my trophy aloft and shouted, "I declare victory!"

** In fifth year:

"You'll regret this when my father hears about this, Potter- oh..."

Audible sobbing muffles Rons next few words, certainly stupid ones, as Harry walks to his next class.
