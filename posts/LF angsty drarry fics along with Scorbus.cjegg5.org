I really like the idea of stories where Harry and Draco realise their feelings for each other (or grieve over their failed relationship) after finding out that Scorpius and Albus are in a relationship. The story should be focused on Harry and Draco rather than Albus and Scorpius. There should be s LOT of ANGST.
