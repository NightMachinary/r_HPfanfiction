Sorry if this isn't the right place, but I'm brand new to reddit. I have looked all over the fanfic sites to find this one fic I read ages ago and LOVED but have forgotten the name and author. Any help would be appreciated! It's a long, canon compliant, post war Harry Hermione story. Harry and Hermione have a slow burn going on and have an affair, resulting in Hermione's pregnancy with Rose. One scene I remember vividly is the trio and Ginny painting the nursery and setting up the crib for Ginnys firstborn, and it causes all sorts of feels for H/Hr since Hermione is also pregnant with Harry's child. Another scene I remember is Luna watching H/Hr and the kids at the Burrow around Christmas time and Hermione wondering if Luna knows about Rose. And Harry gives Hermione a lovely necklace for Christmas (after literally throwing rocks at her kitchen window and making her go outside to meet him since Ron is on the couch inside). And Ginny gets either poisoned or cursed (can't remember which) and as she's dying she basically tells Hermione to take care of Harry because she's known about them all along.


** this is the right place, but you might want to check the flair explanation on the right side of this page. There is a flair (Flairs are almost like tags for your post) called "What's that fic?"
