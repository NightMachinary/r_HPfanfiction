Kicking Gotham and Toppling Heros have me in the mood for more Harry Potter and DC crossovers. So I was wondering if people could recommend me some of their favorites. And please don't recommend megamatt's work. I've read some of his already, they're okay but have gotten stale pretty quick.


** Sadly, in my experience, HP/DC stories fall into one of the following categories:

- Blood Brandy Vegas Challenge. These are usually 1-3 chapters long, and typically only include the lol-so-random drunken awakening scene, plus loads of exposition about how hot the woman/women in question are, and why they're now totally in a binding and inescapable marriage. Strangely, everyone seems to be fine with this.
- Harry is Superman's/Batman's/The Joker's/etc son. These are usually mostly canon-re-treads with large amounts of wizard bashing, intermixed with fluffy family stuff. Harry usually gets given some superpower or other which gets more play than the actual magic.
- Megamatt.

It's gotten to the point where I'm not sure people even think of writing anything that's not one of those when they decide to do something HP/DC.

*** For the second one, I think a big part is the power differential between magic users in DC vs Harry Potter, and how prevalent magic is in DC. You have roughly 100 gods or god-like magic users that are active participants in DC. There are over 100 million Atlanteans almost all of whom are capable of using some sorcery, and the number of fully qualified ones is higher than most estimates of the wizarding world population. Then you have the Homo Magi, who should be at least as numerous as wizards, and who max out at theoretically able to destroy the Earth. The existence of Homo Magi, and magic in general, is also publicly known. Pre-52 there was even another subrace that only had illusion magic, and you could learn magic by brute force even if you didn't have any inborn capability.

Then there's demons, angels, loaners, djinn...

And a typical witch/wizard is basically helpless when you take their wand away. Unlike the vast majority of the DC types.

If you're going to have them stick around in a noticeably heroic fashion, then it might not seem all that believable without giving Harry or whoever a powerup. Giving them a family connection has the added advantage of making them easier to integrate.

**** The things you mention are exactly what makes it an interesting crossover, in my view.

With a lot of crossovers there's often perceived to be a massive power differential in favour of Harry Potter. I think having the Harry Potter character be the underdog in the pure power stakes is a nice change of pace from settings like a song of ice and fire which frequently involve either boring curb-stomps or inexplicable de-powering.

Not only that, but so what if the Harry Potter characters in the crossover are weaker than Doctor Fate, or the Spectre, or Darkseid? Most characters in DC are weaker than those big hitters, that's why the comics they're in feel like they have stakes. DC might be a universe of Gods and Demons of unfathomable power, but it's also home to the likes of Green Arrow, the entire Bat Family (not going to mention Batman himself, as he has plot armour up the wazoo, but Nightwing is an example), and plenty of non-powered baddies. Why does Harry have to be able to mix it up with the big-leagues to make the crossover worth doing?

Finally, having a crippling weakness (the wand) is hardly an unusual thing in DC. Superman's weaknesses are well known, but even Zatanna can be rendered pretty much harmless with a single silencing charm. Pretty much everyone has a weakness that can be exploited by a skilled and prepared wizard. Sure, if Harry got stuck in a cage match with many DC heroes and villains, he'd be in trouble, but a cage match isn't all that interesting as a story.

I don't disagree with you. The things you mention /are/ factors, and I don't doubt they are a dominant reason for the general lack of HP/DC crossovers. I just feel like there's a whole ocean of possibility out there in DC, with so many different heroes and villains, there's an uncountable number of stories that could be told. It seems unfortunate to throw that all away because of the perception that Harry 'needs' to be able to stand up against Superman or Shazam in a toe-to-toe fight for the story to be worth telling.

***** That's fair. I'm not saying they need to go heads up against Captain Marvel or be able to teabag Trigon. They do however, need to be able to survive the story without it seeming ridiculous.

If you get noticed for doing heroic/villainous stuff as a magic user, then you start attracting hostile supernatural types. Canon trainee wizard Harry (or basically any other Hogwarts student) doesn't have the magical chops to hang in the kiddie pool, gets rendered completely helpless without a wand, and doesn't exactly have a wealth of useful skills outside of their magic. Hermione as research assistant for some DC magical in a Carnacki type story is workable, but that's going to be a quick trip.

Even /Kicking Gotham/ gave Harry a large skill and experience upgrade from canon due to being a 10 year auror, along with equipment upgrades. And that was to make it through something both low level and beneath the public eye.

Raised by Batman type stories give Harry a lot of skills, and he just happens to have magic. Keeps Hogwarts usable, and gives him DC enemies he can believably handle. They work well, but a lot of people don't feel like it's still Harry in those cases.

Even some of the more popular fanon upgrades from non-crossover stuff, or having them /Bungle in the Jungle/, is probably enough to hit respectable potential sidekick/teen hero level of ability.

Although now I want a BintJ type story where Harry and Bill interact with Congorilla, Jungle Girl, or some other appropriate D listers.

It turns out Vernon Dursley has a nephew as well, and 19 year old Dick Grayson seems to be nothing like the Dursleys that Harry has grown to hate. Maybe this Summer will be a little bit better with some company.
