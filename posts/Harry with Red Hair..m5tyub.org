Gets confused for a Weasley at King's Cross(or was it on the train?) and they all just roll with it.

I know there's one where Albus takes him to the Weasleys at age 5 or so and his hair gets dyed Red, not the one I'm looking for.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
