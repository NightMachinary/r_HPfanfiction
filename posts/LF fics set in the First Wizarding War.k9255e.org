Angst, Dark undertones, romance; Any genre, just no bashing. Preferably complete and canon-compliant is not necessary but preferable.

I am looking for fics set in the dark decade - 1970-1981. Haven't found many, so can you please recommend them?

BTW, Why is this called the /First/ War? Weren't there other wars - like Grindelwald's revolution, Goblin revolutions, dark wizard eras, witch-hunt etc? And isn't this set in Britain only? So why is it /first wizarding/ when there could have been other wizarding wars in other countries - say, France - in other years? This has been bugging me a lot, any answers?

Thanks in advance.


** highly non canon, Harry sent back to 1970s, very good, complete, oh and gray Harry.

starts in 1972 during the war, canon compliant, pov Narcissa Malfoy so from the DE perspective. Complete.
