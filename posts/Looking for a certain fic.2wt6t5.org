I really want to read one that has no antagonist. I just want to read about the average day at hogwarts, homework and quidditch. Thanks!

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** It's not exactly what I'd call a good fic, but I had to stretch a lot to meet your requirements (turns out most fics have an antagonist - who knew, right?)

It's a fem!Harry x Draco 'pureblood' love story. It's above average quality for its genre, but that doesn't say much.

On the plus side, no antagonist! Enjoy :)
