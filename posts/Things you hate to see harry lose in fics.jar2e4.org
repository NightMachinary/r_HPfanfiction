Like the titles says what do you hate to see harry lose in fics. For me theres 3 big ones. In no particular order his patronus changing unexpectedly.

The marauders map being destroyed. His invisibility cload also being lost either in battle or through someone destroying it malevolently


** Hedwig and Sirius.

Most of the things Harry commenly loses are material possessions and while he does have a connection to them, the loss of his first real companion and his godfather hurt him way more and I hate for that to happen.

Sirius not dying in a fic is always a big plus for me.

**** Yeah, that's mainly from the movies. Daniel Radcliffe is shorter (about 3 inches if I recall?) and not as lanky as book Harry.

Personally I can see Harry as a bit shorter due to not having a proper diet during his earlier years, but yeah, it's easy to imagine movie Harry over book Harry because we can actually see him.

However, I don't get where people get extremely delicate-looking Harry from. Like just genderbend him if you want him looking so effeminate, don't twist his physical appearance so much for no reason.

***** I...don't see why you should genderbend him rather than change his appearance? Harry being a fully different gender is a /much/ larger change than him looking effeminate, and there's a /massive/ difference between being a delicate-looking dude and being a girl.

Maybe the author just wants Harry to be effeminate. Do we really need to ask people to only change canon, especially something as relatively small as appearance, for a particular reason? (Unless they're going on and on about how delicate-looking he is and it's irrelevant to the plot, of course - but that's just poor writing.) (And also with the exception of when appearance matters - like, if you change Harry's black hair and green eyes, then it should affect the story.)

****** people want to change characters' gender for different reasons. Some are exploring their own gender, others are just wanting to see how things might change if the character was a different gender.

I hate it more when people make him effeminate just to suit their idea of what a gay guy should look like to a straight person. Like some writers will make him more androgynous for valid reasons, which is cool, but a lot are just doing it for fetishy reasons

Either way I think both the genderbent, trans or androgynous Harry are valid changes to make, just so long as the story supports it and it's not fetishising people

******* Your second point is what I was really targeting earlier. If you are going to put Harry in a gay relationship, don't try to make it as straight as possible. Harry is not physically weak and delicate; he's technically a stereotypical jock if you look at him. If you are not comfortable in writing a same-sex relationship without one masculine and one feminine character, either put them with someone else, or change their gender (while keeping in mind this will not extremely affect much of some characters' personalities without some other changes).

Anyways, yeah, it's fine to mess with genders and sexualities as long as it fits. However, don't make half the cast trans (actually trans, not genderbent) then never talk about it, it kind of clutters up the story and people expect there to be a reason. People like representation, but just announcing something and ignoring it really doesn't help anybody.

******* You have a fair point about gay men being stereotyped as effeminate. I don't really see a lot of effeminate!Harry (usually it's Draco who fits the stereotype better), and when I do, he's almost always also gay. Which is a shame, we need more effeminate straight/bi dude representation! But I wonder if part of that is not just stereotypes, but also because lgbtq+ people writing queer relationships are also more likely to play with gender roles?

Or maybe straight people fetishizing gay people are the majority, and I'm just lucky to have avoided them.

******** Yeah in experience it's straight women fetishising gay men, which is suss as fuck. Like I headcanon a genderqueer Sirius, so I definitely am not against genuinely fucking around with gender identity, or genuine campiness, and giving a big fuck you to gender norms (and Rowling); but it's best when that expression is natural within the story and not just for the straight gaze. and, you know, somewhat awkward (because teenagers) instead of having it be tokenistic or fetishy.

Totally agree about having more androgynous straight rep, heteroflecible and bi/ pan rep. we love to see it

Honestly my gay male friends are some of the most masculine dudes I know, and I have some straight male friends who are generally more fem leaning or ‘delicate' with long hair. It's called a spectrum for a reason

** His scar and his glasses.

I find it very hard to picture Harry without his glasses and it makes me quite uncomfortable. Also, as someone who has glasses I hate the rhetoric that tends to accompany Harry getting rid of them: There's always something about them being ugly and unnecessary, why didn't Dumbledore take him to this obscure shop in Diagon Alley before, you look so much better, blah blah blah...

The scar totally disappearing is a similar level of uncomfortable for me. It's part of his physical Harry-ness. If it disappears in the context of "Lord Peverell Slytherin Potter, aged 12, says hello to a Goblin and so becomes a Friend to The Nation(TM) and acceses their ritual to undermine Dumbledore and his Greater Good(TM)", it seems like such a smug gesture to me.

The same with scars. The fact that Dumbledore says in canon that even if he could get rid of a scar on a baby's face he wouldn't because ‘it's useful'? That is so fucked up.

Also, Harry was the first character with a facial scar that was not evil nor an helpless victim I encountered. It was the first postive representation I've got, and the only one for a very long time.

Removing is scar is really problematic to me. We don't have nearly enough positive representation of characters with scars, especially facial and visible ones. Let us have this one, please.

******* I personally always figured that he would get an impression from her similar to the uncanny valley. Basically, he'd look at her and see his old friend (and he's not a pedophile, so it would remind him of their /friendship/ back when it was still completely innocent, not his unrequited love), but then he would see her eyes reflect those of his old tormentor, and be wrenched out of the reminiscing in a very jarring way. So I think he would try to ignore her as much as possible because she'd invoke conflicting feelings within him and make him uncomfortable.

I could see someone, remembering Severus and Lily's relationship in the past, ask Fem!Harry to "tell them immediately if Snape acts strangely", just in case, but I very much doubt anything problematic would actually occur. Even if your view on Snape is "Snape is a bastard", there's no way he'd do anything inappropriate. If there was even the slighest possibility of it, Dumbledore wouldn't have let him teach.

Hedwig. I'd much rather have whatever OC or OOC canon character representing the author's wish-fulfillment be killed off than Hedwig. It's even worse when it's a story devoted to "changing canon" but kills Hedwig off anyway.

Also his accomplishments. Like, he learned to cast a patronus in third year. It hurts me a little when that gets changed or lost entirely.

** - Hedwing
- Sirius
- Parents/marauders memorabilia (cloak/map/photoalbum/etc)
- When James/Lily/Dumbledore steal/piss away the Potter fortune and Harry is all "that's nice, at least it went to a good cause..."

Seriously, this one alone irritates me to no end. James/Lily couldn't have spent ALL of the Potter fortune on war supplies unless they were throwing sacks of gold around or downright gullible. The Potters were a pureblood family that is hundreds of years old (at least), with quite a few inventions under their belt. They should be rolling in money. Especially that Potions business his Grandfather sold. Okay, I'm going off on a tangent...

- Firebolt

Seriously, this one also angers me to no end. Umbridge breaks it, steals it and "locks it up", it doesn't matter. She literally just stole something that's worth more than her job at the Ministry of Magic. I would have sent an owl off to the DMLE. Forget the fact that she is torturing kids. People have been sent to Azkaban for stealing things that are worth less.

*** oh yeah, that one makes me so sad! Harry finding out he has money after being neglected so badly is such a thing for me and when a story has it all gone I genuinely feel so devastated. Like just give him this one thing!

I think part of it is the fact that his parent looked out for him, and made sure he'd be ok, even though they weren't there. It really hurts when that is taken away.

Sometimes people water down the character or character bash one character a little too much and it just kind of evaporates the interesting personalities and interactions of the characters it makes the story a little bit more difficult to believe characters need depth and personality..

** Once read a fanfic where Harry, Ron and Ginny meant to travel back in time but they went to another universe. I think they lost the war. Anyways in this universe the prophecy was public knowledge and the wording was something like he will have a terrible power. Which frightened a lot of folk. More specifically Arthur and Molly Weasley. But because Ron and Ginny are so different ( them being war veterans but in children's bodies ) they thought Harry was a terrible influence. Harry in an attempt to seek the same level of love he had received from HIS Weasleys were ignored and shunned. Molly was so wary of him and Harry had tried to recreate a moment just to have Arthur turn him away. Was utterly heartbreaking. I know this is a weird interpretation of the topic. But man it still sometimes makes me cry.

** I like "Wrong boy who lived" stories AU, Crossover, and time-travel fics and some things that always get on my nerve are if he loses

1. His good personality In many of these fics, and I'm not talking about evil!Harry fics, harry just goes mental, torturing people left-right, and center and is a dick to everyone except the love interest and still gets treated like the good guy.

2. His Wand I don't know why but Holly-Phoenix feather is just the right combination of good guy and light. The other wands are boring in comparison.

3. The Marauders Map It's such an interesting tool and is a direct connection to his parents. ( I know the invisibility cloak is similar but in most of the fics I'm reading it gets given to the WBWL) The map is also kind of broken whist at Hogwarts if I was the headmaster of Hogwarts that piece of parchment would be in my office and constantly in use ethics be dammed.

** Oh, plenty. His temper, his kind-hearted nature, his self-sacrificing instinct. Those are the three big ones.

A lot of fics tend to sub in the author's own ego, e.g. making Harry do a heel-turn and decide that he's going to pursue his own success/well-being from now on, regardless of the disasters constantly happening around him. That's simply not in his nature. This is the fundamental reason why I can't get on with a lot of Dark!Harry fics, despite the fact that I love the trope in theory: Harry is far more likely to pick up dark magic if he thinks it can do some good for others, than he is to want it for his own power and betterment.

Harry Potter has no self-preservation instinct and no ego. He's made to be the exact opposite of Tom Riddle in that regard, despite their surface similarities. Harry has no ego; Tom is all ego. Tom is a sociopath; Harry is all empathy. It's what distinguishes him from the vast majority of modern Bildungsroman fantasy protagonists, whose drives concern their own fates, whereas Harry's drive is mainly concerned with the fate of the world around him.

I have no strong feelings towards Hinny, but really, you don't need to drag the whole family through the mud and make them into gold diggers to make your ship work. It's usually to shoehorn Harmony too, which has made that ship utter cancer to me.

It really irks me, especially when it happens later in the story. I'm not talking about development, that's different and important. I'm talking about people changing things about him for the hell of it, like eye color, hair, personality (he becomes unnecessarily weak/cold/dark/evil for no real reason), etc.

If you want to write a SI/OC fic, do that. Don't change everything about Harry, and still call him Harry. That's not Harry anymore. Some authors even acknowledge this in the story and have him permanently change his name, basically saying fu to his parents; not because he was in immediate danger, but because he didn't want the "attention" anymore.

Like, no.

There are certain exceptions (like AUs, character study stories), but for the most part I despise majorly OOC Harry.

And his name. I don't care much if it's some sort of thing like 'I go by harry but I'm officially this', it's more when he changes this name to something that doesn't have any connection to Harry.\\
Partially because it is SUCH a radical change, and also because it makes it really hard to remember who Harry is if I continue further into the fic.\\
(The only time I accept other names besides Harry is when I'm reading a female!harry fic, mostly because for whatever reason it bothers me when they just have fem!harry named Harriet. It's incredibly unimaginative, and despite how little we see of James and Lily in terms of personality I just don't see them naming their child that.
