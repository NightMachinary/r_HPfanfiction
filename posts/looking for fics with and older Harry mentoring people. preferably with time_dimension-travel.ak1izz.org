#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** I've also found it turning gradually more terrible as it went along. The tasteless and stupid bashing of Ron and Dumbledore aside, the blatant sexualisation of underage witches completely killed it for me.What was worse though is that despite the rather imaginative premise, it deteriorated into a badly-done trope-fest after the first third of the story. Kinda got boring too because of that. There were no antagonists and aside from Garry not one character had real agency. It gets tedious.

** Two from the Star Wars crossover and one from Highschool DxD come to mind: linkffn(11157943; 8501689; 12772385)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] by kathryn518 features MoD Harry picking up Ahsoka after the end of the Clone Wars cartoon. At the start of the story, he's been there a while and mostly mentors Ahsoka, but he picks up a few other 'students' too. Needless to say, Potter Luck is still with him strong despite his age and dimension jumping.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]] by Tsu Doh Nimh has Harry more thrown into things around the time of the Phantom Menace and he ends up having some mentoring of Anakin because his sudden appearance and actions altered how Episode 1 ended. It's all in his PoV, so there's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8594589/1/The-Unsuspecting-side-of-the-Force][companion fic]] that shows what happens in a couple of the offscreen moments that are hinted at in the main fic that Harry simply isn't there to witness or with more clarity simply by being from the perspective of someone else who has more information.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] by Vimesenthusiast doesn't have Harry leaving Earth or his original dimension as the first two(three) do, but instead leaving England for Japan to get away from his ex-wife, taking his daughter with him and becoming a teacher in Kuoh. He mentors some of the cast, but it's more of a minor thing behind him being a father to his daughter and pseudo-father for a couple of them; not Rias or Akeno, just as a warning (the father bit, that is; it's a bit more equal give and take on the mentoring level in various areas). Then again, it's DxD; that's practically a warning label on it's own...

Like Lily and James Potter naming one of their kids Naruto or Ichigo. I only read one for Naruto/DxD that had Naruto reincarnated as a devil that at least explained it with a book that his new mother favored that turned out to be about his previous life and he was thus named after himself coincidentally. It was a surprise to myself to even give it a chance to begin with...

To clarify, DxD devils don't have anyone that has a Japanese name, at least not among their pureblood type.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
