Lf A fanfic where Harry acts and thinks like Luna. Preferably xover but not necessarily. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!


** "I See the Moon" by notsoB-hctiB on fanfiction.net. It's a crossover with Avengers, set in the Avengers-verse, where Harry out-Luna's Luna. Abandoned, but still one of my favorites.

** you might enjoy linkao3(438516) and linkao3(23395243), both of which have a slightly odd (but very endearing) Harry and are delights to read.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

  Harry Potter has non-human blood. In childhood, he is contacted by his kin and given support and instruction. How will these changes affect his Hogwarts career? He is not the bold Gryffindor saviour people were expecting. He is ready to love the wizarding world, but will it love him back?I expect there to be pairings in later stories, and for the rating to rise.
