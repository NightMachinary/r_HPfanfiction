I dont care if it is post hogwarts or during hogwarts. I would just like a fic that has a harry with an adventurous nature(during hogwarts) or is an adventurer/ explorer(post hogwarts) like he goes and roams the world in search of lost myths and creatures. A harry/luna pairing would also be ideal cause they could go look for creatures together. NO Slash, Non-Con mpreg, draco is a veela bullshit, etc TIA


** I enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer). Sadly the sequel is incomplete. Hopefully you get some good recommendations since I enjoy such fics as well. RemindMe! 2days

** There's linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern). The first chapter is a little confusing, but it gets much better very quickly.

Definitely worth a read. The fighting and action stuff is very, very good.

There's a lot of love potions and betrayals. Luna is not quite recognizable, and there's little face-to-face interaction. Weasleys and others bashing.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Harry Potter and the Sun Queen linkffn(10659456) is a crossover with the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, and follows along with the game's plot but features many of the ideas that you are looking for.

  During his exploration of the history of the magical Far East, Harry Potter finds cryptic references to an island Kingdom called Yamatai, supposedly ruled by the powerful Sun Queen Himiko until its sudden disappearance millennia ago. He never was able to pass up a good mystery.
