Bashing. Where did it come from? Why do people think it's a good idea?

Many Characters in the HP Universe are less than perfect but that, to me, is what makes them so interesting. So why are people bashing seemingly random characters? I don't mean turning a character into a villain for the sake of the story. This is needed at times for plot twists and so on. No, what I mean is turning on character into a complete a*****e for no apparant reason other than that they can be hated by the main cast and everyone else later. And most likely die a horrible and/or rediculous death at the end.

What is it that makes this so appealing? It has to be on some level or no one would write (or read) it.

Can someoe explain to me how this is a thing and why it seems to be a problem only of the HP (and Naruto) fandom(s)? (I have yet to read it anywhere else)

Thank you for your time.


** Cliched characters are easier to write and understand than the relatively complex characters we were given by JKR. The majority of FFic writers are usually young and/or not experienced enough in writing to capture the complex characters, and accidentally or intentionally end up turning them into flanderised caricatures.

Creating too-good perfect characters makes for a boring mary-sue-fest (although sue stories have an audience too, usually from readers seeking wish fulfillment), and almost no author sets out to do that.

On the other hand, making someone into a too-evil LITERALLY HITLER villain makes for a story that has more conflict, and conflict, however superficial, usually improves a story.

It also doesn't help that people love to feel morally superior. When the target of the bashing 'gets what's coming to him/her', there is a certain vengeful satisfaction. The good guys have won again, etc. etc.

*TL;DR Bash stories are easier to write, and everybody loves a justice-jerk.*

*** Okay, that makes sense. So, you're saying it's kind of like a stepping stone? Someone would write this because they can't (or don't want to bother to) do any better but if the can they will? I think I'll choose to believe that. My faith in humanity likes the idea.

** (1) The character gets in the way of the writer's preferred ship and they feel that villainizing them is the only way to shoehorn them out of the picture. (Particularly common with Ron and/or Ginny when writing Harry/Hermione.) Alternately, the writer is attempting to create relationship drama and is only capable of doing so by turning someone into an arsehole.

(2) The writer simply doesn't like the character in question.

** I agree with the other posters, but I would add one point. I think part of it is related to how long people waited between books. It gave us enough time to come up with elaborate fan theories and a lot of people got really attached to what they had predicted. When the books didn't comply with what they wanted, I think a lot of people became a bit angry, and I would say irrationally so. Resulting in over the top bashing.

** What I can add here is that I've seen this in every fanfiction community I've read in. That's not too many, granted, but it's about half a dozen or so (counting HP). So it's pretty common, really. I suspect in HP people have read so much they're aware of it, even when they're doing it, so they label it in advance (at least, I've seen some folks do that, which is a nice sign at the beginning that I can just skip this and find something else).
