Ok, so this is a request and a question. I've posted a lot of requests today, that's because I'm on break and bored, but that's besides the point. Do you guys know of any LONG and well written fics that chronicle Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts. I know of a few that do his first year but they always stop after that. I'm asking for two reasons, which also plays into part 2 of my question. Number 1, I would like to read it, and number 2, I'm likely going to try and write one, so I'd be curious to hear if anyone was interested in reading something along the lines of which I have specified. Thanks you ACI100


** I'm not sure if it's considered well written, but I kinda like it. It features an OC which is stuck on TMR head and basically it centers around TMR

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** I would read it. Whats your ffn?

I also find it weird that I havent come across a story that just goes through tmr hogwarts time, it seems like it would make a great Dark!Harry like story. Granted I havent really searched for it either.

Muggleborn in slytherin is a great source of conflict initially imo, but you probably have alreqdy thought of that.

He's only written years 1-4 currently, but they're a fantastic read.
