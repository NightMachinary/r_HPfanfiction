So I stumbled across a blatant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5122605/Arnold-DeVillena][plagiarizer]] on ff.net and was hoping to be pointed to the original works.

I recognize several of the stories but aside from White Knight, Grey Queen, I couldn't place where I originally came across them.

If you have the time please report the user for abuse.


** You realize you can c/p the titles onto google and 99% of the time it'll point you to the original author.

*** Yep. Copy-paste is probably the fastest way to ID the fics. Lmao at those update rates, though. Too obvious.

** I know all of these :/ I was actually just reading the "Key to Summer" this week, and its kind of weird one to plagiarize. Not exactly classic material.
