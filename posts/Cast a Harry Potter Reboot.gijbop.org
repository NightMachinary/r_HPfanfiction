Here's a game, if Warner Bros. decided to make a Harry Potter reboot, who would you cast in the roles?


** Adam Driver as Snape. Everyone else stays the same.

** Most of the actors would be unnamed child actors, and fingers crossed they would be able to locate better ones than the original movies (if Game of Thrones and Stranger Things can do it, I don't see why HP can't).

*** Emma Watson done near perfect job as Hermione. Whoever does her role gets constant useless comparisons and trolls. I don't wish such fate on small kids

** It's just too soon, so many of the original cast /could/ remain the same and it wouldn't make a difference. Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, David Bradley, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, Emma Thompson... The only ones that really need recasting are the children or younger adults, and the actors who have died.

** Somewhere there would have to be Benedict Cumberbatch... I don't care where and I don't care what. He simply has to be in them.
