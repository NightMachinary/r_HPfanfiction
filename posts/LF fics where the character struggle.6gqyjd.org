Struggle makes the victory that much sweeter. So - I am looking for fics where even with the best of planning, our characters are beaten to within an inch of their life. Fics where Voldemort seems like an insurmountable obstacle. Fics with tragedy and loss. Fics where, at points, it feels like all our characters' efforts have been for naught.

Despite this, the fic should

- be complete

- have a happy ending

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
