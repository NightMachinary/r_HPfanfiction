:END:
Around April or something, I read this body swap fanfic between Harry and Draco.

[SPOILERS] Some key details were:

• Harry and Draco were actually born as each other but Lucius Malfoy switched them as babies while James and Lily were on some sort of motorcycle and used a glamour spell to disguise them as each other so that Draco (who's actually Harry) wouldn't be killed by Voldemort

• One summer they start noticing their features change and morphing and right before they head back to school they completely transform

• Draco and Harry get into a fight at Platform 9 3/4

• The two decide to switch lives and keep it a secret but it gets found out later by Hermione, Ron & Snape (I think)

• Snape makes a permanent polyjuice potion that could “return them back to the way they were”

• There was around 12-20 chapters and it wasn't finished

If anyone knows this fanfiction and can link this fanfiction down I'd greatly appreciate it!
