Hi everyone.

An idea I had of a scene which amused me. Feel free to expand on it or imagine the events that led to this. Should be open ended enough to make this into just about anything.

​

​

Harry was mostly alright. A few bruises here and there, some cuts but amazingly nothing more serious than that.

Hours of battle had led him to this point. He could still hear the sound of fighting far off, his friends and allies, with whom he'd had to split up earlier, still fighting for their lives against what was left of the Death Eaters.

He hoped they would be alright.

​

"So this is our last gig. You ready?"

She had come. True to her word.

Bellatrix Black's (formerly Lestrange) betraying the Dark Lord had come as a shock to everyone at the time.

Voldemort had managed to trick Harry into fetching a prophecy in the depths of the Ministry of Magic. It had been an ambush, of course, but just at the right time, when they were about to get overwhelmed, Bellatrix had suddenly Apparated in and started cursing the Death Eaters, then fend off the Dark Lord long enough for Dumbledore to arrive.

They'd been working together since then. Or rather on the same side, there was too much bad blood between the woman and the Order to allow anything much closer between them.

Harry himself still wasn't able to let go of his hatred for her, but they needed any wand willing to fight...

​

"I am. Let's end this." He replied.

They stood side by side in front of the door. The heavy wooden door which was the only thing left between them and Voldemort. They took a moment to prepare themselves, to calm their nerves.

They glanced at each other, tension (and maybe a little fear) obvious on their faces.

Harry then lifted his wand and the door exploded into splinters and they threw themselves into the huge, round room behind it.


** " Well done Harry,you've saved the wizarding world "

" Mrs.Lestrange,you are hereby under arrest for the murders of 57 wizards and 109 Muggles,torture,evading the law and loads of other shit you can tell us later "

" B-b-but ! "

" Mrs Lestrange you only helped kill Voldermort for spurring your advances. That does not excuse Impersiusing Muggle men into murdering their wives and children "

*** Harsh, but I could see this happen.

Amusing take on this.

The way I picture this Bellatrix reacting to this, though, would be to simply hand over her wand and accept her fate. Or maybe to have been far away long before the first Auror shows up.

Nice one nonetheless.

** You've possibly read it based on the suggestion, but linkffn(Earl of the North) has a repentant Bellatrix, but it's after OOTP, rather than the final battle.

*** Don't know this one, I'll check it out, thanks.

Edit: Note that my prompt isn't necessarily about a redeemed Bellatrix. It's about Bellatrix teaming up (sort of) with Harry and the Order to take out Voldemort. A lot of different reasons could've prompted her to do so.
