Hi all, I sincerely hope you can all help as I've exhausted all avenues I can think of to try myself.

Between books I read an awful lot of fic as many of us will have done. Between HBP and DH there were a lot of great fics that took the horcrux search and ran with it in fabulous ways. I'm looking for one of those.

So, I'm certain this was written 2005-2007. As far as I am aware it was not hosted on FFN/LJ and this was pre-AO3. The site itself was either personal or one of the smaller archives. I can't say as to which.

It was potentially part of a collaboration or fic exchange (Big Bang style) as it had artwork seeded throughout. One particular image that stays with me was a child, I think an Inferi child, sitting on a bed in the ruins of Tom Riddle's orphanage - a place Harry had to visit to retrieve/investigate horcruxes.

I think this was Harry/Draco, as that was always my ship of choice at the time.

So: can anyone drag any memories of such a fic to the surface? It's a fic that I regularly remember as enjoying, as a potential alternative seventh year book. Hopefully it's as good as I remember.

To summarise:

#+begin_quote

  - published 2005-2007, pre-DH
  - Harry/Draco, hosted on a smaller or personal site
  - Alternate horcrux search/seventh year
  - involves a trip to Tom Riddle's orphanage which is host to child Inferi of which there is art
  - Potentially a big bang or collaboration with an artist, or writer is artist
  - Certainly a longfic, multichaptered
#+end_quote

Any help is appreciated, I've checked the HexFiles but nothing looks like it matches, I've exhausted my google-fu and I can't even track the image I remember so I'm pretty much done on my end.

Thanks, all.

Edit: Upon immediate reflection, even if you don't find this particular one, similar recs would be appreciated!

Edit2: Thanks to [[/u/SuddenlyALampPost]] - this is solved! It's [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html][Abide the Sleeper]] by Furiosity.


** Was reading the subject line thinking "this sounds familiar, but it's probably not a h/d since there are so few h/ders here." Haha... So, I'm pretty sure I read this story too. But I can't remember what it is either. Whenever new challenges came out, I'd chain read them, which often meant they'd blur together :(

Have you gone through the [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/][post-HBP big bang]] yet? That's where I'd start.

Maybe the [[http://hd-worldcup.livejournal.com/][HD World Cup]], but now that I'm going through the links, their site where they hosted all the fics is gone so that's incredibly frustrating. Why you gotta host on your own domain and then let it expire :(

I'll keep thinking on it. I /know/ I've read a fic with children inferi at an orphanage.

edit: actually, is this it? [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html][Abide the Sleeper]] by Furiosity and Imadra Blue. Also on [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12905][skyehawk]]

*** You are a SAINT.

It's [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html][Abide the Sleeper by Furiosity]].

Thank you so much for that big bang link! It's definitely the time lapse that was the problem, so many little sites hosting baby archives. I'd trawl all over back in the day; I'm lazier now and tend to stick to AO3.

**** np! I don't like the little archives much, as it gets all spread around and harder to find stuff. I really should go through all the big bang challenges and save the fics. As seen when going through the World Cup ones, it's just a matter of time before someone doesn't renew their domain and hosting and it's all lost.

***** I always worry about this too. I wish more site imported their stuff to AO3 through open doors. It's really a cool program: [[http://www.transformativeworks.org/projects/opendoors][www.transformativeworks.org/projects/opendoors]]

** This sounded really interesting... until H/D popped up. Glad you found it though!
