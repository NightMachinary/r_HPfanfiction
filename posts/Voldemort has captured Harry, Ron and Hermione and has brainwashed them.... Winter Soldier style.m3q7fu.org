They have titles and their old names hold no meaning to them.

Instead of Cryo Freeze they have the Draught of Living Death.

Instead of the chair, Obliviate.

They have something similar to the Red Room. They are instructors in said red room. They teach the girls there Dark magic, curses, the Unforgivables, how to break a man etc.

They spend decades as Voldemort's brainwashed soldiers before one of them breaks away and makes it their mission to get the other 2 back. It's been decades but they are around their 20s somewhere physically.


** Soldier L walked through the garden of the house in the wee hours of the morning. He had orders to kill, as usual.

Soldier L was confident. That was always the key, because if you were confident people wouldn't ask why you were there. He watched as Soldier H set up anti-apparition and anti-portkey wards from the roof of the cottage. Soldier L set up a silencing ward, a stronger version of Muffiliato that the Soldiers had learned from Handler S before he'd been found out as a traitor and terminated.

Soldier L opened the door of the house and crept through it, all completely silent. It was the residence of Dr. Dean Thomas and his partner, Seamus Finnegan, both in their late 60s. Should be an easy kill.

Soldier L snuck up the stairs and opened the a door. It was a dark bedroom, full of snores. Soldier L blinked. He felt like he remembered something...something to do with Seamus Finnegan and snores. Soldier L blinked and it was gone.

Soldier L lined up his wand at the sleeping forms of Dr. Thomas and Mr. Finnegan. He was about to kill them when Soldier L was hit over the head from behind. He was out before he could fight back.

When Soldier L came to, he was tied to a chair. His eyes were immediately drawn to the figure sitting on a table before him.

"Soldier R?" Soldier L inquired of the redhead. "Where is Soldier H? This is against protocol. Untie me and let me finish my mission. Then we will return to Our Lord."

"Harry, I can't do that," Soldier R hesitated. "I found some people. They'll be willing to help you, help us!"

"Who is Harry?" asked Soldier L. "Why do I need help?"

Soldier R bit his lip and looked Soldier L in the eyes. "You're Harry."

**** Eh. Mostly because I didn't think of it, but also because I thought Mr. Noseless-God-Complex would want to be witty and name it after the lightning scar. But also because I didn't think of it.
