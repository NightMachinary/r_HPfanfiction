** The best one I've read is keeping him in a magical coma (the draught of living Death) in a hidden place.

** Probably either still try to slay him while keeping the other horcrux safe or kidnap him. The options of what he would do once he had him kidnapped is pretty much the author's choice, but I doubt he would train him in magic and allow him any freedom outside of his direct control.

*** u/Ash_Lestrange:

  still try to slay him

This. He had a horcrux he intended to have destroyed. Getting rid of someone foretold to have the power to defeat him would be nothing to him even with the knowledge he lacked in canon.

*** Honestly, what would happened if Harry died.

would the horcrux just inhabit his slowly rottening corpse

**** Idk, they never fully explain the implications of binding a soul to someone else's body. If it's just bound to the body, then yes. However if it also was bound to Harry's soul then that can make things different. One thing to consider is how does the killing curse work. Does it simply stop someone's heart or does it destroy their soul. If that's the case then voldemort using it to kill Harry in the forbidden forest is what ultimately lead to his downfall. If he had used a different method then maybe things would have played out differently for him.

** Voldemort studied more on horcruxes than perhaps anyone else in the world. He must have had precautions if he accidentally made a horcrux or not making the intended object the horcrux.

** It's easy enough to set up a house/mansion somewhere to be completely self-sufficient, add a house elf or three bonded to Voldemort to grow/raise food and Harry's set. From there, it's just the creative use of a Fidelius charm so that Harry has no idea the outside world is there/no reason to leave. Throw in a bunch of muggleborn/whatever pureblood girls whose families Voldie's pissed at and order the house elves to keep Harry alive at all costs and never allow him to leave.

Done and done. For extra security, place the house somewhere completely unseen, or place inside an expanded space and place on a ship/submarine or under the ocean somewhere. Maybe drug Harry and the others with potions to keep them vaguely happy and compliant.

If you really want to go crazy, have Voldie steal a philosofer's stone, make a spare and dose Harry and friends with it. Heck, go really crazy and put the whole prison in space and give it a big push.
