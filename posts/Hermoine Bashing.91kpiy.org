I won't call it bashing, but she has become a mad scientist type warlock in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/][Champions of the Two Worlds]], who really likes to drain souls from sentient beings, linkffn(12888333). She's both amazing and horrifying in the latest chapter.

*** Oh Champions of the Two Worlds is 100% Hermione bashing. Though less in the "let's drag Hermione's character through the dirt" kind of thing and more of "what would happen if Hermione let her curiosity get the better of her and dove head first into the dark arts because she was lost and lonely."

A big part of her start of darkness is that she was cut off from Ron and Harry for years, and when they did reunite both of them rejected her because they realized she'd become increasingly amoral. The last chapter shows just how far she's fallen, willingly killing other humans to achieve her goal and not even realizing she's become evil.

Spoilers: In the timeline the story takes place in, the Six Strangers manage to guide Hermione back to a semblance of "good". She's still a soul sucking warlock who develops a really unhealthy fascination with the undead and necromancy, but she tries not be completely evil a little. However, there will be an alternate timeline older Hermione who shows up who is possibly the most evil and dangerous villain in the story short of the Lich King and Sargaras (AKA Sauron Lite and Diet Satan). Even "good" Hermione is the Vegita of the group and is firmly in the Chaotic Evil alignment.

***** Gnomes think order is something that you do in a restaurant, and Hermione is pure gnome at this point morality wise. It's also really, really hard for warlocks to be anything but evil since, you know, soul sucking, and Hermione is going to be dabbling in necromancy, which is top shelf evil. Hermione might slowly slide to neutral (on the good/evil axis), but right now she's far to selfish and willing to break all societal norms to be anything but chaotic evil.

Remember, in the DnD alignments, evil doesn't mean you kill puppies and are always actively malicious, only that you are very selfish and have no interest in anything that isn't good for you personally, and perhaps one or two people you love (if it won't hurt you).

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

A previous time someone asked for Cedric bashing and I asked them why because I legitimately didn't understand the logic behind it (like, he barely exists til book 4, then he spends the whole time being a nice person then dies). I was gonna do the same here but then it evolved into a rant, partly because I can at least think of some of the logic behind it (despite vehemently disagreeing with that logic).

I'll make sure not to go on rants during fic search or LF threads again.

*** I read bashing fics as more of a guilty pleasure than as a serious read. It may be lazy, but god damn it can be so satisfying at times.

Deprived and Paid in Blood may not be the best fanfics out there but there is just something about them that makes me return to them. Is the bashing over the top? Of course. But it doesn't always mean that the story does not have any other redeeming characteristics.

I honestly can't imagine the fandom without bashing, its honestly so prevalent that HP fanfiction wouldn't be what it is without it. Does that mean I like it or thing it is good writing? No not at all, but it certainly has its place.
