A quick pairings search on fanfiction.net got me nothing, but that doesn't mean there isn't something out there. I would be really interested in a timetravel fic with Harry wooing Molly Prewett. I guess I would get some morbid, Oedipus-like fascination from a Harry/Molly Weasley fic.


** Oh, 16 works in the Ao3 tag! What a joy.

This one isn't even oedipal - it's tagged as Jocasta complex. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3960367]]) It's not time travel, though.

Well, there's my dose of horror for the day:

"The men of the Weasley Family have peculiar desires. And Harry's here to fulfill them."

  A lipstick stain and the feel of hot breath and chapped lips at the edge of her blouse trigger a strange reaction in Molly. Harry's just a boy, but for one summer, she wishes he was hers.

** You know, I'd never considered the possibility before, but now that I think it, something about this particular pairing strikes me as /even more/ gross and incestuous than Harry/Lily, despite Molly not actually being related to him.

*** Because Molly actually /mothers/ him. She's so, so /mother/ (there just isn't any other word to describe it). Lily, on other hand, has been gone since he was barely a toddler. Especially since you're frozen as you were the moment you died; if someone brought her back to life somehow, I can totally see Harry developing weird sexual feelings for her. It's difficult to convince your body that this pretty almost-stranger who looks barely twenty-something is your mother and thus out of normal bounds.

******* I know right? We know effectively nothing about them, but writers have basically transplanted Fred and George into the Halfelven and said 'look, they're pranksters too! And you always say their names in this order! And they have silly nicknames for each other!' etc. etc. It's actually really obvious too. Also, can we please stop with the Legomances, can we please stop with Argolas, aaaah. Every time someone complains about the hp fandom, I'm tempted to remind everyone that the Mary Sue mockfic is an established genre for LotR.

Legomances are here to stay bby ;) Didn't you know a possibly thousands of years old warrior prince who's known for being rather distant (though he does have a sense of snark) is actually a quivering angsty feminine mess who needs the protective cuddles and constant reassurance of the partner du jour?

But only if she's actually a half-elf maiden with limpid violet eyes and golden hair that shines with the light of Anor!!!!!!! Eep I think I just corrupted myself. linkffn(1518794) is my solace.

There's some surprisingly good legomances out there, just... not a lot. I give grudging points to that one that had a half-elf daughter of Elured (I think it was him, might have been Elurin?) who had grown up under Sauron's banner. It had so many many many things that could have gone wrong but was... surprisingly bearable.

** There's one story where molly loses her memory when she's deaged and harry helps out this hot looking redhead only to have ron and hermione show u pto reveal who she is. When molly is back to her real age, she eventually dies. Harry goes to the funeral with his new gf, a 'distantly related' Prewett. Who looks just like an 18 year old Molly Prewett.

I also have seen a few harry/molly fics on ffn. Don't search by pairing, just search for those two in the story and exclude ginny, i think.

There's also a few incestual molly/ginny fics out here on ffn as well.

Edit: and for those of an incestual Father/Daughter bent, there's a Weasleycest fic where Molly reminds Arthur that Ginny is now old enough to be taught about loving and it's his duty as a father to do so. It was pretty well written if I remember right. Not ultra titillating, I think it was more allusion than explicit.
