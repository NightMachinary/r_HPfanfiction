** I don't have anything to recommend, however would like to point out that when asking for fics you should use the request flair. The recommendation flair is for when you are recommending something.

**** (Just realised all my Draco bookmarks are Drarry, sorry!)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] is kind of during? It's a 7th-year AU, good dynamics between all the characters - would recommend the author's other fic too, Stately Homes of Wiltshire! linkao3(7331278)

The others are both post-Hogwarts:

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  Harry Potter, of all people, knows that life isn't always fair. And no one gets to be happy all of the time. But surely there's something more---something better---than a rubbish Ministry job, and a lonely old house, and that feeling that everyone out there is doing a better job of living than Harry is. And it really doesn't seem fair that Draco Malfoy is back in Harry's life, all of a sudden, and even though he's wandless, and living with Muggles, and making his mother cry with his lifestyle choices, he's happy. So what's he doing right, that Harry isn't? Because things don't really change, do they? And if Harry can't be happy, he'll settle for a good night's sleep, some posh antiques, and the opportunity to find out what Malfoy has been up to for all these years. And that's what starts it all.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
