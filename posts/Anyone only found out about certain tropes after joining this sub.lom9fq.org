I joined this sub because I wanted to find new things and types of fics to read, perhaps get inspiration to write through prompts, requests, and ideas in threads. It has been a very interesting experience and one of the reasons is because I ended up not only learning about the existence of certain tropes, but also that they are extremely common.

Some examples:

- Like Daphne Greengrass apparently is already a stablished named OC, and "Haphne" is a thing

- Harry goes to Gringotts and the Goblins fix a ton of things

- Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell. Who came up with /"Hadrian"/ by the way?

- Pureblood politics

- Wrong Boy-Who-Lived

- "Shopping trips"

- I already knew that some people hated Ron and lots of fics that bashed him, but damn how consistent "Weasley bashing" is, and how it also applies to Ginny and Molly

There are probably some more but these are the ones I can think about right now. Anyone else had this experience? With which tropes?

This post doesn't have the intent of shaming the tropes btw! I even read good fics with some of them. It's just funny concept, to suddenly discover something about a fandom that I've been part of for such a long time.


** for me I recognized a lot of theses tropes before but I didn't realize how much I had read that included them and how widespread they are.

** Yes, I've pretty much never encountered any of the tropes you listed outside of this subreddit.

Not sure if it's due to the ships I read or that I mainly stay on AO3. But it's nice to know if I exhaust all of the fics on my current To Read list, there are a host of other tropes I can dig into.

** I could be wrong, but I thought Daphne was actually a canon character who is only ever referenced during Harry's sorting? Because so little is known about her in canon she's a blank slate Slytherin that people can do whatever they want with, make her light, neutral, or dark, depending on their story.

Another big one is also Dumbles bashing. It can range from him being well intentioned but manipulative and short sighted to being highly egotistical and wanting Harry to die so he can defeat Voldy, to him being downright evil

*** I thought that was what named OC meant? A blank canon character so people adopt them into their stories because they can do whatever they want. Daphne seems to have acquired a kinda consistent characterization in fanon though lol

"Manipulative Dumbledore" was one I had already encountered many times, but didn't know how common and consistent some of the /real/ bashing was. Like the trope of him stealing all of Harry's money.

**** "OC" normally stands for Original Character, as in someone the author has completely made up. Daphne isn't an OC by virtue of having been mentioned in the text, even if literally everything else about her is fanon.

*** Yeah, Daphne is a canon character, but because she is a blank slate fanon has basically created her character. Some things vary from fic to fic but overall she has become a widespread OC. For me, I mainly know her as Slytherin, Neutral and heiress to the Greengrass family with a little sister normally in Ginny's year called Astoria (although I think she's canonically in the year below Ginny). Beautiful blonde, blue eyes, that is friends with Tracey Davis, a brunette half-blood Slytherin of the same year.

** The overlap btwn the fics I read and the fics this sub reads/recommends is almost nonexistent, so I thought the prevalence of all these tropes in the "What tropes do you hate the most" threads was just exaggerated in good fun. Then I read a linked fic from this sub, and out of nowhere there's Neutral!Daphne explaining magical cores. It was like going to Australia and seeing a giant huntsman spider right outside the airport. Like damn, y'all really weren't kidding!

** Same actually. Mine is the /Perfect!Flawless!Hermione/ trope that's apparently very prevalent.

For someone who reads about Hermione as much as I do, it's so weird that I haven't encountered any of those fics. I've got a few hundred bookmarks on her, and I still haven't met one.

**** Hmm. That's interesting. It's possible that I'm just a bit more forgiving than most. (Although I doubt that because Hermione's canon flaws are what makes her so interesting to me.)

The fic you linked wasn't Hermione-focused, so it makes me think that this trope is more prevalent in non-Hermione-centric fics? It would make sense then that I haven't met one. I almost exclusively read fanfic either focused on Hermione or has her as a significant character.

Edit: Yeesh. Why the downvotes?

****** Well that explains it. I'll just keep to the Hermione-focused stories then. I'm very happy not to have encountered that trope in my reading, and I would like to keep it that way. (Opposite to you, I don't find the non-Hermione-focused ones very interesting, so different strokes I guess.)

*** When Harry and possibly some of his friends go through Diagon Alley once Harry has access to more of his wealth. They nearly always buy trunks with apartments in them. Sometimes they find stores or Alleys that are not canon with fantastical gadgets in them. Sometimes they get custom wands. The trunk thing is pretty common among them, though.

It's either a sign he's using legilimency or a spell he uses to manipulate people (either to trust him or to focus on his eyes so he can use legilimency) in quite a few fics where he's a villain (or otherwise antagonist, in the case of Greater Good Dumbledore trying to turn Harry into a martyr).

****** Prince Harry has the name Henry on his birth certificate, it's popular among nobility and posh people to do that. So if people are gonna do the “Harry has a posh birth name” trope I always thought Henry would fit quite nicely even if it doesn't have the same bad boy ring to it as Hadrian does haha. I like Harold as well, that sounds like it could be an ancestral name too.

It's quite a British thing to name someone Henry and call them Harry their whole lives (and very weird) so don't worry about not knowing it, it's obscure.
