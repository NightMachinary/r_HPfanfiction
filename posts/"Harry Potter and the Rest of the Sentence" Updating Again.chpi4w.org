After a fairly long hiatus, here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13124020/7/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rest-of-the-Sentence][Chapter 7]] of my notorious sequel to the much more notorious /Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash/. Be prepared for an unhealthy Harmony relationship, a Goblin Rebellion, and unexpected wandmakers.

  Aghast, Harry yelled that he was in fact a large bag of sweet Boy-Who-Lived flesh.
#+end_quote

Aren't we all just bags of flesh, when you think about it?

  "That was impaling!" bellowed the goblin. Harry had to admit that he had a very good point.

Lol

** Is this supposed to be a crack fic? Well, it's shit. It's bad and you should feel bad. Shame on you.

After a few bouts through Google Translate:

What is the flu? In fact, this is fun. Evil and evil. You should be proud of yourself

I feel, as an AI-generated story, it deserves a... computerized response.

Harsh initial sentences aside, this is hilarious to read through. I hope one day, when the world is taken over by AI, they'll look back at moments such as these fondly. Like, when you wrote your first story as a child and were so happy that you showed your parents, and they praised you despite how shit it must have been.
