Hey folks, I'm look for recommendations for Dramione fics. Long or short, I'm not fussed. I've got a lot more time stuck in self-isolation so send them through please.


** Hey! I'd recommend taking a look at [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] as they've got two main recommendation threads and have had a lot of recent requests as well. You may also be interested in:

  Draco Malfoy has a mission to complete, and no one can help him. Spending nights stuck on Prefect duty with Hermione Granger only adds to his problems. Doesn't it? Or is it possible that their unlikely relationship could alter the course of the Second Wizarding War -- if the Boy Who Made All the Wrong Choices can get this one thing right?Come for the medium-burn Dramione, stay for Magical lore and new twists on the canon we love (and love to change)COMPLETE!

  For a moment, she's almost giddy. Because Draco Malfoy's been ruined by this war and he's as out of place as she is and --- yes, he has scars too. He's got an even bigger one. She wonders whether one day they'll compare sizes.

  Life has become a series of battles. Hermione is just surviving, but godamn she is exhausted. Throw in countless shabby safehouses, too much firewhiskey and Draco bloody Malfoy and life couldn't get much worse.

  "All her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope."(From 'The Rainbow', D.H. Lawrence)It was definitely the worst of times. Follow Hermione as she navigates through the quagmire: saving the world, getting top grades, falling in love, lust, and a whole lot of trouble; and comes out of it hopefully at least partially sane

  Brought together by the Ministry of Magic's Marriage Law, Draco and Hermione work together to undermine the edict and subvert their arranged marriage while most decidedly not falling in love in the process.

** I've been reading Dramione for a longish time (4? 5? years-ish) so here is my master list!

- Isolation by Bex-Chan, Rated M, Complete. FFN (This is a Dramione CLASSIC and a must-read!)
- What the Room Requires by Alydia Rackham, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Bathroom Scene Redux by logicallylivid, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- I Spy by gnrkrystle, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Silencio by Akashathekitty, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Five Days by RavieSnake, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- And We All Fall Down by Rumaan, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- The Fallout by everythursday, Rated M (?), Complete, I will attach below a link to a google drive folder of all of her amazing works (Check out Parade of the Sun as well) because it is not currently on any sites!
- Eight and Eighth by Marmalade Fever, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Eagle's Nest by HeartofAspen, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Covered in Crimson by cklls, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Only a Pretense by galfoy (Now WickedlyAwesomeMe on FFN, I guess she changed her username) , Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Boy in the Hammock by galfoy (This one is by galfoy? I'm not quite sure about the whole username thing...), Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Static by galfoy, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Turncoat by elizaye, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- We Learned the Sea by luckei1, Rated T, Complete, FFN

- Abyss by zarah joyce, K, Complete, FFN
- After the Battle by WaitTilMyFatherHearsAboutThis, M, Complete, FFN
- Amortentia by oliviebleak, Rating depends on Chapter, FFN (This is a collection of one-shots and multi chapters, you have to go chapter by chapter to choose which chapter you want because not all are dramione. I would recommend The Real World:Hogwarts (Series) and Epilogue:Drunk Rewrite (Oneshot) because both of these are hilarious!)

All of Everythursday/Sage's Dramione Works: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xFIuty-3AMtuLv3gs14acto2EzNREGJD][Here]]

Anyways, this was very long but I didn't even begin to cover the beauty that is Dramione fanfics. These are just some of my favorites. If none of these seem to be what you're looking for, I would suggest heading over to dramioneasks on Tumblr or dramioneficindex on Tumblr (you don't need an account) and either asking or searching through tags or on dramioneficindex, hitting ctrl F and plugging in a key phrase! Hope this helped :D
