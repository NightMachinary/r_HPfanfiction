I'm a bit bored and I could use a bit of variety. Can anyone recommend a story with a decently written three way relationship? Anything with that so long as it doesn't have any explicit sexual content is fine. To be specific, I'm looking for polyamory between three individuals where everyone is equal in the relationship. “Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.”


** Its never explicitly stated but linkffn(The Sum of our Parts by holdmybeer) has this with Harry, Ron and Hermione.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Because of your "doesn't have any explicit sexual content" requirement I am reluctant to recc anything here.

I don't remember the fics in every single little detail, and it is always possible that there is a small scene in like chapter 40 of 50 that could maybe be considered explicit by someone out there. Like, Three to Backstep has already been recced. I am very sure there are some scenes later on that can be considered sexually explicit.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walk on Water]], linkffn(12076771), fits your request very well:

- Harry, Hermione, and Ron are in a three way romantic relationship, after going through a very traumatic war. Both Grangers and Weasleys are against them too.
- No explicit sex scenes, but their relationships are well depicted.
- It's however not a ship fic, as the main plot is the fight against zombie Battleship BismarckMort.
- HMS Hood is recalled by powerful magic to face off her nemesis once again. For more background info about the Bismarck vs Hood battle, [[https://youtu.be/4_jDaUSSPhc][this video]] is a good source.

Yes, it's a very unlikely crossover, but it works.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

Have only read the first few chapters because I don't like Hermione, but it seems to be what you're asking for.
