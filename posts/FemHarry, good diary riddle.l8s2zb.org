:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic, I remember it was girl Harry and she wrote in the diary and got to know riddle, riddle told her to send the diary to elder Nott(?) abroad so he could take over him (which may also have saved Theo from abuse), once riddle has a body he goes to durmstrang and turns up at the triwiz, that's pretty much all I can remember from it Thanks


** It's called You Get What You Give By Watermellonsmellinfelon I think (Sorry I don't know how to do the link thing)

*** You just write linkao3 or linkffn (depending on where it is hosted) and then the title and author in brackets. The author is not always necessary and the bot usually find the fic even of you misspelled something.

E.g:

Linkao3(You Get What You Give By Watermellonsmellinfelon)

Linkffn(You Get What You Give By Watermellonsmellinfelon)

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N: Fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

** You already said in a comment that you found it already, which is "You Get What You Give" (I'm also reading that fic currently btw).

Regardless, I found your description - Diary-Riddle made a body, went to Durmstrang and went to Hogwarts to compete at the triwizard tournament similar to another fic, which you might find interesting.

  Eliza Potter was abandoned in an orphanage by the Dursely's and so 11 years later she refuses to be the Light Golden girl everyone wants. Eliza Potter is more a force of nature than a girl and she refuses to let anything stand in her way to greatness, and that includes meddling old headmasters[starts in first year]
