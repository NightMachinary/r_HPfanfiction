Like imagine the lovechild of Danzo and Madara. That's the kind of thing I'm going for here. Except not as mind scarringly disgusting.

** There's one where his horcruxes take over a few people like Trelawney and I think Filch and it's fairly amusing. I don't remember the name offhand though.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr

** I once read a pretty bad story where Dumbledore and Snape did this. It was your typical Indie!Harry + Evil!Dumbledore setup.

Snape and Dumbledore had horcruxes and would resurrect each other every time the other died, which happened with semi-comic frequency.
