:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic a while ago that took place in the future, but I can't remember whether it was months or years after the battle

Anyway through some chain of events a box is discovered, pieces of Molly's soul, Bellatrix's soul, and others (I think) were found in the box

And as they investigate over the course of the fic doing all sorts of stuff it comes to light that Molly was originally never in love with Arthur, and him and Rodolphus Lestrange worked together on some evil crap w the box back in their Hogwarts days to make sure they both got the women they wanted, and that through the soul removal stuff they would wanna stay with them

After the soul fragments are returned to their respective people, Arthur confesses, and as it turns out hes has hella stereotypical pureblood Muggle hatred the whole time, covering it up by acting like he has an over-interest.

As Molly and Bellatrix recover in the hospital, Bella is horrified at what she'd done when part of her soul has been missing for so long, and Molly has to contend with Percy and Ron both taking Arthur's side and believing that everything he's accused of is lies

That's what I remember but I honestly can't find it anywhere

I also remember it was definitely more than a few chapters
