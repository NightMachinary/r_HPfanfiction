Would love to see one, and would love to know if any exist.

I can picture it now, Dudley unexpectedly receives a Hogwarts letter, is sorted into Slytherin and spends first year bullying and tormenting poor Harry.

However, he receives a taste of his own medicine from his very own house, Slytherin doesn't like mudbloods after all...

Feeling down and almost sympathetic toward Harry, he witnesses an enraged troll break down the door to a bathroom, in which a terrified witch hides.

Dudley runs away.

Harry does not.

Feeling ashamed and disgusted with himself, Dudley swears to change himself. Starting with how he treats Harry.

And so begins fat, cruel and malicious Dudley's quest, to protect Harry from the shadows....


** My favorites are two different post hogwarts fics. In one, he discovers that Dudley and his husband have adopted an orphan who's letter has arrived, in another Dudley is working in CPS to try to redeem himself for his younger actions. I'll post the links if I can find them.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Forget flying kunai, surprising blood limits, or enemy nin. Neji was going to die from embarrassment first. Hyuuga-centric.

** Would Dudley even qualify for Slytherin? I can't imagine him as particulary cunning or ambitious, and he doesn't even have a family tradition to push him there like some pureblood (Crabe and Goyle). Though I can't imagine Dudley as anything else than a bad Hufflepuff (the one who got sent there because they didn't fit any house, not the hardworking ones).

Also, a Slytherin Dudley would have a /very/ bad time. PS Harry is still the dear of the Wizarding World (without any affair like the death of a Professor or the Chamber of Secret to blemish his reputation). The only people who would be happy to see Harry bullied would be the less savory type of Slytherin (Junior Death Eater) who would hate Dudley for his blood status.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley lives with the guilt of what his family had done to his cousin. He resents the person he used to be and tries to live as someone better, but a part of himself can never truly forgive the cruelty done to the kind-hearted Harry. After a car accident, he wakes to find himself a child again. He sets out to make sure Harry has a better childhood all while hiding his own magic.
