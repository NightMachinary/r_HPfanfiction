I am well aware that this fic doesn't exactly sound like a literary masterpiece, but here we go.

I /think/ the fic was titled something like "No Good Deed Goes Unpunished".

Harry dies and comes back to life I believe, somehow far more knowledgeable and experienced than the was before.

He also somehow becomes the Heir to a lot of houses, including Dumbledore's. This, of course, means that he has to marry someone for each house. There are marriage contracts involved.

He ends up with.. let's see if I can remember them all. Tonks, Susan, Padma & Parvati, Lavender, Daphne, and Fleur. It seemed like Bellatrix was going to get involved in this too.

Susan, as the last member of the Bones family, inherits some kind of necromancy legacy and the responsibility of keeping.. umm. Dracula from returning? Maybe? I definitely remember that Vlad the Impaler was mentioned as some horrible Vampire... I think.. and they are the ones that killed him.

Padma & Parvati basically beg Harry to marry them because their grandfather has sold them off to some Indian Ancient/Noble/Whatever Lord, who is going to pimp them out or something equally awful.

Lavender is a serious Alchemy student, of all things. Pretty sure she gives Harry a Philosopher's Stone as a wedding gift.

Now, I believe the fic is something of a crossover with the RPG "Rifts", made by Palladium Books.

Daphne is sold into inter-dimensional, extraterrestrial slavery, that I think is run by a Rift Alien Intelligence. She has been modified into a cybernetic gladiator, with possibly-metallic wings. Yeah.

Harry rescues her.

Fleur at some point needs Harry's help because her mother & sister have been kidnapped by some serial killer that likes skinning Veelas. I think he's known "the Flenser", and he's got some kind of diplomatic immunity.

Harry & Co. rescue her family. Using piloted mechs combined with magic.

What else, what else...

Bellatrix is a sort of okay person. The Death Eater Bellatrix everyone knows and hates is a simulacrum that she made to dodge being forced to marry a LeStrange. I think.

Ron is paired with Millicent Bullstrode, perhaps. Hermione is paired with Fred & George.

So. Anybody know where to find this beastie?

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
