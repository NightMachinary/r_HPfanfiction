What are some of the most common names you've seen for Hermione's Parents?

I mostly read harry/hermione fanfiction so I see a lot of "Dan and Emma Granger"

do any Ron/Hermione shippers see any "Rupert and Emma" at all?

I was reading vox corporis and it was "Jake and Miranda" which was new but I liked it


** I see Richard and Helen a lot. No idea why Richard is often used, but, if memory serves, in Shakespeare's work, Helen of Troy's daughter was named Hermione.

** Having just read some of KafkaExMachina's work, my new favourite (for sheer "oh no he didn't" shock value) is 'Orin and Audrey'.
