Hi!

I would like to know if there is any fic where Harry wants/needs to learn new magic, not just the Hogwarts standard.

What I mean is a Harry that goes exploring to find ancient tomes, rare books, talks with portraits or asks ghosts. That kind of thing. For example learning new branches of magic, like divination (making it useful). He can make use of thing like the Black library, or other thing like that, but I want him to want to know every kind of magic, not just Light Magic.

Thanks!


** Ascension of the Scorpion Sorcerer linkffn(2353966) was a very good story for me. He doesn't care about repercussions, he just obliterates his enemies. And the fact that it's ancient magic is a bonus. Only drawback for me was that the first bits of knowledge come from a snake (kind of clich√© in dark fics).

** Might want to give linkffn(A Second Chance at Life) a try. It's quite OOC post HBP story, but it's a long story and is fun to read.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
