** They probably wouldn't even need to place a spell. Imagine if someone today said the wizarding world was real. No confundus needed, people wouldn't ever believe it.

Honestly, you could perform magic right in front of me and I'd sooner admit myself into a mental hospital than believe magic actually exists. Because which is more likely? Insanity or magic?

*** if it happens in front of one person, more likely your insane. if something happens in front of a 100 people, they are just roleplayers. if something happens in front of thousands of people, that's a little harder to make a excuse of.

who would believe we had the technology to wipe a entire city off the map in a single second before it actually happen. it was a weapon that was almost exclusive to fantasy only

**** So they'd probably just believe it was some technology. Some /might/ believe it was magic, but they wouldn't jump to believing there was a secret magical society amongst them.

As to your request, I can't remember the name, but there is one out there where JKR is Rita Skeeter.

***** I've read that too and thought it was fun, but I can't remember it either. I can remember, though, another one-shot where Rowling is Ginny: linkffn(3664703).

It's the other way about. Something done in front of one person is an anomaly. Something done in front of thousands of people is a /performance/ and a significant fraction of those thousands will insist they spotted how the trick was done.

*** As long as nobody brought evidence, I would agree. I think a large portion of our population secretly wants magic to be real. If something good enough was brought forward, then I would be very skeptical, but I would accept it if it was accepted by experts. I too would assume insanity, but I wouldn't if many other skeptical minds were forced to accept the evidence.

A live stream with a witch taking requests would he enough to raise an eye. The random requests in a live stream would dismiss a lot of photoshop ideas as long as they interacted with the chat. That doesn't dismiss the idea of the "random" requests being pre-determined, but it would be an order of magnitude above anything that has ever been seen before.
