I'm beginning to think I made this fic up.

But I swear it has to be real- Harry is Snape's son and in order to stop Harry disappearing and Snape's kid suddenly appearing Lupin pretends to be Harry for a few weeks the goes off to ‘train with Dumbledore'.

Any ideas folks?


** ...This sounds craaaazy

** I've read something similar. It had Harry be the child of Snape and Bellatrix Lestrange, I think. Its Tonks impersonating Harry though, and Harry, Snape and Lupin go to Spain to do something? I don't remember what it was called, but it was like 35 chapters long and they weren't even at Hogwarts yet. Time of my life I'll never get back.

** This sounds really familiar, but I don't have an exact link for you since I can't seem to find it right now, either. This sounds like it is a response fic to the Severitus Challenge though. You might want to search with that to help narrow things down!

[edit] I'm kicking myself, this sounds a LOT like Severitus's own fic that prompted her to start the challenge to begin with. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/554557/1/A-Father-s-Sin]]
