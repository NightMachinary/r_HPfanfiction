The Triwizard Tournament was supposedly to test and to display it's champion's prowess. We all know how crappy a spectator sport the canon tournament ended up being, so lets see what fandom can do. What are the most interesting, rule-of-cool, amusing, or otherwise original tasks in fanfiction? Anything but the original Dragon-Lake-Maze tasks from canon, though at a pinch I'll accept those done in an interesting, cool, etc etc way a la Inspector 13 or the numerous Rolling Stones/ACDC Rock Band illusory distractions.

I'm also looking for a Triwiz fic where Harry is put under a spell or potion that makes him experience either his worst nightmare or the worst thing he can imagine. This is then seen by the whole school who are sitting in the Great Hall to watch. The task is 'administered' in the room at the back of the Hall where Dumbledore's famed 'DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FYAH' calmly asked question occurred and Harry remarks bitterly that he's too freakish to even have normal nightmares before he storms out to see the Great Hall audience - Krum, Fleur, and Cedric are openly horrified at his imaginations.


** The fic you're looking for is probably this fem!Harry fic: linkffn(12568760). It's exactly what you're describing. It's in chapter 13.

  The Girl Who Lived is young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. A story of her mischief and troubles in her fourth year of Hogwarts. New tasks, humor, fem!Harry/Fleur. Not related to my other story, Tales of Three.
