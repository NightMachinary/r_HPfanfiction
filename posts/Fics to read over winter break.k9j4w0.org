Hey ya'll. I am currently in the first week of my colleges' 2 week final period before winter break and I would like some fic recs. Preferably either long, or completed, doesn't have to be both. Any slytherin harry fics, or fics where Harry might not be in slytherin, but learns a lot about pure blood culture and he might learn he is morally Grey, or Dark. Or he does not care about light or dark, but magic itself. I just want a fic that goes into depth about pureblood culture and magical culture in general. One fic I have never finished, one day I will :), that talks a lot about pureblood culture is Runaway Wizard [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4190796/1/Runaway-Wizard]]

I am honestly up for anything as long as it's not time travel, or next generation.

I wasn't sure if I should add this question here, or not, but why not. Any good time travel fics that are a must read? I know I said no next gen fics above, but that was more towards fics on pureblood culture. I know many people in this fandom love time travel fics, and I believe there are good ones, but for someone reason I have never really wanted to read one before. I see enough recommendations in this subreddit for time travel fics that I know I could be missing out, but I just haven't read, or looked for fics like this in the past. So any time travel fics that aren't to confusing I guess. I just want to get into time travel fics because I want to try to read a type of fic a at least a few times before deciding if the trope is for me, or not. Thank you stay safe with covid


** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) might be what you're looking for. not a time travel fic but a lot of pureblood society/culture.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
