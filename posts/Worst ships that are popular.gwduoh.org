I used to ship Remus/Sirius when I was a lot younger, but after, I wasn't enjoying their portrayals and it became too repetitive. OOC puts me off like nothing else. I had a Draco/Hermione and a Draco/Harry phase because I love a good enemies to lovers story but rereading the books made me cringe a lot of times at Draco. I don't personally like any pairing with Snape because he's a bully to his students. That leaves me almost with nothing, except lily/James but it usually comes with wolfstar, so that's meh as well.

**** There are a couple of Harry/McGonagall fics that first have Harry being a cat/kneazle animagus and "hooking up" with McGonagall while she is in her cat form (and not realizing it was her). I don't recall reading many Harry/McGonagall fics though I've seen her with Harry as part of a harem where she either de-ages or had a glamour on to make herself look older to ensure the male students wouldn't be distracted by her beauty.

Harry/Narcissa or really any Harry/Black sister is often due to three common plot lines.

Harry being the head of the Black family and the Black Family magic forces changes in the Black sisters for them to "submit" to harry. This includes several Harem stories.

Harry being so powerful magically/sexually/emotionally that the Black sisters can't help themselves and end up with Harry. (Emotionally is typical of Harry/Andromeda fics. Eg she falls for Harry watching him take care of Teddy).

The third line is Harry goes back in time and meets the Black sisters before they become crazy/join Voldemort or marry their canon spouses.

**** Harry/McGonagall is relatively pedestrian compared to some of the ships mentioned when I asked for "[[https://redd.it/gnr0yb][Weirdest ships]]"

I haven't actually read any fanfics with that particular ship, but I haven't gone looking for it either. They definitely exist, though.

Wait, no. I've read /one/ fanfic where Harry has a brief fling with McGonagall. It's actually kind of sweet. In this specific fanfic, Harry is an interdimensional traveler either becoming a god or has become a god, and he goes and visits the afterlife of his home dimension, and meets with McGonagall as she appeared in the prime of her life, and them both being basically ageless beings means the age gap thing from when they were both mortal simply isn't an issue.

**** I can't speak for other Peggy Sue protagonists, but I always viewed those fics as Severus mentally regressing in age as well as physical age -- basically, with his original life being more of a kind of prophetic dreams. Not literally (he still remembers it as he lived through it), but the kind of issues he face after the time reversal are those of a teenager, not an adult.

There are exceptions, for example The Peace Not Promised (where he goes out of his way of avoiding any serious intimacy until they're both physically adults again), but this mindset works well enough for most other fics of this kind.

I do think this plot is used too often with the ship personally, but my issues with it is mostly in terms of (lack of) originality rather than any creepiness factor.

*** Most often I see it as Draco being forced to grow up, learn his own opinions rather than parroting his father, at least when it's done /well/. All to often it's done very badly.

I don't take "You're next, Mudbloods!" to be an indicator that he'll always be that person.

And for all that they have mutual contempt for one another, I'm pretty sure that it's not at the level of "roasting marshmallows over your corpse" for either of them. For all that he would claim to enjoy seeing Potter suffer, when push came to shove in the final book, he couldn't bring himself to positively identify him when the snatchers brought him in.

Following that, the Golden Trio actually saved his life during the Battle of Hogwarts.

And when everything came to a head at the climax of /Halfblood Prince/, despite being told Dumbledore was his enemy his entire life, he still couldn't bring himself to kill him.

Now none of this points at him being a good person, but it does point at him having the potential to grow up to be someone decent.

That said, I generally don't read Draco ships.

**** I don't see the "not killing Dumbledore" as showing anything positive in Draco. I think it just shows that when "push came to shove" that Draco is basically a coward and couldn't do the deed "up close and personal". Not that he had a conscious. He had absolutely no problem helping a group of killers bypass the protections of the school and get inside. Where pretty much any student that they met who was not a Voldemort supporter would be killed.

His two earlier attempts were all designed to kill Dumbledore at a distance eg Draco wouldn't have to be near when/if it happened (like a mine field). And just like landmines he didn't care if someone else got hurt/killed by mistake. Which is easily seen when his first "long distance" attempt failed he didn't have any qualms with trying again with a different method or continuing to ensure a way for killers to enter the school.

As far as the snatcher scene I think that's more along the lines of Draco starting to realize that he has joined a madman who has no hesitation to torture and kill his own followers rather than Draco truly "changing his spots".

And while "you're next, mudblood" might not be an indicator that Draco would always be that way. Added to all his other words and actions is a much clearer indication that he will. Draco should have spent the majority of his life in Azkaban (or have been executed) for his actions in Dumbledore's death let alone almost killing two students.

So while I can't stomach a Draco/golden trio ship (not a slash fan at all). I can tolerate/enjoy a fic where a completely OOC Draco becomes friendly with some members of the trio.

You want to pair Harry and Bellatrix or Snape? That's fine, but there sure as hell needs to be some time travel and redemption/not becoming horrible people involved first.

You want to pair a time traveler with someone? Don't. Unless they are time traveling back to their also adult body, or they are time traveling with their partner also to an of a reasonable age body.

**** Unfortunately it's a WIP that hasn't been updated for over a decade and it's in Russian. But I do remember the premise - Voldemort is defeated but the world is unstable, Hermione is punished for some crimes - the Ministry of Magic erased her memories and snapped her wand in half. She lived in Australia with some dude and then started to have this feeling that this is not her husband. Eventually she gets some of her memories back, her husband turned out to be a rat but he helps her to escape. She still has half of her memories lost but she does remember Snape. Snape is in a magical coma and Harry spends half of his inheritance on keeping him alive. Eventually Snape wakes up and they meet in Italy, but she needs to hide because she did some bad things. And there was a plot about Ginny being in Azkaban because she killed Draco. She talks to Lucius through the wall and they play chess to keep being sane. Then he also teaches Ginny strategy. I remember that this Lucius was the best Lucius I've seen! And the romantic plotline was so well done, when Hermione wakes up and doesn't recognize the husband, she remembers that it should be someone else... It was just so sad! I read this fic mainly for the plot though. It was pretty intense.

Its a bit worse for HP since there could have been a lore more buildup for harry/ginny when instead we get some hints and then bam jealousy and lust. Though those emotions are not unreasonable for teenagers it does lead to fics where ginny is potioning harry (along with various love potion scenes in the books).

Also, since hermione is the female with the most screen time and fans have made some huge characters in daphne, susan, tonks, fluer etc ginny has some real competition in the best girl catagory.

** Any student/teacher relationship. There was a while when Hermione/Snape was getting a lot of creepy stories. Luckily JKR had enough sense to kill of Snape, that seemed to stop most of it.

** I can't stomach Draco with any of the trio anymore, I used to be fine with any combo of pairings (Draco + Harry, Ron or Hermione) but now I just can't see it. I know good writing can make nearly anyone compatible (I still have some old Draco/Harry favorites) but deep down I can't believe it anymore so I can never get into new stories.

**** There's lots of ways to write AU, though; a clever author might be able to convincingly redeem Draco in a way that makes shipping feasible.

Can't recall having seen one that I liked, though. I've seen some good Draco redemption, but not shipped with them.

***** I think might I try something post-war, with adult Harry/Draco where they haven't seen each other in a while. But overall I'm not really convinced they can mesh with anything close to canon (Harry with Dursleys & spoilt/bully Draco + school rivalry).

Actually, this discussion got me thinking & Im not even sure they make sense as friends, even in those 'Harry turns to the dark side' fics. Not with their history and not if Draco at any time reminded Harry of Dudley. If anything, Draco would probably be even more jealous if Harry went dark side but was better at it then him lol.

*** A always felt that those two would be the Marauders least close together as teenagers, between the werewolf prank and them believing each other to be the spy.

Now I could see them getting in an unhealthy and depending relationship with each other as adult, in a way to rewrite their past friendship and trying to erase Peter from the shared memory, by pretending that they were always closer.

And if there were secret crushes on another Marauder back then I always assumed it was an unrequited one on James

** Ship opinions are subjective, but these are some popular ships that a lot of people detest: Drarry, Tomarry, Dramione, Snarry, Snamione. I dislike all of those except for postwar (non-teacher/student) Snamione, which I'm mostly neutral towards, but given how popular all the ships are, clearly some people like them.

** I feel like, with everything going on in the US, now's a really good time to point out that shipping a character who's a bigot who believes that people with "dirty" ancestry with characters who have said "dirty" ancestry is gross and probably says more about the shipper than they'd want for it to.
