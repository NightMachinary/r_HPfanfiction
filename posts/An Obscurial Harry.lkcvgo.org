Any fic with an Obscurial Harry that is written good? No bashing and all cliches? Thanks in advance!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]]

It's kind of semi-obscurial, but it's honestly so good

Edit: I don't know how to do that thing where the summary comes up, so I copy and pasted it instead

“Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point. Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar. Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-

I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?”

There are only 41 with Harry as a main character and Obscurial/Obscurus in the summary, so not too much to go through. A lot of them are quite short or or oneshots, too. I'm surprised, I thought this trope would be more common

** Ok hear me out, I'm not sure this is what your looking for but it is very good and is technically within the bounds of your request. It is ongoing and updated weekly and has crossovers with marvel and very briefly doctor who. When o day with marvel I don't mean MCU but like marvel comics and various surrounding TV cartoons etc. Would recommend Linkffn(13563881)

#+begin_quote
  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3

  There's something inside of Harry so full of rage he can barely stop it from bursting free.
