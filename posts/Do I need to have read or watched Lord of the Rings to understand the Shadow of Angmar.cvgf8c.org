** Shadow of Angmar takes time to explain the world. So much so that I personally (having read all of Tolkien's works) found it a slog to get through.

** As someone who has little specific experience with LotR (one inevitably absorbs the very big basic points just via cultural osmosis, even more so if one is interested in fantasy or just in nerdier topics in general), it is not necessary to have read the books to enjoy the fic. You definitely get the sense that there are people and places and names of significance that you don't have the inherited context for, but it does a good job of explaining things such that you don't get lost.

 

(As AutumnSouls states, it does so to the point that it definitely slows the pacing in order to try to fit in the massive amount of information that Tolkein's works contained. I personally am fine with slower paced stories, more content is more content, but that isn't for everyone)

 

While to some extent I may not know what I'm missing out on from the lack of previous LotR reading, the only thing that sticks out to me that I'm not getting is that it's clear that half the point of the story is how Harry's existence in the world and his actions change things in comparison to canon. Without knowing that canon, obviously I don't notice/see those changes. It doesn't hamper enjoyment of the fic or anything, but it's something that non LotR fans are locked out of by definition.

*** Yeah, there are things you'll have missed, but I'm sure your reading experience was ok.

For example, Harry has probably prevented >! the fellowship of the Ring from being ambushed by the Balrog, because they will know that it's there.!< But you didn't need to know that to enjoy reading about how he did it.

** So, I would say your okay if you haven't... but full discloser I have read and seen them. As a related comment - I strongly encourage reading the LOTR books. They are a fantastic story telling experience. The movies were fun too. 😁

** The events of "Shadow of Angmar " take place (for the moment) before the one of LotR. So reading the books or watching the movie would not give you much informations. If you really want to learn about the Lore before reading it, you would probably have more informations reading the Silmarilion. But as people said before, the author really took the time to explain the world so you should be fine even without having read anything.

** I gave up on the story at some point, and they still hadn't gotten to the LoTR parts. It's more about the Silmarilion era.

*** It starts a thousand years before LoTR. It may never reach that era.

However, knowing LoTR helps in understanding the impact that Harry has on the world.

** It's probably not necessary. However you might still want to consider watching the movies at least to familiarize yourself with the world a bit? I know the movies are fairly long, but it's still doable, I guess.
