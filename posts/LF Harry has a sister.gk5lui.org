  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

*** It's pretty straight forward. If you're linking something from FanFiction.Net, you use linkffn(put the story title or ID number here). If you're linking from Ao3, you use linkao3(story title or ID).

Using those fics as an example:

linkao3(The Perceptive Badger) linkao3(Alexandra Lynn Potter) linkao3(Friends since birth)

Edit: Note that using just the title can have... mixed results, as seen by those random two fics that got pulled up

  Kreacher has a special bond with the Black heir. What happens when he's abused? Who will Kreacher turn to? Is the damage too great?orBefore the abuse can get too bad Harry is adopted by the Tonks family. He gains a new big sister, a snarky house elf, two parents, and much more. What happens over the course of him growing up? How will he continue to relate to his much older sister? And how will his unique "disability" affect his magic? Not to mention his interactions with a squib, a horse, and a herd of thestrals...Currently on a long hiatus, I will get back to it someday soon.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
