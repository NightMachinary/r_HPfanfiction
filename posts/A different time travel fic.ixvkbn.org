Someone can suggest a fic where it's the marauders/lily and their friends to travel into the future?

But not the usual, full of jokes and pranks fic where they found out the future in the second or third chapter. Something long, multi chapter, maybe?

Preferably accidental time travel where the time travelers hides their identities from Harry and co. for a good part of the fic and they found out little by little what's going on.


** I had something like that a d was only 3 chaps in. They travel to the very beginning in of PoA. I am in the process of rewriting it though.
