:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I've been looking through my whole browser history to find this fic but I just couldn't, so I hope someone will know what it is:

I think it was after OOTP, Harry just kinda stops giving a damn about anything. When he is brought to Grimmauld he just goes into his room and stays there. Hermione's Parents are also there and are on Harry's side. He refuses to join the Order and just does his own thing. There's a scene where he tries to make himself some food only for everybody else to eat it before he can. When he won't clean up, Molly refuses to let him eat for a while.

Later he "escapes" to I think Florida where he meets Voldemort on the beach on Vacation. After possessing Harry he is sane again and together they take care of the horcruxes. Voldemort stays in Scotland with McGonagall who he had a crush on as a student while Harry stays in Florida.

I also remember that in the end Hermione came to him and convinced him to forgive her and they end up together.

I hope someone will remember the name and thanks in advance for the help!


** What the fuck. I mean. What.

But yeah, I'd read the fuck out of that.

** It's [[https://seelvor.fanficauthors.net/Indifference_and_Neglect/index/]["Indifference and Neglect"]], by Seel'vor on FanficAuthors.net:

#+begin_quote
  "Sometimes, indifference and neglect do more damage than outright dislike"... "Sooner of later, the day comes when you can't hide from the things that you've done anymore"... Harry lives those two statements.

*** Pretty sure it's against subreddit rules to link it.

Edit: I was wrong. Wouldn't recommend the fic, but I was wrong.

**** I don't believe this violates any rules, both because IIRC there isn't any sexual content involving Harry or other teens, and because this isn't a direct link to the story text. If I'm misunderstanding, of course, the mods can definitely clarify.
