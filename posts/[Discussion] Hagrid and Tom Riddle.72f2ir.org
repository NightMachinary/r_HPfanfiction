Rereading the first book, I suddenly caught myself wondering whether Hagrid knew Voldemort was really Tom Riddle. It would make sense, with his being one of Dumbledore's close allies /and/ having known Riddle in his youth (not to mention, he had a good reason to hate Riddle already, unlike others who may have been too fooled by the "Riddle is the perfect prefect" rubbish to believe he was Voldemort). Nothing especially stands out, exactly, but in his explanation of Voldemort to Harry, there's just... little things that would seem consistent with such an interpretation. "...Maybe he just liked killin' by then", for instance, or "not sure he had enough human left in him to die", both suggest (though not prove) a knowledge that Voldemort started out more human and got corrupted by dark magic over time. There's also his having it on high authority that Voldmeort was a Slytherin, and his vague answer to Harry's question of whether he went to Hogwarts ("He did... many... many years ago...").


** I like to believe he does, and when he thinks of Voldemort he doesn't think of an unkillable dark lord, he thinks of that weedy little shit who got him expelled.

** This is an interesting question. It's easy to write Hagrid off as unintelligent and oafish, but you can't really tromp around in the Forbidden Forest without having a keen sense of observation. I don't know how many people other than DD in the Wizarding World had twigged that Voldemort began as Tom Riddle. Slughorn because of the Horcrux question, but I don't know about the other members of the Order. Did the Longbottoms and Harry's parents know that he used to be an orphan boy and that's what helped them defy him as the Dark Lord? Or is this another example of knowledge that DD kept to himself? Did Snape know?

With Hagrid, I can see it going both ways. I don't know that he would have figured it out for himself, but perhaps DD would have trusted him with the knowledge? He trusted him enough to collect baby Harry, so maybe he let it out to certain individuals that Riddle turned into Voldemort after the events of 10/31/81?

Regarding Riddle as the "perfect prefect", is there evidence that Hagrid actively disliked him? I haven't read the books in a while, so I may be forgetting a scene.

Good question!

*** Perhaps he didn't /hate/ him, but that seems overwhelmingly likely with him having been the one to have him expelled, refused to listen to his explanations, and attempted to kill Aragog (which might have been the least forgivable of all in Hagrid's opinion).

Also, we know for sure that /Ollivander/ knew about the Riddle/Voldemort connection, and some of the senior Death Eaters (the one who were already following him around at Hogwarts) are bound to know.

**** Reread the scene in CoS. Hagrid didn't show any hate towards Riddle for doing his job (Hagrid likely knew he would be punished if he were caught). He was mainly distressed that Aragog would get the blame due to his actions.

***** Sure, but that could easily have changed after Tom tried to /kill/ Aragog.

**** Ah, I forgot that it was likely Ollivander knew.

** It always made sense to me that a lot of the people of their generation knew the origins of Voldemort. He wasn't to subtle about it. He created the name in Hogwarts and Dumbledore alludes to the existence of the Death Eaters when Riddle applies for the Defence position. In my opinion part of the fear of Voldemort name might have come from the knowledge that he personally hunted down anyone who publicly tried to link Riddle and Voldemort.

** It would be amusing if he didn't know, and that Tom was just so charming that Hagrid believed him when he said sorry to Hagrid. (Not canon at all, but if someone you've gotten expelled from Hogwarts over murder is on the grounds with you you would want to be careful.
