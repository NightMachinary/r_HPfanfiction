Redditors? Redditers? No clue. Either way, post your fics! I'mma support your asses!


** My active stories:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][*Alexandra Potter*]]

Female Harry story, starting from the summer before first year. The AU is more than just Harry's gender. The focus of this story is currently on school life: learning magic, friendships and rivalries at Hogwarts.

/Status/: 85k words, 4 chapters off the end of first year. Chapter 12 coming sometime today or tomorrow.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7917665/1/In-Essence-Divided][*In Essence Divided*]]

Story set after CoS. Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets, but due to a freak accident Harry gains control over her body, resulting in a Harry Potter with one mind but two bodies. An action adventure focused on European affairs in the summer between 2nd and 3rd years.

/Status/: 37k words, 2 chapters and an epilogue off complete. Will resume writing once 1st year of Alexandra Potter is done.

On hiatus:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][*Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic*]]

Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

/Status/: 30k words, continuation is planned for but I'm not actively pursuing it right now.

One shot:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8272476/1/Secrets][*Secrets*]]

Dark fic taking a look at a political Harry as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Technically the best example of my writing.

/Status/: 3k words, complete.

I have a number of other one shots and an abandoned fic called Return as well, but these are the fics that I'm most proud of.

** Two years as a *redditor* and you hadn't figured out what we're called? Anyway, my only two HP fics, both one-shots. I am currently working on a longer fic (currently 30,000 words and still going) but that won't see the light of day until it's complete (assuming I don't finish it and decide it's crap).

*[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240625/1/I-m-Joining-the-Order][I'm Joining the Order!]]*

#+begin_quote
  Draco expresses his wish to join the Order of the Phoenix. Lucius isn't impressed. All dialogue. Humour.
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7618729/1/Grab-the-Cup][Grab the Cup!]]*

#+begin_quote
  Or "What Would have Happened if Harry or Cedric had a Brain in Their Heads". An alternate ending to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but with no less tragedy. Rated T for themes of death and a really ugly Voldemort-baby-thing.

** My four-generation Potter/Weasley family war novel that I finished back in the fall. It won the HPFF Dobby award for best villain, which made me really happy:

** Reddit-its, eh? Careful now, if the dash were one letter to the left...

I have stories [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=151202][here]] :) They're primarily next-gen YAs, so probably not fitting reddit's audience (for the canon-only, I do have [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=314682][a post-Hogwarts Lavender fic]]), but my writing has grown a lot, and I'm quite proud of how far I've come! Ask me two years ago, I'd never think I'd still be writing today.

It's finished and I've moved on to the second book, Harry Potter and the King of Serpents - there's a link to that one at the end of Draught of Life.

** My author page is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elizzywithfire][www.fanfiction.net/~lizzywithfire]]

I've got a couple of Harry Potter stories, but my favourites of the ones I have written are generally from other universes. Most of my HP stories have only a couple of chapters up... I hope to one day update them.

I also have a Dramione one shot. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6503269/1/Glimpses-of-what-could-have-been]]

and another oneshot which is a xover.\\
