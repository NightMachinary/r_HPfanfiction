Pretty much as the title says. I'm writing a comedy/crack fic centered around a world where Harry, Hermione, Neville etc... have exaggerated personalities. Only thing is I don't know if what I'm writing is becoming too crazy and out there. I enjoy writing it, but I've been told that it may be a bit over the top.


** I think internal consistency is more important than any absolute metric of realism for a work of fiction.

Create the world you want and give the characters whatever personality you feel like but once you've set things up, stick to them.

Don't go changing the established facts of your world or assassinating your characters for the sake of a cheap joke or to get the plot to where you want it.

*** Thanks for the advice, I'll have to focus on that. My ideas for Hermione change constantly and in the last chapter I changed her a bit. I'll focus on keeping them at least somewhat the same.

**** Or if you want to change a character, maybe make it happen for a reason and then have them stay changed. My problem is mainly with someone acting out of character because the plot or joke demands it then going straight back to the way they normally are in the next scene.

** I feel like the main problem that ruins crackfics is going into a mindset of "random is funny", followed by the author's sense of humor being entirely based off ancient comedy sketches. You can't really go too absurd, exaggeration is a form of humor, as long as you keep it tasteful.

** To me a great crack fic is where absurd things happen to ordinary characters. If your characters start reacting to events in an absurd way (muted reaction to the absurd, or absurd reaction to the normal) then it's a bridge too far. Obviously that line is objective, and playing with that line is the name of the game but I feel like that's the rule

** I've always thought there's nothing such as too absurd but that might just be personal taste. Honestly, though - as long as it stays within the confines of the plot (if there's one for your fic, depending on whether it's a one-shot/drabbles kinda thing but i think yours isn't) it'll be fine.

** Well the thing about crack is...do what you want. No seriously. If you like it, it's fine and someone else will too. Some people like characters being the straight man while the world is the banana man.

Other people don't mind random things out of left field. Still others don't mind frenzied fever dreams where nothing makes sense.

But you do want to keep the same tone throughout so the reader can understand the world that they are in.

Honestly I could see a fic where Hermione has a different personality in every single scene. If it changes once, it's a plot point, if it changes every page it's a tone choice.

My favorite crack scene ever came from a long consistent buildup. (Fleur Delacour firing a rail gun mounted on the back of a dragon at a jabberwock while Luna Lovegood played a guitar solo? More please)

** Dont have to many bizarre thi gs happen right after the other. And dont have it ramp up in insanity to quickly. If you grow the craziness and crack portions of it it's less jarring. Set the personalities and keep with them dont change them unless their is character development to justify it. Also make sure the readers know why something happens or what to expect from the craziness. Dont just have characters do crazy things just for the sake of craziness. Crazy should still follow the logic of the world you build.

You can make a world where people randomly turn into animals and back again but having a character just randomly turn into a goat with no explanation and nobody addressing it is a little Jarring.

** I'd say, don't introduce too many earth-shattering retcons. It's good advice for any other genre but is especially important in this one. There should be one or two ideas that introduced the craziness, the rest should be the consequences. I've seen many crack fics that despite absurd events were initially logical, the plot made me interested, comedy was really funny, but then there were more and more random events and I no longer cared.

Bad crack fics usually become worse, when the author no longer knows, how to maintain the humor. So in one chapter, he introduces dinosaurs out of nowhere, in the next, a secret society of house elves, then we learn that his parents were assassins, then that Lily was secretly a Dom, then that Luna is secretly an agent of the Department of Mysteries, then... I think you get the idea. And the idea of the story was for example: "Harry decided to pass the Triwizard Tournament in a way that would ridicule the Ministry".

Retcons, secrets, chaos unrelated to summary is a recipe for a bad crackfic. You want to create an illusion that all this funny chaos was like dominoes or a house of cards.
