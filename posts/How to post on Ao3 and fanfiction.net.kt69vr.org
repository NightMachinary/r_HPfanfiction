So, I am currently writing my own Harry Potter fanfiction and font know how to post them! I have two problems involving two different fanfic website's.

Problemo 1: I can't figure out how to sign up to Ao3. I put my email in to get the invite thingy and then I click on the button that tells me where I am in the queue. I put in my email again and it says I'm not the queue at all!

Problemo 2: How the hell do I post stuff on fanfiction.net?? I tried posting a chapter and I got a friend to find it to see if it worked. It didn't. They sent me a screenshot and the entire chapter was like 400 characters worth of random numbers!

Ps. If figuring out how to post chapters on Ao3 takes the same amount of brain power as figuring out how to use fanfiction.net does, please tell me how to use it!!


** I can't help with Ao3, I am too new to it to understand the mechanics to the site. Posting wise it is pretty easy.

FFN (fanfiction.net) that I can help with. It sounds like you used the copy and paste feature and just uploaded the document without checking. For whatever reason, ffn been having tech issue and one of them is the copy and paste doc creation. I suggest going to doc manager. Delete what's there and then paste your stuff. Then just reupload your chapter. Hopefully that solve your issue.

** I can confirm that posting on Ao3 is super easy!

When you make your account and log in, at the top right corner it will say your username and the first button next to it says “Post”.

If you click it you get a drop down menu with the options “New work” or “Import work”. I assume Import would be uploading your files but I always go “New work” and fill in the information for my fic.

You can copy and paste your first chapter where it says to. The text default is html so I always switch to Rich Text so it looks cleaner and I can easily make changes I want like italizing words.

Hope this helps!
