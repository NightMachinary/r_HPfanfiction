I was just curious what people on this reddit were

If you dont know and want to take a test or just wanna take it again for some reason but dont want to go to pottermore these are compiled pottermore quizzes for both Hogwarts and Ilvermony. It also gives you what percentage you are of the other houses

I am Slytherin and Thunderbird what are you guys?


** My Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff score are the exact same (27%) and I've always had a hard time deciding on Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw without taking the quiz

** Gryffindor and Pukwudgie

I don't know how I always end up in Gryffindor. I would be such a good Ravenclaw.

** Ravenclaw (as always) with Gryffindor coming in second (unexpected).

Then I got 26% for three houses in the other one, with the Horned Serpent taking over the other 22% No idea what what any of that means though.
