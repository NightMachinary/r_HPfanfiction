  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.\\
  “No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”\\
  “I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.\\
  She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”\\
  “You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”\\
  “Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”\\
  “You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

** Honestly the notion that Tom Riddle was some misunderstood child that Dumbledore drove into evil with his suspicion and cold attitude is aggravating and stupid, and I see it constantly. I mean the guy murdered a kid in cold blood at 16 and his family shortly after, he knew good and goddamn well what he was doing when he did it, and never showed a hint of remorse about it. But Dumbledore's the bad guy because he was correctly suspicious of a murderer.

I swear I really wish Tom Riddle was a hideous bastard sometimes. You would never see this shit if he were.

*** Didn't he kill that boy's rabbit, too? And he was definitely torturing the other kids at the orphanage. If any charges can be laid at Dumbledore's feet, it's that he didn't obliviate him and go about his business.

** On the one hand, that is a terrible summary for a story. On the other hand, it does actually tell me everything I need to know about the story. Specifically, that I should avoid it at all costs.

** The whole Tom isn't Voldemort thing is ridiculous. They're one and the same. It gets even sillier when people claim that Voldemort eventually became 'insane', unlike his days as Tom.

Voldemort was largely responsible for his own choices in life, especially after coming to Hogwarts. It's stupid to pin the blame on Dumbledore.

** I'm not going to debate about this opinion or anything as everyone can like what they like, but I have to say as a FF writer myself I find this post really discouraging. I can only imagine how the author would feel if they stumbled upon this.

Though you may not like the story and may not want to read it, a real person out there put a lot of their time and effort into writing it. It is ok to offer constructive feedback or disagree with ideas/headcanons/whatever in general, but directly insulting an author/story like this feels pretty unwarranted. If you enjoy reading FF, please don't drive FF creators away with this type of hate. If a story is not your thing, you can easily move on and find something that is.

People are leaving fandom because of the lack of positive engagement and the amount of negative stuff out there, especially in HP and other older fandoms. It seems to me like a lot of people who only read FF don't really understand how draining these stories can be to write (on top of normal life these days) and how much work it takes to produce the content they enjoy, so they don't understand how much impact words like these can have on someone.

If you want there to continue to be stories out there for you to read and enjoy, please go comment about how much you love those stories and leave the ones you don't like alone, unless it is to offer constructive feedback and not just bash someone's idea. Thank you.

*** Hey I'm the author of this story and I really don't mind this sort of criticism! But thanks for being so lovely though, it was very heart-warming to read your comment :)

I find a lot of things about this comment thread really interesting tbh! I think it comes down to a key difference in interpretation as to why people like/dislike Tom's character.\\
Obviously Tom is not simply a misunderstood child, lol. And obviously Dumbledore isn't responsible for Tom's actions. And Dumbledore definitely didin't drive him to evil! That's quite literally said in this conversation segment. But I also find it a little lazy to have a villain be the anti-christ, and this story was my way of playing around with the concept of inherent evil and how much power and responsibility adults have when it comes to troubled children, a topic close to my heart.

But I do find it deeply funny that a lot of the criticisms here amount to "Voldemort is responsible for his actions and it's stupid to blame Dumbledore," when the summary includes a line from Dumbledore asking, " “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” to which my character says, "no." Lol.

**** Honestly, I wouldn't call this sort of thing criticism. Criticism would be if someone actually read the story and was like I don't think this was explained well, or you could've added more of this. It would also be different if they gave constructive feedback on the summary and how to write a "better" one if they think it is bad. This is just picking on someone's idea because you disagree with it or it's not your thing, which is bullying. It doesn't seem like this person read your story, just the summary, and then they made certain assumptions about it. Like you said, they don't even seem to have paid particular attention to what the summary actually says!

I'm glad you can take it so well, but personally I find it really offensive someone would directly post the summary and a link to the story. They could have posted just a general thread saying they hate it when stories bash on Dumbledore for making Tom evil. This kind of targeting is completely unnecessary and just rude. I hope this person and the others who commented realize that and don't do this again. It seems your story is fairly popular and you didn't mind it, but especially for new authors or those not getting a lot of reads this is the kind of stuff that drives them out of fandom.

I write Tom as well, largely out of the same reasons/interests you have in the character (PM if you want a link to my AO3). I understand many people don't like him and don't want to read about him. That's fine, I am not writing for them, otherwise I'd pick a different character. But I'm also not tramping all over A03 to criticize people who write things I'm not interested in just for writing those things and not the things I like. It seems like this person and the repliers have forgotten that age-old saying of fandom: "Don't like, don't read."

***** That's a good point, this isn't really proper criticism in good faith. And yeah it's obvious that a lot of assumptions were made! Funnily enough, my story does actually tackle a lot of the issues that are brought up here.

I suppose it is very lucky that this sort of thing is more amusing to me than anything else, but you're totally right, I can really see how another author could find this really hurtful and stop writing. I didn't think of that.

Tom is always a very divisive character depending on one's interpretation of a lot of different aspects of HP (as well as real world topics surrounding psychopathy, consent, and nature vs. nuture etc.). I'm not suprised that a lot of genuinely explorative stories/discussions around his character get written off as "oh you only like him bc he's hot."

But hey! Like you said, I don't write for those people either. Thanks again.
