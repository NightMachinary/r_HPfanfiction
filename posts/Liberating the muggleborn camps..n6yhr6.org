This is one plot bunny I have never seen used as a setup to a story and even when fics do involve the idea that death eaters captured muggleborn the liberation of these camps are usually done offscreen by not the protagonist.

The idea always fascinated me. And with how many people like Harry going all dark lord for various reasons. Seeing the horrors of a concentration camp and the need to exact vengeance on those responsible is an excellent way to get him going down that sort of path.


** This is a part of /monroeslittle/'s fic called /And the Wolves All Cry,/ except it's Lily Potter in one of the camps. Beautiful fic, though, highly recommended!

** Part of the background of Strange Reflections by LeQuin is that Harry was part of the group that liberated the camps after the war. It turned out that Rookwood was the Death Eater equivalent of Mengele.

Needless to say, Harry in that fic is more than a little messed up.

** I can imagine that death eaters would try to take a muggleborn's magic and transfer it to a squib on the reasoning that squibs are the ones who had their magic stolen in the first place. This would probably involve a great deal of torture- maybe not as much biological experimentation, but psychological torture akin to the kind practiced by conversion “therapists”. This would obviously not work, and the most it would do is create an adult obscurial. I could see such victims being used as a terror weapon- stunned and portkeyed into a public area in order to cause destruction.

** For some reason I've never seen it that way. I mean Azkaban is horrifying alright and the thought of being imprisoned in a place where you would constantly feel like you will never be happy again sounds quite a lot like the biblical description of hell without the fire and tar pits. However, I wouldn't imagine that Death Eaters would spend too much time in there since they can't cast Patronuses (according to JK) and mostly use the Muggleborns as a way to ensure the Dementors cooperation. Also on the rocky island where Azkban is it doesn't seem like prisoners could be exploited much. They could produce no manual labor of value, nor were they allowed to have wands.

Therefore I imagined that the liberation would be no more spectacular than Voldemort's orchestrated mass break-out in OotP. In fact I would argue it would be even less spectacular since the good guys no longer had any resistance.

** I too would like to see this plot as well with the trio rescuing people from them or at least the perspectives of people imprisoned in them more.

As mentioned, And the Wolves All Cry, is the only fic I've seen go more into them.

** How about Harry stuck in a Muggle holocost camp? The Damned by fantom_ftnoise. Very dark and gruesome, head the tags and warnings, and don't read if faint of heart. No joke. Otherwise, so very good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3388898]]

** There was a fic from the old Granger Enchanted site, /Dangerous/ by blacklotus, which had a flashback scene about that. The fic was abandoned and the site is gone, but there are copies floating around.

** He doesn't go dark or anything like that, but in linkffn(12307886) Harry's really fucked up with PTSD from dealing with the camps. Some gory detail when he gets around to talking about it

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
