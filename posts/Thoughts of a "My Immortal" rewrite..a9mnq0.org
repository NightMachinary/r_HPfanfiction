So, this very cool dude did a reading of My Immortal on Christmas Eve and I got to listen to the magnificence of a terribly bad fanfic. But I had a thought about rewriting it in a way that makes perfect sense or some shit like that, like just for shits and giggles. The guy tells me I should do that and I'm actually thinking of losing my sanity and doing it.

​

I just....is it plausible? I was thinking like, if maybe this is just going too far and I'll lose my marbles while doing it? Or will it be something fun and engaging?

Right now I'm tempted to, as I'm on a standstill with my own fics and I need to give it a break, but...

I'm not sure.


** linkffn(My Immortal Lily and the Art of Bringing Me to Life) takes My Immortal into Muffin's Lilyverse, and it is truly terrifying and disturbing.

Also, a rewrite that "makes sense" wouldn't actually have anything left of the original story, would it? I don't think I there's anything salvageable there.

** The “beauty” of My Immortal is how bad and nonsensical it is. I would not want to read a version that does make sense. Defeats the purpose to me.
