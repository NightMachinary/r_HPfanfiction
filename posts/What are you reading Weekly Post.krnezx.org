** I really enjoyed "The Letter." It's a Sirius-raising-Harry story and a nice comfort read. It alternates between Sirius, Harry, and Lupin's POV, and the most surprising thing to me is that Harry, who is 7 years old, actually talks/acts/thinks like a 7-year-old. He is so sweet and curious, and his dynamic with Kreacher is amusing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993043/8/The-Letter]]

I also read a Harry/Fleur fic where Fleur comes to Hogwarts to teach a dueling club. Fleur gets to be the badass she could have been in canon, but doesn't sacrifice her recognizable personality traits like her arrogance. It's a great representation of her, and sadly unfinished. Can't find the link/name at the moment it's really good though.

Right now, I'm working my way through a Marauder's Plan (no spoilers please) and it is one of those stories you can totally lose yourself in. I think I'm going to pick longer fics (it's really long) from now on. To be quite honest the Lord/family magic stuff isn't my thing at all so I skim over it. I can see why it annoys people. I like drama, dialogue, interpersonal dynamics etc-soap opera stuff. But anyway it's great to read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]

** linkffn(In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud)

It's about how Tom Riddle Sr. decided to have the responsibility to sire Tommy after Hermione gave him the option to raise him or to give him to a magical family. Yes, Hermione revealed the Wizarding World to him and his parents for them to understand what happened to Tom Riddle Sr. And no, she didn't reveal that she's actually a time-traveler.

Now what I love about this fic is that the Riddle family actually have personalities. It centralizes on how Tom Riddle Sr. adapts to the Wizarding World, and let me tell y'all, it's hilariously perfect. He has a rational mind unlike those fics where he's a 'ruined man'. I guess it's because someone finally explained what really happened to him and that his parents actually believed him. He managed to stand again after that incident with Merope because of the early closure Hermione gave him.

He's also so proud of his House he's practically the embodiment of the phrase\\
"Those bitches don't know what's coming." when he goes to the Wizarding World with Hermione. He blends in with the magical people. Specifically, the /aristocratic/ magical people. He's all like, "I need to be someone that shows what kind of standing the Riddles have to those Wizarding folk and they're gonna respect us."

There are even times throughout some chapters that I forgot he's Tom Riddle Sr. because he thinks and acts similarly to his son... At least 'similar' from what I've read on other Tomione fics, minus the sadistic streak and magic. He's cunning, ambitious, and manipulative.

It's basically the Riddle family pretending to be a magical family for Tommy. It's not a Tomione fic from what I've read so far, and that Hermione's pov and past (future?) life isn't talked about much.

Oh, and Tom Riddle Sr. is perturbed by baby Tommy.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Ah New Years, a time for drinking booze and reading fanfiction.

For the booze, if you're like me and think champagne is a solid 0/1 beverage (doubly so if you're broke and buying some nasty-ass Prosecco) try my go to Champagne cocktail: the St. Germain Spritz. Put 2 parts Champagne (or your nasty-ass Prosecco), 1.5 part St. Germain Elderflower liqueur, and 2 parts club soda in a tall glass with ice, give it a stir, and enjoy. If you're a fancy bitch put a lemon twist in there too. Yes I got this off the back of a St. Germain gift box, but it really is a 1/1 I promise. I guess my hot tip is 5 or 6 days too late to save you this New Years, but maybe remember for next time.

For the fanfiction, I saw a post in the last week on this sub by someone promoting their new-ish fic. It's called In Another Life by Drifting_Melody, and it's quite good. Post-DH a master of death fem!Harry meets Death, who for reasons that haven't been revealed yet, sends her back in time to a parallel universe where she's the twin sister of Harry Potter. An extra baby in the mix, particularly one whose limited baby brain has future memories stuffed in it, derails the train of canon pretty early on, though not enough to save James and Lily. It gets to Hogwarts pretty quickly, which is where I am now. The writing style is fun and unique, with lots of little parenthetical asides jammed into the text in a way that would probably be annoying if the author hadn't taken care to make them flow nicely. It's a pretty new fic, but definitely one to keep an eye on, especially if it keeps updating at its current pace. The author did invent a gender neutral term for witches and wizards, “wixen”, which I do find a bit cringy, but even so I easily rate it 1/1

** There is one I read that I enjoyed, but is kind of odd, because it is a 3 part stand alone alternate version of a different fic that was posted in the outtakes and sidestories thread for the original story. The original story is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377][Rose Petal Red]], which is a self insert as Ginny's twin sister (also, it is one of my favorite self insert stories). While RPR is on hiatus due to the author graduating college and starting a job, they have been occasionally updating their sidestory story with bits and pieces, and they just recently did a 3 part story called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14154777/chapters/69533256][Strangler]] "What if rather than accomodating the SI's early magic problems, the Weasley's treated her poorly, leading her to go dark". It is a fairly dark fic, but I found it quite enjoyable. I don't think you need to be familiar with the original fanfic to enjoy it, and it works reasonably as a stand alone. It is dark, and a lot of people end up killed over the course of it, but if you don't mind that, I would recommend reading it.

** I am currently reading Shield by FeBee - posted in AO3 and FFN - current WIP. Sequel to Sword and Shield from the same author. Percival Graves dies in Grinderwald's custody and is tasked by Death to help her Master. Graves is then de-aged and sent forward in time to the summer between 4th and 5th year. Good friend Ron, not good Dumbledore and Hermione.

** Finished the Denarian Series from Shezza on Tuesday and now I'm out of reading material. But that was without question the best cross over fic I ever read and I don't know why I never heard of it before. I strongly recommend it, it's perfect. It's basically Dark!Harry where Harry picks up an Denarian Coin (Cross over from the Dresden Files Series from Jim Butcher) when he's like 7 y/o and becomes host to a demon. But why am I telling you this, I'm so late to the game, I guess everybody knows this fic already.

Heres the link to the first Book, The Denarian Renegade: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]]

** I'm rereading Stealing Harry by Copperbadge (rated M, completed). I've read it a couple times and enjoy it. The concept is that Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban because of a weird mistake, and he lives down the street from the Dursley's. He and Remus work at a bookshop and one day, 8 year old Harry walks in. They eventually “steal” him from the Dursley's. The relationships between the adult characters and Harry and his friends is interesting and what I like. What the author tried to do to “fix” the actual HP plot is complicated and doesn't make sense to me. But what I like is how the plot goes pretty seamlessly between the adults and the kids.

Rating M

It‘s a HP/LV with light!bashing and I love that it goes through all 7 years without spending to much detail on recounting every book.

Harry is smart and talented but not the super hero he is in some stories.

I love the story bc it really makes me feel something. I like stories where Dumbledore is shown as the manipulative bastard he (in my opinion) actually is and his treatment of Harry backfires, and this one is really well written.

** I just finished Sweater Weather. linkao3(Sweater Weather by lumosinlove)

A Wolfstar muggle AU where they're all french-canadian hockey players

It's very romance heavy which isn't my thing but it was recommended to me a lot and aside from that it was really good! The OCs are just darling they're so funny!

And I learned so much about Ice Hockey. Kinda... I still know nothing about Ice Hockey but I feel like I do. And I can't do the French Canadian accent so everyone just sounded Parisian French to me which was very suave. Especially Sirius and Logan 😁.

It was a very sweet story. If you like Ice Hockey you'll love this. I'm sure it's very accurate to the game 😊

6/10 - if I liked romance it'd be better. Great OCs and Hockey talk made up for it though 😊

** After the discussion on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kqvmat/luna_as_werewolf/][other thread]], I was given reference to three Harmony+werewolves stories (Lupin bites somebody in the end of the third year). I found them surprisingly good:

- “[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24594295][In Bocca Al Lupo by morpholomeg]]” is very well executed. The idea is simple: story of poor Muggle family (Grangers) who has to deal with the fact that their daughter is not only witch (which is strange enough), but she is handicapped for the rest of her life (Remus even pushes his theory that Hermione as a witch should be sterilised, because she is not capable to carry baby through transformations; I really prefer “[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10294436][Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters]]”) Beauty of the story is that it is very clearly focused and it doesn't get bogged down into romance or into seven year story, but it keeps it just in the length of normal summer story. Other thing I really liked was how it describe the frontier between the magical and Muggle worlds and it doesn't limit the story to all those tired places (Hogwarts, Burrow, Gringotts, Ministry).

- “[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21972532][The Wolf Doesn't Lose Sleep Over the Bleating of Sheep by Chelonie]]” is kind of similar story (although it is still ongoing story, so I am not sure, how it will develop), but it is more explicit Harmony story (both Harry and Hermione are bitten, and they quickly move to the old ancestral Potter building Pottery). The thing which was created very well is explicitly pissed off both victims with Lupin, which ends up in the end to kicking Lupin out of their company and house. I am very much looking forward to future instalments of the story.

- “[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11279476][A Werewolf and a Veela Walk Into a Pub by Ares.Granger]]”. After previous two mostly excellent stories, I was a bit disappoint by this one. It is mostly opposite of them: whereas these are mostly about hardship of living with the curse (particularly in the Muggle world), here Harry's (only) lycanthropy is mostly just waved over (“if you accept who you are, you don't need any Wolfsbane Potion and you can control yourself well”) and to make things even more weird, Hermione promptly and conveniently finds out that she is actually a Veela, which leads to immediate (the story is when they are fourteen) very very active sex life (fortunately, acts are only mentioned in the background, it is not overly lemony). Then lycanthropy/veelism is just soup on the top of rather standard Triwizard Tournament story (but there are really only three participants, Harry is by literally acts of god saved and Voldemort vanquished on time). Not sure about this.

To clear my palate, I have read also this beauty:

- “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7382549/1/][When Is It a Contract by Aealket]]” which is beautifully balancing on complete crack story with completely awesome Luna (who always correctly answers any direct question, except the answer doesn't make any sense, and she doesn't remember neither question nor the answer), Amelia Bones ex machina, and completely outplayed Dumbledore. Delightful.

It's a 4th year fic. Shockingly Harry an hermione don't get bit by Remus but get attacked by werewolves during the summer and again they don't get bit but you'll have to find out how they turned. There's a lot of the whole mates and pack hierarchy in here. And has a focus on werewolf laws and changing them.
