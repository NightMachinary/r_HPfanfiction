Can I get a Percy Jackson and Harry Potter crossover where they are seeing each other for the first time in years? Also, I'd prefer if Harry IS NOT a jerk who is jealous of percy.


** Man, being abandoned by his mother so she can take care of another brother kinda makes someone jealous. Unless if Harry is only poseidon kid, not sallys.

*** As siblings I don't think it can be done with quality (would cross disbelief suspension straight to hand-waved bullshit, to say nothing about how much we would need to change about backstories, character behavior and in universe mechanics). I saw one once where they were cousins though, it was abandoned if I'm not mistaken and I don't remember the name, but it seemed as if they were getting along.
