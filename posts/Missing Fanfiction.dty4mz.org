I cannot find this AMAZING fanfiction I know I subscribed to on Archive of our Own. It's called the Heir, and it's Drarry based. Harry finds out he's the heir of Hogwarts, and he's really smart. Each founder has their own set of rooms, and what not, and there's a lot of Dumbledore bashing. I read it recently, and I wanted to read it again but I can't find it. Do any of y'all know what happened to it, or happen to have a copy?

UPDATE: [[/u/ForwardDiscussion][u/ForwardDiscussion]] found it! See the link below. Thanks!


** Is it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7457052/1/The-Heir][this one?]] That's what comes up when you search the terms you specified.
