Voldemort was always a little off and messed up as a child, but he still had his sanity and wits about him. As he created the horcruxes he slowly lost himself piece by piece. Would Voldemort have had a better chance of taking over the wizarding world if he were sane? What would he have done differently if he did have his sanity?


** Well, he could have become the Minister and this should have happened:

Minister Riddle: Be careful of the Order, Harry. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Order member. Learn to use the Dark Arts and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

Harry: What did you say? How do you know that...?

Minister Riddle: Use my knowledge, I beg you.

Harry: [pointing his wand at Minister] You're Lord Voldemort!

--------------

Moody: In the name of the Wizengamot, you're under arrest, Minister.

Voldemort: Are you threatening me, Master Auror?

Moody: The Wizengamot will decide your fate.

Voldemort: I AM the Wizengamot!

Moody: Not yet.

[the Minister/Voldemort rises slowly, and his wand snaps to his hand from his sleeve] Voldemort: It's treason, then...

--------------

Harry: [after killing Alastor Moody] What have I done?

Voldemort: You are fulfilling your destiny, Harry. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark arts. There's no turning back now.

Harry: I will do whatever you ask. Just help me save Ginny's life. I can't live without her. If she dies, I don't know what I will do.

Voldemort: To cheat death is a power only I have achieved through decades of the study of the dark arts. And I'm willing to teach you this secret.

Harry: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Dark.

Voldemort: Good. Good! The Magic is strong in you, Harry Potter. A powerful Dark Wizard you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as... Hadrian Peverell.

Harry: Thank you... my Master.

Voldemort: Lord Peverell... rise.

--------------

Voldemort: [To Death Eaters] I'm sending my new apprentice, Lord Hadrian Peverell, to take care of you.

--------------

Voldemort/Emperor: [to the Wizengamot] In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Ministry will be reorganized into the first Wizarding Imperium, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

[Wizengamot fills with enormous applause]

Ginny: [to Hermione Granger] So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause.

--------------

Dumbledore: Into exile, I must go. /Failed/, I have.

--------------

Ginny: Harry, I was so worried about you! Ron... told me terrible things!

Harry: What things?

Ginny: He said... you turned to the Dark Side. That you... killed First Years!

Harry: Ron is trying to turn you against me.

Ginny: He cares about us.

Harry: Us?

Ginny: He knows. He wants to help you. Harry, all I want is your love.

Harry: Love won't save you, Ginny. Only my new powers can do that!

Ginny: But at what cost? You're a good person, don't do this!

Harry: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Order member has ever dreamed of, and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

Ginny: Come away with me. Help me raise our child far away. Leave everything else behind while we still can!

Harry: No. Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore! We no longer have to hide our love for each other. I am more powerful than the Minister, I... I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the Wizarding world! We can make things the way we want them to be!

Ginny: I don't believe what I'm hearing! Ron was right... you've changed! You have turned to the dark side! You're not Harry anymore!

Harry: [with a growing angry look and voice] I don't want to hear any more about Ron. The Order turned against me. Don't you turn against me!

Ginny: [tears in her eyes] Harry, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!

Harry: Because of Ron?

Ginny: Because of what you've done... what you plan to do! Stop! Stop now... come back... I love you!

[Harry looks beside Ginny and sees Ron standing at the entrance overhearing them]

Harry: [enraged and paranoid] Liar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me!

--------------

Voldemort: Lord Peverell... can you hear me?

Hadrian: Yes, Master.

Hadrian: [looks at Voldemort] Where is Ginny? Is she safe? Is she all right?

Voldemort: It seems in your anger, you killed her.

Hadrian: I...? I couldn't have! She was alive... I felt it!

[Hadrian growls, and his accidental dark magic crushes everything around him in the room. He frees himself from the metal stretcher, and steps off. Voldemort has a smirk on his face]

Hadrian: Nooooooooooooooooooo!

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  "You know, of course, *that they have called this boy my downfall*?" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.

then the whole graveyard fiasco. the fiasco with crouch not being able to catch harry potter. then the whole fiasco at the ministry, bella and lucius (some of the most competent DEs) being unable to catch harry, the prophecy being lost, volde ending up revealing himself to the rest of wizarding england. there's also the fiasco with his diary being destroyed in year 2.

volde says in DH.

#+begin_quote
  “I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. *I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter,* and I shall be.”
#+end_quote

he thinks his failure was sending people like lucius, crouch, bella, etc, to kill harry - what he doesn't know in the prophecy must have harry him from dying.

--------------

what's also sometimes lost in fanon is that people generally assume harry to be very very powerful; the next dark lord.

#+begin_quote
  "You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?"

  "Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?" asked Snape.

  "He. . . lately, we. . . I am asking you, Snape!"

  "If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible --"

  "You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!" she jeered.

  "I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago. . . "

  "But why did you keep him alive?"

  "Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts *there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lord's old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more.* I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  [Slughorn] contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, "'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!"

  Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.

  "Of course," said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, "there have been rumors for years. . . I remember when--well--after that terrible night--Lily--James--and you survived--*and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary--"*
#+end_quote

--------------

i don't think it's unreasonable for volde to view harry potter as his #1 threat, especially given the *extreme* care dumbledore gave to keep harry safe.

that's why he spends the entirety of DH flying around europe (literally) trying to find the wand so he can defeat harry.

and he's right, if anything - harry *was* the person who eventually defeated him.

yeah. i think given how obsessed he is with avoiding death, and how dumbledore calls him the most intelligent student hogwarts has ever seen, i think we have to assume he would be his horcruxes in eg. a pebble at the bottom of the sea if he could.

i think we just have to assume symbolism are magically relevant in horcruxes, also.

we have precedence for symbolism being magically relevant in HP already - for example, harry can only get the sword of gryffindor under an act of bravery

#+begin_quote
  “Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster's chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that *it must be taken under conditions of need and valor* --- and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry's mind and see you acting for him ---”

  He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio Sword.”

  It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.

  “Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.

  What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.

  Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, "So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?"

I don't know where the fanon about "horcruxes make you insane" came from, but it's as insidious as the fanon where "Voldemort is crazy because he's only running on 1/128^{th} of a soul". And to be frank, as much as I enjoy fanfic that tells a different story than canon, this is a bad fanon trope because it lessens Voldemort's culpability for his crimes.

Voldemort didn't murder people because he was crazy. He murdered people because their lives were worthless to him. When he had his full soul, at 11 years old in the orphanage, he was still a nasty little brat who liked to torture animals and other orphans.

*** I'd argue that his actions in the books were often rather stupid. Like many stereotypical monologuing villains, Voldemort gets handed the idiot ball whenever JKR'S plot requires him to fail (monologuing in front of the Mirror of Erised, monologuing in the Chamber of Secrets, the ridiculously convoluted plotting to capture Harry and his subsequent escape in book 4, the plot to bring Harry to the Ministry in book 5 when luring him to another location would have had a much lower chance of alerting the government, placing his horcruxes in locations related to him which made them easier to discover, etc.)

Thus, even though the books often tell us Voldemort was a genius, every time he makes a personal appearance he mostly comes across as a sadistic maniac with poor impulse control. We can either interpret his poor reasoning skills as simple stupidity or, as OP said, insanity.

Not too many knew he was a Gaunt and the curse on the ring should've killed the person who touched it quickly. That it didn't is a testament to Snape and Dumbledore's skill rather than Voldemort's stupidity. The diadem was long lost and hidden in plain sight in a room full of junk that no one bothered to investigate.

The locket was supposed to be untouchable in a basin full of a hallucinogenic surrounded by inferi in a cave on a near impossible to reach island that maybe two other living people knew of and both were muggles. And the cup was placed in a heavily secure vault.

  Twice in a row he got the better of Harry and Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

He temporarily got the better of a teenager and an adult who is also frequently handed the idiot ball over the course of the series. To me that doesn't look like a good measure of intelligence for an alleged genius villain, especially since in both of those cases the plans partially failed as a result of easily predictable reactions by the enemy.

In book 4, I doubt that having Harry go through the entire Triwizard and win was the only way to arrange a kidnapping. Grandstanding in a way that allows the enemy to escape is just plain foolish.

In book 5 it's predictable that Harry might attempt to bring help in unknown quantity. It would be intelligent to lure him to a less precarious location to deal with any of Harry's potential reinforcements before then dragging him to the DoM.

As for hiding the horcruxes and the protective countermeasures: It would have been intelligent to not take the risk of /anyone/ knowing. The entire point of hiding them is to account for the eventuality of an enemy trying to track them down. Thus, it's foolish to leave any kind of bread trail when it would be simple to choose a spot known by no one.

The curse on the ring was fine, but hiding it in the Gaunt shack was dumb. The hiding place for the Diadem was equally stupid. As evidenced by the amount of junk in the room, people at Hogwarts occasionally wander through there to find or deposit items. Thus, there's a non-zero chance of random people finding the diadem or even deciding to take it because they recognize what it is.

I agree that Dumbledore and Harry deserve credit because they did the legwork to learn what they could, but it's predictable that any intelligent opponent would try to learn more about an enemy in order to defeat him. It's dumb for a villain to not account for that when making critical plans.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** *How to take over Wizarding Britain as a right wing extremist/ pureblood supremacist powerful wizard?*

*(Trigger Warning -- Discussion about dark ideas and far right totalitarianism -- Fascism is always wrong!)*

Learn from historic examples (for example 1933 Germany)

Build Alliances with old pureblood families and important conservative/reactionary Wizengamot members. Many conservative witches and wizards are probably uncomfortable with the modernization of wizarding society (more rights for muggleborns and magical creatures), use their concerns, and tell them, that you share them. Get their funding for your political projects.

Get Allies in the Ministry and the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Avoid persecution by the Auror Office for Dark Magic.

Ask the Malfoys for funding, to gain a Wizengamot seat yourself or for your allies. Use money to influence the Daily Prophet and Wizarding Wireless News. Use them to slowly archieve “Cultural Hegemony ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony]] → a theory of Antonio Gramsci). Slowly normalize terms like “mudbloods” while proclaiming, that you are just defending “wizarding traditions”.

Tell them, that your opponents will establish a tyranny which forbids house elf ownership.

Slowly argue against restrictions for Dark Magic; proclaim that this is an arguably often misused but still traditional form of Magic.

Promote conspiracy theories against Goblins and Centaurs. Centaurs as creatures who have unjustified influence over the future with their prophecies. Use antisemitic stereotypes and propaganda against the Goblins. Proclaim that Wizards should control their own money and their own banking.

Tell rich wizards, that they should become independent from Goblin banking, tell poor wizards, that their poverty is caused by Goblin banking.

Fear is central to Wizarding Society. Basically fear, that the Statute of Secrecy collapses. Use that. Start a propaganda crusade, that you and your allies are just young concerned witches and wizards.

Use your armed group/ death eaters to intimidate opponents. But don't start an civil war if you are too weak. Show that you are powerful, but avoid unnecessary cruelty. But already prepare a list of opponents in case you take over the Ministry. Specialize a little bit in mind magic, legimilency and the Imperius Curse. Use violence when it is useful for your purpose, avoid violence if it harms your popularity.

Maybe use your supporters to start some charity projects to increase popularity.

Use these methods to build up your power base. If you control large parts of the Wizengamot or archieved popularity among the wizarding population, start to act.

Your allies should try to dismiss the current minister of magic. Try to replace him with either yourself or an puppet. If this fails, use your faction in the Wizengamot to blockade the Ministry.

Propose a Ministry of Compromise, or a Coalition Government. With your puppets in the more important positions, but open some positions to different factions. Say, that this government of National Unity will try to reestablish order, compromise and peace.

If you fail in the Wizengamot, try to start mass protests against the corrupted Ministry. Say that the people want your leadership.

If you fail, establish a guerilla/terrorist movement. A wizarding terrorist/guerilla group is able to start a long campaign of terror and guerillia warfare. Still it is easier to overtake the Ministry by political campaign compared to guerilla warfare.

If you gain the Ministry and managed to control the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Auror Office start the establishment of your authoritarian regime.

Use your prepared list, imprison or kill all opponents listed there. Avoid any contact with the Muggle government. Then transform magical society into your magical empire.

This strategy is utterly evil and immoral. Compared to Canon, this method has a higher chance of success.

*** Kudos on the thorough breakdown. I like the obvious parallels to the growth of the Nazi party. Now I wonder what the reaction would be of an average magical citizen after Voldemort's version of the 'Night of the Long Knives'. Would the evidence be better concealed with the use of magic such that no one would even know? I imagine it would be terrifying to live in such times.

**** It would be difficult to conceal the killing/imprisonment of a large number of opponents. And it isn't necessary to conceal, that you are imprisoning and persecuting political opponents. Just conceal the more brutal aspects of it. The population should realize, that there are consequences for defying and acting against the new regime.

Concealing all the crimes of the regime would require an enormous amount of mind magic without helping the regime in archiving their goals. If the regime imprisons or kills more than just a few individuals, people from all parts of wizarding society are now missing.

Different people would react differently. Some (especially bigoted people) would support Voldemort for restoring and rescuing "traditional wizarding society". Others would be horrified for the replacement of democracy by a pureblood supremacist regime.

Purebloods would react differently than Half-Bloods or Muggleborn.

Some people would join/establish resistance groups. Some people would try some forms of passive resistance. But the silent majority would be to terrified to act against Voldemort or would give Voldemort a chance. Some people would retreat to their personal space, their families and friends and become apolitical. Others would join the new regime to gain power or wealth. Others would flee the country.

​

(A magical guerilla or refugee group could remain hidden for an almost indefinite time. Just get a magical tent and some basic supplies. From time to time, you need to get some food from muggle stores, else you can avoid any contact with wizarding society and remain hidden for a really long time.)

** I feel like linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels are exploring this convincingly, with Riddle as a cunning (and more than a little dangerous) politician, but not full-blown insane Dark Lord. Essentially if I remember correctly after killing Myrtle to make his first horcrux he felt remorse (?) and realised what he was doing was wrong, so didn't go further down the horcrux path. He's definitely still a formidable antagonist, but more due to his intelligence and morals as a politician rather than being an evil Voldemort figure.

** Okay, there is a lot to unpack here so I will break it down.

First, and I say this not as an insult, what do you think sanity is? Sanity not a quantified phenomenon in people - basically its a measure of how 'normal and rational' a person behaves, as defined by the times. In other words, someone who is insane is someone who is disconnected from reality or unable to reasonably interpret or act on information. You could make a faaaar better case about Xenophilius Lovegood's sanity than Voldemort.

Voldemort was never insane. That isn't to say he was normal, just that he wasn't irrational as humans think of it. He was a narcissist, his every action was motivated by how to help and benefit /himself/. He was a sociopath who did not feel any moral compunctions about this or that action. He /may/ have been a psychopath, given his various personality traits. But what were his goals/reasonings? He didn't want to die - so he made horcruxes and did everything to make himself unkillable. He wanted to be venerated and seen as amazing - so he became amazing with magic and pushed all sorts of propaganda about himself and his history. He wanted to remove any opposition - so he killed off his competition. The problem is that these are rational behaviors, just immoral ones. Voldemort is completely grounded in reality, thats arguably the whole point of horcruxes (keep you alive in the here and now). He lacks the moral compunctions that compel others (or inhibit depending on your perspective) from acting on such goals, and he has the power and intelligence to make them work. And its not like he doesn't understand how morals and values make other people act, he successfully uses them against his enemies on multiple occasions (Harry and DoM fiasco, rule Britain through the shadows to instill fear, Harry lured into the forest, etc.).

The commonly used phrase "power corrupts" is kind of a misnomer I think. A more accurate summation of people with power would be "when you have the power to do what you want to do, you do what you always wanted to do." Voldemort didn't slowly go insane as he made horcruxes, he just did what he always wanted to do since he was a kid. Dumbledore explicitly states Voldemort's intellect and skills were unchanged from making the horcruxes and would remain so when they were destroyed. Moreover, we see through Harry that he is quite capable of reasoning through events and actions, merely unable to understand certain actions because he himself felt no empathy.

TLDR: Voldemort was not insane, he was a narcissistic sociopath with incredible intelligence and skill but no empathy or moral compunctions. Horcruxes don't affect your mind and behavior.

** I mean the short answer is yes

The long answer is what did Voldemort want beyond killing muggles and muggle borns and "half breeds"? Voldemort is often compared to Hitler and the Nazis. But the Nazis have this ideaology beyond who they like and who they hate. So you can see how and why they were able to do what they did while examining the political situation of the time.

In the case of Voldemort you dont have the context you can create a situation that doesnt conflict with canon where a sane Voldy would win. So in that sense yes he could theoretically take over. But you lack the context to say if that could be realistically pulled off given the situation.
