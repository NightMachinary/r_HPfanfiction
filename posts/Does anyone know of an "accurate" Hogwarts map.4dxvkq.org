I am working on a new fic and realized I don't know the "true" mapping of Hogwarts (I feel so ashamed). I have been looking but I'm not really sure what is close. Does anyone know of a good, comprehensive map to use? Is there an official one I am missing? Thanks loads!


** I'm not aware of a "true" map of Hogwarts, but [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/castle.htm][here is]] a pretty well-known, extremely detailed analysis of everything we know and do not know about Hogwarts, including possible locations and orientations based on references to time of day/season/angle of the sun in canon.

It's honestly pretty overwhelming, but at the very bottom of the page is a map which tries to reconcile where rooms could/should be in relation to each other, /if all canon references are treated as factual./

*** Mmm, I have enjoyed reading that several times. However, I do have two issues with it:

Firstly, as you alluded to, sometimes it takes figurative language or visual metaphors as literal descriptions.

Secondly, it's tough to reconcile the map with the events at the end of PoA. Here's the problem: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Lupin and rat!Wormtail are on their way back to Hogwarts from the Whomping Willow. On their way back to the castle they pass by the shore of the lake. On top of this, time travelling Harry and Hermione start out at Hagrid's hut, pass through the forbidden forest, and end up at the same part of the lake, /only on the opposite shore/.

Trying to account for all of that is very difficult, and the linked map doesn't. I've found that the only real way to make it work is to have a pretty irregular shaped lake.

This is my own attempt:

** AFAIK, there is no such thing as an accurate map of Hogwarts because it is never provided in canon. Only landmarks and specific areas are mentioned in the books. JKR did a rough hand drawing and [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/atlas/hogwarts/atlas-h.html][there are other maps on this site]].

If you just do a Google search for "Hogwarts map," there are many beautiful renditions out there.

*** Yeah, I figured that, but I was hoping there was something to help me with general orientation but it is good to know that it is set up to let you fake it!

** Like others have said, there's not any "true" map. Having said that - weirdly, I've found the HPCoS PC game to have the representation of Hogwarts most true to my imagination and close to the movies/books. The outside is necessarily lacking but the inside has a lot of things including the moving staircases, Hospital Wing, various classrooms including DADA, Myrtle's bathroom and quite decent approximations of the Slytherin common room and so on. It draws on the films, necessarily, and there's the to-be-expected "and here is the room where students with enough XP can unlock a specially challenge", but I'm mentioning it because you can walk around it and explore pretty freely and as a result I now feel like I know my way around a great deal of Hogwarts.

Might not be what you're looking for. I always appreciate an opportunity to talk about that game either way.

** I played the xbox games and thought they were pretty good representations of what I imagine hogwarts would look like. The Lego ones were cool too, one of them had hogsmeade

** [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/atlas/hogwarts/atlas-h.html][The Lexicon]] has a collection of maps of Hogwarts - the entire campus and the castle itself, with specific book references to explain why the put things in certain places.
