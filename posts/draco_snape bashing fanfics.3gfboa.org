anyone here know any fanfictions that bash draco and snape, i don't like the characters as they are just awful bullies and people, extra points if no one else is bashed in the fanfictions but those two


** I don't personally read anything with bashing because it's the surest sign of a horrible story written by a man-child author for man-child readers, so I have no recs for you. That being said, Robst seems to be the type of author that would bash. I might be wrong about that, though, I've never fully read any of his works. Beyond him, you could probably just google search Draco or Snape bashing and find a lot of fics with it.

On second thought, Partially Kissed Hero probably features bashing of Draco and I'm pretty sure it has Snape bashing. Again, though, I've only read a few chapters, so I can't be sure.

** I think your view of Snape and Draco is quite shallow. However, there are literally thousands of fics that do exactly what you want - most average, terrible, and badly written. You might want to start with something like linkffn(Harry Crow), look at more of Robst, or go on Scryer and search for Snape and Draco bashing.

** I had to quit the Harry McGonagall series because the Snape and Dumbledore bashing was too much for me to handle, but maybe you'll like it!

** ...Why am I here when Snape is my favorite character?

And I don't care for Malfoy, but I'm not into bashing.

** I had a mental image of Hagrid litterally bashing Snape with Draco as the weapon of choice.
