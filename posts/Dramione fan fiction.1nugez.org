Hey. It's been a while since I've read fan fiction and I'm looking for something to re-kickstart my relationship with it. I remember what first got me hooked onto fan fiction was "The Unseemly Proposal" by sparx and am a huge Dramione fan, so I was looking if any of you could direct me to some really good Dramione fics.

Here are some that I liked. "Journey on Water", "Isolation", "Parenting Class", "Hermione Malfoy", "Eight and Eighth", "Bus Stop".

I also love Sirius Black/OC like "The Ones Left Behind", so if you have any suggestions in that genre, I'd love to hear them. :)


** -we learned the sea

-heavy lies the crown

-redemption (anondracomalfoy)

i'm in a bit of a dramione rut, they are my otp but i'm just kind of eh right now, maybe i just need a new story

*** "We Learned the Sea" and "Heavy Lies the Crown" are two of my absolute, reread favorites for Dramione! I have also gotten into "Cruel and Beautiful," which is almost completed... I think there are just a few chapters left! Enjoy!

*** I can agree so much on A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy. I think that was my first Dramione fic I read.

*** I'm glad you have a favorite author but personally I find her work a bit dull. Her characterization are just not believable or maybe it's just me. Thank you for the recs though!

** "Parade of the Sun" by Sage/everythursday - Hermione and Draco both go after an extremely potent, magical, mythical plant. He, in an attempt to restore his family to prominent status, she in attempt to prevent what she believes will be a resurrection of the war. They are competing with each other but they end up gradually having to rely on each other for survival.

It's better than God of the Lost and is finished. What I enjoyed most out of it is that I found both characters completely plausible based on canon minus that "10 years later" crap. And they kind of evolve naturally throughout the story.

** Here's a link to my fanfiction profile:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/595458/CherryWolf-chan]]

I, for the most part only do one-shots, but you can go nuts on my favourite authors list. 95% of them are for Dramione.

Sigh. Oh Draco. <3
