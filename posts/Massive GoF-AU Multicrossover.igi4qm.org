The Triwizard Tournament should have just been something between the three schools, but due to the interest of many wizards and witches in the ICW it became something new- The World Global Cup. Many different schools apply for the glory of being the first to win this (And for the Galleon Prize of 50.000).

Dumbledore will realize that Magic was never stagnant and that there are some strong Magic Users, much stronger than him in his Prime hundred years ago.

And, surprisingly, many Dark-Core Wizards show an unhealthy interest in the scar from Harry Potter without knowing the legend.

//Basically an AU with NGE, Magi, KHR, Bleach, D. Gray-Man, Assassination Classroom and what you want to add. I so hope someone can write this, because such a Monster-Xover is too much for me.
