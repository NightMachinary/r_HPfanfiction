Are there any fics where HP is accepted as an honorary house-elf? Either just socially or maybe getting access to their magic?

I had a thought of some house-elf goddess (maybe Estanna if D&D pantheon) who sees HP working hard at housework to try to get love or approval from the Dursleys, and the goddess gives the approval and acceptance since the Dursleys never will.

HP might even assume he is supposed to work and sleep with the castle elves rather than the normal student routine.


** There's Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them linkffn(8197451), wherein Harry decides he's an elf -- not a house elf, but a forest elf -- when the Dursleys abandon him in the woods as a child. The sequel is The Handbook of Elf Psychology linkffn(8509020).

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

*** I think I read the first one, up to when they drag him back in. Until then it was a nice boy-runs-away and lives story. It hit me hard when they caught him.

*** I'd read that, it was a fun fic.

But I was looking for a more drudgery and broken-spirit sort of thing, or maybe him thinking he wasn't a proper human and just fit for a house-elf.

*** I tried reading this. I slogged through as far as the mention of Acromantula venom and just could not go any further. I consider my effort heroic.

Was this a joke recommendation?

You've pretty much cemented my conviction to never read anything with WBWL in the title or description.

(going to curl up and weep for a while)

  A new take on the standard Harry as the twin of the BWL, minus a load of dross.

It is fun the first time around! I don't think it lends well to a reread though.
