Hey guys, I wanna write an AU of Harry Potter where "half breeds" and "magical inheritances" are more common in the wizarding world. By magical inheritance, I mean special skills that some wizards and witches may develop during puberty, like being a Seer, or having a natural skill in fire manipulation and so on.

For the Half Breed bit, I want to expand on the Hogwarts Student Population by adding magical beings and hybrids. In my story Ripple Effect, currently in the midst of a rewrite, many students had magical creature blood in them. The half brother of Luna Lovegood was for example Half Water Nymph, as Luna's father fell in love with a Water Nymph and married her, which is actually accepted in RE's world. Because of this hybridization, Luna's brother Oswald could shift between a fully human form using a specialized illusion spell, and a hybrid form that is described as thus:

"So, you're a hybrid?" asked Frank. Oswald nodded, and his skin turned an oily blue and his eyes became solid grey. His ears melted into his neck and became gills, and when he opened his mouth, it was revealed his teeth had sharpened. Only his hair and nose remained the same, as well as his hands, though his fingernails did sharpen and webbing appeared between them.

^ For clarification, normal Water Nymphs have black eyes, not grey. Oswald's is grey because he is blind. This disability is caused by a complication during his birth, and his constant changing between human and hybrid prevents him from getting his eyes fixed through magical means.

Anyway, the reason for this post is this: What magical beings/creatures can you think of that can be paired up with a human to make an interesting hybrid character. And I don't mean something like a Hippogryth and human, I mean humanoid magical creatures/beings.


** Veela, Lamia, Harpies, Minotaur, Mermen, Nymphs (as seen), Sphinx, Centaur, Satyr, Ogre, Trolls, Giants, Djinn, Wendigo, Oni (stand-in for the entire spirits population of east asia that I'm only marginally aquainted with), Banshees, Gorgons, Gnomes, Elfs, Hags, Krampus, Imps, Succubi, Sylphs,...

And so, so, so much more.

One thing I'd like to comment on is the "Transformation" of Oswald in your example. I feel like if you write such an AU, why not let them run around in all their oily-blue skinned, grey eyed hybrid glory? Why use an illusion spell if its an accepted outcome of inter-species love in the society you describe?

*** Because Muggles. Oswald had just got on the train to Hogwarts, and would probably go about in his hybrid form more often at Hogwarts.

**** Aah. ok that makes a lot more sense.

I just thought you'd fall into the same "they're hybrids, but I'll make it so they all look perfectly human" thing so many creature fics have going.

But yea, gotta mask that blue skin from the muggles.

*** Oni are demons though. Ogre-like creatures, more often than not, and it encompass all manner of devils, trolls, demons and ogres. Humanoid, yes, but it's a somewhat specific kind.

The term you are referring to is "Y≈çkai" or "ayakashi".

For OP, here's a few that you might find interesting to include:

- Gashadokuro : the spirit of the unburied dead and appears as a giant skeleton\\
- Joroogumo : a spider-woman\\
- Kitsune: Fox spirits who can sometime take the form of a human\\
- Mujina : A shape-shifting badger
- Mu-Onna: The Nothing Woman, could be interesting as a villain. A vengeful spirit of a mother who lost her child to famine, war, disease. Can protect children in danger, but also try to merge or absorb them by putting the child's soul to sleep.\\
- Nukekubi: Human-like monster whose head detach from its body (usually vicious)\\
- Nure-onna: Female snake-like monster.\\
- Onmyoji: humans who have yokai's power\\
- Raijin: god of thunder if you want to get into this\\
- Rokurokubi: a person whose neck can stretch infinitely\\
- Samebito: a shark-man\\
- Sazae-oni: a snail that turns into a woman\\
- Taka-onna: woman, or female monster, that can stretch its waist.\\
- Tamamo-no-Mae: Nine-tailed fox that can take the appearance of a courtesan\\
- Tanuki: Shape-shifting raccoon dog\\
- Tengu: Bird-like demon (usually humanoid with the beak and wings or the head of a bird) Other times it can be kite beings with the ability of turning into humans. Have long nose.\\
- Ushi-onna: woman with a cow-head\\
- Yuki-Onna: snow woman\\

You could also go with the possessed roll of cotton or the kicking horse leg. Those are hilarious.

** I think you should have the hybrids look almost entirely like humans but have certain traits of the other beings. Fleur, Hagrid and professor Flitwick look almost entirely human but physacly only seem to differ in size and beauty from regular humans. Otherwise Hagrid and Fleur at least seem to have some of the beings magic.

Hybrids should be possible with Dwarves, Trolls, Giants, Veela, Hags, Leprechauns, Goblins, House-Elves, Centaurs, Vampires( Part-vampires are canon so vampires seem to be a class of beings instead of a curse/virus like werewolfs), Ogres, Merpeople, Sphinx( I know you said humanoid but they have human faces and are sentient ), Ghouls( in Harry Potter they dont seem to be undead only simple minded and ugly) and if you want it could be possible with a Boggart if it turns humanoid ( maybe you could add a darker backstory about a woman being raped and impregnated by a boggart for that was her greatest fear)

** Well, I know that you are not interested in this but still: What about a Dragon/Wizard hybrid? It's as much possible as Hagrid (Giant and Human). You can always look at Shyvanna from League of Legends for more details

Nevertheless, this idea could still work, if you had dragon's blood or other whatsits (apparently the ancient Chinese believed that jade was the semen of a celestial dragon?), you could do some fancy schmancy ritual to make half-dragons or lizardfolk or the like.

*** dragons are unintelligent beasts in harry potter, Giants are merely a little less inteligent and have a diffrent culture. You cant really compare the two. Falling in love and forming a relationship with a giant is possible because they are sentient and can consent. Having sex with a Dragon would be besteality and rape because the dragon cant consent. Dragon also lay eggs, while Giants are mammals.

**** And yet Hagrid successfully bred a Manticore (multi-mammal mix) with a Fire Crab (looks like a bejeweled tortoise- very much not a mammal) in his spare time using a broken wand. All interbreeds are possible.

Consent and/or emotional attachment aren't a requirement for procreation. Just as they aren't in real life, more's the pity.

***** It is pretty easy to imagine some crazy pure bloods like the Gaunts trying to interbreed with snakes or dragons or something. If only for the increase to magical power.

******* Its not specifically stated, but Newt clearly writes about an animal in his book. Maybe an animal of orca, or dolphin like intelligence, but still an animal that is nowhere close to human thought.

Dragons in the HP fandom simply aren't Smaug.
