Well, I am looking for a specific fic (but would also appreciate others if the type). I remember only the first scene. After the war, Harry's in his home (maybe it was Grimmauld), getting drunk, and Fate or Fawkes, or something sends him to an AU...

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
