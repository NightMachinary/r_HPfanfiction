Please see the title. :) I have a fanfiction idea that I would like to know if it is good or not! It is about Hedwig being an animagus, a survivor from the first war with Voldemort who did go into hiding as an owl who ended up in diagon alley as a pet at some point, and then she yes became Harry's owl, and that is why she loves bacon and blinks and is so very smart even for I think a magic pet! :) And so what if she was an animagus the whole time and protecting harry potter because she fought in the last war? Yes she would be an original character and not Lily or anyone anybody knew from the canon Order. In my idea I want her to reveal herself to harry at the start of the seventh book, and she survives seven potters plan and they go horcrux hunting alone together because harry has always had hedwig and she knows everything.


** Why would she stay an owl the entire time? The war was won, even if Voldemort was still lurking somewhere (not sure how known Dumbledore's opinion was) it would be safer and easier to get a plane ticket to Prague or Rejkavik then posing as an animal.

The only reason why Pettigrew stayed as a rat was the simple fact that he did not think of traveling to Montana and making a new life there. Why would anyone else, who is not a war criminal that murdered at least a dozen people do that?

The worst part, however, is the idea of living through six books without revealing herself, especially since Harry could have used someone after the graveyard or the DoM.

The only way you could make this plot work is if "Hedwig" ended up on the wrong side of the war against her will ("help us or die"), was, therefore, wanted while looking for redemption and found Harry earlier. So we have involuntary Death Eater goon watching over Harry and teaching him about magic before Hogwarts. Harry ends up in either Ravenclaw (learn as much as you can to survive) or Hufflepuff (it is safer to be underestimated).

If you are looking to write a Harry/background character Horcrux hunt then there are far easier ways that do not require lots of alcohol to be believable on the reader's side. Tonks or Fleur ditiching their soon to be husbands, crossovers with another universe, Harry getting together with Cho and taking her on the hunt or even Harry's neighbor having served with the Mossad (still more realistic than hiding as an owl for 17 years).

*** Thank you for your opinion. :) Yes it is very helpful and good! You are a very smart person! :)

I will not write animagus Hedwig idea then, since you think it sounds very unbelievable to write.

**** I am not saying it is impossible, I am saying that your plot outline is unbelievable. There are ways it could work but it would require a pre-Hogwart's reveal or a massive AU.

** I am not a writer, at least certainly not a fanfiction writer, but I can give you my point of view as a reader (and I love reading Harry Potter fanfics).

Sure, your idea seems farfetched. But shouldn't you start writing first? I think that's the best way of exploring an idea and clearing your head. You've already got a few good workarounds for your idea on this thread. Why not start with them?

Also, was Hedwig really present with Harry all the time? In Hogwarts, at least, she was at the owlery, so nobody knew what she was doing during those periods. Even when Harry was back from school, he would regularly let her out. So, the argument that it's impossible to believe that she was an owl the entire time could be broken down there.

Plus, give your character a solid backstory and you'll have a good story on your hands. How about something similar to when Sirius was on the run and still tried to meet Harry in his animagus form as an explanation for why Hedwig doesn't (initially at least) reveal herself to anyone - she might be wrongly accused of some crime but at the same time she cares deeply and tries to protect Harry.

I don't know. Contrary to what others on this thread feel, I believe your idea has potential. And compared to the crazy twisting of original characters and original plotlines that is common in the fanfiction universe (even in an official work like the cursed child), I'm pretty sure your idea isn't that hard to believe.

Also, what actually drew me to your idea was the chance of Hedwig being actually Lily. I've always felt that the mother-son relationship of Lily and Harry has been grossly under-represented in both the original series and the world of fanfiction, other than Lily's protective force over Harry. I've found the deaths of parental characters like James, Lily and Sirius hard to digest, and I am thus always game for a fic where they return.

Best of luck! And count me in as at least one reader

** I'm very taken with the idea of a traditional fairy tale where Hedwig is a princess enchanted into the form of an owl by a wicked fairy, and does everything in her power to save Harry, ultimately making the ultimate sacrifice for him. It wouldn't make more than a one-shot though and I'd be surprised if it hasn't been done already.

But OP, write the story you want to tell. If you try and write to please others you'll be doomed to failure because people don't like the same things. I mean, I know here on Reddit you'd be forgiven for thinking that they do, but this is a particular microcosm of the wider fandom and genuinely is not typical.

** This is definitely a thing I'd read. Maybe she stays an animagus because in that war she lost everything and has nothing home to. Maybe she stays animagus because she doesn't believe that Voldemort is truly defeated. Maybe she's grown so used to the animal body that she doesn't like the human body. Maybe it's a combination. Definitely something I'd read.

** You'd need a damn good reason for her to remain an Animagus throughout the years. Using some curse that stopped her transformation would be a bit cheap, and you would need to explain why Hedwig didn't try to communicate that she was a person.

** It's possible... but you'd need to delve pretty deeply into her mindset in order to justify it. She could be like Pettigrew, in that she got complacent in her role as a pet, and simply didn't feel any need to summon up the will to become human again until danger struck. Perhaps her life was worse as a person than as an owl. Perhaps she lost herself to her owl instincts and became semi-feral.

I would say it's worth writing if you think it is worth working out. Good luck!

** I'm not sure if you're aware, but this has already been done to an extent in this story: linkffn(more than familiar)

I've seen a couple more with similar plotlines, but this is the only one I remember off the top of my head. That being said, please don't let its existence dissuade you from attempting your own take on it!

  While searching the Black Library for something to destroy Riddle, Harry is led by his oldest, dearest friend to an ancient tome. After reading it, their lives are further linked and forever changed. Very unusual pairing.

** I think it would be good if you can find a reason they wouldn't show themselves to Harry. Like others have said, maybe she is a criminal or something, so she only reveals later on when she trusts Harry, or maybe she is forced by something (Harry in danger from something non canon maybe). I think that 7th year isn't really early enough to make an exciting story though. Like, all they'd do is just destroy the horcruxes and then go kill Voldemort. I would say to think about how she would change the plot if she was revealed at different times eg. before Pettigrew escapes would let her catch him so he wouldn't escape, forcing Voldemort to do something else to come back (maybe recruit Dark wizards from other countries Accidental Animagus style?) or OotP when the Dementor attacks, avoid the whole ministry hearing (because she casts the patronus and obviously she is above 17 yrs old)and replace it with some other plot.

Oh yea I'm not an author so take what I've said here with a grain of salt. This is just what I'd want to read.

***** I know where you're coming from; ideas, after all, are plentiful and easy, But I don't think it's altogether fair to say any idea is worthless - it just isn't worth much on its own. A great idea can be ruined by poor execution and the reverse is just as true. I mean, who would want to read about an orphan boy who discovers he's a wizard and goes off to a secret school of magic?
