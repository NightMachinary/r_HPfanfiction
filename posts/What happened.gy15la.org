I absolutely love pureblood custom Fics and ellory is my favourite writer. But for some reason I can't find their tumblr page elloryia the halo is a lie. Can anyone help me find it again? Or find out what happened to all the Fics on there?


** I'm a huge fan of her universe as well. A ton of her stories are under Ellory on Fanfiction.net. Despite the pairings, none are slash either (if that's not your thing) she just genderbends. On a side note my favorites are the ones with Harry/fem!Draco and Harry/Astoria. Enjoy! P.S. if you know of any other writers who use her universe (or a similar one) let me know. :)
