I read a lot of stories in which witches from different houses always think that harry is poor because he wears second handed clothes.

Where did this come from? I am pretty sure he only wear dursley clothes on vacation and would just wear normal clothes like all the rest of the students when he is in hogwards


** Well, he still has to wear his trousers and trainers and shirts and whatnot underneath the robes, right? Of course, you'd see that they're not exactly high quality or fitting.

*** Pretty sure he would buy those too, i mean he has no reason not too. In movies he has normal clothes and no one make a mention of it in the books either i think

*** Muggle fashion ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Honestly, it's an exaggerated cliché, like to the so called abuse.

** Relatedly, what do all the wizard-raised kids wear other than robes (if anything)? It can't be Muggle-style casual wear like we see in the movies, since we know many/most wizards and witches can't dress convincingly Muggle. Molly Weasley knits jumpers for her kids, so those are apparently normal enough among magicals.

It's probably just another case of "JKR didn't think of that", but it's low-key bugged me for years.

*** I think they just wear robes & cloaks like mages in rpgs. Kinda like what Snape and Mcgonagall wear in the movies?

*** I don't think it's ever really described in canon. The only tidbit I can think of offhand that gives us a hint is Archie or whatever his name is at the World Cup who insists on wearing the sundress for the healthy breeze around his junk. To me, that implies similar sort of wear (e.g. robes with nothing underneath) is pretty standard for at least a certain subset of wizards.

EDIT: Also Snape's memory shows him getting flipped upside down so his underwear is exposed, again suggesting little-to-nothing underneath as the standard.

EDIT 2: Also also I can't remember if boys and girls changing into their robes on the train separately is canon or fanon, but if it's the former then that's another point in the "nothing much underneath" column -- if the robes just go over normal clothes, then there's no need for privacy at all.

** i can imagine harry just wearing what he was given from the durselys and then just throwing his black robes over it at school. he never seems to have much care for how he looks. the clothes were big but not actual rags. it's possibly he's repairing and transfiguring the same clothes he's always had. he may have been given some of rons old clothes; with no younger brothers to need them. maybe there was some still at grimauld, i can see sirius going through everything to find him some. or harry wearing sirius old muggle stuff later on. bill and fleur might have replaced what he lost in those last few weeks at shell cottage.

reading fanfiction should explain why there's no shopping scenes. they're the worst.

** It is never mentioned in the books, that he would buy a normal clothes, but I have always understood that not later than when Harry spent those couple of weeks (days?) in the Diagon Alley before the beginning of his third year he would buy some proper clothes for himself. However, without this silent understanding, he was still wearing cast-offs from Dudley when not being in his school uniform. Yes, it is silly (and it makes him silly), but many fanfic authors wanted to emphasize his abused situation but keeping his in his oversized clothes.

*** I know it is done to emphasize his abuse, but nearly all fanfiction with this problem always mention how rich he really is. And no one ever explains why he is still wearing those clothes when he knows he is rich and it just bugs me.

**** Actually, a lot of fics claim that he didn't buy decent Muggle wear because he wouldn't be able to wear it during the summers without it being a source of trouble with the Dursleys. Many have him worried that if they knew he had money of his own that they'd try and take it for themselves, though the odds of Muggles being allowed to claim a wizard's money seem fairly remote even if Vernon and/or Petunia could bring themselves to mingle with "freaks" long enough to visit Gringotts.

***** That still doesn't make sense, just wear the clothes from september unto juli and trow them away if he can't store them anywhere nor give them to his friends for safe keeping. It just doesn't make sense to me. he is growing boy anyway so he can't wear them more than a year anywY

****** You expect an abused eleven year old kid to have logic and reason? If he was abused to the point of being afraid to wear clothes, as those fics make him out to be, the thought probably wouldn't occur to him he would be too afraid.

******* In the fics i read he is fifth or six years, complete normal behavior but still wears those clothes. So yeah i expect him to use logic and reason since he survived 5 years of hogwards

****** Because they could search his trunk.

And abused people rarely have logic when confronted by their abusers.
