Hi everyone, I'm normally pretty good at finding fics but I can't find this one for the life of me and it's been bugging me for days.

From what I remember Harry ends up in the graveyard but stalls until Dumbledore, Sirius and I think McG and Flitwick arrive. They duel the DEs and win but Harry dives in front of a killing curse meant for Sirius.

Meanwhile people are wondering what's up in the stands around the maze and Fleur is worrying like mad. Ron and Hermione pull her aside and Ron says sonething like "Don't worry Fleur. Harry is invincible. Let me tell you about this one time with a troll..."

Sirius brings back Harry's corpse while he's chatting with his ethereal parents and everyone thinks he's dead. They all go to the Hospital wing, as is habit for the end of a year, and shove HP's corpse in another room. Fleur goes to see him and cries on his corpse.

Harry returns to thd land of the living, kisses Fleur, and then heads to the hospital wing. He sees Hagrid on thd way who says something like "Hi Harry, everyone said you were dead." When Harry gets to the Hospital wing I think Remus is the first to see him and then they all hug and then the trio hug and everyone is happy. I think some more happens after that but I can't be sure.

I hope you guys can see why I'm frustrated. This should be an easy find but I just can't see it anywhere. Thanks, Ch1pp

*** I skimmed the first chapter of that, and OP's description seems familiar... Is that the one where he gets on to the whole-school quidditch team and there's a Slytherin beater who features prominently - Bole, I think?

**** Titus Button actually, and no he doesn't really feature prominently in this one, for that you're probably thinking of linkffn(6535391)

***** Ah, that one's description DOES seem more familiar.

Thanks for getting back to me, I was going slightly crazy trying to work out if they were the same or if I'd combined two stories or something
