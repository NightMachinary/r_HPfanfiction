An in-progress HP/Avengers crossover. I enjoyed what is there. If you liked the shezza88's Denarian series, I think you'll like this one.

*** Well, as they say, practice makes perfect. And if that gives me more to read, who am I to complain?

Otherwise, I think you have to watch out on making Harry too strong. Maybe show areas where he is relatively week. Maybe potions and transfiguration? Maybe have Moody's eye see through all of Harry's illusions.

Also, I hope you show how Voldemort (or his agent) got ahold of pre-Loki blood to bind Harry into the tournament.

**** Yeah. I'm trying to make him not too strong, but also not to weak to not stand a chance against the opponents he shall face in the future. There are, of course, some areas he is weak in, and I will try and get them across in the future.

I plan on revealing the blood thing, though it will probably be via someone guessing how he did it. Thanks for your feedback.

*** So far it has been quite interesting. Love the sarcastic Harry approach. Quite well done. Thank you and looking forward to more updates.

#+begin_quote
  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** I'm about halfway through the second chapter, and I don't think I can continue.

The concept of "power levels" and "recharging his power" is just too much for me to handle. There's also quite a bit of telling instead of showing.

If I had to rate it, I'd give it 2 stars out of 5.

*** I completely agree, to be honest. Looking back, there's a hell of a lot I would change.

If it helps, the "power levels" only apply to Asgardian and Jotun magic rather than HP magic, which Harry uses the large majority of the time, so it rarely comes up.

I'm not sure whether I ever improved at the "show don't tell." Probably, but not very much.

There are also quite a few random and "convenient" plot points which I feel detract from the story and make it pretty bad.

Anyway, thanks for your feedback.

And no, I wasn't stalking this thread every hour. I just randomly searched for it to see if anyone had commented.
