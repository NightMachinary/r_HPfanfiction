I was dwelling on a handful of fics I've read before where the oh-so-heroic protagonists force Unbreakable Vows on people, and I was wondering, are there any fics where that fails outright?

Either subtly, with the unwilling Vow-ee revealing such and turning the tables at a later date, or explosively at the point of bonding, or what?

Maybe if there aren't any, I should write a short snippet to highlight the possibility...


** I don't recall any. In canon, Snape was likely under duress, so canonically, they are unbreakable.

A problem with your idea is that if an Unbreakable Oath taken under duress were breakable, people should know that, and your protagonists wouldn't expect their plan to work, and hence wouldn't force others into such vows.

(It's one reason I don't like such vows - if they work as in canon, people would use them all the time, especially if the alternative were death, and the world and the canon plot would look very different. Add to that that the Vow didn't really add anything to the canon plot, and they could be ignored with little problem-)

*** Yes, but what if it weren't well known that Unbreakable Vows under duress were breakable? People might feel the ~twang!~ of the Vow's power shattering, but it might take recently-developed diagnostic magic to determine that it's gone, and in the meantime, people are hardly likely to go "Huh, I wonder if this will still kill me?".

You could have that as part of the plot; someone who was forced into a Vow complains about it, asks a curse-breaker or such to look at them and see if they can find a way to get rid of it, they find that the Vow's dormant killing magic has somehow been crippled.

Besides, even if they do work and are genuinely Unbreakable, there's still plenty of reason why they might not be used.

It being magic with the express purpose of killing non-adherents would put it on a similar level to the Unforgivable Curses or at least classify it as Dark Arts. Poor wording of it might trigger it to kill the Vow-ee by accident, which I saw in a short parody once.

Or the reverse, the Vow-ee could easily flout the spirit of the Vow. "No, officer, I don't know what an Unbreakable Vow is, I certainly couldn't be acting under one. I suppose I could be under the influence of one forbidding me to speak of it, but, nah, that's just silly. By the way, what's your opinion on this fic's Dark!Harry?"

Besides the Aes Sedai problem, there's also the concern that the Unbreakable Vow is punitive, and after-the-fact (unless it's REALLY trigger-happy), so it does very little to stop people rebelling, it just turns them into suicide attacks.

Although it'd be sort-of funny, if you had a Vow that broke due to duress, but the person forced into making it doesn't realise that, so that when they publicly denounce whoever forced them into it and perform whatever thing is forbidden, fully expecting it to be suicide, but then nothing happens...

**** I would think that people would have studied such vows, and checked how they work. Especially since they are so powerful. And when faced with the choice of getting sent to Azkaban or kissed, or offering an Unbreakable Vow to tell the truth (for half an hour) and prove your innocence, I think most sane people would pick the vow. On the other hand, it would be hard for a decent person to object to someone offering a vow to prove their innocence. (There's the problem that if that is allowed, anyone who doesn't do it will be seen as guilty, but still - hard to refuse such an offer.)

**** Honestly, the only kind of fics I see it working in are crack fics, and in those canonicity of anything is debatable.

We know that the vow does not care about the person's mental state, because the twins almost managed to confuzzle Ron into making an Unbreakable Vow in canon and they got a lot of shit for it from their parents precisely because Ron being confuzzled to heavens would not have stopped it from working. We also know that it takes three people for such a thing: the one making a vow, the one it is made to, and a binder; as such, it may very well be that the presence of the binder and the effect they have on the vow eliminates any ... influence the the mental state of the vow maker could have possibly had.

I'm kind of wondering if the vow would actually fail if it was the binder who was confuzzled to heavens and not really in their mind at the time of the vow.

** There's a pretty good one-shot where this happens to Arthur.

*** Oooooh! That was interesting, thank you!

...Hmm...now I've seen the specifics of this one, though, it reminds me of another one I've seen, one where Snape unwove the effects of an Unbreakable Vow from Draco...what was it...?
