:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So this is a HP/DG fanfic, where Harry pretty much grows up with Daphne as his childhood friend. Details I remember:

- Daphne starts loving Harry from a young age.

- Daphne's eyes change color based on her emotions-black, very angry, amber, annoyed like that.

- Harry realizes very late that he loves her, attempts to pursue Cho, doesn't work.

- Harry to piss his parents off hooks up with an American while in the US.

- This is a WBWL story.


** Three black birds is the name of the fic. Wasn't finished properly though. The plot was shared by the writers but after the second task is covered, the writing stopped.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
