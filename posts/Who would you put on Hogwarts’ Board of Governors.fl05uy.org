We all know Lucius Malfoy was the Head of the Governors prior to his ‘sacking', so to speak, after the events of the Chamber of Secrets. But who else would you put on the Board? Personally, I think Elphias Doge and Augusta Longbottom are, if not canon, aesthetically fitting at the very least. Elphias is Albus' childhood friend while Augusta seems like she would be on at least one committee with her role of Dowager Lady to the Longbottom family given to her by the fandom. Maybe also someone related to Hepzibah Smith, due to their blood connection with Hogwarts Founder Helga Hufflepuff, but other than that I don't really know. Discuss away.


** I'd go with Arthur Weasley. He's obviously got experience with children, and he's good natured and intelligent.

** Griselda Marchbanks, as head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority, makes the most sense.

** Lord Voldemort. Though he was evil, he was one of the greatest wizards of all time and his opinion on education would be quite useful.

*** Tom Riddle, I see Lord Voldemort as a murderous psychopath with sociopathic tendencies who also happens to be a megalomaniac...

Tom Riddle is before he went crazy due to Horcruxes, he might still be a sociopath and a bit of a megalomaniac but he is the heir to the Slytherin line so I would see him on the board

**** He was crazy before. Even as a child he was a total creep. Fully able and willing to murder and tear his own soul apart. No he didn't go crazy - he was always like that.

***** Good point but we're talking about an AU here, there is no bloody way either one would ever have joined the board of governors, I mean LV would've had everyone running for the doors and Tom Riddle just doesnt work like that as you said. He would have creeped everyone out.

****** he was capable of being perfectly charming and pleasant when it suited him. Maybe he joins board of governors to oust Dumbledore? Slowly, insidiously poisoning the board against our dear headmaster until the day they fire him!

** Ideally, it should be Hogwarts alumni who currently have their children or grandchildren attending the school.

It goes with what kind of world your looking to build. Is the Board corrupt? Are the governors holding the position for the fame and reputation? Are the positions granted because of who you know and who you bribe? Based on how Hogwarts is in canon, I'll say the governors are old, nepotistic and corrupt.
