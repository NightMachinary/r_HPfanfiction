I have vague recollections about this fic that I read a while ago. I'm not sure if some sort of "Marriage Contract" was involved or not. Basically, Daphne gets fed up with Harry either not holding up his part of the contract, or not making a move on her when he obviously (from her PoV) should, or something else like that. It was one of those fics that presented "Pure Blood Culture" as being more complex and nuanced than the fascist allegory that is more common. I remember that at least the start of the fic took place on the train. Am I making any sense? Anyone have any ideas?

*Edit: I think it was Daphne, but maybe it was Astoria? They're both pretty much blank slates in canon, so...


** I'm not sure it's the one you're looking for, but when you mention trains and Daphne the only thing that comes to mind is James Spookie's "The Legacy Preservation Act" that starts out on a train with Daphne having a "grand plan"

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

*** Thanks for the guess, but that's not the one I'm thinking about.
