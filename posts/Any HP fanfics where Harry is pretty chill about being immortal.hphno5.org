Like most ive read harry is really sad and stuff and forever angsty. And I feel as though he would have to get over his friend's death at some point. I recognize you don't just get over it, but I think being immortal would give him years to come to terms with it. Like people are going to die around me and this immortality thing is gonna be forever, I can't spend all the time being mad and sad you know?


** Yeah, some angst in the beginning is inevitable, but I feel like after a couple hundred years of immortality any one of us would get so batshit that we'd be walking around naked and talking to stray cats.

The only time immortality gets REALLY shitty is when the earth gets destroyed and you're stuck floating around in space until the universe turns to mush or whatever the science nerds say is gonna happen

*** Yea, the first 50 years would be great, the next 50 years would be problematic, the following 5,000 years would be awesome, and in five billion the sun will burn out and begin fifteen trillion trillion trillion years of madness inducing solitude.

Actual, permanent immortality is only good forever if you can dimension jump, and won't forget who you were as time passes. Assuming you're regenerating, and not becoming a shriveled husk.

You know, after getting a bigger-on-the-inside wand holster that's a Horcrux of mine, under a fidelius on it's location of ‚Äúon my left forearm‚Äù, in the hopes that whatever I put inside it (the hogwarts library, the library of congress, the matrix weapon room, all the food/drink/seeds ever, a house elf or three) will actually come with me; and that I won't wake up, buck naked (sans the Hollows) on a beach of an uninhabited world.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
