** I can't think of anything else that's as non canon as Alexandra Quick that generally gets recommended.

This is by the same author though, and takes place way in the future and is full of OCs so the plot is unrelated to normal canon.

linkffn(Hogwarts-Houses-Divided)

There are a number of other good fics that take place in either the future and the past if what you are looking for is a different plot and are ok with canon characters or characters that are relatives/ancestors of canon characters. So you could look out for fics like that.

Another option would for fics set in an AU that's very AU so that the plot is very different and that have a lot of worldbuilding to make it feel as complete as AQ.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) would fit the bill for that and has a kind of similar feel to the Alexandra Quick series in terms of the writing tone and world building.

** Sort of canon, but I'm hoping the Fantastic Beasts movie will inspire works in that time period/Ilvermony fics, :D. The stuff released in Pottermore about the origins of Ilvermony was fascinating.
