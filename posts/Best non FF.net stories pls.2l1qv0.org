** Check out [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/][skyehawke]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/][AO3]] they both have some great content. I'm not sure what your likes/dislikes are as far as what to recommend but if you like Hogwarts era gen then check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]] and it's sequels.

*** My likes/dislikes:

1. No eroticism unless it's overwhelmingly surrounded by plot.
2. Well written, in the grammatical sense.
3. The more creativity or originality the better.
4. Protagonist needs flaws, antagonists need strengths.
5. No lazy bashing. Criticize people all you want based on canon or common sense, but don't write anyone as unrealistically stupid or pointlessly maliciously evil just to give yourself more things to criticize about them.

**** Definitely check out A Year Like None Other - amazingly well written and just all around awesome.

If you're open to slash I'd recommend [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/siren/DracosBoyindex.html][Draco's Boy]].

Summary: "Harry and Draco meet as eight-year-olds after Harry moves in next door. Draco takes a liking to Harry and decides to make him his boy. Follow them as they grow-up together, learn each other's deepest secrets and, after a little bit of angst and a whole lot of UST, fall in love."

The fic does contain m/m relationships but not until you get towards the end and I could be wrong but I don't think it ever progresses to full on sex. The story itself is fantastic and very well written.

I can't think of any others off the top of my head but if I do I'll let you know.

***** Not OP but just wanted to say I second Draco's Boy. It's extremely well written and well thought out. It's been awhile but I'm pretty sure you're right that it doesn't have full on sex.

** Anything written by Bobmin356 is going to be real good, even their stuff written before HBP.
