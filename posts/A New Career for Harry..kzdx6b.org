Harry doesn't want to become an Auror, he's tired of conflict, he just wants to have a more peaceful life. So he becomes a farmer, with lots of chickens, because Harry has felt a strange kinship with the animals ever since he slew the Basilisk.

** The Dark Lord Indifidious (real name Albert) stared through his binoculars again.

"What is he doing?" He wondered aloud.

"Raising chickens... My lord." His chief mercenary Timothy the Unyielding (Timothy the pimply to the lads) replied.

"Yes, I can see that." The Dark Lord replied, scratching at an itchy spot on his robes. " But why?"

"I mean, he's muggle raised, right? Maybe he hankers for some KFC?"

"What in the name of the Dark Gods is a KFC?" The Dark Lord Indifidious asked.

"T's a place that sells fried chicken Milord". Timothy replied.

"Do they use fiendfyre in the cooking process?" Indifidious asked.

"Nah Milord, Olive Oil at most if you're wanting it all fancy like."

"Fascinating." The Dark Lord replied. "Let's retreat Timothy."

"As you wish Al-milord, sorry." Timothy coughed. " But why?"

"Because the man who conquered is engaged in fowl business Timothy. Best to leave him to it."

"That was an awful pun Milord."

"That's alright Timothy. Perks of being a Dark Lord."

"Is it?"

"That and some cookies. Let's go get some."

"Alright! You're the best Milord!"

** Damn, I cannot find it now. There was one where post War during the celebration of victory (perhaps, including Order of Merlin awards) there was a huge explosion/assassination attempt which killed the Minister Shackelbolt, Hermione, and Ron, and changed Harry into a woman. She then use acquired anonymity to basically fall into obscurity and taking care for the farm. But I cannot find it now.

** That's all well and good, but if you're raising chickens aren't you intending to slaughter them one day? Also...have you ever been around chickens? Peaceful doesn't have a place in a ten mile radius around chickens.
