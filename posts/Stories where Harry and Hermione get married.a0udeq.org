Doesn't have to be the primary focus of the fic (though it would be preferred), as long as it happens eventually. The fluffier, the better, the more we see of the ceremony, the better.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

*** I just wanted to tell you in person that I found this fic life-changing. It really made me re-examine what I expected out of fan fiction, and it kind of puts everything else I read (and my own writing) at a higher standard. I loved the theme of marriage both as a tool of convenience to debrief muggles, and as a true bond of equality both between Harry/Hermione, a form of closure for Neville as he established his own family, and you turned a terrible trope inside out. This was incredibly engrossing, and really expanded on the Wizarding World in a way that I felt was had a consistent internal logic with the main books. Also, it was great you had a fun but competent Ron.
