Harry copes with his life similarly to Luna with mostly imaginary creatures working as metaphors and Lunas general mysticisms. Has this been done before and how would you do it.


** Two existing fics jump to mind

linkffn(8212843) - MCU crossover but quite good

  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

  ABANDONED. Freaky connections aside, does anyone else think it strange that Harry survived a Killing Curse with little more damage than a scar? Well, what if he hadn't come through so unscathed? And what if the other damage was more mental than physical?

** It's not quite the same sort of Lunafication you describe, but linkffn(12026631) is a slightly different sort of Lunified Harry.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Fantastic elves and where to find them ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them]]) is a great fic that sounds like what you might be looking for. Abused by the Dursleys and treated like their house elf, Harry decides that he's actually a forest elf not a house elf and goes off to live in the forest. He doesn't dream up imaginary creatures though.
