** For a lot of fics I like it would be for them to be finished. What's the Sturgeon's Law equivalent that way too many good fanfics have no or bad endings?

** While not the worst trait a fic can have -- bashing (Worse traits, such as mpreg, leaves the fic entirely unsalvageable and thus doesn't count IMO).

To me, bashing completely removes the integrity of a character, making me unable to take actions of said character seriously. This means that whatever despicable actions he/she does, it has a much smaller impact on my feelings while reading the fic than a fic portraying a character doing bad things /without it being bashing/ -- meaning that I can see the person's actions as entirely plausible (even if unlikely).

For example: I usually read SS fics. Fics focused on romance have a habit of bashing James (LESS) or Ron (SSHG). This actively worsens fics and makes interactions between those characters far less interesting. James in particular tend to undergo complete character assassination and become an one-dimensional person with mindless goals and behaviour, while Ron generally tends to be more complex, but turn into the fic's main bad guy, which isn't him at all and completely OOC. Both characters can be portrayed negatively if you so desire without bashing them by exploiting their legitimately worst traits (Ron's inferiority complex and James' malicious harassments) without taking it too far. Allthough, in those particular examples, I much prefer fics portraying these characters positively, it's not hard to still make one's desired ship work (especially LESS) -- but that would change the fics completely.

** The obvious is answer for many is "be completed" (like "800-Rent-A-Hero" though for that story one might have to add "a less scummy acting author") or if it is finished "have more content/a sequel" (Looking at you "Steve and the Barkeep".)

But to be at least a little more specific, it would be for "Stages of Hope" to give a full payoff in the ending. The story is great and I understand /why/ it ended how it did, but /come on, man/

***** I don't mind her metaphors so much as the characters getting so frustrated with her metaphors and the others dancing around the topics. The adults refused to recognize, or perhaps hadn't experienced enough suffering of their own to be able to recognize, how broken the four were. They weren't playing games, they were avoiding painful memories and triggers and her metaphors were oblique ways of conveying something she couldn't state outright. But the adults acted like they were unstable, incompetent lunatics, despite the fact that they'd clearly survived a good deal of everything, without considering that their erratic behavior had a source.

*** I don't mind a manipulative Dumbledore. The man is essentially in charge of a bunch of hormonal teenagers. He is also a politician. What I do mind is a Dumbledore is stealing Harry's money, getting him dosed with love potions, knew Sirius was the secret-keeper, enabled Grindelwald, created Voldemort, and pays Ron and Hermione to spy on Harry.

Bashing is an interesting thing. Ron is loyal most of the time in canon, but has issues at the beginning of Goblet of Fire and during the Deathly Hallows. The Goblet of Fire should have been resolved with a sincere apology before the task, and the deathly hallows scene was poor writing and convoluted. His loyalty to Harry in the other books is phenomenal, although the whole listening to Dumbledore about Harry's mail block-out was stupid.

Hermione is a character who I think should have been treated a bit more harshly in canon. I'm not saying bashing, but 3rd year onwards, deciding to get the firebolt confiscated without consulting Harry, making Harry teach Defense thus leaving him vulnerable to the ministry, being insensitive about his Occulumency lessons and Ron getting prefect, confunding McLaggen, harping on the potions book, and mindwiping her parents! That's not to say of her treatment of Luna. I read a one-shot in which Hermione and Harry talked about the firebolt afterwards and it was glorious and strengthened the friendship.

Ginny bashing has no basis except her talking about the love potions Fred and George sell. Which is kind of horrific, but I'll just put that down to Rowling forgetting implications of that when she continued writing the book.

Snape, Umbridge, the Malfoys, other death eaters, and Fudge are all awful people. I don't really consider attacking them bashing because they very few if any redeeming features. Snape may have hated Voldemort, but he was a petty, bitter man who really wasn't good. I do think Draco Malfoy had a real chance at redemption in canon after book 7.

It's just lazy writing in general to bash Dumbledore made horrific mistakes in canon, so I'd rather see him forced to own up to them rather than explain away the character. I like him trying to apply a Greater Good™ philosophy to life but failing everyone.

Super Harry is fine only if Harry has to work for his skills. I personally enjoy attributing spell potency to the individual. I also like the idea of Harry being able to become Voldemort's equal with the same knowledge.

Lordships are stupid, but actually kind of explain the extreme corruption in the ministry. From what I understand about Rowling's post book releases, it's more of a person politicking for a seat. A 14 year old Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Emrys-LeFay-Grindelwald-Dumbledore-Stalin-McDonald's-Walton on the other hand is pure wish fulfillment.

I think the best fic is where there are parallels with a young Tom Riddle, but Harry is the same fundamentally good person he is in canon.

** My thoughts about two fics I otherwise like very much:

*/The Arithmancer/*

- Remove canon rehashing, especially at the start of the fic. Tell, don't show scenes that rehash canon verbatim.
- Don't have Hermione steal Harry's achievements (e.g., freeing Dobby); make sure that Harry remain competent in things in which he is competent in canon (e.g., not falling over a railing when tripped).
- Hermione is a brilliant which who achieves a lot. However, the saccharine scenes where people say that, though realistic, tend to get tiresome. If necessary to have them, tell, don't show those.
- On the other hand, when it comes to contests of magic, in /Lady Archimedes/ Hermione should outright win more. Later chapters, especially, got very dreary.
- Rethink Hermione's relationship with Dumbledore. Dumbledore would be seeing his successor in her, and he would seek to groom her for the role and mentor her to keep from making the mistakes that he had made.

*/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/*

- Remove the Muggle Law subplot.
- Give Hermione more outright victories. For example, in the Second Task, Harry shouldn't have had to pull her out of the water, and in the Slytherin exercise, she should have put Draco down before the help arrived.
- Rewrite the ending: it's contrived, gives Voldemort too much of an Idiot Ball, and results in being too fixfic.

**** No, that's not quite the same thing. There would have been nothing wrong if Hermione blew up the canon outline, obviated the Prophecy, and sidelined Harry completely. Indeed, it might have improved the fic by reducing canon rehashing. And, if Hermione's talents and investment of time and effort happened to make her better than Harry at duelling in a fic, there is no reason to contrive some advantage for Harry.

Even freeing Dobby was only a problem because she did it in the exact same way as Harry had in canon. If she had done it, by, say, inventing a spell that simply snapped the bond between a house-elf and its master, that would have worked better.

However, /if/ the author would rehash a particular canon event, and /if/ Harry was going to play a part, he should not have been degraded in absolute terms, even if he was rendered less important in relative terms.

***** I agree it makes it a different story, but you need to make it so she's not a Mary-Sue. I love the spell invention idea though. There's actually a fic I can't remember where she frees all elf slaves in a similar way, but in a slightly darker context.

Full disclosure, I'm a proud fan of Harry. I feel he was lazy in canon and pretty much suffered endlessly, but him being good despite that is astounding. That being said, I enjoyed the way the chamber of secrets was solved, where Hermione found out the monster and method of travel and Harry pieced together the location. I feel the main character should always have support like that and that's also why I dislike the secrecy aspect of canon Dumbledore.

I do however admit I'm biased for liking the odd good super!Harry (within limits) fic over super! Hermione. The arithmancer is a much better one though.

I think I misspoke earlier though. Harry in 7th book had an odd instinctual grasp of some things. He understood wandlore and deduced his mother's sacrifice being renewed, which was kind of neat. I feel that's an aspect of canon never really delved in in fanfiction and it would be a shame if it's ignored.

****** Honestly I see no problem with it really as long as there is a reason for all the battle parts which it sounds like there is. It's like a video game I played a while back that I can't remember the name of. It had action, mystery, and exploration in it and the developers made sure to carefully make it so that they balanced each other out and avoid repetitiveness. Not enough fighting would he old and too much would get old. As long as your fic has that proper balance and the battles have a purpose it should be fine.

Harry Potter is definitely not a Wiccan series and there are indications in the text that British wizards are culturally Christian.

I also have the following question: what kind of animagus form sucks? Because, for example, a deer, a rat, a large dog and a housecat are canon animagus forms. The animagus form of a beetle is one that was useful. There is also a Russian version of a well-known fairy tale where a prince is turned into a bumblebee.
