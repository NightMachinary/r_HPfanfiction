I've been thinking about Harry/Cho pairing for quite a while now, wondering about what if they didn't had a rocky start or what if Cho went to the Yule Ball with Harry. Any fics you guys would recommend?


** Try OR DIE TRYING: The story of Cho Chang. This is a fic of canon from Cho's POV. I found it really sweet. It's not an AU of H/C working out though. I would like to see one of those myself.

** I read this one. I liked it but it's incomplete. The author managed to capture the awkwardness of Harry asking Cho out pretty well.

The following links have links to works that are Cho/Harry. I've not ready any of them besides Autumn Swan.

  Suppose Cho said yes to Harry asking her to the Yule Ball. What kind of relationship could they have developed? HPCC AU Reboot to "Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan."

** The only decent Harry/Cho fic I know of is set after the fourth year, so I'd say you are out of luck in that regard. Well, that and a cracky Vegas reunion oneshot.

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
