Instead of becoming bitter and jealous, Petunia instead looks on the bright side and just explores as much of the magical world as she can as a Muggle relative of a Witch. She reads through all of Lily's old textbooks and just books on the magical world in general and ends up using her experiences to become a fantasy author, changing just enough for the Ministry to go 'ugh fine, you can publish it'. She ends up becoming a reasonably successful fantasy writer.

Years lately at a book signing, Petunia meets none other than Vernon Dursley. Who in this timeline discovered his hidden passion for being a stage magic and so ended up running away from home to seek a career in being a magician, the two hit it off over their shared love of magic and end up getting married.

Because of this they both have a strong relationship with the Potters, with Vernon being really impressed upon finding out Petunia's related to people able to do real actual magic. Vernon gets quite good at stage magic and constantly tries to impress the Potters with his tricks whenever they meet up.

Due to this they fully accept Harry into their lives and deeply mourn the lost of Lily and James. Growing up both Harry and Dudley are raised with a strong love of magic and fantasy, reading things like Tolkien and... other fantasy stories around in the 80s/90s. The Dursleys would all have regular family DnD sessions, possibly based off Petunia's* own knowledge of the Wizarding World. They would be completely open and supportive of Harry's magical nature and explain the circumstances of his parents death when they believe he's old enough.

Growing up Harry takes after his Uncle by being quite good at stage magic, while Dudley takes after his mother by being decent writer. Both grow up close and even hold their own tabletop RPG sessions with friends from school.

Harry goes to Hogwarts quite aware of the Wizarding World and also knowledgeable in many Fantasy Tropes and Magic trips. Having a close relationship to his cousin, aunt and uncle who all do what they can to support his journey into Hogwarts.

(Just thought this was a wholesome idea)

Edit: They also watched Star Wars.


** A Petunia who still loves her sister? Dursleys who treat Harry like he was their own flesh and blood and give him a loving home and a brother by another mother in the literal sense? I really do love (well-written) wholesome fanfiction, I hope someone writes a story like that.

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?

** You might like linkffn(11994595). Not quite what you describe, it's post-Hogwarts. Harry has a family with Ginny, Dudley Dursley has grown up and has his own family and is a decent sort despite Vernon's poor parenting. One of Dudley's kids turns out to be magical, Dudley reluctantly contacts Harry for advice, and the families end up meeting up and getting along. A nice story without much angst.

** Dudley took one last breath closing his eyes as his body shuddered a final time.

Harry looked across the battlefield at the sight of his brother torn asunder. Slain with a curse most foul. Rage swelled through his soul as he called on the might of his ancestors.

"Blagroth! You have gone to far and I will end you!"

Blagroth was a thin reedy man who took great pleasure in the darkest of delights. The world would be a far better place with him gone from it.

Harry ran forward his enchanted shield taking the brunt of the foul wizards spell. The force of it still drew a grunt from Harry as he moved on. His Gladius shined in the noon sun as he reached the foul wizard.

Stabbing forward he was pleased to hear Blagroth scream out in horror as he realized he would die here today.

Looking up from where he had fallen Blagroth could only smile with vicious glee.

"You have killed me this day yet I shall drag you to the depths of Hades with me!"

Harry realized to late what the dark wizard had planned. Blagroth used his life-force itself to fuel his last spell.

A whistle cut through the forest and into the clearing where the battle had taken place.

"Blagroth has used 'Ultimate Sacrifice' ending both his and Harry Stormshield's life. The battle to save Fandearl is over!"

Harry moaned and helped Tim up from the ground.

"Ultimate sacrifice is OP, please nerf!"

Tim, formerly Blagroth, chuckled as the youngest of the LARP group complained.

"That's why you always use an archer silly. No one uses sword and board against the final villain for a reason."

Harry could only nod at that. Everyone told him that but still...

"It's so cool though!"

Tim laughed as the made their way over to the other youngest member of the group. Dudley Dursley was a giant of a boy easily a full head taller than his cousin and a slab of thick muscles. Well for a 10 year old he was heavily muscled.

Still the boy despite his obvious perfect genes for a sword and board loved the bow.

Dudley was kicking leaves and thinking about his next character when they finally made it to him.

"Harry, want to be a pair of shadow thieves next time?"

Harry thought that sounded really cool honestly. It was Dudley's turn to pick their theme for characters also.

Harry had chosen their most recently slain characters. A pair of wandering brothers, an archer and barbarian, who had taken up a mercenary contract against Blagroth.

Tim nodded at Dudley's idea. He gave some quick advice for the young boys.

"Make sure you invest in Muffle and Scentless. Being hidden is useless if they can hear you or someone's guardian beast smells you."

Both kids nodded along to that, great advice. Vernon made his way over to the boys still dressed as the King he was this session.

"Great job boys, you got Blagroth. Maybe next time we can try and see if your characters can live longer than a single session though hmmm?"

Both kids ducked their heads as they nodded. They rarely got to do anything more than some side skirmishes. They had gotten to fight in the final battle this time as the campaign was ending today anyways.

Nobody liked having their long term character ganked by two kids who went through characters like most people did socks.

Still Tim had been okay with letting the two kids fight him in the final battle. The other players had been careful to work around the boys and subtly herd them to the last fight.

It was worth it though as both boys were still vibrating with happiness at having saved the realm from Blagroth.

Vernon chuckled and thanked Tim who nodded back.

"Well come along young Dark Wizard slayers! I believe a trip to The Workshop is in order now. Afterall you two did such a great job, you should be rewarded of course."

The boys smiled in glee at the thought of getting to go to The Workshop! It was a passion project of his Aunt and Uncle.

It was a warehouse just on the edges of Inner London that they had converted over. Now a coffee/tea shop upfront with a huge selection of games, books, LARP gear and a gaming tables the boys loved it.

The best part was the back. There was a huge machine shop back there where they made all manner of props and various things.

The area was for public use as well and they made a tidy sum off the fees from that. Many local people doing home projects came in to use their lathes, drill presses and various industrial tools.

That Petunia had gotten a few Muggleborns to enchant the various machines to make them safer and more efficient only helped the business.

In fact Muggleborn customers were a solid third of their customers. Petunia was honestly one of the foremost experts in classifying modern magics and breaking it down to root magic.

She had fallen in love with Magic and been upset at finding out she couldn't do it. Still she had been excited to learn she was a squib, as that meant she still had magic. Just it was far less than a witch would have.

Still she had poured over Lily's first year texts and quickly realized something.

The various spells had commonalities that just made sense to her. She had spent all her pocket money and gotten more through extra work to buy tons of books from Diagon Alley. By Lily's fifth year she had made a working theory.

A theory that she had convinced Lily on that summer and had swiftly brought Lily to to forefront of her year during 6th year.

Petunia had then taken that knowledge and created an entire game system. One that taught the fundamentals of magic buried in the rule books. It was written well enough the Ministry of Magic had not caught on at all.

After a few years it had caught on and now was the biggest fad among Muggleborns after they received their NEWT's. There was a massive upswing in Muggleborn Sorcerer, and even a recent Grand Sorcerer, level witches and wizards recently.

The Muggleborn community had taken to supporting, and fiercely protecting, the Dursley family. That Harry bleeding Potter was the nephew of Petunia was simply icing on the cake.

--------------

Just an idea based off the prompt. Intelligence is usually hereditary and Lily was known as 'the brightest witch of her age'. Why would Petunia be any less outside thematic reasons Rowling's wanted to create?

So an intelligent and driven Petunia had wanted to know why she had magic but couldn't do magic! So she had focused on understanding why magic was the way it was to find a backdoor into it so to speak.

Essentially she dug through the programming of modern magic to find the root code so to speak. Afterall a highly driven intelligent child can see things in a way others would never even think to look.

Hope everyone enjoyed this little story!

**** The schooling is a great idea! I could see an enterprising and clever Muggleborn or Half-Blood in the know taking over Muggle Studies. All the Muggleborn, most of the Half-Bloods and a few clever Purebloods taking the class.

Using it as a way to backdoor into Hogwarts the Petunia Magical Theory. Which would likely be the second year of it during Harry's first year. Quirrel took a sabbatical the year before Harry's first year in canon.

That would be an appropriate time as well. Give the new style time to have been distributed around the Muggleborn community enough to create the opportunity for one to want to use Muggle Studies as the secret way in. Also by third year electives they could have weeded out candidates that would be a bad choice to learnt the knew knowledge. From the behavior of the kids for the first two years.

Thanks for the excellent idea!

It would be nearly impossible, and dangerous, for the Ministry to accept any new magical theory books from a squib. However if Petunia makes them into an RPG tabletop/LARP game and was careful it would stay under the radar easily.

Vernon would not be a stage magician like the prompt but instead a real machinist. Probably an degree in Mechanical Engineering or something similar.

That could then easily lead into him making the fabrication part of the workshop. Which would let them push the frontiers of making enchanted objects.

Afterall the rpg Maxim of "Don't waste spells on what and enchanted item can do" would be something Petunia would likely get behind.

She might only be able to do minimal magic with her system but she can easily use enchanted items.

Probably push the time-line forward as well two decades. Give a chance for 3d printing to take hold.

Picture an enchanted 3d printer! Use any material instead of just the special plastics they had when the technology was new.

Maybe even add in transmutation enchantments to the 3d printer. It would be incredibly powerful and really push everything well past cutting edge.

Enlarge an object and make super intricate details. Finish it out and shrink again. Would be nanoscale level work by hand! Amazing what could be done.

** "I'll finish up with Dudley, Pet. Go see who's coming 'round still trick-or-treating at this hour."

With only the slightest huff--Vernon was as likely to rile Duddy up as he was to sooth him back to sleep--Petunia went to the door. She'd scarcely gotten her robe on when a second knock boomed through the house and rattled what could be rattled.

"Who's pounding away at the door, are you the police?"

"Oh, Petunia, is it? S'mee, Hagrid. 'n the Headmaster 'n...'n another...", came a gruff voice that trailed into mumbling.

Petunia flung open the door and cast her eyes on the behemoth and the aged wizard next to him. She hurriedly invited them in, confused to not see the third Hagrid had mentioned.

"Vernon, it's Lily's headmaster and Hagrid. They have news, I'll bet. And not good, it looks like," Petunia called back into the house. If it were possible for beards to crumple, both visitors' would have done so, from the force with which their faces fell. "I'll put on some tea," Petunia said as she sat the men in their living room and excused herself to the kitchen.

She passed Vernon carrying Dudley and managed a tight smile. She had been worried he would choose his travels over her and the baby, but she didn't need to be. Vernon loved her and he loved being a father. She was setting the kettle when Vernon said loudly, "Evening, gentlemen. And Harry, curled in your arm there, if my eyes don't lie."

Oh god. Petunia's hands became clumsy and she forgot whether she'd already set out the service. "I'm afraid your eyes are keen as ever, Mr. Dursley, and your wife is more correct than she'd like to be," said Dumbledore in response. Hagrid must have been holding a breath, because Petunia heard him sharply inhale and bark a hasty sob. Oh, god, no.

It wasn't boiled, but Petunia brought the pot into the living room anyway. Ah, she hadn't set out tea sets. She numbly set the warm kettle down and turned to go back to the kitchen.

"Petunia, if you please. I have a calming draught, should you like it. We're here bearing grave news," Dumbledore began--eliciting another sob from Hagrid. When Petunia had turned back and had a seat, too, he continued, "James and Lily Potter are dead."

Barely, she registered Hagrid breaking into a full cry, and Vernon talking to him. "Stiff upper lip, now, man. That boy needs us, and we need to be strong for him, and Dudley needs to see how a man acts. There's a good man. Plenty of time for this at the wake, isn't there?"

Oh, Dudley. "Vernon, we have to go. Take the boys and get out of Britain. If they got my sister, they can get us. We have to save-", she said and was cutoff by a gesture from Dumbledore as his face lifted.

"Not quite, dear Petunia. They prevailed, Cadmean though there victory was. They stopped the dark lord Voldemort, I've seen his body myself. Indeed, you, Harry, and your enemies will be the only families mourning tonight--the war is soon to be ended."

Petunia's gaze became vacant and her face slackened. The grief of losing her sister warred with the relief of the end of the war. For two seconds. Her mouth pulled into a rictus frown and she sobbed unabashedly. Dudley was pushed into her arms, and she calmed enough to rock him and enjoy his sleepy snuggles. "I'd like to hear about them, if you know what happened," she managed.

Vernon picked up a worn pack of playing cards and began practicing elaborate false cuts as he listened to the tale of the final days of the Potters. It was a terrifying tale of cat and mouse ending with the cat ruined, ostensibly by the love of the mice. It would go on to be Petunia's first entry in her Adventures of the Boy-Who-Lived wizard book series, but not before some years had distanced her from her grief.

When Dumbledore got to the betrayal of the Potters, Hagrid's mouth opened and spluttered, and he barely managed, "No', Sirius Black. 'E jus' gave me 'is bike to bring Harry safe away."

"I'm afraid so, Hagrid. The magic of the Fidelius is beyond even my power to confound," Dumbledore said in attempted consolation.

"It's rubbish, if you ask me," Vernon cut in. "I know what it looks like when things aren't what they seem, and I know what it looks like when they are exactly what they seem. And that man, Black, was Potter's through and through. Ernest as the day is long, that one. Loved my muggle-magic."

Vernon flipped a few cards out of the deck he was handling. "Either tonight was on purpose," he flipped over Hearts King, Queen, Ace. In another pile, he flipped over the Jack of Hearts and King of Spades, "and they're heroes what gave their all for Britain." With this, he swept the King of Spades through the King&Queen of Hearts, taking them off the table. Just the Jack and Ace of Hearts remained.

"Or." His knuckle rapped against the Jack of Hearts, and before the eyes of mages, it changed to a Joker. "Or, they were betrayed some other way."

Hagrid's face was set firm and he was nodding. Dumbledore's had taken a fond expression that only a few would be able to identify--the face he wore when he recognizes virtue.

"Your insight is nearly as admirable as your loyalty, Mr. Dursley. I'm as sure as I can possibly be that he is the betrayer, but at least we must know if it was deliberate... Or if he has any Jokers tucked in the creases of his hands. I'll question him personally."

"In the meantime, we must impose on you to foster Harry. The spell which Lily used will protect this house as long as--" Dumbledore was cutoff by Petunia's immediate

"Of course we will! Hand him over to Vernon, when was the last time he was fed?"

** High fantasy was popular in the 80's, and Urban fantasy took off in the 90's.

80's popular fantasy would have included the Dragonriders of Pern, the Xanth books (although those have problematic overtones), David and Leigh Eddings's epic fantasy cycles, including the Belgariad. And the Herald of Valdemar books by Mercedes Lackey.

The first book in the Wheel of time series was published in 1990, though Harry might have had a little too much on his mind by then to indulge in an epic quest fantasy. Then again, if he needed an escape, he might have.

I was also reading Mists of Avalon. (Which was era defining for feminist fantasy as well as fantasy retelling of popular lore during that particular decade. Although things that have come out about Marion Zimmer Bradley and her husband make her work a bit problematic, too.)

The first of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books was published in 83. Sir Terry kept writing right up until his embuggerance made it impossible. They're publishing the last of his short stories this year. If you want an author with a strong sense of right and wrong to shape Harry's world view, I would swear by Pratchett.

Douglas Adams is technically science fiction, but his Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is too well known to ignore. As is Ender's game (which is hard science fiction. And again the author is problematic.)

Hope this helps. I'm actually just a little older than what Harry would have been in canon (I graduated high school in 94). So I was thinking about what I was reading at the time. Granted, I'm American. So some of what Harry might have been reading might look a little different.

**** Separating the author from the work is an individual choice.

If I'm going to provide a list of recommendations for 80's and 90's genre work, I'm going to note which books I know were written by people that the reader might have a problem with.

That way they can make the informed choice to include the book in their own works (or read them) or not.

** Oh! somebody please write this! I love this idea!

I've read one short where Petunia gets fed up with Vernon's abuse, takes the boys and leaves him--she raises them alone, poor but loved, and both she and Dudley end up becoming vital secret assets to the OotP. She's sort of drawn as a Muggle version of Molly, in that verse. it's a lovely story--i'll try to find the link, I think it was on tumblr?

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

*** I was about to say Narnia! :) Tamora Pierce's Tortall books started coming out in the 80s too, iirc, and if you want to go back a little farther and hit something British in origin, Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising series is Arthurian-adjacent and very good stuff for young wizard-y types.

**** The kids could also read the "Worst Witch" books, though I'd nearly bet that in the Harry Potter world THOSE are written by a person with sone insight into the Magical World, just as would Petunia be doing in the prompt.

Then there are all the Wizard of Oz books (it IS a series), Mary Poppins and sequals, Roald Dahl books, the first few Redwall books, Pippi Longstocking (plus sequals and a few other Astrid Lindgren books), The Neverending Story...

There are so many kid's fantasy books.

** What about Dudley being envious of Harry's magic and the attention his parents give him when they are kids and going dark? Maybe he latter discover magical abilities himself. Can go both ways, either he finally understand that he is loved, and all eventually go well, or go full dark lord.

*** that would be an interesting twist either way! I'm particularly fond of au's where Dudley & Harry are close, & Dud is Harry's protector and surrogate big bro--not implausible since we see the seeds that could have borne that in canon, when Dudley finally does stand up for him in the end albeit just a little.
