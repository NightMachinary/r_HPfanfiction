Specifically where they remember their past life and still have their powers, if they had any


** I think all the ones I can remember are Harry reincarnating into One Piece and not the other way around :/

There aren't very many good crossovers in this fandom but try out these linkffn(9310341; 11152357)

  Souls are tricky things, especially when some don't come on time and others come too early. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, Harry has to go find out what is wrong and fix it. It's been a while since he's walked amongst the living though, and even longer since he's interacted with them. Still, he'll have some fun poking around in the meantime.

  ONE SHOT "If Mihawk was going to become the world's greatest swordsman, he would need a sword to match. Luckily, he stumbled upon the peculiar green-eyed man named Harii who was the best smith he'd ever met. It started off as threaten-and-irritably-obey, and now it was more like give-and-take (though Mihawk still threatened sometimes.)" Drabble fic,no pairing, long, T for swearing

** *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): Voldemort took over young Harry mostly, hilarity ensued.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): The horcrux in Harry's scar made a deal with him, with vastly more favorable outcomes for both.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.
