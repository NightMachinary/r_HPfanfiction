I know there are a lot of requests for harmony fics in this sub, but I don't recall seeing (at least recently) any posts about the best authors of this ship. I know the majority of you believe this is a difficult feat, and I agree - as a Harmony shipper, I'd say 85% of the stories I find are not good. At all... So I wanted to talk about the ones that are, and how the author makes it work... Stuff like that.

I started reading fics circa 2005 - but they were mostly (bad) brazilian ones since I couldn't read in English back then. I found my way into ffnet around 2009, and really liked chem prof's style back then (still do, though I tend to think his Hermione is a little bit too perfect). Recently I've been enjoying Starfox5's stories because I think he excells at worldbuilding.

So who do you like? Who makes the best Harmony stories, and why?


** littlebirds. I challenge you to find an author more proficient with concise imagery.

  "The problem, as Harry sees it, is he simply wasn't prepared." Rated M for a bit of language, a bit of drinking, and a bit of adult-theme type things.

  'She'd prepared for empty rooms and close air, but not the false play of light.' Hermione goes home. Harry follows.

She also does Harry/Draco, so read the summaries. And she tends to go pretty AU. Soulmate Bond is epic-length, most of the others are significantly shorter.

I just like her way of coming up with different scenarios, she puts in a decent amount of non-juvenile humor, she generally makes Harry a badass (which I like) - although not at an unbelievably young age, and she comes up with some interesting twists on the universe - I love all the parselmagic stuff in Soulmate Bond. Her OCs are pretty well-rounded - and she tends to re-use them in different stories, which I kind of like - someday I'm going to forget they're OCs. The relationships in her fics don't seem to come out of nowhere, have their bumps, and seem believable and adult in nature. And not just in the sexual sense. The people, also, have their faults.

The Magical Promise would be a good shorter one to start with. It's post-Hogwarts (by 10 years, I think).

*** Pretty good recs all around. Not sure MADHarmony really counts as she's only written one thing, which isn't even finished.

Also, shameless plug: I hope one day requests like these can show up on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]], once I finally get around to fixing the CSS/finishing the sub manifesto.

*** Another addition to the above-mentioned list: Lorien829. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829]] . Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2392116/Oddment-Tweak]] is really good, but has only written one fic (which is definitely worth a read).

  During the events leading up to Star Trek V, Spock and Uhura adjust to being together again. This follows "The Kobayashi Maru."
