** As long as it didn't literally talk constantly about being asexual/aromantic I probably wouldn't care. A story about Harry (just as an example) without a romantic subplot wouldn't necessarily be bad as long as the rest of the fic is good.

** All I can say, if you don't want to write about sexuality, just don't write about it. I have read many K+ or T rated stories that did not cross into that subject in 200k+ words, and I liked them. But I do prefer fics that include sexuality, maybe even explicit. But if the author is uncomfortable writing it, the scenes will just come out bad.

On the other hand, the few fics I read where the asexuality of the MC was made a subject of the story, I dropped. Simply because the subject is so far out for me, I could not identify with it at all. And every line the author spent writing about it, trying to explain it, made it worse. Maybe that is just me, and I can't really explain it. I mean, I am straight but some of my absolute favorite fics are explicitly slash. Yet asexual MC's are a straight up "no thanks" from me.

And teenage drinking? I never in 18 years of reading HP fanfiction thought "mhh, this story is unrealistic, they don't drink at all!". So, don't get hung up on what some people feel must be included to make the story realistic. If drinking and masturbation are not mentioned in the story, that does not mean they don't happen at Hogwarts.

*** I strongly agree with your last point. After all, should you write about every time a character goes to the bathroom, or brushes their teeth, or showers, or eats? Sometimes reviewers ask authors about those things, as if by omitting them the author is saying that they never happen. But wouldn't it be much stranger to read a fic where, for no reason related to the plot, the MC's hygiene is discussed?

I think things like drinking, masturbation, and sex can be like hygiene: they are understood to probably be happening somewhere, but just aren't relevant to the story.

** I mean, if you don't want to write it, don't write it. There are plenty of stories that exist without sexual/romantic themes and many more than never even have anyone drinking in it.

Personally, I don't want to read stories that are straight-up romances or too smutty. I like the story to be about other things, fighting bad guys, dealing with loss of family, building an unlikely friendship under interesting circumstances, ect. If there's a romantic subplot or a dash of drinking here and there in expected situations (a party, a bar), I'm cool with it, but it's not what's compelling to me. Never has been.

Truthfully, I don't actually think anyone's going to get critical because your teenage characters aren't crushing on each other or others or aren't having dirty thoughts. If there's plenty else going on, they probably won't even notice it's lacking.

Admittedly, a lot of my stories have some romantic/sexual elements and drinking too. There's also some delving into even darker topics too. Yet there's never more written than I feel comfortable writing. If anyone were to complain to me about it lacking romance or smut or anything else I would honestly tell them that they may want to go looking for a different story to read because that's not something I'm going to force more of into my stuff.

I do want to caution about using tags like asexual!Harry or such, though, because doing so may cause people to expect some kind of delving into that topic or the experience of being asexual or aromantic and they might be a bit upset if there is none of that exploration or just mentions of them dealing with the issues that arise from their lack of feelings for anyone.

** An asexual/aromantic character would not put me off reading, but it would seem to be unnecessary if all you want to do is not write about sexuality. Because obviously going into detail about the MC's asexuality is still talking about sexuality.

There are plenty of fics where romance/sex just doesn't play a role. Sure, if you were writing a coming of age story with a YA tone then it might be odd if you didn't address sexuality at all. But if you're telling a mystery, or an action-adventure, or a war story... then you can just not write about it because the characters are busy doing other stuff.

Hell, that is largely the direction canon took.

** I may be in minority here, but I can totally see relating to such a fic, as I somewhat identify myself in ace category. I've been specifically looking at tags in AO3, with "asexual character" or "asexual Harry" or "demisexual character" to look for more stories in this category. There aren't many, but ones that are there are pretty good fics. These fics explore relationships where only one person is asexual. I thought it was interesting.

I really dig Aromantic fics where sex or romance is pretty much background or non-existent. Many of the Top fics in the fandom are Gen fics, so if your story has content, I think it will shine.

WRT to Drinking or other 'teenage activities', I feel like it depends on you, are you going to Americanize your fiction (I've no problem with that) or make it more British? Or are you going to stick with trend of British Children/Teenage Authors, and make the fics more conservative? Maybe I'm wrong, but I've read quite a lot of British Children's /Teenage Books (having not grown up in America) and they tend to be pretty conservative and more idyllic. Just a perspective from someone who's neither British nor American..

I'd happily read a fic without any romance if there's something else interesting going on.

The first few canon books didn't have any romance at all and they were just fine.

Just don't have the character being asexual their only defining character trait that they start every conversation with. You don't even have to mention it, it's probably best to just subtly imply things like this unless it becomes plot relevant.

#+begin_quote
  people often talk about how unrealistic it is for teenagers not to feel sexual attraction, have sex, and engage in sexual relationships.
#+end_quote

I often see people use this as a justification /for/ having teenage promiscuity in a fic (i.e. "teenagers often have sex in real life, so there should be nothing inherently wrong with depicting such acts in a story, even though laws and subreddit rules forbid it"). But I've never seen anyone claim that /lacking/ sexual urges at that age is unrealistic.

The reality is that human beings naturally have a wide range of libidos. Not every teenager is a horndog, and many have a less active or absent libido even without identifying as asexual. Considering the popularity of "gen" fics without romance, you are not going to offend anyone by choosing to have an protagonist not interested in sex/romance.

If you are going to write a story with an asexual protagonist, then I'd prefer that you just show that character's personality through the story without posting a big neon sign over their sexuality. If they have a low/absent libido , then it's likely that other parts of their life (interactions with friends and enemies, goals, things they are good at and things they struggle with) are going to be more important to their central identity than sex. Thus, I think you would do the character more justice if you thought of them as a person for whom their sexuality is incidental rather than their sexuality being some guiding force that the whole plot needs to fit around.

*** It's not wrong to want to write a story that doesn't involve sex or romance, but just avoiding the topic altogether is not writing an asexual character.

If the character is asexual that is going to affect their motivations, how they interpret other people's actions, how they interact with other people, etc. For example, in a setting like Hogwarts, an asexual character is going to see people around them start pairing up as they get older but they won't experience the attractions that are driving that. They may feel pressure to be in relationships because they've absorbed the idea from the culture around them that that's what is normal, and that may increase the older they get.

If the writer is making a conscious decision to make a character asexual they need to consider these kinds of things.

**** That's absolutely true, the author should consider such things (depending on what kind of story they want to tell). In a coming of age story a character with low/absent libido would have some different experiences than their peers, might experience moments of emotional conflict, self doubt, etc. but those differences don't have to be the defining core of their personality.

During that same period of their life the character would have plenty of other interests/goals for the plot to focus on. An asexual person is a person like anyone else in that regard.

What I'm trying to get at is that you don't have to treat an asexual character the way Hollywood often treats sexual minorities in film/television. Film/TV writers often create token representations of sexual minorities that emphasize their differences, thus leading to unrealistic sterotypes rather than just presenting the characters as people with the same range of lifestyles, skills and goals as anyone else while incidentally happening to have different partner preferences.

**** I think a large part of it would come down to "show, don't tell." For me, it'd be interesting to read a fic with an asexual or aromantic MC, showing how that impacts their adolescence, self, and relationships, as long as it wasn't full of chapters of first person inner-dialogue or heavy-handed conversations explicitly bringing it up at every turn. It could seem normal and natural to the MC experiencing it, because it's their own internal experience, and exploring how that interacts or conflicts with the sexual and romantic norms and expectations of their peers would be really interesting.

I'm not sure I would be able to infer that a character was deliberately written as asexual if the fic just never mentioned romance or sex, so it seems like a fine line between making it an intentional writing point and making it the overarching focus of the plot.

Edit: I mean to say that it could be an implicit or explicit feature of the story, but it would ideally be written in a way that doesn't break immersion in the story itself, which is just a facet of good writing in general.

I've read stories where the MC just /is/ asexual with no issue. It's when the plot stops so a chartacter can make a 2000 word speach about their sexuality, regardless of what letter it is, that I nope out of the story. When it's obviously the entire story is just an excuse for the author to preach to the reader about how horrible they are for not knowing the difference between all the letters in the soup. I mean seriously, I don't know what the difference between pansexual and bisexual is, and I don't care.

** If you're going to write an asexual character, write it as if the audience already knows that they're asexual. You don't need to shove it down the reader's throats. Just... don't have sexual situations. If they encounter conflict because of it - i.e. their romantic partner wants to get intimate, you can naturally address it then by having the character simply say no. You don't need to have them explicitly say "I'm asexual" - especially since the awareness of that is a relatively recent, post-internet phenomenon that wizards wouldn't really be aware of in the 90's. But even if they don't explicitly come out and say it, people can just not want sex.

Because sex is like tea; British teenagers probably want both, but sometimes, they're just not thirsty.

** Write how you feel the character should be. It would make it more realistic than being forced into a stereotype.

I'm usually excited about asexual characters in stories as I identify with them. I avoid stories solely based on romance and skip sexual scenes in all stories.

However I prefer it if the character is subtle about their realisations. I have rarely seen anyone IRL openly admit that they are asexual and find it jarring if they are the type of people who carry banners claiming "I am asexual!!!!" (Though this could be because I am from a conservative society where any talk of sexuality is frowned upon.)

I crossed my teen years without even seeing alcohol though I am quite sure my male peers would have had alcohol in their parties. Again I think it is simply a cultural difference - a woman drinking is judged much more harshly than men.

** To me, if you write a story well, it doesn't matter what the character's sexuality or romantic status is.

This type of thing is easier in a 3rd person and harder in a 1st person. 3rd person gives you some distance from the character in question, and you can say "the focus of the story is not on sex/romance so what I choose to show isn't going to touch on those things."

1st person on the other hand..I think you would have to at least skirt those topics, even if it's only something on the lines of "gee. Everyone else around me is talking about this stuff constantly, how do I feel about it?" because teens are constantly questioning themselves.

** This may be TMI, but I'm gonna input my personal experience and feelings on the subject. I'm a 19 year old virgin and while I have attraction towards people, I rarely feel sexually attracted because I associate sexual attraction with trust. I cannot see myself have sex with anyone unless I've known and trusted and loved them (platonically included) for at least 3-4 years probably more. Right now I would only ever had sex with my best friend, who I've known for almost 8 years, but I am not attracted to her at all. This being said, I am openly bisexual, so I find men and women attractive. In high school a few of my close friends had regular sex, one had casual sex once, and the rest of us are barely virgins now in college (except me). No one ever gave me any slack for it and I never judged anyone for having sex. In regards to a fanfic I would see it reasonable to have little to no romance or for a main character they could be like me. For example "Harry thought Cho was beautiful and he had a crush on her. Eventually they start dating, but are not involved sexually because Harry isn't ready" you could end it there, make it never start, or have the characters grow so that Harry eventually does trust someone. Anyways, spiel over and good luck!

** Before I answer your questions it's important for me to say that the point of fanfiction is to express how you feel. What other people think of those topics is less important than your need/want to express them.

About asexuality - it really depends on the plot and how well the story is written. Usually I search for specific ships and read how the characters develop a sexual and romantic relationship, but I don't mind reading a story involving a ship I'm not into or a story where the character isn't in a sexual/romantic relationship at all if the plot is interesting, like a mystery or an adventure story. Something thrilling.

People can also be ace/aro and in relationships. If you wrote about queerplatonic relationships or about nonsexual bdsm I would really enjoy reading that.

About alcohol - drinking alcohol isn't necessarily a big part of adolescence. Some teenagers don't drink. Some of them drink a bit of wine sometimes. It doesn't have to be a dramatic thing where they get really drunk at parties. I think it's not okay that people are judging you for not wanting to mention alcohol in your fics. I don't have an opinion for or against teenagers drinking so I don't care if you write about it or not.

** The only time I could see asexuality as something relevant to the plot would be if you were doing some sort of marriage contract or other romantic storyline.

Generally you can just not talk about sex or sexuality, it doesn't come off as false or poor writing. Generally everything on the page should relate in someway to your plot, whether it's directly part of it or simply has an influence on it at some point.

For example in an action heavy independent Harry fic, a good reason for him to have a romantic partner is for that person to be kidnapped or to betray him at some point in the story. Another good reason is to give him someone he can expose or explain his inner thoughts or motivations to, effectively they act as an audience proxy to understand the main characters actions. But you could accomplish these goals with a friend or a mentor, just as well as with a romantic partner.

But having the character be shifted into some nieche sexual orientation just to avoid writing romance? Naah. First of all, if you aren't exploring it, there is no point in mentioning it. And if you're exploring it, then it's not the kind of fic i'd like to read because i'm not interested in other people sexual +deviancies+ preferences.\\

Ithink it would not even be necessary to make your mc asexual, a choice of genre would allow you to avoid this topic altogether. Best stories I've read, even if they had romance in them, had no explicit sex because authors found other things to include in them. There are so many other things to write about and so many kinds of relationships to explore! It's explicit sex I find [[https://offputting.It][offputting.It]]'s like, I know it's happening, but I don't need to know every single detail.

** Honestly making a MC asexual in a HP fic would make me more inclined to read it. Im not ace and normally I love shipping but in HP fics im much more interested in plot and a ship especially one i dont think is well done (whether i ship it or not) distracts from that and can be frustrating and can ruin a story that I actually did like the plot of.

And btw even though Im not ace I was very uninterested in dating as a teen and had very few crushes and none of them were ones i felt particularily passionate over. And I dont think thats all that weird as a teen alot of people dont really get interested in dating until their 20s while some start in their early teens it just depends on the individual if they arent ace. My grade was mostly girls. So it wasnt uncommon to not have a boyfriend so maybe there was less peer pressure to have one. Maybe there was more pressure if you were a guy idk. Not that gay people were non existent or that the school environnent was particulatily homophobic but most werent really open about it till college.

As for the teenage drinking I didnt really drink till I got to college. I was pretty introverted tho and in the states the drinking age is 21. So drinking as a teen in highschool in my experience was something that happened at bigger parties not casual hangouts and bigger parties I avoided. While in college casual drinking while hanging out even if you arent 21 isnt all that weird especially if you have 1 of your friend group that is 21+. Personally I never felt super pressured to drink but again i was still more of the kind to have small get togethers where you binge shows play videogames and board games in your apartment than go to big parties. So i guess consider what your MC would prefer.

** J.K made several books and Millions of dollars without once providing a graphic depiction of sex. That's its own genre and not something you'd need to worry yourself about.

I beg you, my friend, write what you enjoy!

** Asexuality exists!! Any questions you may have have probably been answered in [[/r/asexuality][r/asexuality]] at some point or another, including straight up confusion about why the fuck everyone else is shagging but you feel like you missed the memo.

Generally, there are PLENTY of plots that don't require a bedroom scene - so write what you feel like writing (and send me the link, because I only felt comfortable using the label asexual after reading a fanfiction with an asexual character in it and I'd love to read another)

** It's different for everyone, but one of my favourite fics (not Harry Potter) just happens to have two asexual protagonists. The author doesn't make a fuss about it, but it is tagged that way.

I prefer non-sexual stories but if a story is well-written I'll read it anyway, while a badly written story without sex won't interest me. The quality of the writing takes priority but I do enjoy reading stories without sex where I can.

** I am biased, as an asexual. But I am completely fine with no sex. Harry Potter itself barely had any mention of it. The adventures is what does it for me. I would really like it to be pointed out though, so I I'm not waiting for a romance to happen or be surprised if it does happen.

** An asexual MC wouldn't cause me to drop a fic, no. It might even make me more interested in reading it, just to see what the fic says about this. Asexuals don't exactly get a lot of representation in media. (I really liked the Archie comics reboot explicitly making Jughead asexual.)

When it comes to teenage drinking... meh. It happens, I mean it happens a LOT. But you don't have to include it in a story about teenagers. In my experience it's far MORE detrimental to a story to force a lot of sex and drinking into a story where sex and drinking doesn't fit, just because the protagonist is a teenager.

** Personally, I only read fics for smut XD So for me, not my thing, but I feel like if your fic is full of enough interesting information, no one will care.

I wish you all the best!
