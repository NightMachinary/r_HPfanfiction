So, I'm always looking for interesting stories that have Dumbledore in them, even if he's not a major character. I hate bashing with a passion, no Dumbledore and NO Weasley bashing please.

He doesn't have to be exactly like his canon self; it can be different interpretation about him, but yeah; I just don't want any bashing involving him.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

He doesn't have to be the main character or even a major character, (though he can be).

I don't want OP Harry, I don't want Harem Harry, or a snap of the fingers and everything works out for Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful is fine, but I don't want him OP. (Harry doesn't even have to be the main character), as long as Dumbledore is in the story, and written in a non bashing way, I don't care.

Can be on any site, any character can be the main character, just as long as Dumbledore and the Weasley's aren't bashed. Dumbledore doesn't have to be exactly like his canon self, as long as it's not bashing him.

(Same with the Weasley's, they don't have to be exactly like their canon self, as long as it's not bashing them).

Would rather it be completed, but if not it's fine.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118][Thirty-Five Owls]] by Letterblade) is an interesting one in that it gives a take on the Grindelwald relationship I don't usually see.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293][Realignment]] by Puzzled) is fun bc is forces Dumbledore to be a mentor to a kid he really Does Not Like.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
