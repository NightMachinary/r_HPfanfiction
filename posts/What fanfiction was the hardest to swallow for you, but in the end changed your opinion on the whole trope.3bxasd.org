** Like those who have never read a story with this pairing, I didn't understand/agree with the appeal of Snape/Hermione. However, I'll read anything at least once - if only to see if I can get why people like it (whatever "it" is). To my son, chili looks gross but he should at least actually taste it first to see if he really likes it or not, you know? I am like that with my fanfiction pairings/tropes.

Anyway, I read linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria) and it totally and completely changed my mind about the pairing, which I can now say that I enjoy reading.

Everything listed above is COMPLETE! Some are funny, some are serious, most all are smutty. Yet Everything Stays the Same is amazing. I'm not ashamed to say I may have cried at the end. Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if you are interested. I know most prefer to find completed fics, I know I do! All of these can be found on Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com.

Some of them take place while Hermione is a student, so be mindful of that. I also have a few in PDF for that have since been removed. Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss! This is just a small sampling. I have way more to recommend!

** I absolutely hated self-inserts and thought they were a lazy way to write, but then read linkffn(In Bad Faith). As with everything else, the quality of whatever trope is being used depends on the quality of the writer's skill, at least to me. Self-inserts still seem to be a bit self-centered, but I can see the appeal of it as a way to have a character who knows more than they should.

*** 100% agreed. I was skeptical but I took the suggestion and checked it out. I'm up to the latest chapter now, hoping the author doesn't leave it unfinished. The self insert is done extremely well, I didn't think that was possible! Besides that trope, the author handles other tropes that often become cheesy. The concept of runes is done very well. The background history and pureblood politics actually make sense. The characterization is good and I actually ended up feeling for them.

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.
