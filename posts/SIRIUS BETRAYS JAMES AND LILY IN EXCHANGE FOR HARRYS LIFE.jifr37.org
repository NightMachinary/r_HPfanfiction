:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago where Sirius betrays the potters in exchange for Harrys life. In the fic Sirius doesn't raises harry, Bellatrix does. Harry grows up and goes to hogwarts in a world where Voldemort won and he's friends with Draco. In the story bellatrix is crazy and eventually Voldemort sends bella on a suicide mission against Giants or trolls? (Forgot which one). Voldemort eventually has a meeting with Malfoy and Sirius where he tells them his intention of making Harry his official heir.

(I know my description is all over the place but theres are the points in the fic that pop out the most to me)


** I wish you luck this sounds interesting
