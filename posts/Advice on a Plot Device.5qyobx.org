I was recently thinking about Dementors, and as you know there are a lot of interpretations. HPMOR had them as the specters of death, other had lessor demons, and even a couple had them as protagonists. But for the most part, many fanfic authers have gone with Rowling's interpretation without questioning it, or fleshing it out.

I was thinking about Dementors, and I came to realize that while we know they can breed, we don't actually know where they come from(ignoring the wiki here. Bear with me.) . It was indicated that they are created in places of rot and decay, but I couldn't think of many places like that specifically. Then it hit me. Dementors are not demons, or death. They are the physical avatars of misery and despair, raw emotion and magic molded into a being of terrible power. Then I realized, precisely where they could have spawned. What if the Dementors of Azkaban, were created with the misery and despair of the German Concentration Camps. Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Chelmno, Dachau. The only way to defeat such despair and death, is with a Patronus, a physical manifestation of the hope that despite everything, you can survive. I could go on and on about how this fits neatly into my headcanon, despite evidence to the contrary. But given the sensitive nature of the Holocaust, and it's status as one of the things that no one should take lightly, would it be at all appropriate to write it into a fic? I mean, sure it could be interchanged for less sensitive things like the Battle of the Somme, or something horrible, but I would rather not do such a thing. Advice? Thoughts? Downvotes for a silly idea?


** I rather like fhe idea but don't use auschwitz. Grindlewald would have had his own version of the camps and they could have been born there. Or before then in another form of death camp centuries ago.

*** That is an interesting point. I was envisioning the camps as having a separate section for magicals. The problem is that we don't know enough about Grindelwald. Was he bent on subjugation? Was he bent on extermination? The death camps were meant for killing off an entire ethnicity, and unless Grindelwald had intended wholesale genocide of literally every single wizard, I can't really see him using seperate camps with the small population of the Wizarding World. We know Nurmenguard was built as a prison for political prisoners, but that is the only mention of it. Still, I will continue thinking about your comment.

**** Imagine he captured his enemies and began experimenting on them, preparing them in ways to act as inferii but something went wrong. Or oh so right. And lesser demonic forms were born from the despair and lack of hope he instilled in so many.

** I'd have to ask why the Dementors would be sent to Azkaban in this instance. Dumbledore hates them, and I really don't see him letting anyone using them to torture prisoners right after he defeated Grindelwald and saved Magical Europe. And I don't see anyone willing to oppose him in this situation either. "Hey... that Monster was just beaten... let's duplicate his evil acts by staffing a prison with the Monsters his evil created!" doesn'0t Sound like a good idea.

So, if you want to tie Dementors to KZs, you'll need a very compelling explanation for Dumbledore letting the Dementors be sent to Azkaban. And you'll need an explanation for how Azkaban was run before that, and why they would want to switch.

(It's not entirely without precedent, though - Dachau was used after the war to lock up Nazis. But I doubt that would fit Dumbledore.)

** The concentration camps would certainly fit the theme of overwhelming despair and suffering. What you always need to be careful with when dealing with these themes is to stay respectful to the victims and the subject in general. It sounds simple, but when you post something online and readers from various cultures (who all learned different history) read it, someone taking offense anyway is almost ensured to happen.

To the idea itself, I wouldn't limit yourself to the concentration camps. The trenches of the two World Wars, the Gulags, the genocide of the Armenians,... the 20th century alone isn't short of unspeakable tragedy, and I haven't even looked beyond Europe.

** Personally my favorite explanation on the origin of dementors is that Vernon and Petunia became the first two and bred the rest, as described in linkffn(2630300)

Seems preachy and amateurish. Not thought out as much as it should be.

#+end_quote

You're doing creative writing. You don't need a real place. You've been given a ton of leeway and agency in what you can do to explain away Dementers. You don't need to throw in the holocaust; and you shouldn't, because it sounds cheap like you're trying to mold the horrific to suit your story. Readers will see through it.

You need to approach the topic more naturally instead of forcing Dementer-sized perplexities into /muggle/ tragedies. You can do better. You need to go back to the drawing board.

  Dementers are born from rot and decay
#+end_quote

Okay, that's great. This doesn't mean shower-curtain mold. Because I can, I'm going to extend this description to include the decay of morals; the rot of hope. Shit like that. The catalyst is that something magical MUST happen to cause such an experience to develop into something /more/ than that.

We know it's Canon that Obscurials and Obscurus' exist; Obscurials are children who repress their magic, the magic turns inward and becomes parasitic like an untreated wound, eventually developing into an Obscurus.

Could this sort of thing be involved, or at least /paralelled/ with the creation of Dementers? You bet your ass it can.

Think for a moment about how old magical civilisation /is/. It's got to be multiple-thousand years at least. In that time there will have been Dementers, in that time there have been unimaginable tragedies that involved Wizards and Witches. How did old societies deal with Dementers? Did they have a use, were they once wild, eventually tamed? Maybe one day a Witch or Wizard had a spell get out of control, causing problems with magic itself, leading to the spawning of Dementers.

Or maybe not. Maybe Dementers are just this strange perplexity of unimaginable uselessness. However, like a horrifically terrifying black hole, it has it's uses. Maybe Dementers are like lightning - Magic itself letting lose a negative charge that it might remain neutral. Maybe Dementers have an opposite?

There's just a ton of digging you can do into this stuff when you wrestle with it a little bit.

It's not unprecedented, at least; Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin has it as an explicit part of the plot that the souls of hundreds of thousands of newly dead, despairing due to World War II, inadvertently draw Dracula's Castle into the world a full 55 years ahead of schedule.

If you want to link dementor spawning to despair and horror caused by acts of true evil, as well as the Nazi death camps, I'd also recommend looking into the various genocides committed by the Ottomans during World War I, the Holodomor by the Soviet Union, Pol Pot's regime, the great Chinese Famine...

...Jeez, just how much bloodshed and death was there during the 20th century?

If you look outside that time period, there's the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the bubonic plague/Black Death, various 'native conquests'...

*** That's true enough. Part of the problem is that I want the circumstances to be concentrated (pardon the pun). I am sort of thinking of Dementors as black holes you see. Darkness and despair makes them grow larger, but the absence of it slowly drains away their power. Canonically, they were labeled as breeding during the books and we can extrapolate that to the misery under Voldemort and the terrorist like attacks allowing it. But the Dementors need to be maintained or else they shrivel away. The Black Plague is not visceral to us. Yes it was bad, but it happened a long time ago, its effects have all but disappeared, and when you mention it, it is thought of as a history book issue. Yes, the Black Plague would very likely have created Dementors, but Dementors from the Trail of Tears would be more likely alive than the Black Plague Dementors. I am trying to drive at a very particular concept here. The idea that people suffering leaves it's mark somehow. The Holocaust hits all the markers, because it was a genuine, industrialized and mechanized attempt to systematically destroy an ethnicity. People were worked to death, and executed, and thousands processed in one little place. Dementors are Despair, and Patronus are Hope, similar to how Boggarts are Fear and Ridiculous is Humor. Polar opposites. But in order to beat a Boggart, you have to make it funny. And that is why Azkaban is so much more serious than fanfics portray. Because to defend against a Dementor, you must be able to have hope in the face of the level of despair which spawned it. Azkaban is literally populated by the condensed despair and horrors of history. Holocaust is just the easy target in a way, given how well it fits and how many people know about it. If I said they were spawned from the Rwandan Genocide, then there would be readers scratching their heads, but the Holocaust gets my point across more effectively than anything I can think of. Thanks for the comment and the recommendations, I will be sure to check out the alternatives you suggested.
