Okay, so this was the first fanfic I ever read probably back around 2006. I don't remember many details but here's what I do know:

- I read it on mugglenet.com
- I think it's either a two-parter or trilogy
- Harry has memory loss and forgets that he and Ginny were in love
- Harry dates some other girl
- Ginny tries to stay away from Harry cause she doesn't want to get hurt
- one specific scene I remember: Harry and Ginny riding on a broom with "The Wind Beneath My Wings" playing in the background somehow
- Harry eventually regains his memory and feels really bad about what he's put Ginny through blah blah blah

So yeah...I don't remember details, but I figured I'd give this a shot to see if anyone has any clue what this story is called. I don't even remember if it was any good. I'm just interested to find it again purely for sentimental reasons. Thanks!
