Basically Hermione having the equivalent of [[https://youtu.be/_FikHtrfa_I][this]] scene in booksmart+ the aftermath


** As nice as that would be to see, too many people associate working hard with a great future. Plus, that's the core of Hermione's personality, being the well-read no-nonsense chick. Take that away from her and the negative parts of her personality (being bossy, overbearing and overstepping boundaries) will completely overweigh any positives (her loyalty and caring nature). If everyone can fuck around and get good grades and have a good future then Hermione goes from "Well she's annoying but at least she's smart" to "Who cares if she's smart, she's annoying af".

Even in canon, Bill, Charlie and Tonks were said to be popular to some extent and cool. They worked hard, sure, but that's not all they did. I'm sure there are others in the Trio's age range that are the same but don't get featured for obvious reasons (well, except maybe the twins).

*** I mean you do have very smart people who did like do other things.

Like the Marauders were all very smart good grades did impressive shit with magic not even Hermione did in school so it not like there isn't precedent. I mean Hermione does have a character beyond being smart and she should. I think it a good idea to grow her character in fandom beyond just being the smart one. And i think removing the "smart one" characterization from her does help with that.

There is, but if there's a popular kid that's as smart as Hermione and less annoying, she becomes superfluous to an extent.

Which, imo, is mostly negative. She, JKR and fanfic writers really clutch that "know-it-all" ball. She freaked out when Harry was doing better than her in 6th year and her role is basically exposition.

***** Ok so for example Hermione in book 6 can feel insecure because deep down she feels like the replaceable friend who people liked because she was smart. If her smartness is irrelevant people won't like her and want to be her friend . And now her freaking out becomes sympathetic. Seeing people still want to be friends with her despite her smarts not always being necessary feels kinda compelling.

As for non intelligence aspects of Hermione for example:

Hermione cares alot about people who are left behind by society.

She's the one who found out about Lupins secret and avoided telling people so he wouldn't deal with the stigma. She is most furious when Rita writes that article about Hagrid. She was the one who did all that work trying to prevent Buckbeaks execution. She was the one invested the house elf situation. She cares very deeply about injustices she sees. There are alot of potential things you can do with this aspect of her that's not tied to her being the smart one.

And I do think they come out more if she's not always the smart one. If there are a bunch of other smart characters around her like there is for Molly in Booksmart then other defining qualities around her get to shine. And those will be the things most compelling about her. But they are also the qualities that will more likely be overlooked if she is defined as the smart one. It wouldn't be fair if others got defined based on personality traits while she gets defined by what she can provide. Plus it allows others to be smart too and that can be interesting especially if its characters you are less used to seeing as smart even if they are.

Working hard is necessary for a good future but if you watch the scene you realize that it wasn't as if these other characters never worked hard at studying.

In the scene

Molly is confused she says but you guys don't care about studying.

To which the reply is no we just don't only care about studying.

These other interests hobbies and passions are necessary to be a well rounded person. And being well rounded is necessary in life.

Its also pretty true in life. In my experience most of the smartest kids in school did have other hobbies and passions outside of studies. And I mean smartest gpa and standardized test score wise. The ones who ended up in the prestigious colleges. That's maybe easy to say in highschool since extracurriculars are necessary for college. But that continued to be true in college.

In fact those who only studied seemed to struggle more not because they weren't smart but because they had more difficulty with the stress.

At least in my experience.

*** Well, part of what makes stories compelling is character development, and for Hermione to realise that memorising all the useless trivia or spending inordinate amounts of time over books is not end-all-be-all would be a good piece of it.

You don't need to have her suddenly become stupid, or have others outshine her on pure knowledge, but there are already pieces in the books that kinda pick up on the theme - i.e. the devil's snare scene.

And there are ways to pick up her development from there - i.e. have her devlop some focus instead of simply soaking everything for little gain, find some other hobby than studying (i.e. trying to do fun shit with magic), that sort of stuff.

**** I mean as much as Hermione reading alot is useful to them I don't think it's her most useful skill. Yes she a nerd that reads alot of things. But she's probably not the only nerd reads alot of things. There are probably a ton in school who read alot for the same reasons she does.

Her skill imo is being logical figuring shit out like Snapes logic puzzle in book one. And discovering Rita Skeeter's animagus in book 4. She is the only one to apply Snapes lesson to irl and figure out Lupin is a werewolf. Thats where she excels and yes its intelligence but its a specific kind thats useful in specific situations.

She not the big picture strategy person. That's Ron which is why he is the one who immediately sees why knocking out the Troll is a bad idea in book 7 while Hermione doesn't.

Its not understanding people either which is why she struggles to help the Houseelves. Not because her goal is wrong but she goes about it the wrong way. Its why Harry is the one to understand what the hell Dumbledore wants them to do in book 3 before Hermione.

Its also why magic thats not purely logical like the patronus or divination doesnt come as easily to her ( also possibly defense against the dark arts its hard to say since you dont know enough about the subject but Harry does better at magic you have to understand in different ways not just logically and he does better in Defense than her. The dark arts also seem to have a emotional aspect to them or at least the unforgivables do and my bet is Harry would be better at casting them). She gets better over time at understanding people but it's not where she shines.

And as you saw in those examples Hermiones brand of intelligence isn't always the relevant one. To be fair the others having intelligence or knowledge didn't feel threatening to her before book 6. It wasn't as if she saw Harry flying and got mad he excelled in a type of magic she couldn't. And in book 5 she's the one who goes to him to teach DADA. She acknowledges he's better than her and doesn't have a meltdown over it. So you could say book 6 was ooc.

But you could argue maybe her skills were usually important and useful in books 1-5 before this point and if there were more situations where they weren't shed have reacted similarly. Its not intelligence persay but insecurity about not feeling useful. The book you could argue is more directly challenging her skills in a way the others don't. Since another 16 year old ( since Snape was 16 when he wrote in it) logicked out a better way to do the potion with the same available information. It was just specifically in potions but still.

In which case she still has to learn the lesson that she is more than the smart one she deserves to be their friend even when her skillset isn't the one being useful. Or someone ( or in this case something) is equally as useful as her in the area she excels in. Which could be interesting growth for her.

Hermione as I pointed out was not smart in the way Harry and Ron were. She also was not an inventor the way Fred and George were. She was always smart in a very specific way. So it very honestly makes sense to not give her the smart one designation. Because she isn't the only smart one.

But that doesn't mean she's not smart. Removing that designation isn't about diminishing her in anyway but about acknowledging the intelligence of the rest. And making plot points in stories that let you acknowledge and celebrate that intelligence.

Which then also allows Hermione's charscter more free to explore more aspects than just the intelligence part. Which ties into the her realizing she didn't always have to be grinding like that to be successful and useful and prompts her to try to do other things. Things that aren't necessarily connected to her being smart.
