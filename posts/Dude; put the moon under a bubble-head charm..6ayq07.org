There you go, the moon now has an atmosphere.

Just an idea that seemed too good not to share. If wizards ever needed to escape earth they could just build massive runic arrays to permanently terraform the moon like this.

** They probably considered it, but then realized that the moon is a big pile of dust with nothing to offer. Europa has worked out much better so far.

**** Assuming it's possible to magically give the entire solar system an atmosphere ex nihilo it might not be a good idea. That's a, a, I actually don't have a word for how much mass that would be adding to the system. I have no idea what impact that would have on orbits, or if the sun would just combust all of it immediately. Terraforming should have as far reaching of consequences though.

***** Now that's an interesting question. Assuming the bubble-head charm just simulates earth-atmosphere what you would essentially have is a copy of that everywhere, and while we don't notice that it weighs quite a bit.

But yeah there would probably be loads of unforeseen consequences, for one it probably only simulates atmosphere close to earth-surface, since it needs to be breathable by humans, so there wouldn't be an ozone-layer, although maybe one would form?

You're right, it seems like the field of magical tarraforming might be in need of a little more detail than "stick a bubble-head charm on it and Bob's you uncle" after all.

****** I'm no physics and this seems like a good question for [[/r/askscience]] but the first thing that comes to my mind is that /if/ the buble head charm is filled with 'atmosphere' or 'breathable air' that a metric fuck ton of gas that would probably be pulled towards the sun (via gravity) increasing it's mass (and it's heat) boiling earth oceans or worst case scenario it goes super nova and obliterates five-sixths of the solar system

******* IIRC there was a thread on [[/r/askscience]] a long time ago that said that if entire solar system had an atmosphere, the sun would be louder than a train less than a foot away from our heads

***** Um. Radiation (light) carries heat very slowly. solar-system atmosphere means that now sun's heat is carried by convection. we cook to death quickly.

Also Even assuming at creation of bubble, the air created is moving at the correct orbital velocity at each point... you're gonna get all kinds of fun drag. death spiral into the sun, anyone?

** Runic arrays aren't a thing in Canon

Also putting a bubble head around your head is multiple orders of magnitude different than putting bubble head around roughly the surface area of Asia

** I'd use smaller ones to act as emergency backup for moonbases.

That said, I thought they worked by filtering oxygen from the water and air on the outside of the bubble, and therefore would not continue to work in a vacuum.

The real munchkin-spell for space travel is the Undetectable Extension Charm. I have virtually unlimited launch mass and volume for the price of the volume and mass of a suitcase. The tyranny of the rocket equation is broken. Space travel almost free. Population pressure problem solved. Food production problem solved. Instant post-scarcity golden age. This is one of the many, many reasons that the statute of secrecy pisses me off so much.
