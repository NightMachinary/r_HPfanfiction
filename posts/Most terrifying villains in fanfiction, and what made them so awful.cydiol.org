** The Voldemort in linkao3(Patron) is playful, sadistic, brutal, and competent in a really engaging way. I guess I wasn't terrified of him but when I think of "best villain in FF" that's my go to.

The mystery villain in linkffn(Soul Thief) was pretty terrifying in their ability to get to anyone and make each murder look like something it wasn't.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary - By Arabella]]) has diary Tom Riddle as the villain and he's terrifying because of how similar he is to a real life predator interacting with a little kid. It does really well at invoking adult fear.

** I'd say the HPMoR villain is the one I'd least want to oppose.

Scarily powerful, figures things out about yourself before you do, always a step ahead and he created the Voldemort persona just because being good was too boring.

** linkAo3(Light in the Darkness by Sigrun23) The villain just seems so... /Human/. He's not like those over-the-top evil psychopaths in a lot of other stories, he's got a realistic (But pretty horrible) motive. It's just... Horrifying
