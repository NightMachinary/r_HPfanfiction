For those people who are searching for a good Harry/fem Riddle fic, the fic I am going to share is exactly for you. I have read almost every Harry/fem-Riddle fic and I can attest to the fact that this is the best.

The fic is Power of Love by 1valor1.

** I've read all of Valor's works along with many other fics --- good and bad. I have never disliked something that he's put out and Power of Love is definitely my favorite of his works.

*** Just heard an interview with the author & he says he thinks it will end up being something like a million words long, so he's got a long, long way to go.

*** I am a mod on his server and I can tell it will take still quite a bit but it is still worth a read at this point. It is fucking awesome. He also writes up 10k words per week over all of them.
