If you haven't read it it is an time travel back to mauraders era except Harry is dead set on NOT changing anything and ends up pretending to be a squib and is taken in by Aberforth. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410]]. Really read it, it's amazin.

If you have read and seen anything like it please tell me! not specifically the premise but the tone and generally any recs since I would like if I like this.


** Thedivinecomedian had the same sort of tone. I adored the Second String and went on to read TDC's work soon after and found the same level of incredible writing and characterisations as on TSS.

Theire stories are like little jigsaw puzzles you have to put together. And they have perfectly nailed the feeling of Fear and Boggarts it's incredible.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

** There's one that Lomonaaeren is currently posting linkao3(20886212), it's different in tone, and has an adult Harry, but it addresses different timelines and alternate dimensions in an interesting way

  Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived.

*** Mainly I adore Harry goes back in time/AU and have him be an adult or not on hogwarts. I don't really like “Harry goes to hogwart with the mauraders” mainly because I like DH!Harry who has all the future knowledge
