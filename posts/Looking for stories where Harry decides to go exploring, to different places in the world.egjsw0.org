It can be after the war (Either canon or AU in that regard, with the war). It can be an exchange program, or for Auror business, or he just wants to explore.

Going to America, Japan, China, Mexico, Switzerland, et cetra, going to jungles, beaches, maybe exploring for artifacts or animals/plants or just having a fun time with life.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

NO Weasley bashing please

Can be on fanfiction.net or another site

Would rather not have Lord Potter-Malfoy-Black, Harem Harry or super OP Harry.

I'd rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

It can be as canon or as AU as possible.


** Make A Wish by Rorschach Blot has what you're after... sort of... [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885609/1/Finding-a-Place-to-Call-Home]]) This is a Harry/Astoria (underused pairing imo) where they go to all sorts of places. Don't know about all the places you mention but I know for sure that they go to Switzerland.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]]) This fic is not even close to finished but they are just now starting to go exploring the world. I just reccomend this one because it's really good :D

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

*** Have to take back my recommendation of Finding a Place to Call Home. I just read it because I knew that I hadn't finished it the first time around and now i know again why I didn't. The first 4 chapters are pretty good although they do contain some bashing. After that it's just a downward spiral of introducing a Mary-Sue OC and even more bashing...I do wonder how an author can go from the premise of 2 people exploring the world to a bashing fest that plays out mostly in britain.
