** It seems pretty clear that it's a kind of authority-based magic. Voldemort didn't have the Taboo put in place until he'd completely taken over the Ministry. Can't think of any times that was really explored in a story though.

****** Presumably he just killed people who did because he thought it was a good way of building up his mystiques. True Name and so on.

There /is/, however, a very amusing (in a bittersweet way) one-shot fanfic where it all started in the very beginning of his campaign as an act of /defiance/. He proclaimed himself Lord Voldemort, and one journalist said: /obviously that's an alias; he's usurping a title to sound powerful and grand; calling him that would be humoring him and we don't want that. Only we have no idea what his REAL name is. So let's only ever refer to that maniac as You-Know-Who, What's-His-Name, etc. until he gives up and gives us his real name./

It stuck, and as more and more headlines like "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Slaughters Family" and "You-Know-Who's Latest Mass Murder" started coming in, people stopped seeing any humor at all in the names.

(The journalist was later murdered in his own home.)

****** In The One He Feared (link in OP), I put forward the idea that the press and the Ministry cottoned on to the fact that there was a single person behind the various deaths and disappearances which preceded Voldemort's first rise. But because Voldemort had not yet revealed himself, no-one had any idea who it was. So the papers started referring to this mysterious serial killer as "You Know Who".

Basically, he was a boogeyman before he was a terrorist.

**** Most likely it's the latter. As a comparison, remember when Snape grabbed the Marauder's Map? He thought that by telling the map he was a professor of the school and thus had authority there, the map had to listen to his demands to reveal its secrets. Or how Hogwarts itself locked the Headmaster's office from being entered by Umbrige because she lacked the authority as it's true head.

***** Considering the Marauder's Map contains copies of the Marauders themselves, I always thought that this passage was Snape hoping that said possibly-sentient recordings would obey. I could be wrong on this one, though.

Umbridge being locked out of her office, however, I'm confident is kind of a counterexample --- she had the official authority but the magical being wouldn't acknowledge her. And unless I'm mistaken, it's the Stairwell Gargoyle that kept her out, rather than sentient-Hogwarts itself.

Umbrige didn't have the authority. The Ministry was attempting to install her, she wasn't put in by the Board of Governors or given it by the previous Head. The text says "The office locked her out" (paraphrasing).

Yes, but is it because the position holds inherent magic powers? Or because he knows the Map is kinda-sentient, and made by Hogwarts student who /might/ obey such authority?

As for Umbridge... hm, perhaps the fact that due form wasn't respected mattered. But I stand by the fact that the most effective way Hogwarts could have locked her out was through the Gargoyle refusing her entry. What else do you figure happened?

** My theory is that it's some sort of pre-existing structure or spell that the ministry controls, but it can only hold one word at a time.

And during the first war with voldemort it was set to something only death eaters would say.. mosmodre. Thats why pretty much the moment barty crouch cast the dark mark at the world cup a dozen aurors popped in and attacked the location.

Voldemort merely repurposed the taboo when he took power.

***** The only thing that doesn't perfectly fit with this theory is why in HBP when Draco sends up the Dark Mark do aurors not arrive on the scene immediately?

However that is relatively easy to explain away that Hogwarts is exempt from this taboo. Either due to strong ancient magical protections that the Ministry can't break through or that it's exempt because someone might say it in a class to teach what DE's used.

****** Hogwarts protections always seemed to be talked about with greater awe than anywhere else, it's not hard to imagine that the taboo doesn't have the strength to punch through Hogwarts. The aurors might have known it was there, but had no way of getting there quick enough to matter. It's also conceivable that hogwarts was built and protected first and the Taboo was never able to spread to hogwarts in the first place.

** I think, when explaining why it is not used more, you need only consider the uproar a similar power would cause in the Muggle world. The monitoring of certain words as uttered by any person, anywhere, is an extremely invasive, authoritarian measure. Many citizens would oppose it.

Often when people look for limitations to magic, they fail to consider the human/social/political element: that just because something is magically possible, it does not mean that people would consent to its use. Similar things can be said for the use of veritaserum.

****** You're right that it does not pierce the Fidelius (Grimmauld Place in DH). This does make a fair amount of sense: the Fidelius is not a spell on a location as such, but rather on a secret, which is contained within a person's soul. So there's nothing to collapse.

Essentially the Taboo works as normal, it's just that a) there's no protective enchantment on the location, so the Fidelius is unaffected and b) due to the continued efficacy of the Fidelius, the Taboo (not being a secret keeper) is unable to convey the location information to the Ministry.

Incidentally, mechanics like this are the reason why I think it's better to think of protective enchantments as exactly that, rather than the fanon "wards". "Wards" have connotations that cause readers to imagine shield-like protective spells over a physical area, whereas in HP, protecting a location can take quite a few different forms. For example, it's clear that there's no permanent protective shield around Hogwarts (because Flitwick had to cast one in DH). Rather I suspect that the walls of Hogwarts are themselves enchanted to resist both magical and physical damage, which in combination with the "no-flying" enchantment acts as an effective measure against trespass.

He does. Indeed, in the book the spell is cast only by Flitwick. He just goes to a window and casually casts a Shield Charm over all of Hogwarts. BAMF.

** I suspect the Taboo was a large map, much like the Marauders Map. When the name is said an X appears on the map at the location it was spoken with the name of the person who said it.

Over time this would show trails and highlight hotspots for enemy activity.

The map gets cluttered occasionally and has to be erased to make room for more X's to appear.

I imagine the map itself is the floor of a room.

** For my headcanon, it's not a spell but an artifact that requires sacrifices to power it. In some versions it's a chalkboard and/or map, in others it's a room where snatchers sit and wAit until they're sent off then next group steps in to wait for transmission.

The sacrifices are why it's not used by the ministry to counter the use of the unforgiveables.
