Since in the books it seemed that robes were meant to be really baggy and long/covering


** I am your average bloke so I am generally really not interested in fashion. For me it is enough if the body is sufficiently covered against external factors (or not), and that's it. Usually, I just skip over long and long paragraphs of description of hero's and mostly heroine's dress for the next event. However, I was intrigued by linkffn(12713828), where [[/u/Taure]] really developed full independent fashion culture, where all those robes etc. made sense even to me.
