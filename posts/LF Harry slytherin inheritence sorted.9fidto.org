Hi I am looking for all the fanfiction with :

- Harry sorted in slytherin (and acting slytherin so no gryffindor idiot who knows less than a mudblood of the wizarding world )
- Harry aware of his inheritances
- Traditions, custom, ancient and noble house, ...


** You'd probably get better responses if you weren't replying in-character as a Death Eater and calling non-magical-folk mudbloods.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** linkffn(8195669) - Gets old, Slash TMR/HP. Very... dark? I wouldn't say that but the whole story is centering around supposedly Harry who would be the next Dark Lord. It got old in the end for me but eh

linkffn(12388283) - Personal Favourite, H/Hr. Doesn't really have all the title but a really good Slytherin!Harry fic.

Can't really name any other fics from the top of my head, will probably comment again if I can think of some.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
