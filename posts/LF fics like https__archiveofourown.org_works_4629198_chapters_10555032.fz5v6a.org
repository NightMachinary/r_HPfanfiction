*** I know. I feel like the author just used the hp setting as the magic was basically completely original and so was the space exploration. Its basically a novel with hp and marvel dumped in . I hust skipped most of the hermoine interactions until mid part 3

** I just binged that as well thanks to a recommendation on here and was left similarly wanting more. While not all exactly what you asked for these are fics that have been on my mind since finishing the series.

linkao3(Island of Fire by esama) -- A group is relocated by an accident in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. They end up on a deserted island and have to build their own society.

linkao3(Again and Again by athy) -- So this is slash and incomplete (not necessarily abandoned the author has posted after long gaps before). I don't want to spoil the story but it's a good read and they touch on being discovered and have good world building

linkffn(*On An Island In The Sun* By Rorschach's Blot) -- It's a crackfic but Harry gets fed up with magical britain so he makes his own island /society

â€‹

The island of fire below is the translation for some reason, but they have a link the the original at the top of the fic

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.
