We're currently running the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/dlp-competition-winning-entries-info.38401/][DLP Story Competition]] every quarter, where authors can have the opportunity to put out their writing without any real strings attached and receive some helpful critique from the community. We had a pretty nice turnout last time (11 entries!), and we're hoping to match, or beat that this time around.

If you think it's daunting, there's not much to worry about. All entries are anonymous, so your entry will be judged and critiqued without any real bearing on yourself. The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326122/1/][winner of last quarter's competition]] was a completely new face, so don't get discouraged by your possible unfamiliarity with the forum.

linkffn(13326122)

If you're interested in entering, you've got until *9 September* (a bit more than two months) to flesh out an idea and scrape together a story less than *17 500 words* (no minimum).

There's two prompts (again) this quarter:

- *Ritual magic*

- *What professors get up to in the summers*

*[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/q3-2019-story-competition.38578/][Link to the Q3 competition]]* (you need an account to view it)

There's no real bearing if you lose or win the competition, but every entry in the end comes with heaps of useful critique, and comes with an opportunity to help you improve and grow as a writer. Entries are anonymous, so you won't be judged even if yours is less than stellar.

Hoping to see a good turnout!


** The winner was pretty good but I really enjoyed Ice Cream linkffn(13323518) a lot more. If only I had 1/10th of writing talent these authors have.
