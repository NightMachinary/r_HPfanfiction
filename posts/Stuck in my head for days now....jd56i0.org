:END:
So this fic has been stuck in my head for days and all i can remember is it was at least a Harry/Hermione/Daphne and that Susan Bones polyjuiced as Hermione and tried to talk to Daphne but Daphne couldn't because it was like the fidelius secret or something and she physically could not speak aloud and found out that wasn't Hermione

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
