A friend has recommended a story, unfortunately all she can remember about it is that it features a Sirius escaping from Askabibble and finding a magical cave.

Any suggestions for that and any other good escaping and not-at-all-dead Sirius fics?


** Askabibble?

*** It's like Azkaban, but with fanatical preachers instead of dementors. Not only do they suck all joy out of life, they also slowly transform you into one of them. The prison is reserved only for really deranged criminals.

** .... I'm fairly certain that Sirius hiding in a cave was in fact canon.

But anyway, here linkffn(662406)

**** Alas no, this is a cave with magical artifacts not the cave with hot and cold running rats he hides in near Hogsmeade. Thanks for trying though
