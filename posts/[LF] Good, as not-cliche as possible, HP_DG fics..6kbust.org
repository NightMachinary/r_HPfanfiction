The title says it all. I am looking for good Haphne fics. I have read some of these, a handful actually, and so far it's my favourite pairing. I really enjoyed Runic Animagi and Thanks to a Snake. But fics like Midnight Flies and Midnight Folies are...cringy.

Either way, feel free to recommend whatever you think will be a good HP/DG read. I will take a loko at anything you guys consider good.


** Good fucking luck.

But try these out: linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-Dude; Unatoned by SeriousScribble)

*** Good fucking luck indeed. Why does this pairing always get feutured in crappy stories? Really. It has so much potential, especially for a political centred Harry or a more neutral Harry. But it always gets fucked over by not so good writting and just throwing cliches in without twisting them to make a good story.

I do admit. I have read exceptions. But I am out of those and thus searching again.

Thanks for the recomendation. The first one doesn't look that appealing, mainly cause I never really liked post-Hogwarts fics, but I will surely give it a try.

Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

Friendship, not romance, but I think this might have some of what you're looking for.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11816264/1/Not-Quite-So-Boring]])

Long, a bit rambling in parts, and currently unfinished (hasn't been updated for almost seven months), but well-written with a lot of unconventional pairings. Its merits outweigh its flaws, in my opinion.
