In a previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4nn5by/any_fics_where_dumbledore_doesnt_care_and_enters/][thread]] [[/u/bulletfreak]] asked for a Dumbledore competing in the TriWizard tournament. This got me thinking and now I have a challenge.

Voldemort instructs Crouch to put in the names of the Headmasters/Headmistresses to distract the tournament officials. Fudge in his infinite incompetence decides to make the tournament waaaay crazier and has the challenges be obscenely difficult. Then during/after the third task Crouch grabs Harry and graveyard scene ensues (you can choose to have Harry live or die).


** I would rather see a fic where both Dumbledore and a resurrected Voldemort and Grindelwald(? Or Aberforth? Harry?) Are all forced into the tournament. (The cup is a binding contract on the schools, including all students in all 3 schools, which is why they dont just kill V for showing up.

*** That's insane but I love it, although I'd like to see both. Although what is your justification for that? Also who's to stop an outsider from killing Voldemort, a team of powerful wizards, Voldemort can't kill any students nor can he tell anyone to. So these Wizards (who are hired by someone on the outside, Dumbledore can subtly hint at killing Voldemort) attack Voldemort and he's too arrogant to expect that and bam he's dead and because he doesn't compete, he loses his magic and he's no longer a credible threat.

**** Yeah, it would be a bit contrived to figure out some of the logic of why just about anyone would follow along. The Goblet of Fire would be working overtime as a plit device.
