"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."

"You have his key, Sir?"

"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

Instead of taking Harry down to the vaults what if the banker goblin knew that Harry Potter had never been to the bank before (because lets be real he is famous enough, and the bankers probably know who comes into the bank and who doesn't) and like a normal bank they don't just let orphan's do whatever they want without going over anything or making them sign paperwork. Maybe a will reading takes place? Maybe a finical advisor is given to Harry? Either way it is a neutral place for Harry to ask questions about the magical world, which he has no idea existed before.

** It's unlikely that they didn't know that he had never come to the bank before. It's more like they just didn't care. They've been shown to not care at all about wizards; why would they care in particular for an orphan boy, even if he's famous and fairly wealthy? Goblins are greedy and resentful of wizards, and at the same time, the banking industry really is a captive market. The goblins don't need to be polite, they don't need to care.

Also, James and Lily were very young when they went into hiding. They probably hadn't even thought about having a will made, and when they were forced into hiding, didn't have enough time to make one.

** People seem to forget what a bank is doing.

They manage money.

If you want a will read, go see the family Solicitor

None of these are a banks job though. If my parents opened a savings account for me at a real bank and then passed away I wouldn't go to a bank for either of these.

*** The thing is, as far as I can tell Gringots is not a bank, it is a storage and service company that focusses on money and valuable objects. It is like how PayPal is not a bank, everyone uses it as a bank but really it is a money transferal service and the laws and regulations controlling banks don't effect PayPal.
