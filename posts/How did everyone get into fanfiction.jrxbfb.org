I'm wondering how everyone got into fanfiction as I know a lot of people are out of by rumors that's fanfics are just poorly written porn and others try to read it but find a really bad fic and I got lucky as the first fic I found was a marauders plan by cat are cool (don't know how to link) then after that I had standards that made me quit if the fic was bad what about everyone else


** I got fed up of waiting for GRRM to write a new ASOIAF book back in 2016. Then I got fed up of waiting for ASOIAF fanfic writers to write a new chapter for their fanfics in 2019, so decided to start reading HP fanfics.

** I started in 2001 in FF.net, I think the harry potter entry had 200 pages max. I didn't knew english at all at the time, and I had an older friend translate and read to me the fics, but she never translated the smut part(I was 13). That why I now can read in english. I miss lots of fics from the old(pre-2003) FF.net. *I read the first 2 parts of Cassandra Clair fic, still remember some parts of that fic.

** Harry Potter fic, about 20 years ago. Let's just say that I learned a lot of very interesting things and that reading fic should not serve as anyone's sex education because I had some really wrong ideas about how sex worked thanks to reading fic (and my state's abysmal sex education program that mostly amounted to “don't have sex or you‘ll get pregnant”). Anyway, years later I realized that I'm asexual and I no longer read smutty fics out of confused curiosity.

** Zootopia. I needed to see Nick and Judy in a relationship. It then changed to Marvel and Twilight, and now finally, Harry Potter.

*** Lucky! I was so young I didn't know such a thing as FanFiction existed. Poor 11 year old me.

**** You know, I used to find fanfiction weird because all of my run-ins with it were of people writing things about /real/ people. Like, you do you, but it's a little weird that people write sexual fantasies and the like about actual people. Just keep it in your head, folks. (And I know that it's not always smut fics.)

Your comment actually reminded me that my first actual run-in with fanfiction was when I was thirteen or fourteen. I was reading a book on Wattpad and only realized that it was a fanfiction about halfway through when they mentioned One Direction performing. I was a really odd kid who knew of One Direction, had heard about two of their songs, and never cared to learn their names.

** I accidentally came across it... That was horrible for my 11 year olds self who didn't know what these things were.

And I was incredibly confused about the fact that I didn't remember a detailed love triangle between Draco, Harry and Daphne.

** One of the first stories I read was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124), which persuaded me quite firmly, that it is possible to write well even for the amateur author.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** I remember being on a YouTube video and an ad for Wattpad came on. I was really into reading books and thought it was just books online so I downloaded the app and ended up finding a fanfiction on the labyrinth and that's how it all started. Now I dont read real books anymore I just read/wright fanfiction now

** There was a HP fan site where group of dozen or so people were producing extremely fast fan translations of the books as soon as the original versions came out. At the time I didn't know English and couldn't be patient when HBP came out, so while I was searching about news regarding the translation I found that fan site and the site also had a section for fanfiction. That was how I first got a clue that there was a such thing as fanfiction.

Naturally the amount of fics (and most likely their quality) were abysmal so I put fanfiction out of my mind.

It was years later I got into fanfiction, along the years I learned English and while thinking about a what-if scenario about some fandom I'm not sure about now, it popped in my head that fanfiction existed and it was possible someone else might have wondered about the same what-if and wrote about it.

After finding ffn and the sheer amount of fics there were I was sold.

** The emptiness after DH is released. I mean, well yeah the surviving characters are mentioned to be living happily(-ish) but there's simply no full-length additional content (Fantastic Beasts was only an extra book at that time) to look forward to. I /heard/ about fanfiction when some fraud publish random fanfics as "leaked DH", so I thought "meh, just hack writers?", but then I stumble upon some good enough (for me, at the time) materials like wish fulfillment fic or fan wank.

The idea that I can get /free/ reading materials that just tickle my fancy, readable on my crappy phone even when I don't have an internet connection, enough for hours or even days ensuring I never get bored even with mere ~10 MBs of download is so mindblowing I actually look forward to long trips, something I really dreaded before because either my phone will run out of battery, stuck in a blank spot, or I'd have exhausted all the songs I bring with me.

I actually prefer fanfic to stories with original settings and characters back then, since the hassle of remembering which one is which and figuring out the overarching plots force me to trudge through pages of books before the meaty plot, while fanfics got the luxury of going full plot right from the first page. Sure, /now/ I know several original writers who can write such a page-turner, but back then I can just download random fics that have enough followers and usually enjoy it well enough.

As the honeymoon phase passed, I become more selective, and rather annoyed when a fic with good start suddenly broke down in the middle. TVTropes fanfic recs was my go-to portal to find the good stuff, and later on, I stumble on this very subreddit.

** I was 13 and had just finished watching an old 90s cartoon and was saddened that the series ended on a cliffhanger. Then I thought about some of the plotholes/character expansion the series didn't touch upon and wondered if anyone else noticed it, so I searched online and discovered FFN, circa mid-2011. After reading a ton of fanfics I decided to give writing a shot and created an account in early 2012.

I bounced from my first fandom to Winx Club, Kim Possible, Hunger Games, Star vs the Forces of Evil, some other childhood favourites then finially HP in late 2017/early 2018, which I remembered reading up to Sirius' death when I was little and chose to swear off it forever lol. The fandom is very diverse and there's (generally) something for everyone.

** I heard about My Immortal, so looked it up. I couldn't find it however as by that point it has been removed, but by then I had started checking out Hp fanfiction on Fanfiction.Net.

Not sure what fics interested me at first, but eventually I stumbled upon a Harry/Daphne fic and have been into that ship ever since.

** I was trying to find the Harry Potter books on line without having to pay for it ( I don't remember which book it was) but I do remember I didn't have any money to pay for it the actual book and I thought - If you can watch movies online for free, why not read books online for free? (I even thought it might be easier) With an extensive google/yahoo/askjeeves search I found [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I got so excited because at first glance I thought that the fics were all written by J.K (I was a idiot, I know) Anywho, that's how I started reading fanfiction! :)

** I had read every single Star Wars EU novel I could get my hands on and still wanted more. Found fanfic through some fan websites. Couldn't tell you what my first HP fanfic was, but I did find my old ffn profile recently and based on my favorites list I had very low standards 20 years ago.
