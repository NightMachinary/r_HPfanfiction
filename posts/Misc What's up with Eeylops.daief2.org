I know there's a pun or an anagram or something in there somewhere, but I'm dashed to heck if I can see what it is.

Any ideas, folks?


** -ops comes from the Ancient Greek for eye. Eeylops sounds like eye-lops - eye-eye, something to do with how owls have particularly good sight? Also, the more I'm saying Eeylops the more it's beginning to sound like Owlops in a weird accent.

*** Owl ops could would vaguely like Eyelops in a harsh northern Irish tone? Like hammer up to Sam Neill in Peaky blinders levels

**** *Aye-aye*

The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is a long-fingered lemur, a strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar with rodent-like teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger.

It is the world's largest nocturnal primate. It is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole in which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called percussive foraging, and takes up 5--41% of foraging time.
