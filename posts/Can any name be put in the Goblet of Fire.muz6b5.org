Like, if they put Tom Marvolo Riddle, but it wasn't Voldemort himself who wrote in the parchment, would the goblet still choose him?


** I was under the impression Crouch ripped off Harry's name from one of his essays or something, you know, because then it was Harry himself who signed it.

** Of course, that's exactly what happened to Harry, wasn't it?

** In normal circumstances, I would guess that the Goblet has some kind of restriction so only a "student" can be chosen. Without it, it would be totally possible for a Headmaster to put his own name before destroying the competition (which probably happened in the past if the rule was not included from the start). But I'm not sure this kind of rule would still apply after Crouch "fooled" the Goblet.

Concerning your question, I think the name need to be written by the would be participant, though I don't remember if it's clearly said in canon or just implied. In any case, it should not be impossible for someone to find an old Riddle signature, like an exam he took part while a student or just a letter sent to a "friend".

** It's not specified how the goblet works. How does it even know that you are the most suitable candidate? I'd tend to go with [[/u/Riddle-in-a-Box]]'s assumption. In fact even in-universe, I doubt many people know how the goblet works considering that it hadn't been used in 200 years and likely no one alive who had seen it at work or enchanted it was around anymore... unless, of course, the goblet was something created specifically for that Triwizard Tournament and the schools had other ways to select the champions in the past. In which case, it would make sense that Barty Crouch Sr created it and, being under the Imperius curse by Voldemort, he could make it however he wanted it to.

** I think they have to be a student, considering they also have to put what school they're from.

** What would happen if you put joke names in, like Mike Oxlong or Biggus Dickus

** Nope, only if the paper with the name on it was written by himself, you cant write someone elses name and have it binding, (else the world would be completely broken) but if you got a paper with someones name that they wrote themselves? Yup, throw that sucker in.

..perhaps the RoR has old asignments the students/teachers have throw away, with their names on it? Would probaly be the easiest way of getting Riddles name.
