Some of our fanfic writers are geniuses and are writing some of the best stories out there. Do they ever write stories with original characters? What is a good forum to read them? How do people discover such stories? Do they use their fanfic writing names (if so, easier to access) or do they change them?

I would love to hear what fanfic writers say, and how they feel about the loss of the HP world and its communities when writing these stories.

PS: Also, where I can read the stories :)


** Many of the more talented and known authors are actually published. Arsinoe de Blassenville, Silens Cursor, Cassandra Clare come to mind.

You can find original works on Amazon. They typically use their real name, but I've seen many promote their short story/novella/trilogy on their Fanfiction.Net profile or other forums like here and DLP with links to the stories.

** Joe Ducie, who gave us The Hero Trilogy, the Time Duology and An Unfound Door, is published. He still updates his fan fiction work on DLP to boot.

One might assume that original work is an aspiration for most fanfic authors. I know that I want to get stuck into my graphic novel projects fairly soonish, but still have my fics to finish, too, so I don't intend on leaving the community until I'm long dead, haha.

*** I've been thinking about the difference between published fiction and fan fiction. Published fiction is curated by the publishers so it limits the range and style of stories you can tell. On the other hand, fanfiction has more room and an audience. Finding an audience for your own fiction outside curated space may be tricky. So some may not want to write outside fanfic. What do you think?

**** I agree - I mean, JKR was rejected how many times? D:

On the upside, the self-publishing option is becoming more viable by the minute. For content creators, fictional or otherwise, the Internet is replete with avenues in which one can find and keep an audience. Going through "proper channels" is still probably the easiest way to gain exposure, but no one should feel discouraged from forging their own path.

Not to say it wouldn't be an ordeal, of course!

** Original fiction is where I'm aiming for, and I write it for pleasure but don't do anything with it yet. I use fanfic to practice writing, hopefully I'll get to a high enough standard to publish some day.

** I may not exactly be a well-loved fanfic writer or anything (yet!), but I write original stories all the time. However, I do it for my own pleasure and I don't post them anywhere. They're probably not good enough for publication, but certainly the same or better quality as the fanfiction I write, so the idea of a forum is very interesting.

Creating my own worlds is very fun and actually easier in a way. I don't have to find ways around existing HP magic like I do in fanfiction. I'm free to define what magic can and can't do, if I decide to use it in a story.

It's not very active as far as I can tell, but if you want to read original stories (not necessarily by HP writers, but fic writers in general), check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Original%20Work/works][this]] which is the AO3 original works tag. Can't vouch for the quality though.

** u/__Pers:
#+begin_quote
  Do they ever write stories with original characters?
#+end_quote

While I'm neither a writing genius nor well-loved, I'd say that several fanfiction writers do. I've published over twenty pieces of short fiction (a few of which are in "pro" markets) and I've a novel that I'm shopping around. I've also published more than one hundred scientific papers (which don't really count--while there's drama and tension, the characters are flat and uninspired).

#+begin_quote
  Also, where I can read the stories :)
#+end_quote

Jbern published two anthologies of (original) short stories (his /Horror Humor and Heroes/ series) with fanfiction writers. DLP has also published five anthologies of short fiction by site members.

**** Not really, as it's just a day job (theoretical physicist) and I've been at it for over twenty years. All told, 5-6 papers a year is not particularly remarkable.

** At that point, they start posting original works. I think two or three of my favorite authors were in college when they moved into original content. They don't have time/interest in writing fanfiction. Fanfiction is commonly seen as a stepping stone for an aspiring author.

A story that I think could be tweaked into original content is called The Beggar-Thief if the romance was taken out and more introduction was fashioned to restructure the magical society.

And then there is the best known example of 50 Shades of Grey, which is a repurposed Twilight smut.

** I have trouble with creating original characters. (And I get bogged down with worldbuilding.) Fan fiction lets me concentrate on the parts I enjoy a bit more. The tradeoff is I'm not getting better at those parts.

I can get around it by making a melange world with melange characters.

** I'm currently writing a story about a boy who is coming to terms with his homosexuality. I have only drafted it, but I'm excited to write something of my own. :) From others, I assume it's the same name/linked from fics.
