By 'not too deep', I mean that I don't want a work of art like HPMOR (that fic on top of HP-Fanfiction with scientist harry or something). I don't want to enrich myself with new concepts of science, I don't want to increase my vocabulary and I don't want a revolutionary depressing work to give my cold heart hypothermia.

I don't want fucking politics where the MC is forced to play nice due to the threats of old bastards, I don't want a romance where a annoying bitch is shoved down the readers throat and we have to stomach it. A harem is okay as long as the bitches are paper-thin.

Just recommend me a work where the MC grows stronger by learning magic and it is well used in battle. I don't mint if the MC is fucking godlike as long as he graphically nukes every enemy. I don't mind if it is a SI, Hermione or Harry, I just want a protagonist that learns magic and fucking uses it. If he gets a Magical Trunk, that Trunk better break a few Death Eater heads.

Huh. It was actually much harder finding relevant stories than I thought. Most of the curbstompy ones in my favourites are crossovers that take place post-Hogwarts, so Harry isn't learning new magic very much.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

***** Thanks for the recs. Betrayed had a nice prologue, but after that it seems more slice of life and less action. Also it is old, and old betrayal stories have a tendency of making Harry forgive everyone.

Magicks of the Arcane and Honor Thy Blood seem good, I'll start with the latter one. Any opinions on it?

Honor thy blood has quite a bit of politics, but it's the MC and his mentor who are powerful in the wizengamot. Otherwise, it meets your requirements, although I think there is a little romance.

** You're in luck. I love stupid fics like these.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] Ignore the crossovers in the description. You don't need to know shit about them. They're just there to add more things for Harry to blow the shit out of with big ol lightning bolts that he got from chowing down on a power line. The first few chapters are weak as fuck but it gets hilarious as it goes on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] This is a time loop fic. Harry fights demons. Then he fights bigger demons. Might be a little deeper than what you're looking for but there's a lot of fun shit going on. tl;dr Harry's looking for Atlantis to stop Voldemort form unleashing an ancient demon army.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] This fic is my favorite thing in the fandom. Period. Barely any of that fucking political bullshit. Just weird stuff going on with spirits and reflections and things trying to kill the fuck out him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] Crossover with the Hunger Games but you don't need to know anything about that worthless series of books. It's just fem!Harry killing the fuck out of magical things with guns and the most badass Hermione I've ever read.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/][The Unforgiving Minute]] Harry goes back in time to speedrun Voldemort's horcruxes because his friends and the Order died in hilariously over the top ways. (ex: Cedric gets ripped apart by a nest of vampires in Hogwarts). There is no downtime in this fic.

Lastly, not Potter fanfiction, but if you can tolerate anime "Gurren Lagann" sounds like it would be right up your alley. Besides some slow parts with a little politics post-time skip it's pretty much just people in giant robots beating the shit out of each other and slowly escalating into bigger and bigger robots.

*** I don't mind women, I don't mind female MCs but I DO MIND the fucking +bitches+ 'female romantic interests' in all the fanfiction I've read recently. Always nosing into the protags business, manipulating him in some or other way and more-or-less being shoehorned into whatever the MC is doing.

And most of them are named Daphne Greengrass for some reason. Fucking hate it.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** ...3 hours and no recs (JBern's work is good but don't wanna read again). Am I really asking for too much?

All I want is a protag that learns magic and uses it, good fights and low focus on hoes (and bros, if protag is a girl).

*** stargatesg1fan1

Pretty much every story from this author. Uninteresting females only there for sex and the harem. Huge harems so you don't get bored with the same female. God Harry kicking ass, taking names, and adding bitches to harem. Reads like a fix-it.
