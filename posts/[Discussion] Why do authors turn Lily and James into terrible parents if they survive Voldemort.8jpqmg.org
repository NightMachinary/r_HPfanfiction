** They need angst to fill in their lack of genuine story telling.

** Because the will of fate needs harry to grow up as either a determined and self sacrificing individual with the comprehension of his role in life to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Or fate needs harry to grow up alone, free from attachment, and capable of acts of evil for the cause of good in order to better oppose voldemort.

Having James and Lilly be shitty parents expidites both quite well.

Also it's a trope that is easy to fall back on.

** My best guess is so that they can keep Harry more in character. I think he would've turned out quite differently if he had loving parents, which they would have been. Having them be on the dursleys level gives him a similar enough upbringing that he could retain some of his angst, so to say.

*** Would he? Less angsty I guess. but Dumbledore seemed to think Harry was remarkably resilient to the influence of the Dursleys. Not that I think it's all that reasonable, you can't toss a guy in a closet for a decade and verbally and physically abuse him and have him come out in one piece.

**** I think so, anyways. Resilient or not, there's a pretty big difference between okay and loved/nurtured. At the very least, he might be less appreciative even with good parents, as with the dursleys he was super greatful for any good treatment he got from the weasleys and such.

** Because missing/neglectful parents are a standard part of a Hero's Journey when the Hero is a kid. Otherwise the parents would be the protagonists because good parents would put themselves between their kid and the villain.

** You also have the whole Wrong Boy Who Lived genre, which relies on one or both of the Potters voluntarily abandoning Harry. It's a tough nut to crack.

*** I have this headcanon that wbwl is based off of a sideways view of canon where it's normal for a family to have a less loved child, much like in fairytales it's normal for step siblings to be spoiled or evil. I mean, if you look at how Sirius and Regulus, Lily and Petunia, and Harry and Dudley were all treated by their normal families, you could assume that maybe it's just the way the universe works. Of course, I don't generally like or read wbwl fics, but this is my way of trying to understand how they get the family dynamics.

** I think part of it has to do with having this notion that Lily and James were portrayed as great people (which I believe was how most people viewed them except maybe Snape and some others) and when you have a story were they actually aren't good parents, it keeps the story interesting. People like to read about people's lives that are bad and get better. I think you could argue that writing super loving parents could be considered less interesting than James and Lily being "bad" parents. (And of course there could be some really good/interesting stories that have Lily and James as the ideal parents)
