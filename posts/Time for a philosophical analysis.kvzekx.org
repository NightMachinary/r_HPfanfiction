"There is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it." Just why this quote? Could you be more of the VILLAIN? Defend, tear down, use to obtain your transfiguration mastery. Just have at it about this quote.


** Could be as much a refusal of absolutist ethics as a nihilistic maniac's catchphrase.

Power, at its most basic, is the ability to do things. Could be magical oomph, could be charisma and followers, could be money and infrastructure, science and knowledge, faith and belief, even simple self-esteem and confidence - it takes a whole bunch of different forms, but all of them are just ways to let you do more than you otherwise would be able to.

There's no good or evil could be saying that there's no absolute good or evil, specifically. ie. Morality changes with the situation you find yourself in. Murdering random people on the street is bad, killing Hitler or Justin Bieber is less bad.

So, the statement could be saying that there's no absolute morality, only the ability to do things (ie. the strength to seek the ability/power to rule yourself) and choose for yourself and people who follow the morality of others (ie. the weak who don't seek to choose for themselves and just follow the herd).

It's probably just the Nietzchean Megalomaniac thing, but it's possible to bullshit Voldemort being an avowed Libertarian too, I guess. :D

The best and worst thing about Philosophy is that you can pull together an argument for virtually every position. That's why the discipline is still arguing the same topics it's been arguing since Ancient Greece. :D

*** But at the same time, it rejects the concepts of morality for the concept of power, so it is kind of replacing the idea of morality with power.

**** Sort of. It's not rejecting the whole of morality, just the conceit that it's absolutist. That there is an inarguable, constant distinction between right and wrong. Thou shalt not kill is absolutist - there's no relativism or qualifiers for extenuating circumstances, no exceptions made for specific situations, nothing. It says that killing is wrong, end of story. That's what it's rejecting, not the very idea of morality point blank.

There are alternative models to absolutism - for example, I'm a deontological relativist. I believe that actions have intrinsic moral values (they are right and wrong in and of themselves, rather than due to their consequences) but that their moral value depends on the situation and changes depending on qualifiers. Stealing for fun is wrong, but stealing to feed your family is right. That kind of thing. Morality is more than just 'this is good, this is evil'.

Really though, the thing in my last post was more the idea that you can't have morality without power. Say you have a situation with two conclusions - either you do a morally right thing (save a life) or a morally wrong thing (abandon a person to their inevitable death). Is it really morality if you don't have the power to make the choice between them?

Say that you're missing an arm and are terribly unfit, so you don't have the physical strength to save this person's life and you know this full well. Is it still immoral to make the decision not to try save them? Is making that decision not to help less moral than it would be if you were in peak physical condition?

In the same way that the person lacks an arm, so might someone else lack the charisma to persuade someone else away from a bad decision, or lack the magical oomph to cure a mortal wound, or the money and infrastructure to build an orphanage.

If you lack the power to make the decision, then can you really attach moral value to that decision? And thus, is it not strong to seek power in order to make decisions for yourself and weak to leave that strength in the hands of others, letting them make the moral decisions for you?

(It's a very ableist example, I know, but I'm too tired to think of anything better.)

****** Well, if there's no good or evil specifically as moral values, then there's a lot more to choose from. Harm, Hindrance, Pragmatism, Pleasure, Encouragement, etc. Utilitarianism claims moral acts are the ones that bring about the most pleasure (some versions use Hedonistic Base Pleasure, others make the distinction between fuckin' and reading books) while immoral are the ones that cause pain, and there's some German guy I forget the name of that says moral acts are those that encourage people to accomplish goals and immoral are those that hinder them (What their goal is doesn't matter, because that's their choice and thus their morality - your actions to hinder them are immoral on your count, as their actions to hinder you would be to their count).

But if you mean there being no evaluative categories at all - and acts are just acts with no evaluative labels attached - then there's still the idea of power and consequentialism. That means using power to make what you want happen. Strength is having the power to do what you want and make your own fate, while weakness is not seeking that and letting yourself be guided along by the tides of others. It's not necessarily good or bad or painful or pleasurable or whatever else. Just having the ability/power or not having it.

Or you could go with the idea that the world is so insanely complex that evaluating good and evil is impossible and thus pointless (you buy a box of cereal, are you supporting Nestle's human rights violations and thus performing an evil act? Where was the cardboard sourced? Is the store manager embezzling? Are the employees exploited?), or even that everything is just shades of grey and dependent on the perspective of the evaluator. You execute a murderer - that's good to the family of the victim, but evil to the family of the murderer, good to the people employed to kill them, but evil to the other people on death row that might be innocent, etc.

And eh. I have more things to do before I can sleep today. It's only 21:29 here, too. :)

******* Consequentialism was what I was going for. I think a character like Voldemort or Grindelwald would be much more focused on the idea of strength, with both of them caring about not being tied to the will of anything. Voldemort's never wanting to be threatened by death, for example. It's not about time, you could go to bed at 24:00, it's the fact that you're tired. Sleep is important. :)

******** Well, I did end up going to sleep earlier than midnight, at least, so there's that. And sure, it's vitally important, but sometimes there are other necessities as well. :)

I don't know if I'd agree about Grindelwald, but I don't know enough about the character to provide an argument or have a meaningful opinion. Voldemort definitely just wanted nothing else to have power over him, I agree, but Grindelwald always struck me as more of a moral idealist than a power-hog or whatever. Like he actually believed all that 'Magicals are better' stuff he espoused.

** "We want to defend our tradition"

"Our people need more living space ([[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum][Lebensraum]])"

"Stop the Steal (of our magic)"

Then there's this speech by Grindelwald:

#+begin_quote
  "My brothers, my sisters, my friends, the great gift of your applause is not for me. No. It is for yourselves. You came today because of a craving and a knowledge that the old ways serve us no longer. You came today because you crave something new. Something different. It is said that I hate les non-Magiques. The Muggles. The No-Maj. The Can't-Spells. I do not hate them. I do not. For I do not fight out of hatred. I say the Muggles are not lesser, but other. Not worthless, but of other value. Not disposable, but of a different disposition. Magic blooms only in rare souls. It is granted to those who live for higher things. Oh, and what a world we would make for all of humanity. We who live for freedom, for truth, and for love."

** Oh that's my jam. Voldemort is committing a fallacy here, but it's an appealing one. He's saying good and evil are relative and thus don't count, where power is not relative and hence does count. Of course, this is rich, coming from a guy whose literal downfall was love. Power is relative by definition because no matter how powerful you are, the existence of someone more powerful makes you weak. There are many types of power Voldy relinquished, the power of friendship for example, or dismissed, like Snape's love.

I think Voldemort is a self styled Ubermensch :) but in the end, he's exactly not an Ubermensch (as I understand it), because he didn't accept mortality and the very idea that some people won't lick his boots was offensive to him. Poor guy, really.

** The point is that power isn't inherently good or evil, but a measure of ones influence over the world; be it through magical power, political, economic, intellectual power, charisma, connections, talent, etc. It also definitely pulls aspects of a “everyone is the hero in their own story”, and is maybe a condemnation of a black/white gold/evil mindset that lacks nuance??
