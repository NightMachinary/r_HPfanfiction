** I don't think I necessarily have /favorites/ or ones that I completely hate - it's heavily dependent on the writing quality, in the end.

That being said, a few that tend to catch my eye, interest wise, are any that involve Tonks, Fleur, or Luna - they're all great characters that I really like seeing more of.

Another that I enjoy is the unusual pairing (in universe) - so people from different backgrounds or ideologies. The most classic one in the fandom seems to be Harry/Daphne, which is great - but any along those lines of slytherin/death eater leaning + not that is inherently intriguing.

** My favorite one is the HMS Hood from Harry Potter and the girl who walked on water, although the DSS Requirement is a close second.

I didn't really like the Invincible that much. And the Durmstrang ship makes absolutely no sense at all apart from looking cool.

** I don't have a favourite ship. I like well written stories. I've read Hermione/Lucius and Petunia/Severus stories and loved them. But I've also read ones I hate. I've never been a fan of Ginny Weasley, so I automatically don't like her romantically or even platonically involved with the main character. With that being said one the best reads I had of 2019 featured Ginny as the main character. It's all about how the author delivers it.

** On principle, I don't read Harry/Voldemort, or Bellatrix/anyone (except if she's not the cruel and sadistic woman of canon for whatever reason)

I don't like most slash targets because they're /fucking weird/, so Draco and Snape are out, but mostly only if its morally bankrupt (such as the whole entire 'draco the male veela focribly marries someone' thing, or snape with anyone that's not in his generation)

Don't like pairings that are forced, and multi!pairing stories usually degrade into a shitty harem fic.
