Hogwarts is presented as being the only Magical school in Britain.

However, is it reasonable to assume that other, lesser schools are out there in Britain? To draw an analogy, Hogwarts could be an analogue to Eton, but they only take the cultural elite. Not everybody goes to Eton.

It doesn't seem reasonable that an entire magical society could be supported by a class of 30-40 students leaving Hogwarts each year.

Thoughts?


** Rowling said that Hogwarts has an average of 700 to 800 students at any time. Which translates to around 100 -100 students per year. Harry's year was small as they were conceived during a war. Add around a dozen homeschooled kid and the numbers see okay

** In canon, Hogwarts is probably the only magical school in Britain. However, the numbers - like you mention - don't /truly/ add up for a viable society IMO. Though obviously the canon WW population is quite low.

If you want to do an AU, or a more fleshed out worldbuilding from a 'sensible' standpoint, adding more schools is a good idea. One I've seen that was funny was based on the Old Woman that lived in a shoe tale - a remedial school (primarily for Muggleborn) that was in a giant boot - and obviously not a great one.

I personally have no issues with stories that expand the size/scope of the world - so I'd say to go for it. Those who prefer to stick closer to source material wouldn't, I imagine.

** There's a new fic out by Disobedience Writer mentioning something called the Tintagel school.

** The main schools are just the ones registered with the ICW. There could be plenty more that just never bothered to register, be they formal schools without the paperwork or more improvised in a kind of 'irregular classes in the village hall or Elder Bob's front room' sort of a way.

I vaguely recall Rowling saying that more Magicals choose homeschooling than formal schooling, but it's possible there are more formal schools as well.

As I recall, this is what she said about primary schools--there's no formal schooling for children younger than eleven years old.

**** You could be right. There's no reason we can't extrapolate further though - it would make sense for a low-numbers and generally scattered people to have a homeschooling preference.

** I've always imagined something similar to what you're talking about with Hogwarts being the oldest, best, most famous school in Britain, but for some reason it's only really attended by the elites, weather it's because of cost, or some other reason. If we think about it, there seem to be a lot more 'pure blooded' students in Harry's year than we would think based on the stated small size of pure-blood populations. Furthermore, the only muggle born students whose backstories I can think of are Hermione, whose parents are dentists (and therefore probably decently wealthy), and Justin, who is assumed to be quite wealthy himself. There is also the point that Hogwarts is a massive castle, with a tiny population, which makes me think that there was a time when Hogwarts was the only school, but over time more were founded, and large chunks of the population started transferring to those schools.

I've seen this topic expanded on a bit in several stories, most notably, linkffn(Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus) which had a pretty interesting take on it.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** There's a fanfiction called Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor, (note: very evil manipulative Dumbles) which has a school called Waxwings. It was for poorer families.
