A lot of fics have Dumbledore's plot hinging on the idea that Harry MUST be raised with the Dursley's (so he can become meek and pliable etc.)

Then if he comes to Hogwarts not that way, either because he was raised somewhere else or just didn't turn out the way he wanted to, he sits in his office the entire story and has panic attacks because all his plans are down the drain.

If he's this manipulative, machiavellian figure then there is no way he wouldn't be able to work with whatever ends up coming his way.

E.g: Struck with grief and a mighty urge to ensure that the only thing left of James and Lily was safe, Sirius takes Harry and goes into hiding. Ends up raising Harry into a James Potter 2.0.

Are you telling me Dumbledore can't handle that? Even if he wasn't part of Harry's childhood as a sort of aloof, protective grandfather figure to endear himself to young Harry, he'd be able to play on the same emotional beats as in canon and he could get Harry to likely think giving himself up was the only way just as easily.

Alternatively, a more Slytherin!Harry arrives at Hogwarts, perhaps with his Lordships and raised by a Slytherin based family or some darker ally of the Potters.

Again, Dumbles should be able to work with that. Slytherin's are a dime a dozen, he could sit back and observe before subtly ingratiating himself to Harry until he becomes some kind of confidant or trusted ally (in the same vein that Palpatine did for Anakin). Harry thinks he's using Dumbledore but he's playing right into the Headmaster's hands; Dumbledore's dealt with his kind for decades, he knows how to work with them.

I very much like the idea, also, of Dumbledore kind of crossing a line from shadowy manipulator to almost an abuser. He could model himself (like in canon) as this trustworthy figure with a familial love and bond with Harry and would make sure to be present and near him a lot more. However, the entire time he is gaslighting him with talk about the sacrifice of his parents and friends, how he killed Quirrell, how Voldemort would come for his loved ones to get to him. Stuff to break Harry down over and over again.

I'd love a story with the above (maybe during the war or after) where a character, any character, sees this behaviour for what it is and tries to help Harry put himself back together and realise his life is worth living.

I know a lot of people tune out of a fic (or don't start reading it at all) because of the Manipulative!Dumbledore tag, but there's a lot more nuance to the premise and a lot of different ways it can be executed to achieve the effect of having Dumbledore as a villain that I think more fic writers should tap into.


** I think you underestimate the amount of problems you get if you write Dumbledore as an antagonist who is genuinely a good manipulator. Because if he is, considering how long he has been at things and the lack of a foil of the same level, the plot naturally becomes "Dumbledore wins" or even "Dumbledore has already won".

So then he needs a strong opponent to even have a story, and it can't be Harry in the canon era because of age alone. And if you have one---say, the Black family---then you have to explain why whatever events your took from canon still happened despite that. Or warp things so much that Harry Potter is Harry Potter in name only (raised differently, no Boy-Who-Lived at all, different parents, etc.).

It's definitely possible---for example, you could have Dumbledore's foil not be on Harry's side at all, and not care one bit about all the canon events, until some weird inciting incident moves things around---but it's hard work. It's not really surprising that most Manipulative!Dumbledore stories end up with him being arrogant and slow to adapt instead. Those basically are "Dumbledore has already won" stories where he becomes so intellectually lazy that he loses everything.

(You could also write a /House-of-Cards/-style story with Dumbledore as a villain protagonist, but that's really hard to pull off.)

** That's why I love the “Harry is Tom's equal in more than just name” because then it justifies any manipulation/control from Dumbledore (even encourages it!). And it's always interesting to see a war of wits between Dumbledore and Voldemort get messed up because Harry was by the sidelines, learning from both their mistakes. (And seeing Dumbledore being conflicted between his love and pity for Harry and his fear of him becoming another TMR is always better than the silly “I like this kid just fine but he shall die so that I'll share his money with the Weasleys”). But these stories are usually unfinished and/or with some form of Tomarry in them and thus, get little rec around here.

On the other hand, i started a story, not long ago, where Harry is this cute little kid not far from his canon. He becomes friend with the Twins and basically all the school. But Dumbledore, who doesn't act so far from his canon self, is truly shown as being manipulative. Every time Harry and his friends/allies get one step over him (like finding some other arrangements during the summer while still getting protection from family blood, because Dumbledore made a convincing argument), he comes back from nowhere with a way to manipulate them to do exactly what he wants. And it's so believable, that by the end of first year, I just couldn't read anymore because it was just way too much to stomach. That's when you realise that by being headmaster, knowing everyone in position of power or not, being chief warlock and at the Wizengamot, he can get absolute power so easily and just get and do whatever he wants. I think the truly manipulative Dumbledore is realistic (I really don't buy the innocent, loving old man who did nothing wrong), but if Harry doesn't change, or the atmosphere doesn't adapt, it becomes so... terrifying in a way. That's probably why we read or write so much Old Manipulator who lost his touch rather than that.

**** It may have been by Chelonie, on AO3, but I'm not too sure. It had two part in the series, last time I checked. And it's one of these non-Gryffindor stories.

(I'll go look more in depth in my history tonight)

** If Harry subverts Dumbledoor's plan, that is sort of a kick in the face and usually becomes a bashing!fic.

I always think of the bashing fics as taking the characters being bashed down, giving them 'payback' for how much Harry suffered. Having them actually be worthy adversaries sort of detracts from this.

On the other hand, you might have circumstances not specifically connected to Harry mess up Dumbledore's plans, in which case seeing him make new plans each time to account for the changing situation would be enjoyable.

** I imagine (and my experience with such posts over a year tells me) that most people will highly enjoy reading a story like that. For some reason nobody does it beyond a one shot.

I can only speculate but maybe stories like that and being inside the mind of characters like that is not a very pleasant experience. I think stories like that are pretty rare in fantasy fiction in general. Though it's literary potential is good, I guess most people that write fanfiction for fun don't want to spend time thinking like that.

A more likely speculation though is that people don't feel confident enough in their abilities to write many Albus POV stories in general.

*** It doesn't need to be done from Albus's perspective for any of these, it's just I don't like how Dumbledore is set up to be this manipulative genius in fics and effectively does nothing. It all gets lost in the fics setup, Harry goes on as if he doesn't exist and Dumbledore is on the sidelines wondering where everything went wrong.

**** I know what you mean but whether it's written from Albus's perspective or not, it has to make sense for Albus's character for it to end up being a good story. Thus in the end the writer has to put in almost the same amount of effort thinking things through from Albus's perspective which (I suspect) is somewhat daunting/difficult/etc.

It's pure speculation of course. The correct answer is almost definitely much more complex and stranger.

** My problem is with the over-the-top portrayals, you know, where after something goes wrong, he rants - aloud - in his office about how Harry is going dark and must be sacrificed for the Greater Good ™️, while Fawkes is singing sadly in the corner wondering where it all went wrong for his old friend.

Come on, show some subtlety, don't spill the antagonist's motives and plans in some pointless monologue. Let the reader guess.

Because he's a behind the scenes manipulator. And you can't exactly drop this big counteraction to what's happening at the drop of the hat. He has to call in favors, get supplies, send out orders, etc. Especially when it comes to the Wizengamot. Then there's bribes, favors, and all that to consider. And you can't exactly call on an emergency Wizengamot meeting out of nowhere for where Harry is staying. People will just ask "why?"

A lot of that goes out the window if he has someone playing a family figure that is diametrically opposed to Dumbledore. The Weasleys and Hermione worked because they all believed that Dumbledore was made out of rainbows and unicorns. Give him friends (and their family) that believe otherwise? Or a Slytherin Harry? They will suspect him out of hand.

In the broadest terms, yes. In reality? No. Hogwarts is full of legacy sortings. "I'm gonna be Gryffindor because that's where my parents were!!!1111!one" And they get sorted there. Look at Malfoy, he was more Gryffindor than Ron. And I still think the book six events were waaaay out of character for Malfoy. Harry? Hufflepuff. Besides a few occasions of bravery, it's all to do with friends. Chamber of secrets? His friend's sister. DoM raid? Sirius.

​

That brings up another thing: Why is the sorting hat there anyways? It will just listen to you anyway, why bother sorting people?

** Honestly, I have only read 1 fanfic where Dumbledore is really competent as a manipulator (can't remember the fic name, it became a weird crossover with Alice in wonderland before being abandoned). A man with 100= years old experience, where the protagonists are barely able to come even against him with rituals and faerie magic and time travel.
