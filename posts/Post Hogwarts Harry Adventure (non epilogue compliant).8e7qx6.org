I had a little brain child about the end of the canon potter verse but before the epilogue where Harry goes on a world exploration, similar to what Riddle did after his graduation. Learning new and fantastic Magic's, meeting new people, new enemies, allies, etc. I've been on fan fiction for a while and haven't come across one that is any good. They either have Harry too OP or it's simply shit writing. It'd be interesting to see a slow progression from “I beat Voldemort due to his insanity, crazy luck, and a shit ton of educated guesses” to “still has the potter luck, but with the skills to help him out of it”. The progressive gaining of confidence and skill. No amazing amounts of money or 400 lordships and a grimorie full of OP battle magic, but a story about hard work, humor, and adventure.


** I think this might match a few of your criteria.
