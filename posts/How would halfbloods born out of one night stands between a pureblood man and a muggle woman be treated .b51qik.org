In my headcanon,Romilda Vane and Michael Corner are half siblings with their father being a particularly shitty playboy Quidditch player and I was wondering how they would be treated by the purebloods ?


** Probably as a muggleborn.

** Well, if I've learned anything from r_hapas who hate asian women who date white men, assuming white = pureblood, then the kids turn out worse than pureblood women and muggle men.

** Honestly I've wondered before how many so called muggleborns are really just bastards of a wizard that had a one-night stands with a muggle women. Probably more than you'd think.

****** Thing is don't equate bastards with non pure bloods. How would a bastard born of two pure bloods be treated?

Is the embarrassment purely because of blood status?

Tom was a halfblood. I don't even know anything about Dean. Assuming its Pottermore canon.

** As muggleborns since their father wouldn't be actually known since he wouldn't reveal he's a wizard to some muggle he's probably actually raped since he can dose her wth a love potion then obliviate her after he's done.

** I think it depends on their father's involvement in their life pre-Hogwarts. Do they know who their father is? Do they know their father is a wizard? If they know and he's somewhat involved then they'd be treated as halfbloods. I imagine their treatment would vary depending on who. Perhaps a few cracks about their mother being a muggle from pure bloods like Draco but otherwise treated well. If they don't know, then they'd be treated as muggleborns. This is the same backstory Dean Thomas was supposed to have (grew up with mom, not knowing his father who was a wizard).
