In usual tellings, Merlin is placed somewhere in the 5th and 6th centuries, along with all of Arthurian myth. However, in canon, Merlin apparently was born in 982 and was sorted into Slytherin.

Here is a resolution I thought of. Another part of Merlin's myth is that he ages backwards. Therefore, he could have been born sometime in the 4 or 5th century, got aged up magically, and started aging backwards until he was a teenager again and then went to Hogwarts as his retirement home.

Thoughts?


** I like the idea, it's whimsical in a very Potteresque way. Perhaps a wonky experiment with a Philosopher's Stone?

I'm trying to remember if the aging backwards thing was a thing outside of White's Once and Future King, though.

*** I remember a fic where there was in fact 2 Merlins. A first one, who lived well before Hogwarts, and another one (maybe called Merlin in honor of the first one from what I remember) who came years later, was sorted in Slytherin and ultimately been known as an amazing Enchanter.

***** Exactly this one. I really like the solution author brought to the problem, since keeping only one Merlin means either he was at least as old as the Flamel when he went to Hogwarts, or one of them is pure invention.

***** In the Last Mage of Krypton series (HP is Kal-El), there are several indications that there were no less than three different Merlins, the Merlin who forged Caliburn (and guided King Arthur), the Merlin who apprenticed one or more of the Founders and the Merlin who was Sorted into Slytherin.

It's also strongly suggested that because all three had the name Merlin, the Wizarding World forgot to differentiate between them and assumed all three were the same.

**** I'm doing a two Merlins thing sorta, too. Basically the first one gets possessed by an Outer God and turned young, then infiltrated Hogwarts. At least that's in my backstory notes, not sure if it'll make it into the story proper, lol.

** I just figured that there were two Merlins. That, or the magical community made shit up to make themselves look better (or just feel better for having no discernable culture).

It's the same with Quidditch. Assuming it's true that the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1998][423rd Quidditch world cups took place in 1998]], and that they took place every four years, the world cup would have started being held in 729 B.C. -- 233 years before [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Broomstick#History][the first recorded use of wizards riding broomsticks]], and 1,779 years before [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Quidditch#The_evolution_of_Quidditch][the game that is recognised as the modern version of Quidditch began being played]].

(Uppon investigating Quidditch to find the right links, I've discovered that apparently the first Quidditch Wold Cup was held in 1473, so it is evident the wizarding community of the world has been padding their cultural canon even more tranparently than I had first thought)

  The tournament has been held every four years since 1473. As with so much else about the wizarding world's most important sporting competition, many query the accuracy of this statement.

  [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/history-of-the-quidditch-world-cup][Source.]]
#+end_quote

The way it's worded does allow for that, I suppose. Wizards themselves seem to question it too. It might've just been chaos before 1473, each country having its own tournament every four years or whatever, perhaps calling it the World Cup in the same way Americans use "World Series" for their national baseball championships.

** There is an easy, overlooked resolution: Merlin was born no earlier than 982, and anything else is just muggle myths. Sometimes the right answer is the easiest, least complicated one. Sometimes the cigar is just a cigar and nothing freudian.

Since Arthurian literature is /not/ something I'm all that versed in, I might have various mistakes myself. Merlin first originated in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetiae_Merlini][Prophetiae Merlini]], which was written around 1130-1135. Since the Statute of Secrecy wasn't established until much later, its likely that the very myths about Merlin were bits and pieces wrote by muggles who didn't have all the facts. Him attending Hogwarts isn't a plothole, especially since Merlin as he is in HP canon is clearly meant to be based on Arthurian legend... which was set around the 12th century.

Think about it like this: The first story about Merlin was written around 1130-1135, and references events that occurred in the 1120s so its clearly intended to be portrayed as being a story of its time (and not about prior centuries). Assuming that Merlin was born in 982, he would be about 148-153 years old... which is actually perfectly normal for a wizard. We know that Bagshot and Marchebanks were two witches in the HP books who were significantly older than Dumbledore who lived until 115-116. In Dumbledore's case, he would have lived for at least several more decades if he was murdered.

Whether Merlin was specifically taught by the Hogwarts founders is unknown, but its very likely that he was. Merlin wasn't born prior to 982 since he attended Hogwarts, and the earliest portrayal of Merlin is in 1130-1135. Meaning that Merlin would have been at least 148-153 by the time he was known to muggles. Its possible that he lived for several more decades, but he would probably be dead by the age of 250. Though in my personal headcanon, I think he probably did live a long time for a wizard compared to most wizards since it would explain how significant his legacy was if he had lived until around 250 years old.

Of course, since Merlin would have been born no earlier than 982, anything contradicting this would be muggle myths. It is entirely possible that the muggles would have mistaken the Arthurian/HP Merlin of the 12th century with the older, completely unrelated Myrddin Wyllt from around the 6th century. So there would only be one actual Merlin. The HP Merlin would be the one famous wizard influenced from the Arthurian portrayal. Myrddin Wyllt would just be some other wizard who not only pre-dates Hogwarts, but would be too old to have anything to do with its foundation.

As for the Order of Merlin, it would have likely been named after Merlin, not by him. It would be an award named in honour of Merlin so it wouldn't need to actually be founded by him. Just because its called the Order of Merlin doesn't mean it had anything to do with him. Dumbledore's Army had nothing to do with Dumbledore whatsoever, yet Ginny still came up with the idea to name the DA after him to further oppose the Ministry.

*TL;DR: Merlin in HP was born no earlier than 982 and is the one and only Merlin. The 5th and 6th century Merlin would be the muggles mistaking Merlin for Myrddin Wyllt, an unrelated wizard who vastly pre-dates Hogwarts. In the HP series, Merlin's common Arthurian portrayal would make him at least 148-153 years old, whereas the muggles wouldn't need to know his exact age other than simply being an old-aged wizard.*

*** 1. Merlin had nothing to do with Arthurian legend, originally. King Arthur was a century earlier, and Merlin had his own cycle.
2. "Myrddin" is Merlin in Brythonic.

Rowling's description of Merlin falls apart completely if you know /any/ of the Matter of Britain. There's no use in trying to mitigate that. If you really have to, it might be better to consider "Merlin" to be a title, like it is in /The Dresden Files/; this allows for multiple Merlins, all of them "the real thing".

** I like the idea that Merlin attended hogwarts, was sorted into slytherin and believing himself to be named after the most powerful wizard of all time alongside his prodigious talent became arrogant and started experimenting with very dangerous magics, eventually leading to an accident involving temporal magics which sent him back to the 5th/6th century. After awakening in that time period he began looking for the great wizard he was named after, hoping to find a way home, only to discover nothing and eventually realize that the stories of Merlin he grew up listening to were the deeds of himself stuck in the past to live out the rest of his life.

** Personally, I like the idea that Merlin was born in the 5th century, but the Slytherins spread a rumour that he was in Slytherin and no one has ever really thought to question it. All to make Slytherin seem better, even though Merlin was dead before Hogwarts ever opened. I can't remember which fic this is from, but I like it anyway.

** No need to get fancy with it. Humans get history wrong all of the time (see: 4004BC creation of the world). If we say wizards have better records, then the disparity is simply Muggles getting it wrong.
