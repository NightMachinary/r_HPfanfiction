  I still want to finish the story, but I also have no desire to continue writing fanfiction.

The author's new original fiction is at [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/932775/]]

And even though /The Black Prince/ is now dead, it's still a fun read for fans of ASOIAF.

** The author's new fiction is quite promising and even better written than The Black Prince. I'm impressed. Wonder if they're trying to get it published eventually?

** Yeah, it's a pity. So few interesting and well written ASOIAF crossovers.

Any suggestions BTW?

*** the difference one man can make is decent if you don't mind an OP harry and it being incomplete/abandoned; makes a civilization for the wild-lings beyond the wall lots of basebuilding/uplift

**** I have read that. It's nice in the worldbuilding and the application of magic. The last lion of house Rayne, I think by the same author, is also decent.

Incomplete stories are a risk you have to take with fanfiction.

***** Look: Fanfic is a hobby for pretty much everyone involved. If this was about a published author, I could at least partially understand you.

But every writer has the right to update the story as they please, and to invest as much or as little time as they want - they don't /owe/ you anything.

Don't get me wrong, I've learned my lesson. I only read stories marked completed these days.

There's nothing wrong with me. All I did was state clearly that I don't appreciate when people write half a great story and don't finish it.

But, if I really am wrong, great, carry on.
