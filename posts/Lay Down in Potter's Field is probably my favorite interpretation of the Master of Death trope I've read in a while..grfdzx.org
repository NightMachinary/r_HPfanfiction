So I work night crew and I was looking through ff.net for fics I haven't read yet when this little gem hit me linkffn(13590533)

As I'm at work I can't give a full review of it but I highly recommend it, it's a really nice interpretation of what the Master of Death could do and I enjoyed it immensely

#+begin_quote
  "Every Potter who died on a Potter's Field always returned to the living." The dead are watching. The dead have always been watching. And when their Master jumps through time back to his fourth year and is promptly killed, they answer his call. Time travel! MoD!Harry

** I remember one oneshot I read that basically had Master of Death a job description. Death cannot intervene directly on the mortal plane. The point of the Master of Death in that specific oneshot is to take out wizards who cheat death, like Voldemort did.

** Ebenbild is really good at that and seems to enjoy writing MOD! fics. The talent is there and I like their fics, I just wish they'd tone down the Dumbledore bashing... You may want to try reading his other fics if you like this one üëç
