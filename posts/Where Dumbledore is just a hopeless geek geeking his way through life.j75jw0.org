Would really like a story in which instead of either the ruthless manipulative asshole or the standard slightly batty grandfather Dumbledore is just a HUGE fan of geek culture, like, can explain forwards and backwards as the entire story of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Star Trek; has read all Marvel, DC, Vertigo and Dark Horse comics ever released; never loses a Comicon; is a /very/ enthusiastic player of RPG, LARP and MMORPGs (perhaps he figured a way to mesh technology and magic to the sole propose of playing while saying he is doing paperwork; has read the entire Discworld series: used magic to make Duel Monster (the card game) be playable in the same way as in the anime (with the cards summoning the monsters and having effects on the players and the world)...

Bonus points if at some moment he just ups and grabs either Harry, McGonnagal or Nicholas Flammel for a round of LARPing.


** Dumbledore 'we had a few students in the 60's they tried growing some muggle plants on the grounds, I put a stop to that and well' he pauses to take a hit 'I just keep having to put stops to it'
