I'm looking for Fics where Neville is an arrogant git, believing he should have everything, the kind of person you want to take behind a rough pub and smash his face in.

Kudos if it is a fic where Neville is the WBWL and extra kudos if it has a Neville/Ginny and Harry/Hermione pairing.

Cheers in advance

** Definetely deserves it's M rating, it's also H/G as opposed to H/HR but talks about N/G as a previous thing. But other than that it fits your description.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
