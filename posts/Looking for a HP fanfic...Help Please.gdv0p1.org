:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I am looking for a fanfic that I read years ago, I think I read it on [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]]. It was a Harry/Ginny pairing, from what I can remember - Harry moves in with Sirius after fifth year, but Sirius has drinking problems and gets violent towards Harry when he's inebriated. However, Sirius doesn't remember it happening and acts normally so Harry decides to keep that to himself. I think later on Harry ends up getting kidnapped and tortured by the death eaters but he manages to escape. That is the extent of what I can remember, I really really wanna find that fic and if anyone has read that and has a link, could I please get it. I kinda remember the name was something like down the rabbit hole but I haven't had any luck with that so far. Every few years, somehow that fanfic reminds me of itself and I try and find it. I really hope I have some luck here. Thanks


** Was Snape involved in the fic at all? I seem to remember something along those line that included Snape as a mentor.
