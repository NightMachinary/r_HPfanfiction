Right now the muse just visited me while at work and brought me a plot worm i can't get out of my head.

This the basic idea

After Harry dies in the Forbidden forest in book seven instead of going to Limbo-King-cross and meet Dumbledore he wakes up in his Dorm at hogwarts but he is younger (4th year) and is in an universe where Tom Riddle died as a baby.

Voldemort not existing means a lot of changes that could be interesting and see how Cannon!Harry Adapts to them

Some of the things i have tought about are these

No first war

- Lily and James are alive and well I think James would be an Auror or even head of DMLE, Lily could be an unspeakable or some other kind of Academic type of job.

- Sirius never set a foot in Azkaban and he is your typical Womanizer, I'm consiedring giving him a son and a dead muggle wife

- Alice and Frank Longbottom where never tortured to insanity and rised Neville

  - I think Neville would be still mildmanered but not so easily scared, he would still be terrified of his gran

- Bellatrix never went full crazy. but i don't think she would be very proud of Sirius

- The Malfoys, I think Lucius would no be so bent over on the destruction of every mudblood or be but not so open, he still would be very influential and have a few rows with James in the ministry.

- Petter is still alive and well and with not Voldemort he never had a chance to betray his friends, he is still friend with the Maraunders (let's see how harry reacts when he finds out)

- Snape never became a teacher, he probably works as a master Potion Maker or something, or if he became a teacher he would be the DADA teacher (no Jinx on the job)

The trio

- alt!harry (the harry before cannon!harry replaces him): I think that he would be more like James before he got his shit together but maybe not as bad (thanks to lily) he could be kind of snobby (his family is rich) and a total prankster (Sirius is alive and well and still his Godfather)

- Hermione: With no troll on their first year she never made friends with harry and ron she probably hangs with Neville and she is more engrosed in her books than in cannon because she has no real friends.

- Ron: Harry being snobby and kind of a showoff didn't fit well with Ron on the train and with Harry pulling a few pranks on him. he doesn't really like harry that much.

The Weasleys

- The twins probably see in alt!harry a fellow prankster\\
- Ginny hates harry because of his attitude (this could mirror James/Lily relationship if I don't go Harry/Hermione)
- Fabian and Gideon are alive and Mrs. Weasley is not as protective of her children

Other

- Hagrid never was expulsed from hogwarts and i can totally see him working with charly in the dragon reserve
- Dumbledore has not as much influence as in cannon in the ministry, last cool thing he dis was defeat grindelaw in 1945

So what do you else think that would be changed if voldemor never existed.


** You need to have some kind of turmoil occur as a result of Harry entering this alternate universe if there wasn't pre-existing problems with the universe. Otherwise, the reader will get bored. Furthermore, I believe James and lily would have had more children and I really like the idea of Harry's sibling(s) noticing his change when our harry takes alt Harry's place in the alt universe. Finally, I do not think cannon harry would ever just leave behind all his friends from the original universe as they were pretty much family to him. Perhaps you could change the DH ending to Harry being the last one alive or something and finally facing voldemort because be ha nothing to lose? Or the story could go a different route that you'd have to come up with that causes staying or leaving the new universe to make sense based on who is left in the old and new universe and the ties harry has to those people. Also I believe you should really think about an explanation of the magic behind Harry being sent to this new universe.

*** Yeah I guess It need some kind of conflict but i don't want to remove Voldemort to just replace it with another character

I like the idea of Harry having a little brother or little sister

And about harry not leaving his friends, what about leaving the Lily, James, Sirius and Lupin of this universe how could harry chose between his friends and the family he never had

the explanation about harry ending up in this universe is MAGIC, no but really i was something about harry wishing that Volemort never existed so the universe ansered his call or something

**** I think The World As We Knew It and Backwards With A Purpose are two fics that also gave good explanations for the reason why/how the time travel occurred. Obviously it doesn't need to be as detailed as NoFP, but the reason the time travel happened shouldn't be "just because".

** The first thing that came to my mind was that if there was no Voldemort, then Snape never fell in with the Death Eater crowd and never estranged himself from Lily. So did Snape and Lily remain friends? Or did Snape just fall in with a seedy-but-non-Death Eater crowd and estrange Lily just the same?

There are also many, many things that would have changed, but which wouldn't really have much of an effect on Harry or his life unless you choose to make it so. Some examples of this: the Riddles weren't murdered; Regulus Black wouldn't have died; Barty Crouch Jr. wouldn't be a baddie; Moody wouldn't have made as much of a name for himself fighting Death Eaters and may have never received the injury that led to his getting a magical eye; the Chamber of Secrets would never have been opened and Myrtle wouldn't have been murdered...

Also, really consider Alt!Harry's pre-Hogwarts childhood. Lily and James would have made sure he had magical playmates. Who might they have been? The Weasley kids? Neville? Or perhaps Lupin had kids? How is Lupin, anyway? Does he face less prejudice?

Finally, if you decide to pursue this, keep in mind that it isn't really a plot. What you have here is not enough to make a story; it's just a starting point. You'll still need to come up with a plot yourself.

*** you are right about Alt!Harry's pre hogwarts childhood, Imagine if Harry And draco where playmates and now on better terms, how could cannon harry react to that. (What? Draco and me are friends!?)

And what you say about Snape, yeah. he probably didn't fell with seedy people but still if Lily married James something must have happened between them even if they still where friends after graduating (You are marrying the guy who tormented me during seven years!)

About the plot I'm not sure harry would want to go back to his original universe or stay in the new one, Also i think there could be some other dark wizards out there but not as bad as voldemort

it could also be about harry trying to connect with Ron and Hermione and Ginny who really don't like him very much

Or how Dumbledore reacts when he finds outs (maybe he reads harry's mind)

** I think your head cannon is off. This sounds like I'm bashing James potter, but that's not my intention.

To me James would have made a terrible Auror, he was fundamentally a coaster, and not too fond of rules. He was comfortable with not working and he could have lived off his family money if he wanted to, and I believe he probably did. If anything he would be a chaser in one of the international Quidditch teams, that's the impression I get from James pre-war.

Following that, I dont think Lilly would be with James, I think she would probably be with Snape because Snape would not have been as pressured and groomed into becoming the boy who called her a mudblood. And I think (someone might be able to correct me) that JK herself said that had that incident not happened they would have gotten together. In this case Snape would not be a teacher he would be or might be Harry's dad...or not if you think that your Harry is James son. In either case he would probably not be childhood friends with the Weaselys (because as a family they don't appear to have many friends outside of the circle they have as a result of the war, the majority of which are adults). Neville is a possible friend in a Harry Snape or Harry Potter scenario, but in a HS case you get the Malfoys. Whereas HP you might get Harry with Blacks kids (if he has any) or even Peters kids.

You could have James be an Auror in an attempt to still try and get Lilly and that could genrate some real drama in the Snape household which would be quite interesting to read. Everything else you've laid out seems very 'rose tinted' to me, not in a bad way but in a 'that wouldnt happen because people are nosy arseholes' sorta way. Hope that makes sense.

*** Well if i went full butterfly effect with this there would be no harry and the weasleys and Longbottoms would have married latter in time making me create a full set of OCs (wich i'm not too fond of)

I think I will do something with Snape and Lily but i'm not sure what

and i want to keep it James/Lily so it can be one of the reasons that makes Harry desicion to go back harder.

Yeah i have an idea for Sirius son/daughter I can't imagine peter marring but this being and AU I could work it out someway

**** What if, you have a war but its not headed by Voldemort and thus not as organised/as successful as the first war. You could have mad-eye/Dumbledore defeating this new Dark Lord, allowing for the our guys to be born, James and Lilly getting together etc. Because in reality I think a 'war' (big or small) probably would have happen with or without Tom. That would allow for the changes to the timeline, but also allowing you to keep somethings 'safe'. What do you think?

** I think though that, since Voldemort never existed, Pureblood domination over the magical world would actually be MORE rampant, because there will never have been a real physical threat/war presented like with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and therefore Pureblood supreme-ism will, instead of being viewed as blatant oppression, be woven into wizarding society and therefore harder to eradicate. Instead of being a group of war radicals, the Order of the Phoenix might be established as a protest/activist group or even a political party. Maybe James, Remus or another order member could run for minister of magic against Lucius Malfoy or another person who would have been a Death Eater (Yaxley, or Rudolphus? Rudolphus would be interesting since Bellatrix could be his "Lady Macbeth" if you get the reference.) That will create a conflict within the context of the new world.

Also maybe Lily could cheat on James with Severus!! (Sorry, couldn't resist. I know cheating doesn't exactly fit Lily's profile but under certain circumstances it could work. Like maybe James cheated on her first.)

Or, given the fact that JKR said that the only reason Lily didn't marry Sev was because he was interested in the dark arts, and that in this world there are no Death Eaters, Lily might actually have married Severus. But that kind of kills your story since Harry wouldn't exist. Just another interesting idea though.

*** Yeah i want to do something with Lily James and Severus, not something as cheating but maybe they are still friendly to each other or they work together, and that makes James super jelly... i don't know.

But yes i need James and lily together so alt!Harry can fuck up things for Cannon!harry :P

Also i like your idea of Pureblood supremasism beging more rampant! I think i will use it :)

** Really, there isn't a lot to go on for James. All we know of him is how he acted as a teenager. And he died at 21, which is when a lot of people are still young and partying. Maybe he would mature and become an auror in the canon universe after fighting so many Death Eaters. With no Voldemort though, what would draw him to that? Maybe he would do something completely different if there was no Voldemort. Maybe him and Sirius would open a joke shop, in the thread of their past deeds at Hogwarts. He could have done a stint as a Pro Quidditch player, and moved on to make his own business.

What would Lily do? Since there would possibly be no Snape at Hogwarts in this universe, what if she took the post as Potions Master? Or maybe even Muggle Studies? On the thread of using her Muggleborn status to further her career, what about in the Ministry in Muggle Relations? She could work with Arthur!

*** We know that James got his shit together and matured after his fifth year (Can't imagine Lily Marrying Jerkass!James), I read on some fic that maybe the fact that Lily and Snape broke their friend ship somehow provoked James to realize he was a jerk and lily would never like him that way.

I Like James as a Pro-Quiditch Player that could work Thanks :D

I see Lily like a more academic person, she could become a researcher or an unspeakable working at the Department of mysteries

** I thought something similar once. What if voldie was never evil? He stayed Tom Riddle, that promising young student everyone loved. But he isn't a dark lord so no expulsion for hagrid, no first war. Instead we have a rising dark lord when Harry comes into his first year. There could have still been a prophecy but no one would have known who it was about. And voldie is still super powerful, but not evil and he helps Harry train

** Find some reason that CANNONHP can get into this universe. What if James and Lilly wited longer to get married so there is no Harry in this verse. Maybe instead of Voldemort being the penultimate bad guy a OC in his 6th year gives Harry a feeling that he is going to be a next dark lord but no one believes him.

Don't give James an Lilly a kid but give them harry which strains their relationship as James always wanted a kid but for some reason Lilly couldn't have children (uterine cancer maybe) so she neglects Harry and he has to win her affections.
