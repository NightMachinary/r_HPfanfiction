Decided to read some fanfics with cliche starts such as the big shopping trip, 12+ compartment trunks and being the heir of pendragon, the four founders, Merlin and Herpo or something. Most of them being manipulative Dumbledore I got curious if there was any that derail such a plot.

Say, Dumbledore actually being his supposed magical Guardian can see just what family lines Harry can inherit, some law that says because Sirius didn't give Harry a home within a week or two magical Guardian ship is up to the Wizengamot aka Albus. The magical blocks and abilities blocks actually being there for safety reasons such as to much magic equaling more devastating accidental magic, blocked parcel tongue so am to not cause a up roar in the wizarding world, occlumency blocks so that Harry could actually develop a personality, etc.

I'm looking for fics that basically make fun of such cliches yet still doing them to the letter. Giving them practical reasons or stopping them from happening in the first place.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. Not sure on how to type this request.

*** Honestly, I think this fic falls more along the author writing the cliches because they don't know any better (or because that's what they personally enjoy) rather than doing it out of some attempt at subversion.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
