  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

  Harry defeated Voldemort: his act of heroism is famous throughout the wizarding world. He's trying to finish his final year at Hogwarts in peace, but something peculiar is happening to him, something he never would have expected. It's all rather embarrassing and making his life very complicated.

  Gabriel might have made a mistake when he borrowed pagan weapons to make a fake angel blade, but he'd thought it would be enough to trick Lucifer. Well, it was, but now the archangel find himself set adrift on another Earth. With his Grace almost gone and unwillingly possessing Harry Potter, what can Gabriel do? Maybe Hogwarts will be enough to distract him...
