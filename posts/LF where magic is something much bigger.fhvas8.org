Fics that include stuff like the origins of all of magic, where the energy comes from and how it came to be. Some really good magical theory and history. Maybe even the History of Magic class being a bit more literal


** I'm not sure how many of these fics are about magic politics religion or history and I can't remember how much relevance they have but there all pretty good anyway
