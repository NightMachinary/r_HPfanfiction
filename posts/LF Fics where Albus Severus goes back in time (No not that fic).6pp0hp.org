Looking for any stories where Albus Severus Potter goes back in time to when his dad is a kid, maybe year one, and is stuck there.

Thats a great idea for a fic!

But we dont really know when he would go. When he falls into the lake on his way into the castle for the first time? That would be dope.

*** Imagining it now, Albus falls off of the boat and when he surfaces realizes that his new friend Scorpius doesn't quite look the same...

Going to school with his dad, mom, uncles (meeting Fred!), aunt, and dealing with all the stuff that went down during the series. Would he be in Slytherin? Or another house? How would he deal with meeting his namesakes?

The more I think about it the more I really wish someone wrote it.

**** So plot sketch:

Gets on train, gets super nervous. Wishes he could get away from his older over bearing brother. Train gets attacked by some kind of ex-Death Eater faction who wants to get their hands on a potter in order to do some time vodoo (all of which goes un said until later), Harry saves the day but LITTLE DO THEY KNOW (a favorite trope of mine) that the ritual was done, but instead of sending a death eater back to kill young harry, Albus Severus gets hit, but seems fine. Trains gets back underway, and they reach Hogsmeade. Albus gets in a boat, it flips over and the moment he falls into the water, a great light goes off and he suddenly gets pushed back out by the giant squid onto a boat again, but he does not notice anything amiss at first, nor does anyone else (since a boat had flipped).

Then, prof. McGonnagal notices one extra student in her headcount. End Chapter One.

****** No, no no no no. Too, hmm, heavy handed. Clunky. It would not even get that far. Lets try this

McGonagall paused, looking down at the auburn haired boy with bright green eyes, eyes like only one other student she had taught a generation ago. She blinked twice, dispelling the memory, and said, "And who might you be?"

Albus exhaled sharply and froze. A terrible fear, that he was not supposed to be at hogwarts after all, that a mistake HAD been made, suddenly rose up in his throat, the size of an apple, preventing him from speaking or even breathing. He became aware of all the other first years staring at him, whispering to each other. His eyes went wide when they fell upon another boy whose eyes were just as green as his and who also looked just as surprised as he. Even worse, the confused looking boy next to the former had the same color hair as Mum's and looked just like . . . It could not be!

Albus' brain simply could not handle neither the stress from simultaneously realizing that his father and uncle had appeared as children right in front of him nor running out of oxygen since he had been holding his breath from the moment that Prof. McGonagall had failed to recognize him. Without a sound, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he fainted, his mouth sagging open from the look of shock he had just had.

As the students gasped, Minerva rolled her eyes too, and muttered "Another clerical mistake from the morons at the ministry, another boy bound for the hospital wing before the feast even begins. Of course it's when Potter begins too. This will be an interesting year."

********* I think your writing style is fantastic!

Only thing is I wonder how Albus would cover up who he is? The only options I could think of would be

a) Pretending to be muggleborn

b) Dumbledore finding out who he is and thinking he is sent back for a reason, gives him an alias

c) A fake name appearing on the list of first years (a supposed unknown Black descendant?) and Albus deciding to go with it

********** I already have that sketched out actually. In the first chapter, Harry would be seeing Albus off at the station and it would play out just like the epilogue except that this time, Harry would remind Albus that whenever he gets anxious or nervous to practice those mental exercises that he has been showing him his whole life. Yep, occulmency training. Upon waking, Dumbledore would talk to him and ask him questions, but find him to be a "natural occulmen" or at least, close to it.

Albus would panic at first, then make up a name, like Albert Wheeler or Albert Cutter (playing off his middle and surname). Dumbledore would obviously not buy it, but leave it to rest for now while he investigates in his supposed free time (the man has like 5 jobs wtf).
