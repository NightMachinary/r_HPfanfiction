Being a history fan, I'd like to read some "real world" stories in different times.

Any pair is fine, het, slash I don't care. Romance, comedy - doesn't matter what genre.


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=141880][celticbard]] might have what you need. Her stories which are largely set in the past, and she's wonderful with worldbuilding in each one. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]] is one of my favorites, about a minister's daughter during the Salem Witch Trials. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=270265][Legend]] is a Founders fic about the founding of Hogwarts. There's magic, but it isn't heavy in either. They read more like historical dramas.

** May I ask, why would you want this in hp fanfiction? I never got the non-magic AU's, there's plenty of good historic fiction about a lot of periods, probably a lot better, if you don't want the HP universe to be involved to the extent there isn't even magic?

*** Because I like the characters and want to see them in a different setting...which is pretty much the basis of fanfiction in general.

If I wanted to read something historic, I'd just go to the library or use a search engine. But that isn't the case, so that is why I am here.
