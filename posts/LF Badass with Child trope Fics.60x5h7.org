So I've recently finished The Last of Us and just watched Logan so I'm really digging the Badass with Child trope. Are there any well written fanfics which uses this trope primarily? Could be one-Shots, but longer fics would be dope. It doesn't matter who the Badass or Child is (although I would like to see a Lily Harry combo if it exists).

Thanks!


** I started to write out a premise that I thought of related to this post, but then I realized that I kind of wanted to try to write it myself.

Don't have much experience writing narrative, though. Should I practice writing a few one shots first?

**** I'm not really a youth, though. I'm closer to 30 than to 20.

Edit: Also, I'm sure that's a reference or something, but not one that I understand.

  Kakashi survived his losses in spirit as well as in body, and having learned both wisdom and intellect from his experiences, he now seeks to pass those traits on to his students. Story emphasis is on tactical fighting, mind games, adventure, and the occasional bout of humor. GenFic, no story stealing OC's or creepy romance between children. Current Arc: The End of Team 7.

** I've built a level of this in the fic that I'm writing, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][*The Rezidentura*]] linkffn(12334664) in which Harry is raised by Natasha Romanoff - the Black Widow.

You also see a level of this with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][*Altered Destinies*]] linkffn(3155057), which features Harry going back in time to raise Tom Riddle. This features heavily on the war with Grindelwald, and Harry is most definitely a badass in this.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  or the Resident Spy. When Dumbledore left Harry Potter with the Black Widow it was with the hope that he would get his own assassin in return. He should have remembered his own advice about people's choices. Harry is raised by Natasha, and the world is a much different place for it.

I mused about a post apoc hp with his daughter based on this for a while. More likely to do it as an original story.
