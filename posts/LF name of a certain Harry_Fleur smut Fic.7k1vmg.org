in that Fic, Harry visits Fleur and Bill, while the latter is absent, Fleur gets one of her "Wild Veela" Periods, means: she has to fuck the next male (who was actually supposed to be Bill), and as Harry tries to call for the Redhead, Fleur blocks his path and having her way with him. They have a Session and Ginny and Bill get suspicious (i think) and Harry steps into their Room, explaining the Situation, making Bill angry for shagging his Wife, while Ginny is amused by this situation and blames Bill for forgetting to cast Wards/Protections.....as far as i remember, she wished Harry Fun for the next session.
