The setting is the Yule Ball where Harry and Ron are basically relaxing after dancing for seemingly an eternity, and they witness two ladies in a heated debate over who is right and who is wrong, turns out it's none other than Elsa and Anna, which solely happens to be they are both in Gryffindor, the professors have retreated to their respective private hangouts leaving the students alone, Harry spots Elsa approaching the door tries to intervene only to find himself block with razor sharp ice, her icy powers expose for all to see, everyone is surprised, Elsa hastily runs from them, Anna, Harry and Ron gives chase but Elsa is too fast for them she runs far away from the castle, freezing the lakes as she runs, snow begins descending signalling the start of the eternal winter, the question here is instead of Anna which is incapacitated realising the mistake she made, chose not to pursue Elsa out of guilt now the task falls to Harry, how would he convinced Elsa to stop the winter?


** The smog rises from the highways tonight

Not a Tesla to be seen.

A kingdom of industrialization

And it's run by gasoline.

The engines roaring like the constant blasts inside

Couldn't keep NOx in, heaven knows VW tried.

Don't let them in, don't let them see!

Be the clean car you always have to be!

Let oil flow! Let oil flow!

Can't cheat on tests anymore!

Let oil flow! Let oil flow!

And Trump believes "Clean coal"!

They don't care that we're going to pay

Let the world heat up

It's all a Chinese Hoax anyway.

*** Elsa can relate to that superbly since Harry had to conceal his powers, never thought how relatable they are..
