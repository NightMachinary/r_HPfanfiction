Hey all, I hope you are having a wonderful day/night.

Anyway, I want to know how to make a HP fanfiction enjoyable, and how to go about writing one. Is there anything I should avoid, out more emphasis on or make sure to place in?

I want to try my hand at making HP fanfiction. I have wrote fanfiction for Naruto and RWBY before, but HP is a whole different can of fish I feel like.

I do like using pairings that not many people see or think about, and I have a thing for older women in my fanfiction, if that helps any. I also enjoy reading Multi/Harem fics and maybe some help with how to manage that for HP fanfiction.

Also, I want to know what makes or breaks an OC - male or female, side character or somewhat of a main character.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time and have a good day/night.


** Have a sense of them and a bit of a backstory. They have to act consistently according to their character and not 'know' things they shouldn't know eg be a voice for the author.

** This is all personal opinion and not really to be taken as truths. Despite how I write things to try to keep it as short as possible.

To me the two most important thing are : what is your story about, and why do you need an O.C. to tell it?

I have read way too many fanfiction that are trying to tell two stories at once (or more), and thus that don't know on what they need to focus. It quickly becomes confusing, and weak, and bad. Side plots and all are fine. And some themes or plots do mash well together. But it's rare, and need way more work than most people seems willing to put into fanfictions.

For an O.C. to work, it has to have at least some traits, knowledge, a position or qualities that no other characters have. If the O.C. bring nothing new, but is just a pale copy of an already existing character, then I'd wonder why I need to learn about a whole new character when X could do, say or be the exact same think.

The tragic backstory of your O.C. - if any - have to be realistic and have to have a somewhat realistic impact on them. If O.C. has multiple traumatic events that happened to them (which I wouldn't recommand doing, unless they are consequences of the first one), don't tell us all at once. Impart it slowly within the story. Also remember that most people are trying to hide them, and you won't notice that not everything fine until you get to know them better. It should feel that way with your O.C.

(Unless the story is about the traumatic event, of course, and how they deal with it).

Keep the name realistic. The simplier the better. They can be meaningful (like Remus Lupin, in the books), but stay on the idea that they shouldn't stand out too much. The HP universe is great for meaningfull name because you got a lot of wringling room with all the non-too-common name already existing in-universe. The idea is to not jar the reader to much out of the story. You don't want reader to think "what kind of name this is?????".

Give you O.C. real flaws. When I mean real flaws it's stuff that really are not good. Not those "It's good for job interviews flaws because deep down they are qualities" or "it's little quirky stuff that are fun but not really important" flaws that I keep reading in fanfictions. And it's better if those flaws do have real consequences on the story and characters, and O.C. needs to work on them.

** If you're interested, the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] subreddit is a also great place for questions like this. : ) They're super helpful with writing questions.

I like when OC's have their own quirks and such, like favorite snacks or a hoodie they've worn so many times that the zipper's broken and the cuffs are frayed, but they love it anyway because it matches their eyes and--somehow--it always smells like home.

It's little stuff like that that connects me to them, and makes them feel like more than just a plot device.

I can't think of anything that makes me immediately dislike an OC.

** Hmmm.. okay, if you have time to read a loong fic, then there is this little known Harry/OC fanfic that portrays an amazing OC character (warning; has smut scenes) it's quite good too, even if you don't have the time now then I suggest you read it later.

linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power)

Now, how to write HP fanfiction, first, get your names of things, people and creatures checked and confirmed

For example: the Daily Prophet not Profet, Profit or Potato (yes I've seen that), Kreacher not Kreature, Buckbeak not Bukbiik, Bukbeak, Buckbiik or similar, among others are common mis-spellings

Second, leave no plot holes and get your HP facts checked (also, anything that is not the 7 books is not canon according to about 67% of the community) common plot holes are things like time turners, invisibility cloaks and Voldy being an idiot but that's pretty normal

Now, if you want a harem fic then by the gods never ever make that into a Lord Harry James Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Lovegood-Greengrass-Weasley-Emrys-Le Fay-Peverell-Ollivander-Naruto-God and some others with rings of ungodly power for each one

Basically avoid anything within linkffn(king of magic) and people should just chill

unusual pairings are of a large number in HP fanfic (Dobby/Hagrid, Harry/Hedwig, Hogwarts/Giant Squid, Hermione/Devil's snare, Hermione/Hagrid, Dobby/Hermione, Ron/Hedwig, Hermione/Giant Squid, Harry/Basilisk, and I feel like I'm missing atleast fifteen more)

but then there are the decent, but unusual pairings like Harry/Luna or Harry/Tracey or Harry/Hannah, which are in that order the most common to the rarest (that I've seen) of these three

Harem fics usually include Hermione, Daphne or Fleur (Daphne being the sister of Astoria Greengrass, Draco's wife) or even more than one of them, and then on the side there are girls like Susan Bones, Ginny Weasley or Luna Lovegood

I feel like I've missed something, but I can't remember

Eh whatever

Stay safe and have fun writing
