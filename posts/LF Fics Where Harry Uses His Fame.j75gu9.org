Whether that be for good or bad, I just want to read some fics where he takes advantage of his fame. Thanks in advance!

  “Harry,” Hermione said gently. “I think Romilda is right. If the /Harry Potter/ turns up at the tournament, does well -- amazingly well -- then demands to know how his godfather spent years in prison for Pettigrew's murder, if Pettigrew is apparently still alive -- think of it, the political pressure will be massive, it'll be unstoppable.”

Daphne Greengrass argues that he should use his fame in linkffn(The Perks by Free Drinks).
