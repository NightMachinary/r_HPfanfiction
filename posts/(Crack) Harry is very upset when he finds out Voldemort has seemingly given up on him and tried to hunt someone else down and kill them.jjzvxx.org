** "So that's how it is Tom? We're killing other people now?"

"Harry, it's not like that. I heard that Umbridge bitch sent a pair of dementors after you, and nobody kills you but me. You know that."

"Oh Tom, you still hate me?"

"Always."

*** When Voldemort goes for Umbridge, one of her cats sacrifices itself for her and the killing curse rebounds. Now Umbridge also becomes famous as the Bitch Who Lived. She uses that fame to consolidate her position as Minister for Magic and now Magical Britain is worse off than if Voldemort would have conquered it.

** "We had a /thing/ here Tom! You can't just mess with it, it'll throw- I don't know, like the entire /UNIVERSE/ OFF BALANCE! I should've known you'd do something like this! You always were a selfish bastard! And you know, I can find my /own/ Dark Lord, I don't need you!"

"Well what are you waiting for then?! LEAVE!"

"/sobs/ I will! And when you see me on the telly after I've defeated whoever they are, you'll be sorry!"

They never did see each other again, but even when they both fulfilled their dreams; they always felt the longing, and knew deep down that they always would, until they killed one another.

** Bellatrix swore as she dove into cover, the curse that Potter had sent at her passing close enough to singe her hair. "What the bloody hell is wrong with you, Potter?!" she screeched as the teenager dodged an Entrails Expelling Curse from another Death Eater, who was promptly tossed into a wall hard enough to leave an indent in the brick. "HOW DARE HE?! WHAT GIVES HIM THE RIGHT?!" Harry yelled, furiously blasting her cover to rubble. "Are you CRACKED, boy? I don't know what you're on about!" Bellatrix shouted, trying to Cruciate him. He Summoned a piece of debris into the path of the curse, causing it to explode in a shower of shrapnel.

"He's trying to murder someone else! He hasn't tried to kill me all year! We've been mortal enemies for YEARS, and he betrays me like this, and I won't stand for it!" Harry ranted insanely, a never-ending stream of curses and hexes flowing from his wand as he advanced on her. "He's bloody insane. Oh Merlin..." she muttered to herself as she shielded from a nasty looking purple flame curse. A cutting spell slashed into her off arm, opening a 4 inch gash that began to bleed heavily. With a rush of fear, she realized that she wouldn't survive this fight if it continued. "Potter, wait! Maybe I can try to talk to him, make him realize?" Bellatrix said desperately, not daring to hope. To her surprise, it worked; Potter instantly froze, looking pleading rather than insane.

"Do you think he'll listen?" Harry asked plaintively. "Yes, of course! I am his most trusted, his most faithful servant! He consults with me often, on important plans!" Bellatrix told him, grunting in pain as her bleeding arm began to ache harshly. Harry's wand dropped a fraction, so she pushed on. "If you let me go, I'll go straight back to him. I'll tell him that you're a bigger threat than we ever realized, that he simply must refocus his attention on killing you. You'll see, he'll be trying to kill you before the end of the week!" she promised. Harry considered for a minute, then lowered his wand to a standard guard stance. "Go. If you fail, I'll torture you until you bleed from your eardrums and die next time." Harry told her; she shuddered, but turned on her heel and Disapparated with a crack.

Lucius Malfoy was in the study when she arrived. She stumbled on the landing, increasingly dizzy due to blood loss. His aristocratic eyebrows rose at her state, even as he caught her. "What happened, cousin?" he asked, laying her on the fainting couch so that he could apply some first aid spells. "It was Potter. He's gone mad!" Bellatrix declared, hissing in pain as Lucius' spells went to work. "You're one to talk, Bella." Lucius commented mildly as he fed her a Blood Replenishing Potion. Bellatrix glared at him, but did not refute his words.

"He's like a gilted lover. He's angry, no, distraught that our Lord has not attempted to kill him this year." Bellatrix explained. Lucius raised an elegant eyebrow at that. "I withdraw my prior statement. Potter is far more insane than you." Lucius said with external calm. Bellatrix snorted, then shuddered. "As soon as I can, I need to see Him. The Dark Lord has no idea what has been unleashed by His actions... or lack of actions, in this case." she said. Lucius shuddered as well; that would not be a fun conversation.
