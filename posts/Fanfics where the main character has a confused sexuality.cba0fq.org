Also has to be a relatable character, with other aspects to them. I want a proper journey of sexual discovery where the character figure things out for themselves.


** linkao3(to reach without by inwardtransience) - Harry has a dysphoric experience and self-transfigures into a girl. Much internal struggling ensues. Incomplete and projected to be Harry/Susan, but there's enough to sink your teeth into.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** I'd imagine it would be something that would be hard to find an audience. There seem to be quite a few hp readers that have a preference for either slash or non-slash, and thus a story where the character might end up with either preference is likely to not interest those groups. At least it seems like you might get "author flirted with bla but them made the character go foobar instead".

Might work better as a background character.

The only fic that comes to mind is that one where Hermione goes "I think I might like girls" and Harry responds "Good, I think I also like girls", in a fic that had a nice Hermione/Harry friendship... But it wasn't a drawn out thing.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/780604]]) is a really nice one for self discovery when it comes to gender.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/781256]]) is good but also kind of depressing. It's a nice look into the wizarding world's view of sexuality, but that view's a downer.

  Over the years, Hermione almost gets the chance to come to terms with her own sexuality and sexual orientation, but never more than that. Little chances slip away over the years, into nothing.

** I really loved linkao3(Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)).

I had discovered myself to be asexual and was desperate for someone's experiences I could relate to, even if it was fictional. Harry's confusion and attempts at relationships touched me a lot.

Hope you find what you need.

  Malfoy is way too interested in coroner reports for somebody who's definitely not looking for ways to die, Harry wants to be friends with him, and Ginny wants to break up with Harry.Features: Little League Quidditch, an abundance of bath bombs, happy endings, and gay robots in space.

  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. LGBT characters. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. More notes inside.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
