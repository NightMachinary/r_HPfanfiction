I read The Cursed Child. I got angry. Now I'm getting even. The 'verse this is fixing is our own.

I'm almost done with this fic, which I affectionately call "the trashpile." It's time travel, so I threw all the rules out the window and decided to just have fun, splash around in some tropes, and see where it got me. Which is here, on a 60k word count throne of trash.

** I thought it was engagingly written, fast-moving, and a lot of fun. I'd like to see more CC fixes because I think there are potentially many alternate takes on it if you think outside the box. And all of them will be better than the play.

I've written one myself but it's hard to get eyes on the page because there's so much resistance to it. I guess people think that if you've written fanfiction for it, it's because you like it, when actually the opposite is the case. I've taken to describing mine as a 'transformative work'.

** I have been following this fic since it started and have really enjoyed it so far (Although I did read it on fanfiction.net so I did not know about about the time travel or Lily when I started reading it).

The story follows Harry, Dumbledore and Snape as a random girl appears out of nowhere knowing too many things about them and claiming to know a way to defeat Voldemort. They have to decide if they should go along with this strange random girl's plan. She also likes to go around telling Harry, Snape and later Lily details that other people like Dumbledore never told them which creates some interesting situations.

It has a good balance of being both entertaining at times and having a more serious tone at other times. I have not read cursed child so I don't know how accurate Delphini is to her character but I like her in this fic. Snape is also well portrayed and is not a super nice well adjusted person that he often is in fics that include him as a main character.

** It's pretty original concept/direction wise, capably written and the limited scope prevents it from taking spanning eight years with twice the word count of war and peace only to peter off without an actual ending. I genuinely like this fic, top-marks though in an admittedly limited category. (There's an obscene amount of Harry Potter fanfiction though I doubt there's more then one wonky, Crused Child time-travel fix-it, especially with the given approach.)

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

** - Your tags are atrocious and can be used as an example why Archive is bad

- Why would Delphi' travels to the 5th year change that Lily survived and why would she be together with the man who sold her family out? Without Lily dying, Snape has no reason to turn against Voldemort.

- If you want people here to read it, tell us something about your story. The description only says that Delphi traves back, your tags only raise more questions.

*** The timeline before 5th year is unchanged, Lily is resurrected in a way that makes sense for the fic. Lily and Snape are not together (at least as of yet) and their interactions between each other are varied in tone. She is not happy with him for various reasons but he is also the one of the few people she knows and who is around.

I do agree that this fic is likely not for someone who really doesn't like Snape though. He is not whitewashed here, but it does seem to be somewhat of a Snape redemption fic.

It is entertaining and a good fic otherwise, I do recommend reading it.

**** The tags promise a Snape pairing in the future. Dude got her and the love of her life killed while marking her son for death. He joined the magical Hitler knockoff who was targeting her fellow Muggleborns and her in particular.

The only intimate contact Lily would have with him would be ramming a rusty, poisoned sword up his arse before twisting it.

***** Almost anything can be done in fic.

Doing it /well/ is another matter entirely, of course.

A post-1981 Lily/Snape pairing could work, but it would have to contain an unattractive, non-whitewashed Snape and include an incredibly dysfunctional mess of a relationship for me to buy it.

(Come to think of it, any pairing involving Snape should probably be incredibly dysfunctional.)

****** I know this post is older, but I gotta say: 100% agree. Dysfunctional mess relationship is the only Snape relationship, and that's why I like shipping him with Lily, because that relationship is a /trainwreck./ There are plenty of happily-ever-afters in fic out there. I don't need to write them.

I think that we have a certain standard around here, even if the occasional Death Eater pairing tries to change that (they get downvoted into oblivion for a reason). I mean, you could write Anne Frank/Voldemort/Giant Squid, but at some point long before that, you should ask yourself why the hell you are putting your time into that project.

******** I don't ship people with Bellatrix, I advocate a more nuanced depiction of her than "evil Black Sister who joined Voldemort because she was so evil". It just is a better, less trope-y story.

The only two ways I see Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Bellatrix happen are massiv AUs, or under very specific circumstances which I haven't seen written so far.

And unlike any other Death Eater, Bellatrix is actually a capable fighter and a threat, so she isn't just a turd with a silver mask. She is cool evil, like Darth Vader.

I think she'd more likely stab him in the chest so she could watch his expression as he died. But I agree, Lily has self-respect, she left Snape behind and she definitely wouldn't get with him after he got her husband killed.

**** You have author's notes for flavors, tags are for finding shit. No one is going to search for Delphi/ruins everyone's day. Half of your tags are redundant (Order of the Phoenix would be enough, there's no need to tag CC if you already have the CC fandom tagged).

At least on Tumblr the only people who are subject to your tag spam are your followers, who obviously don't mind since they are following you. On archive all they do is clog up the search results for everyone else.
