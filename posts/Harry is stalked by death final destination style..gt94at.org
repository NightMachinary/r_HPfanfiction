A sort of death premonition as well as sign that death is near. Harry know when death is near and "Hides" from him everytime. It was never seriously targeting him until he prevented someone else's first death.

Plus points if both dumbledore and riddle get stalked as well but dealt with it differently


** “Really” Harry asked by the windowsill, barley avoiding falling to his death “you have to stop trying to kill me by freak accidents Larry, after the sharknado last month I thought you had seen reason” “I've told you to stop calling me Larry human! I am DEATH I am a reaper of souls. And I shall have yours” “God you're such a stalker” said Harry “plus you refuse to tell me your name and you seem like a Larry”
