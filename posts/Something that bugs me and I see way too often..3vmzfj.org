Moldy-Shorts, Dork Lord and Umbitch. Holy fuck do these annoy me. They are fine and amusing in crack/humour fics, but when I'm in a serious fic and people start to drop those nicknames it really drags me out of the seriousness and I just feel annoyed.

Anyway feel free to rant in this thread about other things that annoy the hell you of you.


** It's a shame that these are annoying, because it's something teenagers would actually do. Not so much the Moldy-Shorts or Dork Lord, but Umbitch I could totally see happening. When I was a kid we had some pretty unflattering nicknames for our hated teachers.

*** I really don't like nicknames for Voldemort. He's supposed to be so terrifying that people can't even speak his name. And then you have these kids calling him stupid nicknames? Doesn't follow. Fred and George do it, but they're hardly representative of the average person and their mother is rightly horrified and worried that their shop is going to be targeted.

****** Is "Taboo second war only" canon or speculation?

Because it makes so much sense for the taboo to have existed during the first war. It means the fear of the name actually makes a lot more sense.

******* The Taboo being used in the second war is canon. It being used in the first war is speculation. You can make the case for its use in the first either way.

I agree that it does make sense if it had been used in the first war. But [[/u/Ocdar]] has a good point as well. [[/u/Taure]] has said something similar in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/376ymm/whats_your_headfanon_yes_i_just_made_that_word_up/crkn9uc][other topics]].

#+begin_quote
  It's heavily implied that the Taboo is a Ministry power, not something Voldemort did. The Taboo didn't start working until Voldemort took the Ministry, the night of the wedding, and it is administered by the Ministry. When Harry triggered the Taboo and the Snatchers came, they had come from the Ministry -- going to Malfoy Manor was a deviation from procedure.

  This would be why Voldemort didn't use it in the first war: he didn't have access to it, because he never successfully took the Ministry.

******* I see the Taboo as something they needed control of the ministry to implement.

Fear of speaking the name during the first war could be entirely due to just killing people that spoke it. In book 1 Hagrid mentioned that you didn't know who you could trust. If the rumor got started that someone was killed by death eaters just for saying Voldemort's name to his friends in private, there would be huge discord. You would have people immediately unsure of who they could trust and fearing expressing their opposition to current events.

*** Umbitch maybe and I chuckled the first time, as she is just a petty overstuffed person, it really only bugs me in super serious fanfics where it seems out of place. But Dork Lord and Moldy Short really bug me cause yeah, they shouldn't be afraid to say his name but there's a difference between not fearing the mere mention of this person and treating them with utter disrespect despite the fact that he could easy kill you. Gotta respect your enemy.

Actually I find the name "Voldemort" annoying - I love it when Dumbledore or Harry just call him "Tom" (as it makes him angry and prone to mistakes!) - it's after all just the made up name of a crazy upstart wizard who's ashamed of his ancestry and afraid of dying (it's a wounder that he got the deatheaters to follow him if he tortures them regularly - I mean a room full of dark wizards firing Avadas and he's toast, sure he might survive because of the horcruxes, but he's got no power-base if he comes back (hell, he might stay a shade forever as he needs help for a body-creation-ritual!))

ps: I called people less than flattering names when I was younger (hell, I still do sometimes - just like people on Star Trek: TNG calling Reginald Barkley (spelling?) "broccoli" because of his less than stellar work ethic and social ineptitude (despite them man not being stupid!))...I either shortened their names or changed the names of people I liked, too - like one of the teachers Mr. Kastenhuber, every student called him "KaHu" when not talking to him (Hell, I'd love nicknames for more of the Hogwarts staff!)
