Hiya, I used to read a lot of fanfic as a teen, stopped for a few years but now want to get back into it. There's a couple of really specific ones I half remember that I'd love to re read if anyone can help me figure it out. Apologies that my descriptions almost certainly suck.

One of them was about Harry going back in time and changing stuff. I can't remember much about book 1, but I know there was a sequel where everyone starts dying because history is righting itself and I think the author abandoned it halfway through book 2?

Also there was another series of hp pdfs, I remember the word phoenix being a big part of it but nothing else. I think there were 3 or 4 books in the series, and in pretty sure they were anti dumbledore.

Also, my favourite fic is Harry Potter and the Summer of Change, my otp is honks. If anyone can suggest more fics like SoC or any good (not too smutty) honks fics that would be amazing. Thanks in advance!
