** Not a fic, but have you watched A Very Potter Musical and both of its sequels? Harry is very James in it, and it's fantastic.

** What would Broz Do? is a fic where Harry and Ron are sort of like Sirius and James. It's based on what the author thinks Harry and Ron would do if they never became friends with Hermione

**** Why do you need Harry be pressed into something he isn't? Read some Marauders' Era story. Just going through “The Peace Not Promised” by Tempest Kiro linkffn(12369512) and it is very well written (although, as usual, in a need of severe cutting) Snilly story with well-written arc for James (and not so much Sirius).

I take 'What is fanfiction?' for $500.

Seriously. Fanfiction is all about changing characters into something they are not. Do you also comment this everytime people talk about independent Harry, or Slytherin Harry, or any other Harry other than Canon Harry.

******** I was not talking just about you. I have just lost (not that I would care THAT much, I have plenty of them) some fifteen points in this thread because people called me a Snape apologist. Then I suggest that making Harry into James II. is not the best idea, because these two are very different characters (not that you CANNOT or MUSTN'T do it, just that it is stupid; if you want to make Snape into pink-robes-wearing prankster, go ahead), and I am accused that I don't know what fanfiction is. Awesome.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

*** you sound like a Snape apologist for sure. Let's just forget the fact James laid his life down for his family, and that Sirius broke out of goddamn Azkaban to protect Harry. No, the real hero here is the magical Nazi who set a mass murderer on two babies.

**** I don't think I am (and BTW, I haven't uttered a word about Snape). I am not excusing Snape's horrible behaviour towards Harry, and I don't excuse his descent into being a Death Eater. Those both are absolutely horrible things and it seems to me that JKR got over them too easily (Albus Severus Potter). And yes, James obviously grew up from some of that and then by all accounts he was a good leader of his group and a good father dying for his kid. However, every child in his life has to have a moment when it discovers that their parents are not flawless Gods (I wrote linkao3(18770464) about it), and that each of us (quoting Sirius in a film, or Solzhenitsyn for that matter) we each have some light and dark parts, and yes James and Sirius certainly had some of both.
