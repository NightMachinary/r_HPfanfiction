** Did you try searching ffn? It's not that hard to find a long harry/daphne story with bashing.

**** Ho corrected it. I think it's funny that his edited version still has at least eight mistakes.

****** No, but there are six proper nouns that aren't capitalized, no period, and no subject. He left out that he's looking for a story after the word bashing and his transition to his second request is incorrect. It might not be technically incorrect, but he also wrote "daphne or susan or a patil or multiple" which would be better written as "Daphne, Susan, a Patil, or multiple women."

** *Aspirations* and *Rise of the Wizards*, linkffn(4545504;6254783): their authors definitely don't like Ron and Hermione.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
