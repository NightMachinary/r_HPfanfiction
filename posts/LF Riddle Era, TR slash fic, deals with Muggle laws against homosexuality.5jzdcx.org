So I really don't know if this has ever been written, but it's worth a shot. Tom Riddle grew up in a time where being gay was a criminal offense. But while I have read several time travel fics that take place in that era, some of which were slash fics, I've never seen any that addressed this criminalization. I know it is fanon (canon?) that wizards view homosexuality differently, but Riddle was Muggle raised so... yeah.

Thanks in advance :-)


** I've definitely seen it vaguely addressed, but in a "wow you guys are old-fashioned lol" way, not in a "oh crap we could get arrested for this" way. I would also like to see that! It would add an interesting depth to the slash that isn't usually present.
