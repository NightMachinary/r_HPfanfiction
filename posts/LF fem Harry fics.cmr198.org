Decided to give one a read was pleasantly surprised. So can anyone recommend any good ones. Not so in to cross overs tho


** No recommendation for fem!Harry stories would be complete without linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh). Absolutely beautiful characterizations, heartrending scenes interspersed with lighthearted comedy. Easily in my top ten FF of all time.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Huh. Neither of the fics I first would have thought of have been recommended yet.

!linkffn(Victoria Potter)

probably one of the best ones. It's highly canon divergent to the point of basically having its own plot (I think the plot of Philosopher's Stone is relagated to a single scene where the school is on lockdown?)

!linkffn(To Reach Without)

This one has a /lot/ of worldbuilding. It's honestly had to summarise.

*** I really like TRW, but it's worth pointing out that the plot develops /extremely/ slowly and was just starting to get somewhere by the time it got abandoned. The characters are great though, especially Hermione imo. One of the better friendships I can remember reading.

the author, inwardtransience, has a few other female Harry stories which are all worth reading if you like their style.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Shameless self-pomotion time! I'm writing a story called "Holly Potter and the Witching World," a pretty massive AU where 90% of the magical world is female. The witching world is a differently-structured society than the canon wizarding one, largely being formed around polyamorous families called "covens" (because "harems" sounded too Arabian Nights)... and since I'm going full AU anyway, sometimes the magic works a little differently, and the story is different too.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

*** (CW: mentions of CSA, among other things, in this little rant thing)

Every time someone recommends the Black Queen series I get a little sad. Like, the only thing I can really think about it is how much goddamn /potential/ it had, but was almost immediately squandered under ... Less than thrilling interpretations of certain topics.

Like, I project a lot into what I want in a fanfic, sure, but the premise of a darker fem!Harry who has experienced some form of child sexual abuse - and with others profiting from it - being tutored under an old witch who taught her to take control of her life and move beyond her dark past is /such/ a fucking gripping idea to me. Traumas and shit are my own, sure, and I don't really expect anyone to write it because I feel like I could relate to it, but I was so excited for it because it could honest-to-shit deal with a traumatized child dealing in dark powers and facing her traumas head on before finding a way to move beyond it.

The Black Queen doesn't do this. I won't get into it but Candyland is so wrong in how that sort of shit works that it was almost offensive to read - the willingness that's implied really put me off - to me, and the main character never actually has to deal with their dark past aside from the fact that they fear being weak like they were in the past. It handled very, /very/ fragile and uncomfortable topics with the grace of a sledgehammer and none of the nuance. Just because the main character has owned their trauma doesn't mean they /literally have to own the thing that traumatized them/, for fucks sake.

There was just so much potential in there for a story with a darker main character who overcame their trauma with darker actions, lashing out at the world around her while trying to prove to herself and others that she's powerful, all the while maneuvering around a Dumbledore who /can't understand what she's dealing with/. None of that potential was realized, and while it scratched the "project through the pov character" itch I had to an extent, it still didn't really work, especially with how it handles things like Narcissa and Luna, to a lesser extent.

On that same note, if anyone has any recommendations for a Harry who has dealt with being an escort / has dealt with child sexual abuse and it fits any of my ramblings, feel free to drop a link and I'll probably read it.

**** Gotta say I totally agree with this and second it for anyone looking for a bit of a criticism on this trilogy.

First time I read it, I eventually skipped the scenes with Candyland and Narcissa being the character that she is in that fic. You can't really skip Luna, but fucking hell...

I never finished the last part of the trilogy. As you said, the characters disappoint in how they were written to handle these topics.

**** Try antithesis, not exactly what you want, and at first it reads like another edgy wrong boy who lived fic, but after a few chapters it starts going deep into how psychologically FUCKED Adrian/Harry is, it sort of dives into dark magic addiction, while all the while Adrian who is relatively strong(above average) is so throughly convinced that he's weak and useless allowed himself to be convinced and manipulated. (SPOILERS) and the most absolutely fucked up part is, that literally all the pain and sadness he goes through could literally have been avoided if his parents noticed him more. It is genuinely the ONLY fic to nearly have brought me to tears

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?
