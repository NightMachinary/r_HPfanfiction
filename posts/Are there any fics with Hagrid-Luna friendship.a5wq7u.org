Not necessarily as a primary element, but there.

It struck me as interesting that the two fairly eccentric, gentle, animal-obsessed, slightly socially isolated characters never really cross paths in canon iirc. That seems like a missed opportunity, although at the same time I can see how it would have been hard to slot in from Harry's POV.


** Definitely feels like something that could be canon, we just never saw it because it didn't happen in front of Harry's POV.

Maybe Hagrid was the one who told her where to find the thestrals... maybe Hagrid was a friend to her during her early years when it's strongly hinted at her being picked on... I'd like to think of her and Hagrid having tea together sometimes, perhaps he is more adamant debating her about the existance of snorkaks and nargles and other creatures. PERHAPS, MAJOR PERHAPS, he's the one who knew Newt and years later at some fundraiser for magical creatures she goes over to talk with Hagrid and he introduces her to the grandson of an old friend of his, Rolf Scamander.

** Sadly, there isn't much on Fanfiction.net--which is all the more the disappointing as it's one of my very favorite ideas for stories.

For one-shots, there's "Hope" and "A Different Sort."

I'm not as well-versed for any one-shots for Archive Of Our Own.

There's a couple of small subplots where this comes into play in longer fics.

The classic Nightmares of Future Past has a first-year Luna being somewhat awestruck by Hagrid, as she's never met a half-giant before, but she can't understand why people don't like him, as Hagrid is very nice. Luna, being Luna, has no brain-to-mouth filter and tells Hagrid this while visiting him (alongside Harry and Co.) for tea.

There's also a very tender scene in the fic /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ where Hagrid is showing the fourth-years thestrals for a lesson. Luna is the only one who can see them, and Hagrid's gentle but firm affirmations of thestrals improves her opinions of him as a teacher dramatically.

On that note, /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is an excellent Luna-fic in its own right. The scene in question is in Chapter Eleven.

*** Nightmares also has Hagrid taking an interest in Luna's 'obscure' creatures.

** Sorvan's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] Hagrid and Luna bond over magical creatures pretty much immediately after meeting for the first time and while it's not exactly a centerpiece of the story their friendship is repeatedly brought up again whenever either of the two shows up.

Note that the story is a Harry/Ginny soulbond fic, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea (even if it is one of the best executions of the trope I've seen so far)
