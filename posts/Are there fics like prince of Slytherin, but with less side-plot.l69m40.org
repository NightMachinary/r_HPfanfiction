I really like this fic but i cant get past second year. It just gets to much at once. So im looking for something similar but more to the point.


** I had the same issue. If I wanted that complicated of a plot, I'd read my AP Stats textbook. I liked the premises, but it required too much concentration for me when I'm trying to relax.

*** Loool, same here, an apt comparison Indeed! If you want something like PoS but with less side plot, id recommend Sarcasm and Slytherin series on AO3. It is either abandoned or updated very slowly, though. From what last heard, the author seems to be alive.

*** Yeah, it's definitely overwrought at times, but there's also just so much good/creative stuff packed into it. Rare magic, everyday magic, a creative dive into mind magic in different aspects, character studies that you normally don't see, references to fanon without feeling dismissive, magic martial arts that don't feel like they're just ripping off Naruto, actually competent folk on both sides including a legitimately threatening Pettigrew, etc.

I'm definitely very hot and cold on this fic. Some stuff I absolutely love, some stuff I straight up skip on a reread. First year I liked the least, mostly because the Jim stuff was kind of comical, and even that had stuff like the Neville plotline that I found pretty interesting. Also literally /everything/ gets explained, which tends to draw things out.

**** I have mixed feelings about this. It is a more streamlined PoS, but I feel it leans a little too hard into the rehabilitation of Death Eaters. Some of the plot of the latter books in particular rubs me the wrong way.

Glad to see it's not dead though. I've definitely stuck around to read way worse stories.

***** The characterisations are absurd in this series. There is absolutely no consistency in the actions of the characters - imagine James and Dumbledore conspiring to put Sirius in prison because he was using Dark spells against Death Eaters (in his capacity as an Auror).

** Sarcasm and Slytherin was already recommended I believe, but yes, it is essentially simpler and more straightforward plot-wise.

Another one I could recommend is Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos, though it may be closer up there with PoS in terms of complexity than Sarcasm and Slytherin. I would say it is marginally less sophisticated plot-wise than Prince of Slytherin, but more so than Sarcasm and Slytherin.

** I know what you mean. I'm currently on the 4th book but haven't read any of it yet because I know the first 10 chapters will be lots of side plot. But the side plot actually has bearing on what happens later so its not side plot for long, Anyways I'm waiting for the author to post Chapter 13 of the current fiction before I start reading. lol

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
