Preferably with a major role although minor is also fine, well-written and enjoyable.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12972342/1/A-Step-to-the-Right][A Step to the Right]], linkffn(12972342): dimensional time travel, so far so good.

*** I just hope it doesn't overstay it's welcome like A Marauder's Plan did.

Up to this point this new fic has been really promising, but I'm concerned that it will go off meander in a million directions again and never get to the point.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

*** I hadn't realised they'd started a new series!

So glad. Yes A Marauders Plan went a bit too long but it's enjoyable.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11659440/1/A-Black-and-A-Dumbledore][A Black and A Dumbledore]] by Lily Carmen Black is highly enjoyable and written like a poem from what I can recall.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus Black died at eighteen and as he was pulled down by the Inferi to his watery death, he never dreamed that he would be saved. But by chance, luck was finally on his side and whether it was by destiny or some cure trick of fate, Ariana Kendra Dumbledore saved Regulus Arcturus Black that night; in return, and forever more, he, and five Ghosts, chose to keep saving her.

** Would it count if she still dies but features in a story? As in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]] she's a major character. Goes from Kendra's death to Ariana's death.
