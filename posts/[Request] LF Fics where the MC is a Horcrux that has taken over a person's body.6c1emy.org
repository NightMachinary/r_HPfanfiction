  Dedicated to my friends in the Teachers' Lounge. Lord Voldemort's attempt to possess the soul of Ginny Weasley was successful, but his triumph was not without consequence. Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts.

** I was seriously wondering why you would want to have the Master Chief as a Horcrux. Then I realised that you mean main character.

Also now I want a Halo Crossover where a bunch of Spartans slaughter the pureblood supremacy movement without survivors.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
