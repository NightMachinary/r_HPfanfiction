Honestly looking for Harry as Snapes kid+decent at occlumency+angst because THERE IS NO WAY THOSE TWO FIGURE OUT THEY ARE RELATED AND FLY ON RAINBOWS INTO THE SUNSET GUY COMEON!! Even if child harry is excited, Snape is expected to have an adult angsting mental breakdown.

And I like Occlumency... not that its a 100% requirement but I like it.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.
