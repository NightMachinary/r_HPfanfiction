** I have to say linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) and it's sequels are good, but it's very dark. I still enjoyed it, however.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Harry Potter and the Rejected Path - linkffn(6375811) - is a long fic (357,000+ words) and is still updated a few times a year it seems. It can be a bit smutty at times so keep that in mind.

Like a Phoenix From the Ashes by Kinsfire - Harry loses the support of his greatest allies, but learns something else in the process. This story is often angsty and dark, but is guaranteed to end in a good manner. [[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Like_A_Phoenix_From_The_Ashes/index/]]
