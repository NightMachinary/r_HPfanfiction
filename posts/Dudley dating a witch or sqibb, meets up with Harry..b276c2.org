Dudley was dating a witch, or possibly a squib, and they met up with "Cousin Harry". Dudley's date is shocked to find out it's Harry Potter.

Found!!!! By [[/u/ProteanScrivener][u/ProteanScrivener]]

I was mixing two stories, but I was thinking about the imaginatively named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Runs Into An Old Muggle Classmate]]


** I think I recall the story, I'm currently looking through my list of saved fics, see if I can find it. I haven't yet, but I found something similar: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate]]

Edit: couldn't find it on my list, rip.

*** That's interesting. I'd have thought a Dudley/a Hufflepuff would be far more likely - looking at Cho's boyfriends, she goes more for the good-looking, clever, sporty type. Dudley doesn't seem to be conventionally handsome, and is more beefy than sporty.

Actually, I'd like to see a Dudley/Romilda fic.

**** Any division lower than super heavyweight tends to be a lot leaner than people think. They're ripped and cut as hell.

I once ran a 5k with Oscar de la Hoya and he did a high 15 low 16. That's blistering fast for anybody not a talented and super competitive distance runner-and in the pack with them. For reference, most of the high schoolers who finished around him that race went on run College track/cross country. Lots of combat sport athletes are absolute beasts of athletes. It's incredibly demanding.

I could definitely see boxers as sporty rather than beefy. Most of them are.

***** I guess, but Dudley was allegedly very obese, and Vernon and Marge are both large boned, on top of being overweight. Even once slimmed down, it's unlikely Dudley would ever have a slender build, the way Harry and Cedric were. During his boxing years, he was as big as ever, just muscle instead of fat. We don't know for sure about Michael's build, but all three were dark, and Dudley was blond. So, he still doesn't seem her type.

** Hmm I'm pretty sure you're not mixing stories. There is indeed one where Dudley is with someone from the Wizarding world and indeed is surprised when she learns his cousin is HP. It may be a subplot in a bigger fic though. Not sure anymore but I'm pretty sure it exists. It certainly does remind me of something I read which isn't what was proposed here (that I read too).

EDIT: I'll also add that it's possible that Dudley didn't know his girlfriend was a witch until this encounter. Not sure though.

  Dudley was captivated from the moment he met her, but their relationship won't be easy. After all, how could a Dursley last with someone so un-Dursleyish as Luna Lovegood?

  After a year in hiding with wizards, Dudley Dursley isn't the same thug he was when he used to beat up kids on the playground. He's a world champion boxer now, and his life has its own rhythm. But the beautiful French girl at the club throws that rhythm off. Then Harry Potter reappears in his life, and Dudley has to face the world that he had tried so hard to forget.
