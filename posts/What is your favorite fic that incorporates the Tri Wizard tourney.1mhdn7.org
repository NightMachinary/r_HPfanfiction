** Not even a contest in my mind:

JBern's "[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][Lie I've Lived]]"

It's an AU piece with a Harry/Fleur ship, but it's written with a sense of imagination that outstrips anything Rowling did in book 4 (In my opinion at least) and the characters are much more mature, reasonable and fun to read. It's pure awesomeness in 60,000 words.

This is the writing that really got me into Harry Potter fan fiction. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

***** Well, I only read the first two chapters, and someone else pointed out that it is much better edited afterward, but ... grammar is objective, mostly, and surely I'm not the only one who noticed the dozens of mistakes. Add to that Harry's bizarre interactions with every other character so far and you get crap.

I'm on mobile but HPMOR is my favorite fic, and the only one that I think truly comes close to professional-level writing. Off the top of my head I also really enjoy some of enembee's work I think, and a couple of others. If you respond to this I can link you a couple more later.

**** Yeah, the writing is really poor for the first 2-3 chapters. It was originally a fic for a contest, so the first couple of chapters weren't beta'd properly. The writing quality is much, much better after that.

** I thought this one was interesting, just because it was so different and sad: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]]

#+begin_quote
  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
#+end_quote

Basically, Harry isn't actually Harry, just a sort of clone. The real Harry comes back and everyone turns their back on clone-Harry, so he tried to use the tournament to prove himself worthy.

This fic contains a much more expansive and complicated version of the Tournament, and since this is a time looping fic, you see it play out several times with different outcomes.

  Dumbledore doesn't ignore the 2nd prophecy! He apprentices Harry and teaches him a rare form of magic, but draws the ire of a secret society who seek to guard this knowledge and do Harry in. Assassination attempts on multiple fronts. H/F, Yr. 4 GoF AU.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6990881/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alternative-Tournament][Harry Potter and the Alternative Tournament]] - A Harry Potter and Disney crossover where Mary Poppins takes on the role of Harry's Headmistress and Governess for his fourth year and beyond.

I LOVE this fic. It's got tons of pretty solid humor and if I didn't know that Mary Poppins was awesome before, I do now. Harry gets all kinds of help from different Disney character and manages to save the day all while snubbing his nose at his former professors and classmates at Hogwarts.

READ THIS FIC.

Edit: I wanted to make sure that people know that this story doesn't really contain any relationships between characters except the last bit of "and then they lived happily ever after". The story says it's "slash", but it really isn't - the extent of it is something along the lines of Harry saying "boy, I sure think that Oliver Wood character is cute, I wish he were my boyfriend". It doesn't play a role in the story AT ALL beyond a line or two. Unless you find the entire idea of homosexual references morally reprehensible, it's nothing to avoid reading the story over.
