Dumbledore is not evil, or insane, or incompetent, yet he is often portrayed that way in fanfiction. Dumbledore bashing is so common that it's practically a meme on this subreddit. Some Dumbledore bashing is self-aware --- making Dumbledore senile can be funny, and sometimes it's necessary for the plot --- but I fear that most Dumbledore bashing is sincere, and it stems from a misunderstanding of Dumbledore's actions throughout the series.

So, to cut to the chase, I'm going to do my best to explain Dumbledore's plan, and perhaps justify some of his bewildering decisions. I'll be paying specific attention to Dumbledore's actions in the Philosophers Stone, since people often disagree with everything he did in that book.

Because I'll be reverse engineering the book's plot, please keep in mind that a lot of this will be conjecture, and perhaps Rowling's intentions don't align with my interpretation of canon. Please think of this post as a canon-complaint speculative work of fanfiction, instead of a retelling of the literal events as depicted in the books.

Before we begin analyzing Dumbledore's actions, we first need to deconstruct his motives. Contrary to what Rita Skeeter might say, Dumbledore does /not/ believe in the Greater Good. In actuality, Dumbledore is consumed with regret for the death of his sister, and he hates himself for his role in her demise. The Dumbledore who believed in the Greater Good died alongside Ariana, and the Dumbledore we meet in canon despises that utilitarian philosophy.

So, why, then, did he treat Harry like an expendable pawn? Why, as Snape put it, "raise Harry like a pig for slaughter?"

Our tale begins as it does in the first book, with the deaths of James and Lily Potter. In the immediate aftermath of the Potter's murder, Dumbledore realizes several things:

- Harry is the child of prophecy, destined to vanquish the Dark Lord.
- Lily sacrificed herself for Harry, and by doing so she activated an old enchantment of love and blood. Lily's blood, within Harry (and Petunia), will now protect him from Voldemort.
- Love (specifically, Lily's love) is probably the "power the Dark Lord knows not."
- Voldemort survived having his body destroyed, and is therefore utilizing some form of magical immortality.

At this point, Dumbledore does not know how Voldemort has achieved immortality, and so he has no idea /when/ Voldemort will return --- he could regain his former power in a matter of days --- so ensuring Harry's safety is urgent and paramount. Voldemort may /personally/ and /immediately/ try to kill Harry again, so no ordinary wizarding family could adopt Harry without considerable risk of imminent murder.

Dumbledore briefly considers adopting Harry himself. However, the Ministry is corrupt, and overrun with bewitched double agents and Death Eater infiltrators. There's no way the Ministry would allow Dumbledore to adopt The-Boy-Who-Lived without a lengthy bureaucratic battle, which could prove fatal for Harry if he is ever taken into Ministry custody.

Taking that into consideration, Dumbledore does the only thing he can, and sends Harry to live with his muggle relatives. The Death Eater agents within the Ministry do not challenge this decision, because they assume Harry will be vulnerable in the care of defenseless muggles. However, because Petunia shares Lily's blood, the blood-love-enchantment will grant both Harry and the Dursley's protection against Voldemort and his followers.

Dumbledore's decision to not send Harry to an ordinary wizarding family is soon justified when the Longbottom's are tragically tortured into insanity by Death Eater remnants. Frank Longbottom was a trained and experienced auror --- if not even he could keep his family safe, then what hope would any normal family have of protecting Harry? The blood-love-enchantment seems to be the only way to garunatee Harry's safety.

It's worth noting that Dumbledore has no reason to suspect that Harry will be mistreated. The Dursleys love and spoil their existing son, and Dumbledore assumes they will treat Harry the way any decent people would treat their recently orphaned nephew. Even so, Dumbledore recruits a local squib to keep an eye on Harry, and to report if she ever notices anything suspicious.

And so, the years go by. Dumbledore does everything he can to investigate Voldemort's immortality, starting with an investigation of Tom Riddle's past. Regularly, he hears reports from Mrs. Figg, the squib keeping watch over Harry.

Harry is neglected in the Dursley household. He sleeps in a closet. He doesn't get any birthday presents. But, unfortunately, the Dursley's are a vain couple, consumed with worries about their image and reputation --- they never made Harry sleep in a closet /in public/. So, while Mrs. Figg was aware of the Dursley's general dislike of Harry, she never knew the full extent of their neglect.

As per Mrs. Figg's regular reports, Dumbledore learns that Harry is a polite, kind and occasionally snarky child, and while the Dursley's don't care about Harry, they don't beat or abuse him either. Dumbledore is concerned for Harry's happiness, and he often considers sending Harry to a more loving family, but an unfortunate ultimatum keeps him from acting. Leaving the Dursley's simply isn't safe, and Dumbledore is haunted by the fate of Harry's original family. Despite Dumbledore's best efforts, the Potters were found and murdered. It is an established fact that conventional magical defenses aren't enough to protect Harry's guardians from You-Know-Who; sending Harry to a new home would be a death sentence for his new family. The blood-love-enchantment is the only thing known to work --- even the Fidelius charm failed to stop Voldemort in the past. It really is a choice between the Dursley's or death.

With a heavy heart, Dumbledore continues his research.

Eventually, though it's not clear exactly when, Dumbledore comes to the conclusion that Tom Riddle is using Horcruxes as his form of immortality. It doesn't take him long to figure out that Harry is also a Horcrux. Naturally, this is a problem; Voldemort can not die while Harry lives.

Dumbledore is not an evil man. Dumbledore no longer believes in the Great Good. Dumbledore refuses to sacrifice Harry. With the memory of his sisters death weighing heavily on his mind, Dumbledore redoubles his efforts in researching the nature of Horcruxes, determined to find a way to defeat Voldemort /and/ save young Harry from his seemingly inevitable tragic fate.

In his research, Dumbledore learns several important things:

- There are two major ways in which Voldemort can regain his body: He can use the Philosophers Stone, or he can perform a Resurrection Ritual.
- The Resurrection Ritual requires the blood of Voldemort's greatest enemy. Voldemort would take that blood into himself, and use it within his new body.
- Harry's shares Lily's blood, and it is Lily's blood that powers the blood-love-enchantment that keeps Harry safe.

Based on this information, Dumbledore forms his master plan to defeat Voldemort and save Harry:

- *STEP 1:* Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
- *STEP 2:* Destroy the Philosopher's Stone, so Voldemort is forced to use the Resurrection Ritual to regain his former power.
- *STEP 3:* Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.
- *STEP 4:* Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
- *STEP 5:* Lie to Harry, and tell him he needs to be killed by Voldemort to destroy the Horcrux within his scar.
- *STEP 6 (a):* Harry willingly sacrifices himself to Voldemort.
- *STEP 6 (b):* The Horcux is destroyed by Voldemort, and Harry is protected from death by Lily's blood-love-enchantment, because Lily's blood is still flowing in the veins of Voldemort's resurrected body.
- *STEP 6 (c):* Because Harry believed he was going to die, and he willingly sacrificed himself to protect the people he loves, a /new/ blood-love-enchantment is created. This new blood-love-enchantment is based upon /Harry's/ blood, just like the original blood-love-enchantment was based on /Lily's/ blood.
- *STEP 6 (d):* There are now two different sets of blood-love-enchantments. The first is based on Lily's blood, and it was created by her sacrifice in Godric's Hollow. This blood-love-enchantment protects Harry from Voldemort. The second blood-love-enchantment is based on Harry's blood, and it was created by Harry's "sacrifice" in the Forbidden Forest. This blood-love-enchantment protects everybody Harry loves from Voldemort. Both Voldemort and Harry have /both/ Lily's blood /and/ Harry's blood flowing through their veins.

At this point, Voldemort is fucked. He can't win. He can't kill Harry, because Lily's blood (within Voldemort) keeps him alive. He can't kill the people Harry loves, because Harry's blood (within Harry and Voldemort) protects them.

This is Dumbledore's grand plan. This is how Voldemort is defeated in canon. Dumbledore was /lying/ when he told Snape that Harry had to die.

If you still don't understand, then I'll let Dumbledore and Harry explain it in the their own words:

#+begin_quote
  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died

  for me this time -- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in

  his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. *“He took your blood and rebuilt his living body*

  *with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered*

  *you to life while he lives!”*

  ...

  *“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a*

  *tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body*

  *keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you* and so does

  Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

  *“And you knew this? You knew -- all along?”*

  “I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily,

  ...

  *"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,"* said Harry as they circled, and stared

  into each other's eyes, green into red. *"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again.*

  *Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - "*

  *"But you did not!"*

  *" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're*

  *protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are*

  *binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your*

  *mistakes, Riddle, do you?"*
#+end_quote

I'd also like to draw your attention to this passage from the Goblet of Fire:

#+begin_quote
  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told

  Dumbledore. “He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was

  right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought *he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's*

  *eyes.*
#+end_quote

Dumbledore felt triumphant because it was at this moment he knew his plan was succeeding, and Harry could be saved.

There you have it. That explains steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Dumbledore's master plan.

But there's a problem. While some of Dumbledore's machinations are clearly laid out in the books, we never have a direct confirmation of steps 1 and 2. These steps are essential for the overall plan --- they lay the groundwork for everything that happens in the final books --- for without them, Voldemort would have never taken Harry's blood into himself, and Harry would have been doomed to die.

And that raises some questions: when, and how, did Dumbledore convince Voldemort that Harry was his greatest enemy? Because you have to admit, that's quite an accomplishment; Dumbledore convinced the /greatest dark wizard of all time/ that an /awkward pubescent child/ was a credible rival.

To find the answer, we need to reexamine The Philosophers Stone. If we take the events of the first book at face value, nothing makes sense in the larger context of the overall story:

- Why would Dumbledore hide the Stone behind such easily thwarted defenses?
- Why didn't Dumbledore confront Quirrel when he realized he was working for Voldemort?
- Why did Dumbledore leave the Mirror of Erised in a random room of the castle, where wondering students could find it?
- How could Dumbledore be so stupid as to be drawn away from the castle by such an obvious diversion?
- How could Dumbledore be so incompetent as to allow Harry to come face to face with Voldemort himself?

Most fans simply disregard these questions with the meta knowledge that the Philosophers Stone is a children's book and shouldn't be taken seriously. Dumbledore only acts like an idiot in this book because it's necessary for the plot. The protagonist being surrounded my incompetent adults is a cliche in fiction for children.

However, I don't think we need to break our immersion to explain Dumbledore's seemingly insane decisions. We don't need to retreat into a meta-narrative to understand the Philosopher's Stone. We simply need to view Dumbledore's actions within the wider context of Dumbledore's master plan. The story in the Philosopher's Stone was /not/ about protecting the Stone, it was about Dumbledore engineering an encounter between Voldemort and Harry --- under /tightly/ controlled conditions --- to lay the groundwork for Voldemort's eventual defeat.

For those of you that are still skeptical, please read the following except:

#+begin_quote
  “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend --- Nicolas Flamel ---”

  “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the

  thing properly, didn't you?"

  ...

  “D'you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father's cloak and

  everything?”

  “Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did --- I mean to say that's terrible --- you could have been

  killed.”

  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted

  to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I

  reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught

  us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's

  almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...”
#+end_quote

That's an explicit canon conformation that Dumbledore orchestrated the entire event. He wanted Harry to face Voldemort, as per step one of his master plan. And when you reread the Philosopher's Stone with Dumbledore's master plan in mind, things start making a lot more sense...

- Dumbledore asked Hagrid to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone, knowing that Harry would be accompanying him (so that Harry would know about the Stone's existence)
- Dumbledore gave Harry his Invisibility Cloak on Christmas because he knew Harry couldn't resist exploring the castle (which meant Harry would discover the Mirror and learn how it worked)
- Dumbledore didn't banish Quirrel (because he wanted Harry to confront Voldemort personally)

And so on. Hell, Dumbledore was probably the one who suggested that Hagrid give Harry a flute. There are countless contextual clues that only make sense with the hindsight of offered by the later books.

But perhaps the most relevant evidence are the challenges Harry and his friends had to face in their attempt to retrieve the Stone. Every single task was meticulously designed to /appear/ dangerous, but in actuality be easily overcome by the specific skills of Harry and his companions:

- *The Three Headed Dog*

Hagrid knew how to get past Fluffy. Hagrid /just so happened/ to be the one who retried Harry from the Dursleys, so they had become close friends. Hagrid /just so happened/ to give Harry a flute for Christmas. And even if, by some miracle, Hagrid didn't reveal Fluffy's secret, Harry also had an invisibility cloak (given to him by Dumbledore) that made getting to the trap door easy. That's all rather convenient, don't you think?

- *The Devils Snare*

It's a good thing Nevile is a Herbology genius and future herbology professor, right?

- *The Flying Keys*

This is certainly a difficult challenge (unless you happen to be the youngest seeker in a century, but what are the chances of that?)

- *The Giant Chess Set*

Harry sure is lucky that his best friend is a chess master.

- *The Troll*

Trolls are scary. Unless, of course, you already know how to beat them, having defeated one earlier in the year.

- *The Potion Puzzle*

How convenient that Harry's other best friend is smart enough to easily solve such a simple logic puzzle.

Clearly, Dumbledore intended for Harry and his friends to get past these challenges with minimal difficulty. Every singe obstacle was vulnerable to the individual talents of Harry and his companions. It's all far too convenient to just be a coincidence. However, Dumbledore made one mistake; he assumed Nevile would join Harry on his quest, but instead Nevile tried to stop him. However, even without Nevile's Herbology expertise, a combination of Hermione's book-smarts and Ron's common sense was more than enough to get past the Devils Snare.

What's more, the Potion Puzzle was also specifically designed to separate Harry from his friends:

#+begin_quote
  “Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire --- toward the Stone.”

  Harry looked at the tiny bottle.

  “There's only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That's hardly one swallow.”
#+end_quote

There was only enough potion for Harry to face Voldemort alone. After all, if any of Harry's friends could follow him, then they would have been immediately murdered by Voldemort --- just like Cedric Diggory --- because Voldemort only needed Harry in order to get the Stone from the Mirror. Harry's friends also lacked his blood-love-enchantment, so they would have had no protection against Voldemort, unlike Harry.

Separating Harry from his friends also had another, less obvious side-effect: it gave Voldemort the impression that Harry solved all those challenges /by himself/. Remember, the whole point of this exercise is to manipulate Voldemort into using Harry's blood during the Resurrection Ritual. What better way to convince Voldemort that Harry was a worthy rival then to trick him into thinking that Harry was simultaneously a chess protégé, herbology expert, skilled seeker and clever logician? The tasks were so specific, niche and varied, that I doubt even Tom Riddle could have gotten past them when he was 11 years old, yet Harry seemingly breezed through with little difficulty --- just as Dumbledore had intended.

But there is a problem with this theory --- a rather significant problem, that I'm sure many of you have already noticed; this plan is totally fucking insane.

Dumbledore is risking /the lives of children/. He is putting Harry in a /life threatening situation/. This mad scheme is completely at odds with Dumbledore's motives; he's gambling with the safety of the student he wants to protect. The Dumbledore that hates himself for his role in is sisters death would /never/ send children to fight deadly plants, or deadly trolls, or deadly games of chess --- no matter how prepared they might have been to overcome those individual threats. It simply doesn't make sense.

But wait a minute, did I just call it a "/deadly/ game of chess?" That's not right. That chess set wasn't deadly at all --- it doesn't kill you, it just knocks you unconscious.

I want you to imagine, for a moment, what Quirrell must have been thinking when he played that game of chess. Quirrell would have assumed that if you die in the chess game, then you died in real life. As far as Quirrell knew, that game of chess really /was/ deadly. After all, everything he saw indicated that it was deadly, wizard chess is traditionally violent, and it wouldn't make sense for it /not/ to be deadly.

But despite all of that, Ron didn't die. We know with absolute certainty that the chess game was /not deadly/. We all thought that game was deadly /until we saw it wasn't/.

So ask yourself this, was that Devils Snare really as deadly as it appeared? Would Harry really have died if drunk the wrong potion? Was that security troll really trained to /murder/ /children/? Would Fluffy have really eaten the students who visited the Third Floor Corridor?

Remember, all the teachers at Hogwarts knew about these defenses. Would Minerva McGonagall have ever approved of a killer three headed dog in her school?

What's more likely, that /every single Hogwarts professor is fucking insane/, or that those challenges weren't as deadly as they appeared?

I propose that every challenge that the Golden Trio faced that night was exactly the same as the game of chess --- it /appeared/ deadly, but would have just knocked them unconscious if they failed. Fluffy was trained to attack adults, but to only scare children. The Devils Snare was bewitched to capture students that fell into its grasp, but /not/ to kill them. None of those potions were deadly to people under the age of 18.

And that makes a lot of sense. I'm sure Harry, Ron and Hermione weren't the only ones to meet Fluffy over the course of the year --- there's no way Fred and George didn't investigate the Third Floor Corridor --- yet we never once hear about a student being maimed to death.

It's out of character for the teachers of Hogwarts to be so apathetic towards their students well being. The only way the events of the Philosophers Stone makes sense is if those challenges weren't actually fatal. Since the chess game sets a decisive precedent that the danger was merely superficial, and because we have no evidence to the contrary, I think that is a fair assumption to make.

If all of the Third Floor tasks were only as dangerous as the game of chess, then Dumbledore's plan isn't as absurd as it seemed at first glance. However, there's still the glaring issue of Harry's encounter with Voldemort --- there's no way that /Voldemort/ wasn't deadly. How could Dumbledore have guaranteed Harry's safety?

And that's not the only unanswered question...

#+begin_quote
  “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.”
#+end_quote

Why would Dumbledore /fly/ to the Ministry? Why not just apparate?

#+begin_quote
  Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. “Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
#+end_quote

How did Dumbledore enter the room /after/ Harry had drunk the last of the potion?

#+begin_quote
  He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...
#+end_quote

How did Dumbledore arrive at the /exact second/ that Harry truly needed him? What are the chances of that happening by pure luck?

And the how hell did Quirrel not notice Dumbledore's arrival, when Quirrel /literally/ has eyes in the back of his head?

None of this makes any sense.

Unless...

#+begin_quote
  “I don't need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
#+end_quote

Unless Dumbledore never went to the Ministry. Unless Dumbledore was in the room all along, */just like he was the last time Harry found the Mirror of Erised./*

If Dumbledore really was already in the room, and invisible, then Harry was never in any real danger; Dumbledore could have defeated a wizard of Quirrel's ability in an instant. This way, Dumbledore could orchestrate an encounter between Harry and Voldemort, thus completing the first step of his master plan, while also ensuring that he could intervene as soon as Harry's safety was in jeopardy.

Not only that, but Voldemort needed Harry to get the Stone out of the mirror --- the very test was designed to force Voldemort to interact with Harry before trying to kill him. Everything about the finale of The Philosophers Stone was a charade by Dumbledore, to manipulate Voldemort into taking Harry's blood during the Resurrection Ritual.

The only thing in canon that isn't consistent with this theory is that Hermione remembered seeing Dumbledore rush towards the Third Floor Corridor after she had left to find help. However, there are a dozen canon-complaint ways to explain away that memory.

And there you have it, that's my stupidly long explanation of Dumbledore's seemingly bizarre actions during the Philosophers Stone. It was all part of his master plan to save Harry.

While you might disagree with some of the specifics of this post, I think you can agree that the overall picture is logically consistent and in-line with established canon. Even if we cast away all the speculation and focus purely on the established facts, there is an undeniable chain of cause and effect that begins in the Philosophers Stone and ends with Harry surviving his final encounter with Voldemort:

- *FACT:* *Dumbledore planned Harry's encounter with Voldemort in the Philosophers Stone:*

#+begin_quote
  “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows

  more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we

  were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think

  it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had

  the right to face Voldemort if I could...”
#+end_quote

- *FACT:* *That encounter with Harry was what convinced Voldemort to use Harry's blood in the Resurrection Ritual:*

#+begin_quote
  "His mother died in the attempt to save him -- and unwittingly provided him with a protection I

  admit I had not foreseen... I could not touch the boy.”

  Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek.

  “His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice... This is old magic, I should have

  remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.”

  Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with

  the pain....

  “I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power

  thirteen years ago... for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too..."
#+end_quote

Note: Voldemort only learnt that he could not touch Harry during the encounter in the Philosophers Stone.

- *FACT:* *Dumbledore already knew the significance of Voldemort taking Harry's blood:*

#+begin_quote
  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told

  Dumbledore. “He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was

  right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry /thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's/

  /eyes./
#+end_quote

- *FACT:* *It was this event that lead to Harry's ultimate survival:*

#+begin_quote
  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died

  for me this time -- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in

  his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body

  with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered

  you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

The chain of events that lead to Harry's victory is clear. Dumbledore knew what he was doing.

It is simply not consistent for Dumbledore to work so hard to keep Harry alive while also putting him in genuine life threatening situations at the age of 11. We can ignore these logical inconsistencies, and discard the entirety of the first book as a silly children's story that needn't be taken seriously, but I think it's far more interesting and immersive to find an in-universe logic to explain the plot of the Philosophers Stone.

In conclusion, I don't think Dumbledore was incompetent or insane. Dumbledore wasn't indifferent towards Harry's well being. He had a plan--- a manipulative plan, to be sure--- and his plan /worked./

Harry /survived./

*><><><>Bonus theories!<><><><*

I originally planned to do a detailed analysis of Dumbledore's decisions and accomplishments across every book, but I gave up. Even so, I thought of few fun things about Dumbledore, and rather than try to awkwardly include them in the wall of text above, I thought I'd just dump them here instead. Feel free to ignore all of this junk.

- We never found out if Dumbledore had a back-up plan

Most fanfics assume that if Dumbledore's original plan was the only hope for winning the war. But are we sure about that? Dumbledore might have had a back-up plan --- a plan that would only activate if his original plan failed.

For example, he might have sent a sealed letter to a trusted foreign friend, with the words "Open this letter only if Harry Potter has been killed yet Voldemort still lives," written on the envelope. Inside, the letter would detail everything Dumbledore knew about the Horcruxes and Tom Riddles personal history. I mean, why not? It's a good idea to have a back-up plan, yet no fanfics ever seem to consider that possibility.

- There is a way to apparate inside Hogwarts

Dobby apparates inside the Hospital Wing during Harry's second year:

#+begin_quote
  “Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air.
#+end_quote

So, if you ever need to apparate within Hogwarts, just ask a house elf to help you out. Nobody ever realizes this in canon, and I don't think I've seen anybody take advantage of this loop-hole in fanfiction.

- Dumbledore knew that Voldemort wasn't responsible for the dementor attack during the summer of Harry's fifth year

Lily's blood-love-enchantment should have protected Harry from Voldemort and his minions while Harry was living with the Dursleys. Unfortunately, those dementors could still attack Harry and Dudley, because they weren't working for Voldemort ---they were sent by Umbridge. Umbridge was totally unaffiliated with Voldemort, so the blood-love-enchantment was totally useless in warding off the dementors.

I doubt Dumbledore knew that Umbridge was the one responsible, though he probably became paranoid of a potential third party targeting Harry.

- The Philosophers Stone in the Mirror could have been a fake

Why would Dumbledore keep the real Stone in the mirror? Why not just keep the real Stone in his pocket?

In fact, Dumbledore might have destroyed the Stone at the beginning of the year. I mean, it wouldn't have made a difference to Nicholas, would it? Since the Stone was locked in the castle all year, Nicholas never had access to it. Or perhaps Nicholas did periodically visit the castle to use the Stone, which would be an interesting encounter for a fanfic to explore.

On the other hand, perhaps the Stone was never destroyed. Dumbledore could have lied, and Nicholas might have taken the Stone and gone into hiding.

- Dumbledore probably didn't care if Voldemort got his hands on the prophecy

Before the finale of The Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort had 4 objectives: Kill Harry, kill Dumbledore, seize the Ministry and retrieve the prophecy. Regardless of whether or not Voldemort read the prophecy, his other three objectives would not have changed, and his actions in the following years would have been mostly the same. He was always going to try to kill Harry, and knowing the prophecy wouldn't have changed that.

So, why did Dumbledore try so hard to protect the prophecy? I suspect he just wanted to stall Voldemort, because as long as Voldemort was obsessing over the prophecy he wouldn't be focusing on his other three objectives, and it was /those/ objectives that actually mattered.

Also, it's possible that the prophecy in the Ministry was a fake. While it's true that Dumbledore couldn't have actually removed the prophecy from it's place in the Hall of Prophecies, he could have destroyed it, and then replaced it with fake prophecy of his own design. After all, Harry destroyed thousands of prophecies without suffering any ill effects. It's a bit of a loophole, really --- you can't /remove/ a prophecy, but you can /destroy/ a prophecy. As for what the fake prophecy might say, I'm sure Dumbledore could have thought of something interesting to confound Voldemort. Since we never actually hear the prophecy within the Ministry, this idea is technically canon compliant.

- How Dumbledore found that Horcrux Cave

I was trying to think of a legitimate methodology for finding the cave, and this is the best I could come up with:

1. Compile a complete 1940's muggle road map of Britain
2. Compile a modern muggle geological map of Britain
3. Compile a 1940's muggle private vs public property map of Britain
4. Overlay these three maps
5. Eliminate everything on the map that isn't on the coast, or over 4 hours driving distance from Tom's orphanage, or on private property, or more than a short walking distance from a 1940's road that meets the coastline, and then eliminate everything with an underlining geology that wouldn't allow for cave systems

7. If you don't find the cave, eliminate all searched areas and then tweak the original elimination parameters
8. Go back to step 6.

I think that's a feasible approach, although Dumbledore probably just used some magical bullshit to find it.

Anyway, that's all, folks.

** One factor you're consistently missing is the factor of free choice. Harry chose to go after the Philosopher's Stone when he could have stayed safe in the dorms. Harry chose to go into Chamber of Secrets after Ginny when he could have told a non-Lockhart teacher; he chose to go after Sirius in OotP; he chose to walk into the forest to die in DH when he could have run away (and indeed could have run away throughout DH).

Dumbledore consistently gave Harry the choice, and he consistently gave Harry the knowledge that he would need to succeed were he to choose to involve himself. But he did not raise a child soldier - Harry always had a choice. So there's only a limited amount that Dumbledore could be said to have orchestrated everything. Harry could easily have derailed all of Dumbledore's plans at any time he chose.

The only times Harry does not have the power of choice are those situations which Voldemort, not Dumbledore, had the major hand in orchestrating (such as the Triwizard tournament).

Which was the point. This is what Dumbledore means in OotP when he said he cared for Harry too much. People say Dumbledore's actions in the books represent the "greater good" philosophy, but this is not the case. The "greater good" option was to raise Harry as a child soldier and not give him the choice, but rather to force him into the conflict. This is what Dumbledore means when he said he gave Harry a childhood: what Harry had /was/ an innocent childhood, compared to that of child soldiers.

If you want to criticise Dumbledore's approach to care of children, the real criticism is not that he was heavy handed in placing Harry into dangerous sitautions; rather that he was not heavy handed enough, because he allowed Harry to choose to place himself in dangerous situations when he could have prevented it through more direct interference in Harry's life. However, he can't always keep Harry out of danger, as sometimes Voldemort simply outsmarts him. This, I feel, ultimately vindicates Dumbledore's compromise. He has given Harry the choice to simply bury his head in the sand, but has also provided him with the weapons he needs to survive if he does choose to involve himself. Any more preparation would have been preparing a child soldier, any less and it would have been insufficient to keep Harry alive.

In short, Dumbledore is a libertarian, not a utilitarian. His problem is not being too manipulative, but rather being insufficiently manipulative - it is expected, in modern society, that parents/those with child care responsibility will manipulate children to keep them safe. But the wizarding world has a rather different culture with regards to danger. They don't wrap their kids in cotton wool like modern Western societies do.

Had Dumbledore protected Harry as best he could -- in the sense of keeping him safe, keeping him insulated from all danger -- then likely Harry would have died upon becoming an adult, insufficiently prepared for the most powerful wizard of all time hunting him down. Dumbledore's job isn't just to keep Harry alive until age 17, at which point he can wash his hands of responsibility on the basis that Harry is an adult. Rather, Dumbledore sees his responsibility as giving Harry the best chance of coming out of the coming conflict alive and relatively whole, but without violating his free will.

The other aspect I think you are missing is the fact that people often misdirect a problem with the world onto a problem with Dumbledore. For example, Dumbledore's decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys. Dumbledore tells us in OotP that this was the *only* option where Harry's safety was guaranteed. He was convinced that any other path would have resulted in Harry's death.

Now, Dumbledore knows far more than the reader about the post-1981 political landscape of wizarding Britain; he also knows far more about what is and isn't magically possible. This means that the reader doesn't really have a leg to stand on when they say that Dumbledore should have done X instead of putting Harry with the Dursleys: Dumbledore has already thought of X and ruled it out as too dangerous. And if Dumbledore considers it a politically or magically weak protection, then the reader doesn't have any facts they can use to displace Dumbledore's knowledge.

What the reader *can* say is that they think it is stupid that placing Harry with the Dursleys was the only magically possible effective protection. But that's not a problem with Dumbledore, that's the problem with the magical system. Within the magical system that exists in the HP world, Dumbledore took the right choice so long as you agree that an alive Harry with an unhappy home life is superior to a dead Harry with a happy home life.

*** Great post.

You're absolutely right. Harry chose to go for the Stone on his own accord --- Harry had full autonomy over his decisions, and he has personal responsibility for his actions.

But I think Dumbledore knew Harry would go for the Stone prior to Harry making that decision himself. Dumbledore offered Harry that choice with the prior knowledge of how Harry would act, so Dumbledore incorporated Harry's future decisions into his plans. Dumbledore created the challenges in the Third Floor Corridor under the (correct) assumption that Harry would eventually face them.

Dumbledore never coerced Harry, but he did have sufficient wisdom to predict Harry's choices.

I also agree with this. My rant about the Dursleys was directed at the people who thought Dumbledore didn't care about Harry's suffering. There are many, many people in this fandom who think it was in-character for Dumbledore to willingly leave Harry with abusive guardians, despite there being viable alternatives.

I was doing my best to explain that there weren't any alternatives. Dumbledore was presented with an ultimatum, not a choice.

*** I think everything you said about Harry's choices is true, and the libertarian/utilitarian is novel and insightful, but I would not consider it a serious /omission/ from the original post, especially since it focuses on the first book. (And I can't help but wonder about all the fanfiction where Harry breaks away from Dumbledore & co. only to go seek out training, sometimes from literal soldiers. Still his choice, though. What if he /did/ just ask Dumbledore?)

Dumbledore could have taken the choice from Harry by asking him to save the stone, or threatening him, or even just telling him how bad things will be if Voldemort gets it first. Even without any of that, I still say he orchestrated a remarkable portion of the events of Harry's first year. The above post seems like a good response to that.

After that year I think the orchestration angle loses still more credibility and the argument of your comment holds more weight.

This is a great comparison. A lot of fanfiction invents a great deal of procedure and red tape to be retroactively trampled over by Dumbledore. You'd think the tape is supposed to protect Harry from a killing curse. (I don't think even duct tape is /that/ good.) And I guess Dumbledore already told Harry (and us) the real lesson: sometimes just following the usual approach, the /easy/ way, isn't right.

#+begin_quote
  it gave Voldemort the impression that Harry solved all those challenges by himself
#+end_quote

This is clever. Voldemort couldn't actually say something about it to Harry, because Harry would very probably respond that his friends helped him.

Putting the Doylist hat back on, I can't help but think that response would be expected in a children's book, that it would be arrogant of Harry to let someone think otherwise. By omitting the whole topic Rowling leaves it as a realization to be discovered later. We learn what sort of person Voldemort is, and this is the sort of assumption he'd make without remark.

#+begin_quote
  That encounter with Harry was what convinced Voldemort to use Harry's blood in the Resurrection Ritual
#+end_quote

I hadn't sufficiently absorbed this insight either. I am probably not the only one.

There is a certain set of time-travel stories where Harry deliberately prevents Voldemort from taking his blood, and this puts them in a new light. To the extent those stories don't mean for Harry to die, they either already removed his partial horcrux with the time travel or posit that the horcrux just takes the killing curse instead of Harry (an interpretation not exactly supported by the text, see: your post).

** Part 1/3:

I'm really excited to read this because I don't recognize you're username and it's rare to find someone who defends Dumbledore, and even if we disagree in the end somehow, we are both still clearly passionate about deciphering Dumbledore, and that's amazing in and of itself. I'm writing my comment as I go.

I'm especially curious what your interpretation is because of you singling out Philosopher's Stone, the book I generally consider too poorly written for us to understand on any meaningful level what's even happening.

#+begin_quote
  Before we begin analyzing Dumbledore's actions, we first need to deconstruct his motives.
#+end_quote

Very good chance I'm falling in love with you just for saying that.

#+begin_quote
  Contrary to what Rita Skeeter might say, Dumbledore does not believe in the Greater Good.
#+end_quote

And yep, I just fell in love. While I understand why this is a common belief, I also think that just a little analyzing makes it clear that Dumbledore is, at least, not following the same moral code he had as a teen.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore briefly considers adopting Harry himself.
#+end_quote

Obviously you said to consider this canon-compliant, so on that basis this is possible, but I would be very surprised if Dumbledore considered adopting Harry for more than a moment and I would also be surprised if his reason for not doing so had anything to do with the Ministry. I think he would at all cost want to avoid the thing that ended up happening anyway - caring about Harry. It is not in the world's best interest for Dumbledore to care what happens to Harry, and Dumbledore said he knew he must avoid it. I do like your point that there could be enough Death-Eater presence to prevent a successful adoption and that Dumbledore feared the delay could be fatal for Harry. While I do think the Death Eaters at the Ministry would all shitting their pants and pretending hands down they were Imperiused and the last thing they'd want to do is publicly disagree with Dumbledore, that doesn't mean Dumbledore would know that, and the fear of the Ministry that you've outlined still feels valid to me.

That's a round-about way of saying I agree with your conclusion, sorry about that - I just really really love analyzing Dumbledore.

Love your point on the Longbottoms. Dumbledore does say in OotP that Death Eaters were at large and almost as terrible as Voldemort and for that reason I feel perfectly justified in saying that Dumbledore would have feared Harry's safety at a regular household.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley's love and spoil their existing son, and Dumbledore assumes they will treat Harry the way any decent people would treat their recently orphaned nephew.
#+end_quote

As much as it would make my life easier for this to be true, I have to say I can't consider this valid - Dumbledore says that he knew Harry would have ten dark years ahead of him. I think it's at least plausible that Dumbledore did not forget Petunia's teenage letter and was at least marginally aware that she and Lily had a falling out. However, I do agree with you that Dumbledore really could have had no way to know /how/ bad it would be for Harry. Not sure if you're going towards this thought, but I think Dumbledore should not be criticized for placing Harry /initially/ at the Dursleys as it frankly makes the most sense from any angle. And that anyone interested in criticizing Dumbledore for Harry's upbringing should instead criticize him for /keeping/ Harry at the Dursleys. Criticizing Dumbledore for placing Harry there shows an expectation of a Dumbledore who knows everything and can see into a future, which is expecting far too much perfection, I think.

Maybe you'll mention it later, but in case you don't, I really think a significant reason that Dumbledore keeps Harry at the Dursleys is the fear that he will care about Harry. What does anyone do when they are trying not to care about someone? Don't we all try our best to not think about that person? Don't we find things to distract us so we stop thinking about thm, don't we change our schedules to purposefully avoid them? I can think of several personal examples off the top of my head of friends who avoid their exes they still have feelings for and stuff like that - not going to certain restaurants anymore and that sort of thing. Maybe sometimes we begin to do this without even realizing it? I think this is what Dumbledore began to do. He placed Harry at the Dursleys, and maybe he was getting proper reports from Figg or maybe not, but either way, I think he intentionally (and to his discredit) tried to not think about Harry as a proper human being, because he would begin to care. It's the "trap" he mentions in OotP, and he says he started falling into the trap when Harry /entered/ Hogwarts, so doesn't it then follow that prior to Harry entering Hogwarts, Dumbledore was still successfully /not/ in that trap. It seems pretty clear to me that this means he (on some level intentionally) failed to meet Harry's basic needs.

#+begin_quote
  starting with an investigation of Tom Riddle's past.
#+end_quote

Again something that doesn't really make a difference so it doesn't really matter, but I tend to think that Dumbledore's research began long before Harry was even born, perhaps before Harry's parents were born, and that his research is the thing that prepared him for creating the Order of the Phoenix in the first place. It makes sense to me that Dumbledore, even as of Riddle's interview with Dumbledore for the DADA post, had already begun. But dates are (frustratingly and probably intentionally) vague and figuring out when he started the research doesn't really change much anyway.

#+begin_quote
  So, while Mrs. Figg was aware of the Dursley's dislike of Harry, she never knew the full extent of their neglect.
#+end_quote

I think it's very likely the Dursleys would be mortified with this news getting out and would forbid Harry to mention it. I would find it very strange that Harry would fail to tell any of his teachers or adults he sees at school but would think to tell Mrs. Figg, whom he sees roughly once a year on Dudley's birthday. This alone makes me think Harry doesn't tell /her/ even if he does have a loose tongue elsewhere. But while I'm extremely happy to get into the details of what I think Mrs. Figg knew, I also don't think it matters all that much - Mrs. Figg knew /enough/, and I feel that she's earned the right to be criticized for not doing more, as should Dumbledore (though obviously I think Dumbledore's reasons are a part of his interesting character arc).

#+begin_quote
  Eventually, though it's not clear exactly when, Dumbledore comes to the conclusion that Tom Riddle is using Horcruxes as his form of immortality. It doesn't take him long to figure out that Harry is also a Horcrux.
#+end_quote

Your phrasing suggests a couple things I disagree with. Dumbledore says this in OotP,

#+begin_quote
  "I guessed, fifteen years ago," said Dumbledore, "when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul. [...] You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.”

  [...]

  “What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard [...] it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work [...] But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read [...] he was being remarkably blasé about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. [...] The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. *It suggested that he must have made --- or been planning to make --- more Horcruxes*, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense.

  “Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. ‘Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, *Horcruxes in the plural*, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil' . . .”
#+end_quote

Dumbledore has outlined the timeline of his thought process and says the earliest he considered /multiple/ Horcruxes (as opposed to just one) was when he heard about and saw the diary. And then still two years after that he gets more evidence. I suppose Dumbledore could have considered this sooner, even just as a passing thought, but nevertheless, I think it's possible that if Dumbledore can already recognize a Horcrux then it's likely he does not need to realize there were /many/ before suspecting what Harry is.

#+begin_quote
  STEP 1: Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.

Our interpretations are diverging in a major way right now. Still, I'm excited for any internally consistent theory and am excited to read what you're about to say.

#+begin_quote
  STEP 3: Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.

  STEP 4: Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
#+end_quote

So I don't think Dumbledore planned these, but let's say I did - why would Dumbledore's original plan order it this way? Surely he'd prefer to switch Steps 3 and 4, destroy all the Horcruxes /first/ and then have Voldemort carry out the Resurrection Ritual.

Steps 5-6d I agree with, but I think Dumbledore can only possibly have planned these after the events at the Ministry in OotP. I would love to be convinced that he could have planned these things beforehand, but then this would make almost all of OotP confusing to me.

#+begin_quote
  If we take the events of the first book at face value, nothing makes sense in the larger context of the overall story:
#+end_quote

I /totally agree/, though where you have come up with a way that it the book fits, I personally feel like the book is just not written with quite the skill the later books were, and unfortunately we are left with a confusing book that nobody agrees on, and not much can be helped.

#+begin_quote
  That's an explicit canon conformation that Dumbledore orchestrated the entire event.
#+end_quote

I think we might define the words explicit and canon and confirmation differently. I would say this is an explicit canon confirmation that Harry /believes/ that Dumbledore orchestrated the entire plot. I'm still on the fence about whether he actually /did/, though. Firstly I have no idea /why/ Harry thinks this in the first place, because his conversation with Dumbledore doesn't suggest that at all - in fact, Dumbledore seems to say the /opposite/, like when he says that he turned around from the Ministry when he realized Harry had gone after the stone, and that he was surprised that Harry knew who Flamel was.

I'm not saying that Dumbledore /didn't/ help Harry in that first year, but I am absolutely questioning why Harry /thinks/ he helped. What, in Harry's discovery of the stone, does he think Dumbledore was behind?

#+begin_quote
  The Devils Snare

  It's a good thing Nevile is a Herbology genius and future herbology professor, right?
#+end_quote

How could Dumbledore know that Neville will be good at Herbology? It's not even hinted at until GoF, right?

#+begin_quote
  But there's a problem with this theory --- a rather significant problem, that I'm sure many of you have already noticed; this plan is totally fucking insane.
#+end_quote

Exactly! I haven't read past this part yet, but this is exactly what I'm thinking - if Dumbledore did indeed want Harry to face Voldemort, I just can't imagine that he would resort to the methods he would have had to have used for him to be behind these things. Hiding newspaper clippings under Hagrid's tea cozy on the /off chance/ Hagrid and Ron start talking about something without Harry and Harry's mind wanders? Not to mention the off chance that Ron is even present.

#+begin_quote
  The only way the events of the Philosophers Stone makes sense is if those challenges weren't actually fatal.
#+end_quote

I agree with this statement completely..... but unfortunately the reason I agree is because I don't think the events of the book make sense. While I do like the idea that the tasks would not have harmed underage wizards, I feel it compromises the safety of the stone - Voldemort could manipulate a student to steal the stone for him as he has proven with Hagrid and Quirrell that he is not above using and framing others.

#+begin_quote
  Why would Dumbledore fly to the Ministry? Why not just apparate?
#+end_quote

Apparating is not mentioned at all in the first book. I think it's possible JKR hadn't invented all its rules yet.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore enter the room after Harry had drunk the last of the potion?
#+end_quote

How did Harry drink it after Quirrellmort did? I think the bottles must refill.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore arrive at the exact second that Harry was truly needed him?
#+end_quote

That's fair. But there are so many things that happen at opportune times in all stories and in Harry Potter that I feel singling out this event feels unfair. Though I guess one could say Dumbledore was behind all those other examples too.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Quirrell was writhing in pain because that is what Voldemort was doing at that moment. I don't find it curious that they did not notice Dumbledore arrive.

#+begin_quote
  The only thing in canon that isn't consistent with this theory is that Hermione remembered seeing Dumbledore rush towards the Third Floor Corridor after she had left to find help. However, there are a dozen canon-complaint ways to explain away that memory.
#+end_quote

And what are they?

I feel there're a few more. So far you have only talked about the tasks that lead to the stone and not how Dumbledore influenced Harry's interest in going after the stone in the first place. I'd love to see you go through Harry's life that year plot point by plot point and describe ways that Dumbledore could be behind Harry's increasing/decreasing/increasing interest in the stone. Because honestly, I can sort of see a Dumbledore that wants what you are describing, but I can't see that he actually did those things based on the events of Harry's year. It just doesn't gel with me, and I was really hoping that you would go through Harry overhearing Quirrelmort and overhearing Snape and all that stuff and explain how Dumbledore was somehow behind Snape taking Harry's library book and behind Harry choosing to get it back and behind Harry looking in the teacher's lounge instead of Snape's office and behind the exact point in the conversation Harry overhears between Snape and Filch. I just don't see how Dumbledore is /actually/ behind that sort of stuff, and almost all the knowledge Harry gains throughout the year is him happening down a corridor and happening to overhear stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Even if we cast away all the speculation and focus purely on the established facts, there is an undeniable chain of cause and effect that begins in the Philosophers Stone and ends with Harry surviving his final encounter with Voldemort:
#+end_quote

That only means the plot meets the bare minimum of what plots are meant to do, but that doesn't mean that Dumbledore orchestrated the causes. You can always look /back/ on plots and come up with ways in which it was all planned because /of course/ in hindsight you can track cause and effect, but just because things caused other things to happen does not prove /or/ disprove that those events were orchestrated. I bought a table from someone on Craigslist today because I moved apartments and I moved apartments because I got married, and I got married because I met a guy I fell in love with, but that does not mean the person who owned the table was behind me meeting my husband, even if I can track the cause and effect.

For example, I do agree with you that Voldemort realized Harry was a foe from meeting him at age 11, and I do think that that's why he wanted Harry's blood for his resurrection ritual, and I do think that that led to his own downfall, but just because Voldemort has a progression of knowledge that alters his choices does not mean that I'm convinced that Dumbledore orchestrated those events in his mind.

Everything you have said highlights specifically why I think people's interpretation of the first book greatly influences their entire interpretation of Dumbledore. My problem with that is that there is nothing concrete to work with in the first book, so readers choose a story that feels interesting to them which is great, but then they use that to explain Dumbledore's actions in the rest of the series, often forcing them to come up with convoluted ways to make it fit (like Dumbledore merely pretending to be sad in OotP because they can't possibly see a way that he's human enough to shed tears). While you have put a remarkable and amazing effort into understanding Dumbledore's actions in this book (that I truly love even if I disagree), most fans don't bother (not that they are obligated to). But maybe Harry was wrong. Maybe JKR was a bad writer. Dumbledore says in OotP that he began to fail at his plan after seeing Harry in the hospital wing, and yet none of that explanation shows up in your analysis. The multi-step plan you've highlighted as Dumbledore's original plan never veers off course as Dumbledore later says it had. Do you feel Dumbledore was lying to Harry in OotP as part of his plan? You also don't incorporate Dumbledore's death by the Resurrection Stone - had Dumbledore foreseen that as well? If not, where did Dumbledore see himself in his plan? How much did his own death effect things?

I want to acknowledge the immense effort this took and I'm really thrilled and happy that you care so much about Dumbledore to have written this. I also realized way too late just how different it is to analyze a book in the context of what is possible within canon-compliant fanfiction and to analyze a book as a self-contained literary written work. While there is obviously some overlap, the goals are just different enough that I realize that a lot of my critique of your analysis doesn't really apply to what you were going for. Fanfictions strongest quality is in playing around with ambiguous stuff, and that's as it should be. I'm used to analyzing the books with a slightly different goal, so I apologize for coming off as disagreeing with things that I see now are possibilities in fanfiction /because/ they are ambiguous.

#+end_quote

That's the problem in a nutshell. The canon characters and the canon plot do not go together outside a children's story where no one questions tropes. Trying to reconcile the canon plot with a wise, benevolent and competent Dumbledore simply doesn't work. Too often, Harry suffered or was in danger, endangering Dumbledore's whole supposed plan. Even if he didn't want to care about Harry he would have had to care about the best way to defeat Voldemort, and would have had to take better care of Harry - which would have led to Harry not getting into quite that many adventures and to boring books.

It's a problem I encounter often when writing a benevolent, competent Dumbledore who cares about protecting the innocent and especially Harry Potter: There are fewer moments for Harry to shine since he's actually protected. (Fewer angsty moments too, since he doesn't feel isolated and neglected, but that's a good thing in my opinion.)

The other problem is that a lot of canon is over the top satire. Inept Ministry, evil step-parents, crazy wizards with no idea about muggles - trying to take that seriously leads to stupid excuses that turn Arthur into a wizard who plays the muggle-loving but ignorant fool to reassure Harry... for years, apparently. Instead of admitting that the traps in book 1 are traps for a children's book that clever child heroes can deal with, it's suddenly some master plan to test Harry or give him self-confidence, or to delay Voldemort - even though the traps barely delayed kids and that if Dumbledore had made the traps intentionally easy to overcome, Hagrid would have blabbed about it - to Quirrell, probably.

And in the end, the explanations don't work anyway - even if the< close one plot hole, they open up others, because if characters who were merely acting as plot devices to allow classic children's tales tropes were actually hypercompetent plotters, then a lot of the canon plot would have gone differently.

#+end_quote

This is what I find so confusing too - my issues with some of the theories I've seen is often not that I refuse to believe Dumbledore would manipulate things, but that if he /were/ going to do that, then I think he would have done it a different way. The biggest one off the top of my head is why would a Dumbledore who is preparing Harry for his Voldemort-filled future be so concerned about not letting Harry know? Firstly - eleven-year-old Harry believed he was being helped anyway, secondly, Harry is good at keeping secrets, thirdly, Harry is jumping at any chance to be the hero. He is so obviously willing to be trained and primed and prepared - why would Dumbledore ever feel the need to /pretend otherwise?/

On top of that, Dumbledore himself explains in OotP that he realized in hindsight that Harry was everything I just said above and admits that he had not allowed himself to realize this because it meant he woudl have to burden Harry. As far as I see it, this supports the idea that Dumbledore was /not/ training Harry at least between the end of the first book and the end of the fifth.

I could be wrong, but I'm getting the vibe that you are speaking about the entire series, while I'm speaking specifically about the first book and maybe the second and third. But by the fourth, and especially by the fifth, I think Dumbledore becomes very well written. I would not say that competant/benevolent/wise is the Dumbledore I'm defending, because I think he's very flawed, I just credit those flaws to cowardice and fear rather than to malevolance or lack of concern.

  Again something that doesn't really make a difference so it doesn't really matter, but I tend to think that Dumbledore's research began long before Harry was even born, perhaps before Harry's parents were born, and that his research is the thing that prepared him for creating the Order of the Phoenix in the first place. It makes sense to me that Dumbledore, even as of Riddle's interview with Dumbledore for the DADA post, had already begun. But dates are (frustratingly and probably intentionally) vague and figuring out when he started the research doesn't really change much anyway.
#+end_quote

I agree. In my original outline for this post I hoped to begin with Trelawny's job interview and end with Dumbledore's death. When I narrowed the scope of my post I had to copy and past different stuff around, and it messed with the timeline a little. Dumbledore was definitely investigating Tom Riddle's past prior to the Potter's death, because otherwise he wouldn't have been able to get the memories of Hokey the house-elf, who died sometime in the 1950's.

 

#+begin_quote
  But while I'm extremely happy to get into the details of what I think Mrs. Figg knew, I also don't think it matters all that much - Mrs. Figg knew enough, and I feel that she's earned the right to be criticized for not doing more, as should Dumbledore (though obviously I think Dumbledore's reasons are a part of his interesting character arc).
#+end_quote

I think your analysis of Dumbledore's feelings is far deeper and far more accurate than mine.

However, I don't think we can criticize Dumbledore for leaving Harry with the Dursley's. Nothing in canon suggests that there was a viable alternative that would keep Harry safe. A miserable childhood is better than being murdered.

 

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore has outlined the timeline of his thought process and says the earliest he considered multiple Horcruxes (as opposed to just one) was when he heard about and saw the diary.
#+end_quote

I think Dumbledore actually knew Voldemort had multiple Horcrux's prior to seeing the Diary. Tom Riddle's determination to acquire Helga Hufflepuff's cup wouldn't make sense if he only planned to create a single Horcrux --- Voldemort would /never/ choose a Hufflepuff relic over a Slytherin one --- unless he had already created a Slytherin themed Horcrux.

 

#+begin_quote
  Steps 5-6d I agree with, but I think Dumbledore can only possibly have planned these after the events at the Ministry in OotP. I would love to be convinced that he could have planned these things beforehand, but then this would make almost all of OotP confusing to me.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore felt triumphant after learning that Voldemort used Harry's blood during his resurrection. Triumph requires success, which requires an attempt, with implies a plan.

Goblet of Fire is when Harry and the audience discovers Neville's talent, but it would have been clear to his Professors from the beginning. Harry never did any homework with Neville, and it's out of character for Neville to speak up during class, which is why Harry only learned of Neville's affinity for plants when Neville brought it up himself.

But it doesn't matter if it compromises the challenges, because the challenges are incredibly easy to begin with. I mean, 26 + 74 is a more difficult problem than 10 + 12, but would that difference be enough to stop Voldemort? And is the difference worth risking the lives of children? I don't think so.

Someone else in this thread linked to a [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160404122903/http://hpcompanion.com/ps/psessay/][great essay]] that I wish I'd read prior to making this thread. It goes into detail about some of this stuff.

 

#+begin_quote
  Do you feel Dumbledore was lying to Harry in OotP as part of his plan? You also don't incorporate Dumbledore's death by the Resurrection Stone - had Dumbledore foreseen that as well? If not, where did Dumbledore see himself in his plan? How much did his own death effect things?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore's /ideal/ plan might have looked something like this:

- *STEP 1:* Destroy the Philosopher's Stone, so Voldemort is forced to use the Resurrection Ritual to regain his former power.
- *STEP 2:* Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
- *STEP 3:* Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
- *STEP 4:* Protect Harry, and help him grow into a good and competent adult.
- *STEP 5 (a):* Lie to Harry, and tell him he needs to be killed by Voldemort to destroy the Horcrux within his scar.
- *STEP 5 (b):* Harry willingly sacrifices himself to Voldemort.
- *STEP 5 (c):* Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.
- *STEP 5 (d):* Voldemort "kills" Harry.
- *STEP 5 (e):* The Horcux is destroyed by Voldemort, and Harry is protected from death by Lily's blood-love-enchantment, because Lily's blood is still flowing in the veins of Voldemort's resurrected body.
- *STEP 5 (f):* Because Harry believed he was going to die, and he willingly sacrificed himself to protect the people he loves, a /new/ blood-love-enchantment is created.
- *STEP 5 (g):* There are now two different sets of blood-love-enchantments, one that protects Harry, and one that protects everybody Harry sacrificed himself to save.

In this best case scenario, Dumbledore would have destroyed all the hidden Horcrux's prior to the ritual. Voldemort also would never kidnap Harry for the ritual --- Harry would give himself willingly to Voldemort, and so Voldemort would be both resurrected and fucked at the same time.

The plan we see in canon had been alternated to account for Voldemort's actions and Dumbledore's mistakes, but the major beats remained the same.

 

#+begin_quote
  Apparating is not mentioned at all in the first book. I think it's possible JKR hadn't invented all its rules yet.

You're right. Floo Powder also didn't enter canon until later books. The real reason Dumbledore flew to the Ministry was because JKR hadn't yet conceived of other means of magical transport.

However, please indulge a thought experiment of mine: imagine that you (the person reading this) find a [[https://imgur.com/kMxt8QY][magical portal]] (bare with me) that transports you to the Potter universe.

Wow! You're in the Potter universe! There's Hogwarts! There's the Womping Willow! And holy shit, that's /Dumbledore/! This is so cool!

Naturally, the first thing you do is /demand/ that Dumbledore tell you why he flew to the Ministry in 1991.

So, how does Dumbledore respond? We can speculate, theorize and guess at what his answer might be, but whatever it is, it'll be something that makes sense /within his universe/. He won't blame JK Rowling, because she /doesn't exist/ in his universe.

It's those sort of questions that fanfiction can answer; we can create in-universe explanations for the meta-driven inconsistencies. That's what I've tried to do in this thread, and, like you said, you're approaching this from a different perspective. I think a lot of our disagreements come from the fact that you're willing to accept the plot holes for what they really are, but I'm still in denial.

But anyway, great posts. Sorry I didn't reply to every point you brought up. Your analysis of Dumbledore's feelings towards Harry was particularly interesting.

I with you there, but I should clarify that I mean criticism in the literary sense - so it's not so much about what the reader concludes, but about the questions they're asking (and how they are asking them), which is really important in understanding Dumbledore's characterization. Being critical of him for Harry's upbringing is a start. It's a bit like the idea of "it's our choices that show us who we are". I don't think that means that our choices reveal if we are good or bad - that's far too black and white and I personally feel this series goes farther than that. I think it means that our choices reveal the very complex people we are and often betray our priorities to ourselves and to others - though I don't mean betray as necessarily a bad thing. Snape, so determined to be a Death Eater, was betrayed by his love of Lily and could never be a proper Death Eater again, and Dumbledore understood that and trusted Snape's deepest priority to defeat Voldemort because of that, despite how nasty Snape was, that foundational trust existed. Dumbledore reaching for the Resurrection Stone betrayed his commitment to understanding and respecting death and revealed how much the destruction of his family still affected him. Being critical to me is the process of dissecting and asking questions. Only that way can someone contextualize Dumbledore's choices and really understand why he made certain choices and what those choices show about him.

#+end_quote

I do think Dumbledore had a plan, I just think it was a different one than you suggest, and I think he was failing at it, both from his own faults and also due to things outside of his control. This partly ties into the things in OotP I was referring to, so I'll answer that with this. I think Dumbledore's original plan had to have been pretty bad news for Harry, because Dumbledore himself implies that failing at his plan allowed Harry to have a normal childhood, meaning both that he definitely had a plan and also that succeeding at this plan would have (potentially) not allowed Harry to have a normal happy childhood. Dumbledore even goes so far as to admit that prioritizing Harry's happiness risked the lives of many and that Dumbledore "never believed he would have such a person on his hands".

Okay, so I can kind of tell I'm getting into my loooooong answer, so I'll link to [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/][this]] post which covers pretty much everything I think. But the short answer is that I think he knew Harry had to die if they had a hope of killing Voldemort. This is pretty bad, but in the meantime Voldemort aint back, so Dumbledore kind put it to the back of his mind. This is both good and bad - it's good in the context of what it tells us about Dumbledore's humanity - he does not /like/ the idea of hurting Harry. But it's bad because Dumbledore was not prepared for Voldemort's return - he had not yet told Harry about the prophecy and he was not ready to toss Harry into this world of Voldemort and burdens and all that awful stuff. Dumbledore freaked the fuck out because he had fallen into that trap of caring about Harry. The result is Dumbledore did not treat Harry like a cog in the machine nor did he treat him like a competant human and partner-in-crime, instead Dumbledore chose to coddle and hide information from Harry, which made sense to him at the time because Dumbledore believed himself to be allowing Harry's happy childhood to continue. In hindsight the problem was both that lying to Harry is never a good idea and also that Voldemort managed to infiltrate Harry's mind anyway and because Harry wasn't informed that this could happen, he did not realize it was a trick.

I think Dumbledore's actions in OotP are him reacting to Voldemort's surprise return. I also think that the events at the Ministry are the very things that lead to Dumbledore's new plan. One reason being that Dumbledore learns that Harry's mind is protected from Voldemort. I feel this is often overlooked when analyzing Dumbledore's planning timeline despite the problems and resolution of this issue being well outlined and explained in the fifth book. Dumbledore was terrified that Voldemort would use Harry's mind. This is even a legitimate reason that Dumbledore avoided Harry that year because every time they were near each other, Harry felt Voldemort rise inside of him, even Dumbledore says he could see it happening in Harry's eyes. Dumbledore guessed (correctly) that if that feeling was prominent enough Voldemort would feel it too and realize he had access to Harry's mind. Of course Voldemort realized this anyway when he felt Harry's presence while attacking Mr. Weasley, and so Dumbledore thought that Occlumency would do it. Dumbledore could not have known there was another option, because he does not fully understand the connection, in OotP we witness him trying to figure out what it really means through the "in essence divided" question he asked one of his magical instruments, and he also admits to Harry at the end of the book that he knew it was a connection to Voldemort, but he did not know exactly what it could do yet. But at the Ministry Dumbledore witnesses Voldemort possess Harry and /within seconds/ witnesses Voldemort flee Harry's mind because of the pain. Dumbledore now knows that Harry's mind is safe from Voldemort's attacks now, which is not something Dumbledore could have planned or had any control over, and I think was just as surprised as Voldemort was.

#+begin_quote
  "That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.”
#+end_quote

I think this revolutionized Dumbledore's plan - Harry's mind was now a safe place to put information. Beforehand, if Dumbledore had told Harry about Horcruxes, maybe Voldemort would see that in Harry's mind and know what they were after! But now Harry's mind is safe. Dumbledore has also simultaneously realized that he should not be coddling Harry, and has finally accepted that it's time to train and teach Harry, and these two things are why Dumbledore 180s from OotP to HBP - not to mention that his own death speeds things up. I agree with you that Dumbledore most likely originally intended to destroy the Horcruxes himself, but his own impending death prevents that from being a possibility.

** It seems like the professors set their "challenges" guarding the stone during the summer. The forbidden corridor is mentioned at the welcome feast. This brought the entire school's attention to the area, which would make it very difficult to add tasks last minute.

So how did Dumbledore manipulate the professors into setting these tasks that he personally customized for Harry and company's strengths, if he really didn't even know them yet?

At the latest, the protections after Fluffy could have been set within the first month or so. By the second month of school, Halloween, Quirrel has the (obvious break-in attempt) troll incident and it can be assumed that Dumbledore would make sure everything was at maximum security immediately.

We know for certain that the Mirror was added after Christmas, so the Third Floor Corridor was indeed undergoing changes and revisions as the year wore on.

And we don't know to what extent the professors were responsible for their respective tasks. Dumbledore could have come up with the idea of each task, and then the professors had to find a way to implement that idea.

If we were to believe that Dumbledore had no involvement in forming each task, then we also have to believe that it was just a coincidence that each task synced perfectly with the unique talents of Harry and his friends. That coincidence might be acceptable from a meta perspective, but it is unfathomably improbable when viewed from strictly within the Potter universe, and it is that unacceptable improbability lead me to find an immersive explanation.

****** The Headmaster of Hogwarts isn't obligated to give an 11 year old the whole and complete truth.

I don't know either way, and I don't think there is any proof in the text, but it seems possible for Dumbledore to move the mirror from the 3rd floor to an out of the way classroom on Christmas day and only keep it there for 3 nights. He gave Harry the cloak for Christmas so Harry can visit it, and I'm sure the unsigned note had a mild compulsion to lead Harry to the unused classroom. I say mild because it didn't interfere with his behavior while he had a goal (reading about Flamel in the Restricted Section) but as soon as he stopped thinking about where he was going, he ended up exactly where Dumbledore wanted him.

Harry then comes back the next night with Ron and Dumbledore is in the room with them, invisible. The night after that, D tells Harry >“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know --- ?” “I don't need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.

And he ends the lesson saying "the Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared."

  Why would Dumbledore fly to the Ministry? Why not just apparate?

Flame Freezing Charm from the Elder Wand would probably accomplish the same result quite well, I'd imagine, but as a kid, I always assumed that the inanimate obstacles would reset and the potions would refill themselves, considering Voldemort and Quirrell got through before Harry and company, and they still had to do most of the obstacles too..

#+end_quote

Considering Dumbledore does almost exactly this in Harry's fifth year at the battle at the Ministry, I think that can just be boiled down to Dumbledore responding to danger to his students in an appropriately quick and urgent manner.

I agree that later on in the story, Dumbledore did manipulate Harry with the intent for Harry to survive, the evidence is there, plainly; but I do not agree with the notion that Dumbledore was all-knowing from the beginning and manipulated events to get 11 year old Harry alone in a room with Lord Voldemort. He holds two important positions in the Wizarding world, in addition to his duties as a headmaster of a school. It doesn't make him senile or incompetent if he makes mistakes, it only makes him human.

** Fantastic stuff. My two cents on an easier way to find the cave:

Step 1: Find one of Riddle's still living muggle contemporaries from his orphanage days (shouldn't be too difficult through government orphanage/adoption records)

Step 2: Ask (or coerce/confund/imperius as needed) which beach the orphanage children used to go on holiday to

Step 3: Obliviate them so they forget the encounter

Then, obviously, visit the beach and search for a cave, the nearest one is probably it

** Let me start this by saying that I absolutely loved your analysis. I started reading fanfiction after all the books came out, and when I first read some of the evil Dumbledore fanfics I was astounded by how easy it was to twist Dumbledore's motives. I'll be honest, I enjoyed the trope a little bit but I realized that the basis of most of those fanfics was not an accurate analysis of Dumbledore's methods, but simply taking advantage of plot holes left by Rowling (for example the Potter's Fidelius Charm). I would however like to point out two things about Steps 1 and 2.

1) Dumbledore did not need to convince Voldemort that Harry was his main enemy. Dumbledore explains to Harry that whether he believes in the prophecy or not, Voldemort certainly does. He had already "marked Harry as an equal". And knowing Voldemort, being defeated by a baby would not sit well with him and he would try to right that wrong regardless. HOWEVER, he definitely tries to convince Voldemort that Harry has certain powers to defeat Voldemort by protecting the prophecy, leading Voldemort to constantly doubt his ability to kill Harry.

2) While it would make sense for Dumbledore to destroy the Philosopher's Stone for the sole purpose of pushing Voldemort towards the ritual of resurrection, I do not believe he would want his friend Flamel to die. This is where things get a little murky - if Dumbledore is willing to let Flamel die, just so that Harry MIGHT have a chance to survive based on a lot of guesswork, is that not evidence of him making a sacrifice for "The Greater Good"? I understand that destroying the Stone does not mean instant death for the Flamels, but the ultimate consequence is that the Flamels would eventually perish. I personally believe that he never destroyed the Stone. He just manipulated Voldemort into thinking that using Harry's blood to resurrect himself was his best option. (Which makes him even more of a genius.)

** Any time I see a Dumbledore bashing (which is about every day) I was tempted to write up something similar, but I think you did a much better job than I could have done. Thank you! So much!

Dumbledore is such a wonderfully complex and multifaceted character. So many writers have a tendency to reduce him to this one-dimensional caricature of a villain, it's almost criminal. Of course there are multiple instances were I question his modus operandi (leaving cryptic instruction via testament instead of straight out telling them what he knew and handing over the sword when he knew that he was going to die; not providing Harry with a base of operations for the horxcrux hunt; etc.) but this Greater-Good-Persona is a really cheap way to create an antagonist.

(It's much better than assuming that canon is literally true in the most obvious way and then extrapolating out to all the characters being stupid, which is what bashers tend to do.)

** Late to the party but I'd like to take a stab at this. I like both good and dark Dumbledores. I think there is good material for either one to be honest. Dumbledore's character has enough support to be written however you want for the most part.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore is not evil, or insane, or incompetent, . . . I fear that most Dumbledore bashing is sincere, and it stems from a misunderstanding of Dumbledore's actions throughout the series
#+end_quote

Evil: Dumbledore isn't evil yea, but it isn't exactly a huge leap to believe he is when taken as a whole because his actions are pretty dark. Dumbledore is extremely manipulative and more or less killed the Flamels. The Fidelius is at the moment a known unbreakable charm. The only reason the Potters died to Voldemort was because they trusted the wrong secret keeper. Flamels likely could have just as easily placed the stone in a location under Fidelius and continued living. That could be a way to view Dumbledore as being evil and isn't exactly against canon.

Insanity: Agreed, not sure how this one came about for more serious stories.

Incompetent: Honestly, canon Dumbledore can definitely been seen as extremely incompetent. And the reason for this really is because the books went from children stories to YA stories. First book: Potters die, Dumbledore sends ONLY Hagrid to go pick up Harry. Hagrid who has no magic and unknown if DEs were lurking around. Potters die Oct. 31st, and arrives Nov 1st late night to Private Drive before being found Nov 2nd morning by Petunia. What happened between Oct 31st and Nov 1st. Harry wasn't seen examined? If examined, could he seriously not recognize what was in the scar, despite recognizing the ring in the latter books? It might be explainable, but it could also be incompetence. There are more examples, but that's just within the first section of the first book. So it isn't a huge stretch to portray Dumbledore as incompetent. There's also the whole Hagrid introducing Harry to wizarding world with zero information, having a spy in Riddle's midst, who is a freaking potion's master, and not having Riddle drugged with Draught of the Living Dead, basiliks not being known about etc etc.

Believing it to be a misunderstanding of Dumbledore's action just tends to mean you read his actions a specific way, but some other reader has read his actions a different way. Of course this breaks down in the 7th book, but if it's an AU story post 6th year, it could honestly still be a evil Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Contrary to what Rita Skeeter might say, Dumbledore does not believe in the Greater Good.
#+end_quote

Possible he doesn't believe in the "Greater Good", but there is no doubt he believes in the greater good, lower cases.

#+begin_quote
  Taking that into consideration, Dumbledore does the only thing he can, and sends Harry to live with his muggle relatives.
#+end_quote

This decision makes sense. Sirius was the godfather and believed to have betrayed the Potter's, no trial notwithstanding. The protection that went around Private Drive was supposed to be near impossible to breach by DE's. The issue is, post-GOF. How exactly can Dumbledore be justified in sending Harry back AFTER Riddle has Harry's blood flowing through his vein. There is a safe house, under Fidelius, with himself as secret keeper.

#+begin_quote
  It is an established fact that conventional magical defenses aren't enough to protect Harry's guardians from You-Know-Who
#+end_quote

Define conventional magical defenses. I keep repeating it, but Fidelius 100% would have been complete protection from Riddle if Dumbledore decided to make himself secret keeper.

#+begin_quote
  The blood-love-enchantment is the only thing known to work --- even the Fidelius charm failed to stop Voldemort in the past. It really is a choice between the Dursley's or death.
#+end_quote

The Fidelius did not fail to stop Riddle. Peter Pettigrew failed to stop Riddlet. Don't mix this up. It isn't a choice between Dursley's or death. While the decision to send him to the Dursley's makes sense, it doesn't mean there weren't other options.

#+begin_quote
  Based on this information, Dumbledore forms his master plan to defeat Voldemort and save Harry:
#+end_quote

Yea the master plan is great and all, but is extremely dark. There was no possible way Dumbledore knew without a doubt that Harry would survive Riddle "killing" Harry. Dumbledore was more than willing to have Harry die so that Riddle could be stopped and honestly went about it in a convoluted way. Seriously no chance of drugging Riddle when your spy in the enemies midst is a potion's master?

#+begin_quote
  He can't win. He can't kill Harry, because Lily's blood (within Voldemort) keeps him alive
#+end_quote

What? Riddle could have straight up cut Harry's throat, decapitate etc. Magic that would kill Harry, works against Harry, EXCEPT the AK. Riddle casts magic that was definitely harming Harry before that moment and clearly could cast other magic to have killed Harry. Harry wasn't invincible from being killed by Riddle, just invincible from being AK'd by Riddle. It is hinted that AK is soul magic because of the fact the AK tried to take Harry's soul but instead took the Horcrux, Dumbledore gambled and happened to win.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore gave Harry his Invisibility Cloak on Christmas because he knew Harry couldn't resist exploring the castle (which meant Harry would discover the Mirror and learn how it worked)

#+begin_quote
  That chess set wasn't deadly at all --- it doesn't kill you, it just knocks you unconscious . . . We know with absolute certainty that the chess game was not deadly
#+end_quote

There is no canon support that it wasn't a deadly chess set. We do *not* know with absolute certainty that the chess game was not deadly. It could have been luck. If there is a plausible other explanation, it is not with absolute certainty. Agreed about Fluffy and Devils Snare. Troll, no way he could have predicted that. A troll could have gotten a lucky swing in and killed any one of them. The fact is the Troll and Chess Set were deadly.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Support? The teacher's might know who is involved in the defense, but I don't remember any indication that they knew what those defenses involved. Quirrell knew how to get past Fluffy at the very latest, around Easter Holidays and before the forest detention. If he knew about all the defenses, the only defense that should have stopped him is the mirror. With at least 2 months before the crew went down to stop Riddle, are we really going to say Riddle is so dumb he couldn't figure out what the mirror was for 2 whole months? And yes, Riddle clearly did not know what the mirror was as indicated by the scene between Riddle and Harry

What? There is evidence to the contrary and it does not set a decisive precedent that the danger was merely superficial. Wizards chess is damaging to the pieces. We know this. There is no evidence that it was spelled/enchanted to work different from a normal, giant, wizards chess game. You would have to add assumptions to believe it wasn't dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore arrive at the exact second that Harry truly needed him?
#+end_quote

It could have just been timing. Dumbledore awhile ago, and possible /flooed/ off to the Ministry. Remember, Harry doesn't know about the floo system and if I remember right, floo sounds like flew.

#+begin_quote
  "No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you -- " PS excerpt
#+end_quote

Dumbledore doesn't always tell people everything. If he was lying here than either he was in the room or he had gone to the ministry and finished up and came back.

#+begin_quote
  If Dumbledore really was already in the room, and invisible, then Harry was never in any real danger
#+end_quote

This is never definitive. All it takes is one lucky spell. To be honest I think it was a two fold plan. One to force the encounter, and two to test Harry's morals (if he could get the stone).

#+begin_quote
  In conclusion, I don't think Dumbledore was incompetent or insane. Dumbledore wasn't indifferent towards Harry's well being. He had a plan--- a manipulative plan, to be sure--- and his plan worked.
#+end_quote

That's fair. But there is evidence that Dumbledore was in/competent and his actions could be taken as dark. When an action tends to be dark, it isn't a huge leap to evil despite there being a difference. If all of Dumbledore's incompetence is just being seen as manipulative then yea he isn't incompetent, but it could honestly go either way for a lot of his actions.

100% false. It worked in the graveyard. The time it didn't work was after Harry took the AK, and it still tossed Harry's body because of the force of the spell. Riddle still used other magics in the duel against Harry in the final battle. Riddle could use any indirect spell against him and it would work.

Again, we don't know how pieces get destroyed. It doesn't have to be complete annihilation and still could have been deadly. I'm not saying it's an awful assumption, just don't present it as concrete canon proof when it requires outside non-canon assumptions.

What? Absence of death doesn't go one way or the other towards if the tasks are deadly/fatal or not. It does not make MORE sense to assume they aren't fatal. We know there is poison, a troll, a three headed dog etc. All those are deadly tasks on the face of and just because no one dies doesn't mean it isn't fatal. It makes MORE sense to assume they were fatal than not. Assuming they aren't fatal requires other assumptions that have no canon hard evidence to support. Whereas assuming they are fatal requires nothing other than a reading of canon.

I edited it in and it might have been while you were replying, but the crucio during the final battle didn't hurt him because he was master of the Elder Wand. It was cast on his "dead body". Dumbledore got extremely lucky. Harry would have died if it wasn't for the Elder Wand. And the killing curse would effect Harry because he technically had 2 souls inside him. The AK only needs to take one, which it did, hence "invincible" to Riddle's AK.

#+end_quote

Fair, it's been a long time since I've read it, but do we know 100% for sure what pieces he took over? I do remember them being missing pieces so probably because of the movie I just filled it in as knight. But I don't remember it saying how they took over the piece. It could have just been they were riding the broken pieces as play.

Besides the tasks can be deadly and not fatal. Proof that the other tasks were deadly is in the actual tasks themselves for the most part. It would require proof that they aren't deadly, OTHER THAN no death, to actually say the tasks were not deadly/fatal.

If i start listing deadly tasks, without other information, it is impossible to say they aren't deadly, just because no one has died in a extremely small sample size. It's taking in other assumptions that isn't supported by canon that allows you to make that assumption.

Yes we know Dumbledore doesn't want them to die, but we do know his end goal was to set up Harry to face Riddle under controlled circumstances. We know he is extremely manipulative, and tbh, willing to sacrifice pieces for the final win. The tasks might be safer then normal, but it doesn't mean they aren't deadly. All it takes is one wrong misstep and it could have killed any of them.

If it is so EASY to foist the child of on his muggle relatives (who hate magic - which Dumbledore knows ("...ten dark and difficult years...")) then it should be a hell of a lot easier to stuff him with some minions of his under a fidelius! Let them educate him, brainwash him with Dumbledore's ideas and ideology etc. you don't have to show him Diagon Alley or have him visit the ministry! Voldemort will be just as stumped if he can't find the child because of a fidelius (if Dumbledore makes sure that the secret keeper is genuine - Veritaserum would do wounders here, as would Legilimency!), not to mention that the love-protection only works against Voldemort and only once! The second time the killing curse hit Harry he did die after all, so a fidelius is probably the better option!

** The problem with this explanation is: If Dumbledore could pull off such a complicated plan, against all odds, and with such a narrow margin of failure, then why the hell was he such a useless idiot most of the time? A man able to outthink and outplay Voldemort to that degree, stymied by Fudge, Umbridge and the Malfoys? Unable to prove Sirius's innocence? Unable to keep control of the Wizengamot? Unable to protect children? Further, how could he arrange Harry's kidnapping, yet not save Cedric? Or stop Malfoy's murder attempts? If he's unwilling to sacrifice Harry to win the war, why the hell isn't he willing to save the other kids?

No, the best explanation for Dumbledore's manipulation is and remains: JKR wrote a children's book, and used the classic "useless adults" tropes, then, later tried, to make it all make sense for a YA novel. And failed.

*** Unfortunately people are downvoting you because they disagree with you, I think.

I wouldn't say it failed to make sense, as there are people here who like the later novels and Dumbledores role in them. We are also used to have this kind of level of suspension of disbelief in what is possible to plan in works of fiction and can overlook them up to a (subjective) point. This point is different for everyone, so some may be okay with it and some may not. It is obviously easier to write books for the former group.

Btw. I liked your fiction "Divided and Entwined", and something like this would be the strategy that would be far more likely to work in real life. Dumbledores plan in the original works is far too complicated to work outside of fiction as too much can go wrong (Like the crippling you mentioned. A bit of crucio and he is a vegetable. Good job), except if he were a perfect precog.

Dumbledore was never outsmarted by Fudge. He wanted Umbridge to kick him out of Hogwarts so that he could focus on the Horcrux hunt without being bogged down with his responsibilities as Headmaster.

The status quo of the fifth book is actually strategically beneficial for Dumbledore --- it delayed Voldemort from reaching his win-conditions, and it gave Dumbledore time and opportunity to pursue his own win-condition. I'll add another bonus theory to my original post if you want more details.

Sorry, I didn't mean to say that the Umbridge being at Hogwarts was beneficial. 1995 was a bad year for Harry, and everything he had to deal with was bullshit.

What I meant was that the cold war of 1995 helped Dumbledore more than it helped Voldemort. Voldemort was afraid of making any big moves without knowing what the prophecy had to say. This meant that during 1995, Voldemort wasn't pursuing his win conditions to the full extent of his abilities --- he wasn't trying to assassinate Dumbledore, he wasn't killing, bewitching and threatening Ministry officials, and he couldn't even try to kill Harry because he needed Harry to get the prophecy.

On the other hand, Dumbledore could focus almost entirely on hunting Horcrux's. The Ministry seizing Hogwarts didn't delay or impede the Horcrux hunt.

If the war between Dumbledore and Voldemort was a race, then during 1995 Voldemort was taking small, timid steps, and Dumbledore was taking long and confident strides.

Even as Headmaster, Dumbledore was rarely at Hogwarts throughout 1996. Harry often comments on Dumbledore's long absence from school. Of course, Dumbledore had to return to Hogwarts occasionally, like to teach Harry about the Horcrux's, or to see Slughorn's memory.

***** Also, to be perfectly honest, you're totally right. I did make Dumbledore too competent in my original wall of text, and that hyper-competence isn't consistent with the mistakes he made later in the series.

But there is a way to salvage this theory, if we assume that the plan Dumbledore executed in canon wasn't what he initially had in mind. Please see [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8tiblb/exploring_dumbledores_manipulative_master_plan/e19besz/][this post]]. Dumbledore /did/ make mistakes, and Voldemort did outsmart him at times; the plan listed in my original post had been edited and altered in response to those events.

Dumbledore isn't as godly as I initially made him out to be, and the only reason he succeeded was because he changed and compromised his ideal plan to account for events as they unfolded. Dumbledore was flawed --- he couldn't have protected everyone --- but he adapted and improvised to overcome.

I think you need not just look at what Dumbledore had done and try to find explanations for it, but at what Dumbledore should have done, if your explanations were true, at each important step. And that is where the whole theory of a master plan gets derailed, because Dumbledore simply made too many obvious mistakes without ever learning from them.

Dumbledore /did/ guard Harry better. He sent Harry to the Order of the Phoenix headquarters as soon as he realized there was a third party who could circumvent the Lily's enchantment. From the dementor attack onward, Harry only got into life threatening situations by running to them himself (like in the Hall of Prophecy), or when Dumbledore was there to personally protect him (like with the Horcrux cave), or after Dumbledore's death.

That's is a very fun idea. Most people bash Dumbledore because they think he believes in the Greater Good, but you're criticizing him for /not/ believing in the Greater Good. It's an interesting switcheroo.

I think a lot of this boils down to our individual perspectives. Brace yourself for an incoming Star Trek reference.

Some people are like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADEDLoLY3AY][Picard]], and they believe that the path to victory is equally important as the victory itself. On the other hand, there are people are like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StF9jrhw-pU][Garak]], who believe that the ends justify the means. Garak and Picard are both super cool, even though their personal philosophies are total opposites.

Dumbledore is an odd case, because I think he's torn between those radically different philosophies. Logically, Dumbledore agrees with Garak's mindset --- he can rationalize committing small acts of evil in order to prevent a greater tragedy --- but emotionally, he feels more closely aligned with Picard --- Dumbledore is very empathetic, and he's consumed by guilt for his sisters death.

I highly recommend you check out [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8tiblb/exploring_dumbledores_manipulative_master_plan/e18zfvs/][these posts]] by [[/u/bisonburgers]]. I think she has a far better understanding of Dumbledore's motives than I did when I created this thread.

Dumbledore is indecisive and contradictory throughout the books because his logic and emotions are at odds with each other. This dichotomy is why Dumbledore fucks up. For example, Dumbledore knows that it's strategically beneficial to treat Harry like a child soldier, but emotionally Dumbledore is compelled to let Harry enjoy his school life without the knowledge of the prophecy hanging over his head. It's this sort of compromise that leads to most of Dumbledore's mistakes.

Also, I think it's worth pointing out that having empathy wasn't Dumbledore's weakness; Dumbledore's weakness was that he struggled to reconcile his empathy with his intelligence. If Dumbledore was more like Picard --- if he rejected the Greater Good based on logical and intellectual grounds --- then perhaps he would have been more effective than he was in canon.

If Picard was in Dumbledore's position, he would have invested far more time trying to redeem wizarding society on a fundamental level. Picard would have created a system in which the Blood Purist ideology could not thrive. However, Dumbledore did not value bureaucracy, truth, ethics, rule-of-law or diplomacy in the way that Picard does, and so he never focused on fixing the institutionalized corruption and bigoted culture that allowed Voldemort to rise to power so easily.

On the other hand, if Garak was in Dumbledore's position, then Voldemort probably would have been defeated far sooner. However, in the process of doing so, Garak would have tortured, murdered, and ultimately utilized the very same tactics that made Voldemort so abhorrent. Garak's methods would not create a stable foundation for a new world --- he would have violated all the lofty ideals on which one could base a better society --- and stability would only ever be found through continued violence. If you just assassinate every suspected Death Eater then you've legitimized murder and laid the seeds for future revenge. What then? Do you preemptively kill the Death Eater's children? Or do you just naively hope that your enemies offspring will behave more honorably than /you/ did? There are long term consequences to abandoning due process and empathy. A world populated by the likes of Garak would not be a world worth fighting for.

In the end, I think Dumbledore found a way to square his utilitarian perspective with his conscience. Dumbledore's final plan turned love itself into a weapon. Dumbledore was part-Garak and part-Picard, and when those parts were at odds Dumbledore made mistakes. But when push came to shove, Dumbledore created a plan that both treated Harry as a sacrificial pawn /and/ as a precious person that needed to be protected. Dumbledore managed to defeat Voldemort /and/ save Harry. Dumbledore's greatest triumph and final victory occurred only when both his Garak-side and Picard-side were working in unison.

******** I think anyone risking innocents in order to protect the guilty is failing the basic morality check. This isn't about "the end justifies the means" or "the greater good", it's a basic, fundamental moral matter: If the only way to protect an innocent, especially a child, is to kill an aggressor, then that's the only moral choice. Whether you believe in the ends justify the means or not - risking children when you could save and protect them is wrong anyway.

We're not talking about Garak here, or any other strawman, we're not even talking about a suspected Death Eater here. We're talking about Malfoy who has been revealed without a doubt as the mastermind behind a plot to mass-murder children.

********* I disagree.

If Lucius had a gun pointed at a student's head, and he was about to pull the trigger, then using deadly force would indeed be ethically justified. However, unless there is an /imminent/ threat of violence, it is ethical to pursue other means of resolving conflict. That was Dumbledore's problem --- he didn't try anything, nor did he try to foster an environment in which other nonviolent options were viable.

It's very easy for you to present an ultimatum between dead Death Eaters or dead children, but that false dichotomy only has credibility under the threat of immediate and unavoidable violence, /or/ within such an unjust system that the threat of future violence is met with silence. In such a system, the ethical thing to do to is to change the system. To pursue private violence, in lieu of systematic change, is a surrender to the existing institutionalized injustices. To murder Lucius in 1992, in fear of an unspoken future threat, would be an implicit acknowledgement of the status quo as being either acceptable or unchangeable. Dumbledore did have opportunities to potentially instigate systematic changes, which could have then offered alternative resolutions, but he did not pursue those possibilities.

Dumbledore didn't take the position of Minister, even when it was offered to him, yet that would have allowed him to tackle the corruption within the Ministry. Despite being Headmaster, Dumbledore allowed a culture of bigotry within Hogwarts. Dumbledore didn't publicly accuse Lucius of orchestrating the opening of the Chamber of Secrets. Even if Dumbledore lacked concrete proof, he should have voiced the truth anyway, because the truth has inherent value beyond its strategically exploitable utility.

Dumbledore was not a man of diplomacy or honesty; Dumbledore preferred secrets and violence --- just like what you're advocating for now. From within the framework of your perspective, it might indeed seem like Dumbledore was immoral for not fully embracing violence, but that's only because your philosophy is too narrow --- it's insulated from the wider context, and from the wider responsibilities that come with power.

  Dumbledore certainly could kill Malfoy without anyone being the wiser - which would prevent all those consequences you fear.
#+end_quote

Perhaps.

Dumbledore could also murder Narcissa Malfoy without anyone knowing. And then Walden Macnair. Then Fenrir Greyback. Then Goyle Sr. And then he could conduct a false flag attack against the Ministry to convince them of Voldemort's return. Then he could arrange for Umbridge to have an accident. He could then place the Minister under the Imperius Curse so he control the Ministry in secret. Those are all legitimate solutions to the problems within the wizarding world, right? And as long as he doesn't get caught, there are no downsides!

But eventually Dumbledore will make a mistake. Eventually, he'll be caught. For this strategy to be successful, Dumbledore really would have to be a god --- he'd have to be somebody so incredibly competent that the /never/ fucked up. If Dumbledore was that hyper-competent, then shouldn't he be able to win without using these methods?

Of course, you could claim that "Dumbledore will stop before he get's caught," but is that really true? If it is logical and ethical to murder Malfoy, then it is equally logical and ethical to murder Fenrir Greyback. If Greyback's murder was logically and ethically justified, then so is the murder of other Death Eaters. If Dumbledore killed /only/ Malfoy, then, according to your ideology, wouldn't he be guilty for /not/ murdering Greyback? Wouldn't letting Greyback live be fundamentally unethical, according to your worldview?

The killings would only stop when Dumbledore runs out of people to kill (which won't happen), or he's caught (which would be a disaster) or because he becomes a hypocrite that abandons his philosophy. You can't say that Malfoy is a unique case, because your justifications are equally applicable elsewhere. If you think murdering Malfoy is justified, then you believe that /conducting executions without due process or civil accountability/ is justified. Malfoy's murder would not happen in isolation. There /are/ consequences to your mentality. Even if nobody traces those killings back to Dumbledore, just what kind of society would Dumbledore have created? It would be totalitarian in /function/, even if it lacked the bad press of being totalitarian in the public eye.

What's more, Dumbledore wouldn't have solved the underlying issues that created those Death Eaters in the first place. He would be destroying the symptoms of the problem, but not the cause. Even if every person Dumbledore killed was deserving of their death, would that really end Blood Purity? Not every Blood Purist was a Death Eater; there must have been hundreds of others who harbored feelings for that ideology, even if they didn't want to become Voldemort's minion. Killing the KKK wouldn't have stopped segregation or bigotry in America --- the world just isn't that simple.

Another problem is revealed when you consider what is /required/ for Dumbledore's crimes to remain hidden from the public. Your philosophy in execution cannot function alongside a competent /and/ benevolent government. If the government is benevolent, then they must also be incompetent, because otherwise they would solve and reveal the true nature of those deaths. If the government is competent, then it must also be complicit in concealing Dumbledore's crimes from the greater public. But isn't establishing a competent and benevolent society the ultimate goal of this endeavour? Yet the creation of such a government would retroactively jeopardize your accomplishments. Your methods and end-game are mutually exclusive.

I haven't even gotten into the risk of innocents being caught up in all this. It would certainly be a dark world if even the good guys were lynching people.

In conclusion, I think there are still consequences to your ideology even if it is implemented secretly.

I've kind of strayed away from discussing Harry Potter (which is fun and warm) and started discussing politics in general (which is typically a lot less fun). Forgive me.

I'm not advocating an authoritarian government - I'm advocating doing what is needed to save children if there's no other choice, and rebuilding a better government at the same time.

It's really simple: If you need to save children from being murdered, then that takes precedence over following the law or obeying the government.

What victims? What are their names? How will they die? When? You say that a preemptive murder is the only solution, but I can't offer alternate solutions because you can't answer these questions. You are using ambiguity to justify certainty. You're peddling fear in the name of righteousness.

And please take note that I'm not asserting Malfoy's innocence. However, if you don't prove his guilt prior to passing out judgement then you are legitimizing a system of ethics that /will/ eventually condemn innocents to death. We cannot allow guilt to be determined on the basis of suspicion and speculation --- such a system would be rampant with corruption and abuse. The road from civil security to oppression is shorter than you think.

Even if Dumbledore was infallible in his judgement (which he wouldn't be), can you promise that his successor will be the same? What about his successors successor?

Every society in in the world that doesn't respect civil liberties is a shithole. Do you think that's just a coincidence? Do you think that happened by chance? You can't build a better government without ideals on which to base that government. A government cannot be benevolent without assumed innocence and due process.

And I am /not/ implying that inaction is appropriate. But if you think that murder is the only course of action, then you have to /prove/ it --- simply repeating that it's "the only way" isn't good enough. /Prove/ to me that it is indeed an ultimatum between lives. If you can't prove it, yet you still think preemptive murder is necessary, then you're advocating for a world in which death is dealt based on /feelings/ and not /fact/.

******************** Malfoy tried to get all muggleborns at Hogwarts killed by Basilisk. He failed thanks to dumb luck. He showed no remorse either. We know this, Dumbledore knows this, Harry knows this. It cannot be proven in court due to Dobby not being able to testify for whatever reason.

But Malfoy presents a clear and present danger to all muggleborns - his actions prove that beyond any doubt. Either Dumbledore deals with him, or the next time, Malfoy might succeed.

And my argument is that killing him is the last resort. If everything else fails, Dumbledore has to kill him rather than let him try to murder more children.

Just so my stance hasn't become muddled in this long conversation, my issue is not specifically with Dumbledore killing or not killing Malfoy in 1993, but that allowing this instance opens up the door for others to feel morally justified in murder, and it becomes much more difficult to enforce moral murders when most people do not consider themselves wrong. Everyone doing the murdering would /feel/ in the right. And I can't help be very confident that murdering Lucius would have given Draco the drive and passion to become a mini Lucius rather than the one incapable of murder. It seems that Dumbledore could kill Lucius and frame it on someone else, and then maybe Draco would not focus his anger at "the good guys", but then we are getting in really deep and it still only works with this single instance rather than as a blanket allowance.

I was thinking exactly the same thing - it /is/ a nice switcheroo because while I find the idea of flat out murdering Malfoy completely reprehensible, vile, immoral, and a slippery slope towards evil and a solution that does not consider the mental health of the attacker and ignores the moral code of the story (in this case specifically Dumbledore's line, "Killing is not so easy as the innocent believe"), and ignores that this would give the younger Malfoy a legitimate reason to seek revenge just as Harry does to Voldemort, I can, /at the very least/, consider it a more self-contained solution than the other interpretations of Dumbledore that expect him to pull everything off perfectly without ever getting his hands dirty or messing up. At least a murderous Dumbledore solves /that/ double-standard, even if it would probably inevitably fail.

This is not the first time I've seen someone claim that murder, torture, and removing the rights of Death Eaters is the "right" way to govern, but I always find it terrifying.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore is an odd case, because I think he's torn between those radically different philosophies. Logically, Dumbledore agrees with Garak's mindset --- he can rationalize committing small acts of evil in order to prevent a greater tragedy --- but emotionally, he feels more closely aligned with Picard --- Dumbledore is very empathetic, and he's consumed by guilt for his sisters death.

  Dumbledore is indecisive and contradictory throughout the books because his logic and emotions are at odds with each other. This dichotomy is why Dumbledore fucks up. For example, Dumbledore knows that it's strategically beneficial to treat Harry like a child soldier, but emotionally Dumbledore is compelled to let Harry enjoy his school life without the knowledge of the prophecy hanging over his head. It's this sort of compromise that leads to most of Dumbledore's mistakes.

  Also, I think it's worth pointing out that having empathy wasn't Dumbledore's weakness; Dumbledore's weakness was that he struggled to reconcile his empathy with his intelligence. If Dumbledore was more like Picard --- if he rejected the Greater Good based on logical and intellectual grounds --- then perhaps he would have been more effective than he was in canon.

  If Picard was in Dumbledore's position, he would have invested far more time trying to redeem wizarding society on a fundamental level. Picard would have created a system in which the Blood Purist ideology could not thrive. However, Dumbledore did not value bureaucracy, truth, ethics, rule-of-law or diplomacy in the way that Picard does, and so he never focused on fixing the institutionalized corruption and bigoted culture that allowed Voldemort to rise to power so easily.
#+end_quote

I think this is a beautiful thought and I once again love the comparison, but I also have to be the "well, actually" person and say that Dumbledore does seem to have tried to change the idealogy of society as well - although clearly was unsuccessful. Dumbledore's reputation (so long as we assume it's earned) is about reaching out to other magical creatures in friendship and understanding, he's learned many languages in order to effectively communicate with others, he understands without criticism how to work with giants, centaurs, merpeople, and house-elves and is unafraid to disagree with the Minister when he is blaming things on Madame Maxime. While we don't witness all the direct examples of Dumbledore's advocacy for these people and creatures, it is highly implied that they happened because many characters criticize and/or praise Dumbledore for exactly these things - Malfoy, Voldemort, Fudge, Rita Skeeter, Doge, etc. And considering all those people have varying motives for describing Dumbledore and yet all agree that he has done this work, I think it's safe to say that Dumbledore /has/ tried very hard to change the purist ideology.

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, if Garak was in Dumbledore's position, then Voldemort probably would have been defeated far sooner. However, in the process of doing so, Garak would have tortured, murdered, and ultimately utilized the very same tactics that made Voldemort so abhorrent. Garak's methods would not create a stable foundation for a new world --- he would have violated all the lofty ideals on which one could base a better society --- and stability would only ever be found through continued violence. If you just assassinate every suspected Death Eater then you've legitimized murder and laid the seeds for future revenge. What then? Do you preemptively kill the Death Eater's children? Or do you just naively hope that your enemies offspring will behave more honorably than you did? There are long term consequences to abandoning due process and empathy. A world populated by the likes of Garak would not be a world worth fighting for.

  In the end, I think Dumbledore found a way to square his utilitarian perspective with his conscience. Dumbledore's final plan turned love itself into a weapon.
#+end_quote

I agree, though I feel Dumbledore got extremely lucky that the world just happened to back him up. Dumbledore is /very very very very very very very very very/ lucky that love protection magic just happens to transfer with blood resurrections. Whether he planned it or not, he is lucky that the world/science/magic/whatever just happens to function in a way that saves Dumbledore from having to make a much harder decision. He's one lucky bastard.

This is like Inception levels of interpretation now, but I think the reason Dumbledore got extremely lucky is because the utilitarian method just happened to eventualy coincide with morality and humanity in this one particular instance - and not because Dumbledore orchestrated it that way (though this comes down to the level of control we believe Dumbledore had), but because Voldemort accidentally did, and because Voldemort /kept/ doing so. I think Dumbledore really did not believe there was any hope for Harry - and then Harry miraculously discovers and attempts to save the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and then he miraculously saves Ginny from the basilisk and Voldemort, and he refuses to let Peter Pettigrew be killed, and Voldemort steals his blood and Harry stood up to him, overpowered his wand, absorbed some of Voldemort's own magic, and escaped with Cedric's body. I think the end of GoF, Dumbledore is like "well, holy fuck, this kid really does have something, doesn't he?" and through analyzing how Harry's has succeeded, Dumbledore discovers that Harry's consistent power has been love. I don't necessarily believe that Dumbledore had always known it would be or that he planned for it.

And what I love /best/ about this series is that Harry is really not that unusual. His level of love is fairly standard to those around him. What makes Harry different from everyone else, what makes him more suitable to defeat Voldemort is not that he loves better or stronger than his friends, but that Voldemort gave Harry the connection that /weaponized/ Harry's love against himself. Voldemort really did create his own worst enemy and then continued to empower that enemy with each new attempt to do the opposite. Poor Voldemort, I almost feel sorry for the guy.

In the end, while Dumbledore did a helluva lot of work to ensure that Harry was the victor, it was still magic itself that dropped the first domino when it favored Lily over Voldemort.

You're right. Dumbledore was certainly aware of the bigoted side of wizarding culture, and he had the courage and integrity to publicly criticize those evil ideas.

However, what differentiates Dumbledore from Picard is that Dumbledore believed that those evil ideas where the fault of individual people, whereas Picard believed that individuals were the product of the underlying logistics of their environment.

Dumbledore tried to redeem the wizarding world by redeeming the people within it. For example, Dumbledore tried to redeem Draco by encouraging him to act against the circumstances of his environment. Picard, on the other hand, would have considered the circumstances of Malfoy's environment to be fundamentally unacceptable, and he would have fought to change those circumstances themselves.

You brought up the example of the giants, and I think that further establishes the difference between Dumbledore and somebody like Picard. Dumbledore tried to bribe individual giants into opposing Voldemort. Dumbledore only opened meaningful dialog with the giants when such a relationship became strategically significant, and he attempted to form a personal relationship, rather than creating systematic cooperation between cultures.

On the other hand, Picard would have helped the giants because he genuinely believed in the principles of mutual cooperation, humanitarianism and universal justice. Because Picard intellectually valued these principles, he would have freely given humanitarian aid to /all/ giants, and he would have done so long /before/ Voldemort's return. Picard would have offered help to the giants regardless of their immediate strategic value, and therefore would have formed a relationship with them /before/ such a relationship had strategic utility.

Dumbledore's morality was driven by his sympathy and empathy towards specific people. Dumbledore's clumsy attempts at diplomacy came too late to be effective, or were too personal to make a difference in the grand scheme of wizarding society. Picard's morality was more concerned with the logistics of a system, and how that system effected the liberty and prosperity of the individuals within it. This is why Picard would have been so much more effective at creating meaningful change.

And I'm not implying that Picard doesn't feel sympathy for the individual, or that he doesn't value personal relationships --- it's just that Picard was intellectually aligned with his moral code. Picard believed that his philosophy was not only ethically correct, but also that was also strategically correct, especially when it came to the bigger picture of establishing a better world. In contrast, Dumbledore struggled to find common ground between his empathy for the individual and his logical pursuit of a better world in general. This incoherence made him ineffective.

If we bring this back to [[/u/Starfox5]]'s original proposition (that murdering Malfoy was the ethical thing to do), then I think Dumbledore would agree that killing Malfoy was ultimately in the best interests of the wizarding world, but Dumbledore's empathy for Malfoy as an individual is what stayed his hand. Picard, however, would logically oppose Starfox's ideology on all grounds. In Picard's philosophy, there is no conflict between empathy and the (lowercase) greater good.

I think you're probably right, but at the same time we don't know how Dumbledore would have acted if magic didn't function the way it did. If the canon solution to Dumbledore's predicament wasn't viable then Dumbledore may have found another way to salvage the situation. Dumbledore was extremely intelligent, and I don't think we can discount the possibility of him succeeding through alternate means.

Also, I don't think we can claim that magic was stacked against Voldemort. If we take away Lily's love magic, then wouldn't it also be fair to take away Voldemort's Horcruxes? Voldemort had plenty of magical advantages that were only available to somebody truly evil. If we take away the righteous and loving side to magic, then we are not making magic more neutral, we are instead making it more inherently aligned with evil.

That all being said, I don't disagree with what you're saying. You're absolutely right that Voldemort was the architect of his own defeat.

And sorry I haven't replied to your other post. I'm a little overwhelmed trying to keep up with this thread. The long story short is that I agree with most of your analysis, and you've changed many of the opinions I had about Dumbledore prior to making this thread. Thanks for enlightening me.

Perhaps, but at that point Dumbledore probably also had Slughorn's altered memory, and I don't think it would have been hard to put two and two together.

********** Part 1/2:

#+begin_quote
  However, what differentiates Dumbledore from Picard is that Dumbledore believed that those evil ideas where the fault of individual people, whereas Picard believed that individuals were the product of the underlying logistics of their environment.
#+end_quote

I don't necessarily disagree (because I'm not really sure what your comparison means yet), but off the top of my head I can think of Dumbledore explaining that Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards. While one could interpret this as Dumbledore singling out the Black family specifically, as Harry thinks at first, I think in context it becomes clear that Dumbledore is speaking generally about wizardkind, and how both Sirius and Kreacher are symptoms of a larger societal problem, when Harry accuses Dumbledore of being a hypocrite for blaming Sirius for hating Kreacher, Dumbledore says,

#+begin_quote
  “Sirius did not hate Kreacher. He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.”
#+end_quote

And I feel Dumbledore does more than just acknowledging this, but has acted on this too.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore only opened meaningful dialog with the giants when such a relationship became strategically significant, and he attempted to form a personal relationship, rather than creating systematic cooperation between cultures.
#+end_quote

One of the reasons the Gurg listened to Hagrid and Maxime was because the Gurg had heard of Dumbledore already and of his advocating for giant rights. Hagrid said,

#+begin_quote
  "He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say."
#+end_quote

In light of Dumbledore having done this in peacetime, it seems to me that you are saying this was still insufficient. But what is the better option, then? Should Dumbledore have personally befriended all types of magical beings and been their white knight? What's the balance of aid you're expecting? It sounds both impossible and dishonest, like white folks who qualify themselves by mentioning their black friends or Hermione who forces her ideals onto the house-elves. Or is it more that advocating for others isn't enough, it's got to actually work otherwise it's a reflection on the advocates intentions? Is the corrupt and stubborn Ministry not even a little responsible? Is Dumbledore responsible for all of them becoming better people?

#+begin_quote
  Picard would have offered help to the giants regardless of their immediate strategic value, and therefore would have formed a relationship with them before such a relationship had strategic utility.
#+end_quote

It seems to me that Picard and Dumbledore have this in common, then ... and I kind of want to read that fanfiction now... But I don't understand where your version of Dumbledore comes from. Where do you imagine he got his reputation from? Is everyone else lying when they attribute these qualities to Dumbledore?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's clumsy attempts at diplomacy came too late to be effective, or were too personal to make a difference in the grand scheme of wizarding society. Picard's morality was more concerned with the logistics of a system, and how that system effected the liberty and prosperity of the individuals within it.
#+end_quote

Are we talking about the same character? It seems plain to me that Dumbledore has devoted his life to inspiring others, especially the government, to be kind and humane. If he is less effective then Picard, then bully for Picard for having a better track on which to run, but I'm honestly confused on what grounds this criticism is laid against Dumbledore since the books seem to overwhelmingly imply and show Dumbledore saying and doing the things you say only Picard would do. The only fault I can think of is that Dumbledore turned down the Minister position making him less aptly-positioned to affect change than he might otherwise have done, but I feel condemning that choice is ignoring Dumbledore's attempts to deal with his own inner personal problems and demanding that he simply not /have/ personal problems so that he can fix all the world's problems instead. Is this the price Dumbledore must pay for being intelligent? Is Dumbledore's problem that he is so close to perfect that his imperfections appear much worse than they would on anyone else? Is his flaw being clumsier than a god? I'm asking this from the perspective that Dumbledore is much closer to the Picard that you've laid out. When bad things happen around Picard, is it because he started too late to make friends? Is Picard also responsible for the choices and actions of everyone else in his world?

#+begin_quote
  Picard believed that his philosophy was not only ethically correct, but also that was also strategically correct, especially when it came to the bigger picture of establishing a better world. In contrast, Dumbledore struggled to find common ground between his empathy for the individual and his logical pursuit of a better world in general. This incoherence made him ineffective.
#+end_quote

In the context that our conversation is mostly about preventative measures and fixing society during peacetime, then I fail to see where Dumbledore's ideology is conflicted. I love your analysis that Dumbledore /during wartime/ has discovered that the best way to save the world does not align with his ideology, but all you have convinced me of in this post is that Picard's god dealt him convenient cards and Dumbledore's god dealt him shitty ones. What would happen if Picard found himself in Dumbledore shoes - would magic alter itself to Picard's authority? Would it suddenly function differently to save Picard from making difficult choices? If your answer is that Picard would have solved the problem sooner, do you mean to say that Dumbledore didn't try to? Is there a religious faith element at play I'm missing, where if one believes strongly enough, that god will alter things to help?

After Grindelwald and before Harry, what incoherence do you mean? What is causing this conflict in Dumbledore's mind? Are you saying he is selfish for advocating for giant rights during peacetime because it's somehow clear he is not doing it for the giants' own good, but in preperation for a future conflict?

*********** Part 2/2: [[/u/Just_in_it_for_memes]]

#+begin_quote
  If we bring this back to [[/u/Starfox5]] [-2]'s original proposition (that murdering Malfoy was the ethical thing to do), then I think Dumbledore would agree that killing Malfoy was ultimately in the best interests of the wizarding world, but Dumbledore's empathy for Malfoy as an individual is what stayed his hand. Picard, however, would logically oppose Starfox's ideology on all grounds. In Picard's philosophy, there is no conflict between empathy and the (lowercase) greater good.
#+end_quote

I think that Dumbledore would agree with Picard on this one too and frankly I fail to even see much difference in this particular example between these objectives, because all I see is that Picard either may not be suited to resolve all types of conflicts (not to suggest that Dumbledore is) or alternatively that he lives in a convenient world where things always work out where moral fiber alone saves the day.

But since we're on the topic of Dumbledore considering murder - at the very core of the series is the theme of death, respecting it and developing a healthy view of it. The Deathly Hallows symbolize the different flaws of humankind and the objects are designed to exploit those flaws, consequently meaning that a person who masters the objects is less exploitable in those particular ways. The wand symbolizes our desire for power and those who seek it, but those who fight brazenly, loudly, and offensively with the wand are doomed to be attacked by like-minded people. Dumbledore, having very good reason to believe that Grindelwald had obtained that wand, and even despite believing that he, himself, was the more skilled wizard, did not go after him. His fear of learning about Ariana's death was /so strong/, that it both reveals the extent of his cowardice in the face of so many dying, but it also shows that his fear has eradicated any allure the wand might still have had. He finally went after Grindelwald not for the glory he'd gain, but because his shame was consuming him. That's how he won that wand, the opposite of glory and fame and confidence. Dumbledore never told anybody he had the wand either, because how could he? It would admit his greatest flaw - and Dumbledore's reward is readers interpreting his greatest flaw as a desire for power instead, and using that as the foundation on which they interpret all his actions. Even in Voldemort's war, he never sought out a fight, he only used the wand to protect others; therefore the wand couldn't exploit him. It's how Dumbledore describes Harry's use of the Invisibility Cloak, that Harry uses it to protect others from harm or death, implying that this is the correct or wise way to use the objects.

While Dumbledore is suited to handle the Elder Wand, it's the Resurrection Stone, the one designed to exploit those in grief, that Dumbledore fails, because he had hoped to see his family. This powerful wizard that can hold his own against the most skilled wizards, who understands the deepest laws of nature, who can produce the most impressive magic, foiled by something so mundane and average as grief.

Furthermore, Dumbledore spends an entire chapter convincing Harry in HBP that it is not the prophecy, but Harry's own will to avenge his parents, and everyone else, that is important in going after Voldemort - that the prophecy is meaningless to Harry, and all that matters now are the choices he and Voldemort make (which aligns with the prophecy anyway, because the prophecy does not prophesize that Harry will or must fight, it prophecizes that he could win. Even by the rules laid out there, it is still Harry's choice). But aaaaaaaanyway, Dumbledore acknowledges the legitimacy of avenging one's loved ones as the basis for going after Voldemort.

And this is the man who would consider killing Lucius in cold-blood? Dumbledore in one breath supports avenging loved ones and in another breath is the murderer? I'm not even sure why we're debating this because he not only didn't kill Lucius that time, but didn't kill any of the Death Eaters he caught in the battle at the Ministry and that /is/ a dire situation in which lives are immediately at risk, and yet he /still/ chose to imprison them. And not only that, but Dumbledore has a speech /to Malfoy's son/ about how they can protect him and his family and keep him safe, and if it weren't for Dumbledore's inability to communicate this offer to the Order, I fully believe they would have done so, because Dumbledore already has a history of protecting Voldemort's defectors - Snape! (sorry this paragraph is more responding to Starfox's comments than yours, I think)

I hate to resort to outside-book information, but JKR even has an entire article about almost this topic, called [[http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sno25c]["Why Dumbledore Went to the Hilltop"]] that explains his willingness to hear Snape out, who at the time of their meeting was not much better than Lucius.

#+begin_quote
  If we take away Lily's love magic, then wouldn't it also be fair to take away Voldemort's Horcruxes? Voldemort had plenty of magical advantages that were only available to somebody truly evil. If we take away the righteous and loving side to magic, then we are not making magic more neutral, we are instead making it more inherently aligned with evil.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand where this hypothetical is going. I suppose you can take away any magical element to consider how differently the character would have acted. So yeah, it would be interesting analyzing the books as if the Hocruxes didn't exist, but I'm failing to see what point it makes about Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps, but at that point Dumbledore probably also had Slughorn's altered memory, and I don't think it would have been hard to put two and two together.
#+end_quote

Do you think so? It seems much more likely that Dumbledore got the memory after GoF, prompting Slughorn to go into hiding for a year. Am I overlooking something that suggests Dumbledore got the memory beforehand? It seems incredible that Dumbledore would have not been focusing on Horcruxes for decades if he'd had that memory, especially in light of what he says in OotP about his figuring it out only after Harry handed him the diary.

Picard is indeed forced to make some shitty decisions throughout the series. There are lots of times when his duties irrevocably conflicted with the realities of his circumstances. Things didn't always work out the way he wanted. And for the record, Picard wasn't a Mary Sue; he did have flaws, but most of those flaws manifested within his personal life, and they didn't effect his decisions as Captain. As a Captain, it is hard to find fault with Picard's decisions.

So you're totally right to call me out for criticizing Dumbledore for not being perfect. In truth, Picard is close to what I would consider an ideal leader. To compare Dumbledore to this ideal isn't fair. My intentions when making this comparison weren't to insult Dumbledore, or to say "/my/ character is better than /your/ character." I was simply trying to establish where Dumbledore differentiates from the ideal, and I wanted to do it strictly from the perspective of his philosophies, rather than focusing on the more boring quantifiable aspects of competence (like intelligence or cunning or whatever).

I dunno. It was probably unwise of me to bring Star Trek into this at all, because it's a comparison that only makes sense if you're familiar with both franchises, but I'm in too deep now to back off. I just feel like there's a fundamental difference between the themes of Start Trek and the themes of Harry Potter, and I am personally more aligned with Star Trek's philosophy, even though I'm struggling to actually articulate what those differences actually are.

#+end_quote

I agree with your assessment of Dumbledore. I just think that the /reasons/ for Dumbledore's altruism are different from Picard's.

Dumbledore would never murder somebody, because Dumbledore is too much of a good person. Dumbledore loves people. Dumbledore can empathize with someone who's gone down a dark path, because Dumbledore almost went down that path himself. Dumbledore knows people can change, because Dumbledore changed. Dumbledore simply cares too much for other people to murder them. On the other hand, even if you took away Picard's empathy, Picard still wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood, because he believes it is /illogical/.

For Dumbledore, morality is a conflict between what is ethically /right/ and what is /easy/. Within Dumbledore, ethics is a war between his benevolent emotions and the logic of the Greater Good.

The general philosophy of Star Trek is very different; Picard believes that good and evil is a conflict between benevolent logic and malicious instinct. In Star Trek, evil is usually presented as the perversion or abandonment of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deq6_p47g54][logic]].

This is not a superficial difference. You mentioned how I could fault Dumbledore for not accepting the position and responsibilities of the Minister of Magic, but you didn't explore /why/ he refused that position. Dumbledore doesn't trust himself with that much authority. He worries that his empathy won't keep his logic in check.

You then go on to say that I can't blame Dumbledore for being "too intelligent," but that implies that intelligence --- that logic itself --- is in opposition to benevolence. This is the significant difference in personal philosophies that makes Picard more effective than Dumbledore. Picard feels awkward and unbalanced /outside/ of a position of authority. Picard relishes command; he /wants/ the personal responsibility that comes with leadership, because there is no internal conflict between his intelligence and his benevolence.

 

#+begin_quote
  What would happen if Picard found himself in Dumbledore shoes - would magic alter itself to Picard's authority?
#+end_quote

This isn't a fair point when the magic within the Potter universe was designed by JK Rowling explicitly to justify her philosophy that love conquers all.

On the other hand, half of all Star Trek episodes are resolved by the crew making some logical deduction that leads to a new scientific revelation, engineering breakthrough or cunning maneuver. Star Trek could be characterized as a show about pursuing the truth --- whether it be scientific truth, personal truth or ethical truth --- and that goes hand-in-hand with pursuing power. After all, you do not become weaker by learning something. Knowledge is power.

However, Rowling would classify the pursuit of power as fundamentally evil. I mean, in Harry Potter, ambition is the virtue of a Slytherin. It is the virtue of the bad guys.

#+begin_quote
  "And a thirst... to prove yourself..."
#+end_quote

According to Dumbledore, what makes Harry a true Gryffindor (a good guy) is that he chose to reject his Slytherin qualities --- he rejected ambition. And in the end, Harry doesn't win because he worked at improving himself, he won because he rejected power (the Elder wand) and because of love (made possible by the magic system).

But take a look at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuzh6RT0wx8][this scene]].

#+begin_quote
  "I know I've got something to offer, I just need a chance to prove it"
#+end_quote

Even if it's not word-for-word the same as the quote from the Sorting Hat, you've got to admit that they're pretty close. Yet look at how differently ambition is portrayed. And I'm not implying that Dumbledore would have disproved of that Star Trek scene --- he probably would have commended Nog for his self-determination --- but you can't deny that there is a /tone/ of disapproval within Rowling's work towards power and ambition.

And why is that? Ambition is not /inherently/ evil. Seeking power for power's sake is ethically /neutral/ --- it's what you /do/ with that power that actually matters.

When you place logic and empathy in opposition with each other your cause is crippled by the incoherence. Dumbledore didn't accept the position of Minister because he was too "wise" to seek power, despite being the most benevolent and intelligent wizard in Britain. How is that an effective philosophy? This philosophy means that the people best suited for power are the least likely to seek it. You can't put logic and benevolence in conflict without in turn handing power to the incompetent or evil. Ironically, the negative consequences of Rowling's philosophy are actually present within her work; Voldemort (evil) and Fudge (illogical) are the two most powerful wizards for a time.

 

Man, it took me far too long to write this up, and it's only now that I read through it in its entirety that I realize how rambling it all is. I was trying to articulate this /feeling/ I have about where Dumbledore's philosophy falls short, but I think ended up abstracting everything to the point that it lost any coherent point I might have made.

But oh well, I've invested too much energy in this wall of text to delete it now.

The Federation has a strict policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign societies. This is quite literally their Prime Directive. But in my personal opinion, Picard is /too/ respectful of other cultures. While Picard does violate the Prime Directive when faced with a humanitarian crisis, I actually think he perhaps doesn't violate it often enough.

***** It's extremely easy to look back into the past and see how you got to where you are as a straight line.

While I roughly agree with OPs "task list" that Dumbledore made for himself, there's no reason to believe that everything went off without a hitch.

What we see are the successes, but it's entirely possible that those successes /are/ the backup plans. Each step along the way may have been a failure, covered up by a new plan created on the spot.

It's easy to appear Godlike if you assume he planned for events 11 years in advance, but I posit that quite a lot of how things went were adaptations of his original plan, while sticking as much as he could to his "to-do list".

****** The problem is the plans in canon are shit. That's OK for a book aimed at kids, but anyone with half a brain would laugh at say Voldemort's plan to lure Harry into the DoM in book 5. The whole damn plan hinges on Harry not being able to contact Sirius, Dumbledore, or anyone else from the Order - and being stupid enough to charge ahead to the DoM. The whole damn plan requires everyone, from Dumbledore to Harry, to act like idiots, and relied on dumb luck to foil Harry's attempt to check in Grimmauld Place.

And that was Voldemort's master plan to get the prophecy, on which he bet most of his core followers.

Same for Dumbledore's canon plans - they are far too prone to fail, and mostly worked due to dumb luck and dumber enemies.

*** While I disagree with your conclusion, I agree with your questions. A Dumbledore that pulls off his first plan without a hitch makes it appear like Dumbledore could have prevented a lot of bad things from happening if he just put in the effort. Consequently, he appears callous for not having tried. I would even say that this is the natural foundation for eventual Dumbledore bashing. If we do not expect these amazing long-term plans to come off without a hitch, then we would never assume he can fix anything, and we would not put the world on his shoulders.

**** As I said in another post, this plan probably wasn't exactly what Dumbledore was originally aiming for.

Dumbledore's initial plan might have looked something like this:

- *STEP 1:* Destroy the Philosopher's Stone, so Voldemort is forced to use the Resurrection Ritual to regain his former power.
- *STEP 2:* Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
- *STEP 3:* Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
- *STEP 4:* Protect Harry, and help him grow into a good and competent adult.
- *STEP 5 (a):* Lie to Harry, and tell him he needs to be killed by Voldemort to destroy the Horcrux within his scar.
- *STEP 5 (b):* Harry willingly sacrifices himself to Voldemort.
- *STEP 5 (c):* Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.
- *STEP 5 (d):* Voldemort "kills" Harry.
- *STEP 5 (e):* The Horcux is destroyed by Voldemort, and Harry is protected from death by Lily's blood-love-enchantment, because Lily's blood is still flowing in the veins of Voldemort's resurrected body.
- *STEP 5 (f):* Because Harry believed he was going to die, and he willingly sacrificed himself to protect the people he loves, a /new/ blood-love-enchantment is created.
- *STEP 5 (g):* There are now two different sets of blood-love-enchantments, one that protects Harry, and one that protects everybody Harry sacrificed himself to save.

In this best case scenario, Dumbledore would have destroyed all the hidden Horcrux's prior to the ritual. Voldemort also would never kidnap Harry for the ritual --- Harry would give himself willingly to Voldemort, and so Voldemort would have been resurrected and fucked in the same night.

You can think of that plan I listed in my original post as the backup plan, that was made to account for Voldemort's successes and Dumbledore's mistakes.

** A valiant effort to justify Dumbledore's actions, but it all falls apart if you just consider the alternatives. Why didn't he ask the goblins to remove Harry's horcrux? How come the key to Harry's vault is alternatively in the hands of Hagrid and Mrs. Weasley, but never himself? How could he have never received any owls during his childhood?

It's obvious the lemon drop guzzling goat was stealing Harry's money and denying him his inheritance. The ultimate plan you speak of was nothing else but sacrificing Harry and then stepping in to finish Voldemort off himself for fame and glory.

** Those are some lovely theories, but the issue I take, is that Dumbledore overstepped every single time. Tom Riddle is a terrorist who was strongly driven in that direction by Dumbledore, although his actions are his own, and he was clearly insane well before he tried to murder an infant. Dumbledore is a straight up Machiavellian Dark Lord, who attempts to 'guide' the world by molding it's youth, and holding key positions in it's legislature. Why we bash Dumbledore in a few easy to understand bullet points.

- Dumbledore placed Harry with his relatives, against the advice of McG, which should have been irrelevant as Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.

- He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable. There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone.

- He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.

- Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.

- At the end of the year, after Harry straight up kills a professor, He is sent back to the neglectful, borderline abusive relatives to whom he was delivered without due process in the first place. Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry. Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry. An eleven year old boy killed someone. Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children? Once more, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and all of the above actually falls under his purview, but he does nothing.

- Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see the Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed. And again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, again, that of running the school, and he fails.

- Why weren't the authorities notified when students were being attacked and petrified? Where were the interviews, the investigation? My recurring theme of Dumbledore having one fucking job and failing persists. The aurors are one floo call away.

- McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.

- Sirius Black was a member of Dumbledore's super secret vigilante group. Dumbledore knew about the dark mark thanks to Snape turning coat. Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.

- Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.

- Dumbledore hired a werewolf. He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month. He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.

- Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.

- The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.

- A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job.

- Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors? Shouldn't Dumbledore call them? Maybe once they get to the infirmary as Harry is clearly injured. Ah, but no, Dumbledore couldn't possibly be assed to do his job. Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.

- Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.

- End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.

And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.

I'll say it again for those who missed it - Dumbledore had one fucking job as Headmaster of a boarding school and he failed at every level. Even worse he ~maliciously~ groomed students to become suicide bombers.

So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.

  Tom Riddle is a terrorist who was strongly driven in that direction by Dumbledore, although his actions are his own, and he was clearly insane well before he tried to murder an infant.
#+end_quote

I must have been hit by a Memory Charm, since I don't seem to recall Dumbledore driving Tom Riddle to commit horrible crimes.

In fact, I remember the very opposite--Dumbledore tells eleven-year-old Tom that thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts, that he must speak to his teachers with respect, and that he must return the items that he has stolen to their proper owners and apologize for what he has done.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore placed Harry with his relatives, against the advice of McG, which should have been irrelevant as Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore may well have convinced the authorities that placing Harry with blood relatives would have been the more suitable scenario. In any event, we know very little of how law works in the Wizarding World, so to say that Dumbledore had no right to do so is speculation at best.

#+begin_quote
  He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable.
#+end_quote

The traps were meant not to stop a thief, but delay them. The final trap, the Mirror of Erised, was virtually unstoppable to anyone who had unscrupulous reasons to get the Stone. Dumbledore was trying to lure out Voldemort, so that he could stop him.

#+begin_quote
  There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone.
#+end_quote

I've never been convinced of that. Not one of them would have stopped Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.
#+end_quote

It was never stated that Dumbledore was the one in charge of detentions. That's something to take up with McGonagall, as it appears she was the one who set it.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.
#+end_quote

I cannot believe I'm about to play devil's advocate for that slimeball, but I'm too stubborn to quit. There aren't exactly a lot of extremely skilled Potions Masters to go around. Snape is slime, but he also has nowhere else to go. Dumbledore needs him at Hogwarts, and dismissing him to allow a different Potions Master to take his place would risk losing an extraordinarily valuable spy.

And Snape may be a bastard, but his NEWT classes only take the best, and given the sorry state of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, Dumbledore may be willing to risk it, as to get the best possible candidates for Aurors.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the year, after Harry straight up kills a professor, He is sent back to the neglectful, borderline abusive relatives to whom he was delivered without due process in the first place
#+end_quote

Harry didn't kill Quirrell. Quirrell's body was damaged, but it was Voldemort's possession that led to it, and upon his departure, Quirrell's body couldn't stay alive. That's an important difference.

And the Durselys suck, but they're also a classic piece of story-telling. Comically incompetent, mean-spirited guardians have been a crucial part of story telling in English literature for quite literally centuries.

And once again, there's no evidence whatsoever that the Durselys weren't given custody through due process.

#+begin_quote

  Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry.

Again, no evidence there wasn't.

Again, Harry's treatment is akin to the orphans from Charles Dickens, and countless others. And in any event, the Dursleys treat him like scum, but there's no indication that anybody other than Dudley is actively hitting him. Vernon picking Harry up by the collar is not the same thing as beating him.

#+begin_quote
  Once more, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and all of the above actually falls under his purview, but he does nothing.
#+end_quote

And Dumbledore also knows that due to the blood protections that he cannot easily move Harry.

#+end_quote

And did Harry ever once go to a teacher and say what was going on? No. It was the 1990s--the studies about the ill effects of bullying weren't completed. Stop acting as if the books were written, and set, in the 2010s.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not all who were aligned with Voldemort had the Dark Mark--Greyback doesn't. And what sort of idiot would allow his chief spy to have the branding that identifies him as a member? And more to the point, Sirius was not sent to Azkaban for betraying the Potters. He was sent to Azkaban for blowing up a street and killing a dozen people. Dumbledore may have pushed for a trial--we're never actually told this definitively and for all we know, the Chief Warlock may not have the final say (The title "Chief" may not even mean much--several of *Chief* Justice Roberts's responsibilities are largely ceremonial or very, very specific).

*** *TLDR: You make a lot of good points about flaws Dumbledore has, things he should have done better, and ways in which he was sort of a bad Headmaster, but your conclusions on those points are over-the-top, not fully supported by the evidence, and paint Dumbledore in a far worse light than he deserves.*

*Long Version:*

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.
#+end_quote

This is an assumption unsupported by the text. In fact, given that Dumbledore actually did place Harry with his relatives, it makes much more sense to assume that he had the authority to do so.

#+begin_quote
  He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable. There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone
#+end_quote

This is of course a good point. Even assuming the OP's theory is 100% true, it doesn't change the fact that Dumbledore was baiting Voldemort to attack a school.

#+begin_quote
  He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.
#+end_quote

To be completely fair, anyone with Hagrid in the forest is probably perfectly safe (and far safer than with an actual qualified wizard unless they're really exceptional.) Of course, being left with just Fang, or worse, alone, is really bad, and Hagrid is careless enough to make bad judgment calls like that, so it's still not a great idea.

Also, it's entirely possible that Dumbledore wasn't involved in this decision, which would put the primary blame on Hagrid and Filch's shoulders. (And I think McGonagall knew?) Of course, Dumbledore does maintain /some/ culpability as the headmaster, but not nearly as much as if he were directly overseeing things.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.
#+end_quote

This one's pretty bad. Even as much as I buy into the idea of Snape standing up for his own house to counteract anti-Slytherin bias and actually being a good teacher for students he likes, he really is an awful person and probably shouldn't be allowed to remain in charge of kids. To be fair, though, this makes Dumbledore more of a bad headmaster with too much trust in a coworker/friend than a Machiavellian Dark Lord.

#+begin_quote
  Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry. Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry.
#+end_quote

There probably was an inquiry. I can't imagine the Board of Directors not taking this opportunity to ream Dumbledore as much as they could. He probably tried to protect Harry from it, though, to minimize the trauma of killing someone.

#+begin_quote
  An eleven year old boy killed someone. Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children?
#+end_quote

These are in fact issues, but likely as much with the times and magical British society than with Dumbledore. Doesn't absolve him of guilt, but it makes him no more fallible than plenty of decent-ish real school administrators. Heck, it seems likely to me that therapists aren't even a thing in magical Britain at the time of the books, and the nurse probably just flat out isn't trained to recognize abused children.

#+begin_quote
  Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see the Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed.

#+end_quote

Again, you're not wrong, but you're blowing it out of proportion a bit in that bullying is (unfortunately) not uncommon, especially decades ago. Plus, there's a good chance the teachers (and possibly even Dumbledore) /were/ trying to do something about it, but were just ineffective. (Also, they were probably focused more on safety than bullying during that year.)

*** *Part 3:*

#+begin_quote
  Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore would absolutely agree with you here, but the Ministry had him outmatched.

#+begin_quote
  End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Opinions on how tightly-policed boarding schools should be clearly vary. Also, some of the staff (Umbridge) were actually in company of the students until they left. And Dumbledore wasn't even there. As for the Ministry, Dumbledore is in fact far more qualified to protect the kids personally than the entire Auror Corps, as demonstrated when he shows up and immediately defeats all of the Death Eaters before driving off Voldemort in a duel. This is probably your weakest point in this entire argument, actually.I've already talked about therapists, but the medical attention is a good (if minor, as Harry really wasn't injured much, unlike his friends who did get immediate medical attention) point.

#+begin_quote
  And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

See the OP. Although I suspect Dumbledore's views on child abuse aren't quite as enlightened and modern as we'd all like them to be (as in he doesn't think it's as bad as we do), so sure, let's criticize him for that.

#+begin_quote
  put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

Just to be picky (and make a reference), every word you just said was wrong. He put him there for his protection, a jihad is a religious crusade, Dumbledore did not want Harry to kill himself (and indeed he didn't), and to be stupidly extra picky, there were no bombs. (But more to the point, Harry wasn't allowing himself to be killed to do damage. He was allowing himself to be killed as a sacrifice to protect people, and Dumbledore set it up to the best of his ability so that Harry would survive anyway. As per the OP.)

#+begin_quote
  maliciously
#+end_quote

I don't think we define this word the same way. Because really, "maliciously" means "intending harm," or something like that, right? Dumbledore obviously did not intend harm, and in fact tried to the absolute best of his ability to (successfully) let Harry survive, defeat Voldemort, and save hundreds of lives.

#+begin_quote
  So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.
#+end_quote

I feel like I should quote Luke Skywalker again here. There's an inherent contradiction between not caring about his intentions and claiming he's evil. Not caring about the greater good is kind of ridiculous when we're talking about whether somebody is good or not. Ignoring a prophecy that is in fact correct is just stupid. And "deliberately failed said children" is as obviously wrong as "maliciously" was above.

#+end_quote

This is another decent point. The reasoning probably had something to do with the Aurors seeming lack of competence in the books, combined with a less reasonable desire to just keep the school open without causing a scandal. Also, there's every possibility there was some of this going on behind the scenes--maybe any investigators were taking Harry's statements second-hand from the teachers he had to explain things to? Again, the Board of Directors was absolutely doing /something/.

#+begin_quote
  McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is crazy. That said, again the guilt needs to be shared with the Ministry of Magic, which signed off on this too. And there's nothing technically wrong with giving a student a time machine. It may be unreasonably risky for a very small reward, but it's not in any way a bad or evil act. Plus, I expect they would have taken it away immediately if they ever found any evidence of Hermione breaking the strict rules.

#+begin_quote

Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.
#+end_quote

The second two sentences here are assumptions. Reasonable assumptions, but we don't have any evidence they're true. And even if they are, Sirius Black was, to Dumbledore's knowledge, guilty. It certainly would have been the moral paragon thing to do to push for a trial anyway (despite Crouch and probably a majority of the rest of magical Britain pushing to just throw him in Azkaban), but it's likely this wasn't illegal (however unjust the law obviously must be), and Dumbledore had no particular reason to go out of his way to give Sirius a trial when he had very strong reason to believe he was guilty.

#+begin_quote
  Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.
#+end_quote

Uh...maybe. I mean, after each incident, Dumbledore must have gotten assurances from the Ministry that it wouldn't happen again. And I think "invading the train" was actually a sanctioned search, if I remember correctly. Plus, don't forget that Dumbledore was just reinstated after 2nd year, and we know from book 5 that the Ministry could probably force Hogwarts to remain open even if Dumbledore declared it shut down. His position really wasn't very good. If he had 100% cooperation from the teachers, he would have had a ton of capital by orchestrating a strike, but it clearly wasn't the hill he wanted to die on. Not when the soul-sucking demons are legally appointed law officers with legitimate authority who supposedly only suck souls when commanded by human law officers, and he got assurances that they weren't to be allowed on school grounds, AND he and multiple other teachers were capable of forcibly ensuring that themselves if it became necessary (as it did in canon.) It reasonably wouldn't seem worth the effort.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore hired a werewolf. He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month. He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.
#+end_quote

An unbreakable vow is too harsh; killing someone for making themselves a risk is a little extreme. But that doesn't mean your point is completely wrong--he certainly should have done more to make sure Lupin took the potion. Like, at least order Snape (and probably at least one other person) to watch and make sure Lupin takes it. (He may even have done this with Snape in canon, actually.) That said, Lupin did have a track record of safe transformations at that point--he's essentially an expert at handling a dangerous weapon, and the consequence to himself for any slips is probably death, so it's not unreasonable to trust him to stay safe.Your sex offender analogy weakens your argument in my opinion, if only because the crime is so inane and the response so over-the-top.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.

Illegal and somewhat unsafe for the children, but not actually the wrong thing to do. And it wasn't even /that/ unsafe, given the Dementors weren't usually actively dangerous, Lupin being a werewolf shouldn't have been an issue given the other precautions he, Snape, and Dumbledore were taking, and (crucially) Dumbledore sent them back from the future, so he already had evidence that they'd be fine.

#+begin_quote
  The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.
#+end_quote

A major oversimplification. Football has a death toll. Still happens. As do many other sports. Plus, the contest was supposed to be safer than when people died in the past, Dumbledore (again) doesn't have complete control over the school and may not have been able to stop the Ministry-organized and sanctioned contest even if he wanted to, and it seems that some (stupid) quirk of the magic of the Goblet means Dumbledore couldn't have done anything more for Harry once he was a contestant.

#+begin_quote
  A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job.
#+end_quote

On bullying, see above. Again, you're not wrong, but it's not quite as big an issue as you're making it out to be. And with Snape, I expect that some of it is an (unfortunately common) tendency for teachers to assume students are exaggerating with complaints against unliked teachers, or just not report at all. Especially since many of their complaints against Snape are actually over-the-top or flat-out incorrect.

#+begin_quote
  Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors?

Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.
#+end_quote

The Minister of Magic was also there, right? Or did he just show up later? (Which would have meant somebody called him.) As well as many other Ministry personnel. It's more their job than Dumbledore's. Especially when he was seeing to the safety of his student and running the school amid the uproar. Aurors probably did show up eventually, but we already got the scene of Harry explaining what happened and the scene of the Minister not believing him, so why waste time with a formal police interview that adds nothing to the story? And again, therapists not existing is not Dumbledore's fault.

Correction--Dumbledore is ensuring that an innocent man not have his soul sucked out of his body. He is helping a man escape from very unjust laws.

Dumbledore drew an Age Line so that only students of age, that is, legal adults could cross the line to put their names into the Goblet of Fire. He only wanted adults to be in the Tournament. He also saw the opportunity to mend bridges with the International community--and had things gone as he had envisioned, those bridges would have been.

Crouch's impersonation of Moody threw him for a loop, and why shouldn't it? More to the point, he is not the least bit happy about Harry being entered, but he also knows that he can't just undo everything.

Trelawney is an incompetent twit, nobody disputes that.

Fudge is there. So is Bagman. Possibly other Ministry officials, given that Fudge is able to summon a Dementor.

Harry's physical injuries were healed by Fawkes--possibly at Dumbledore's direction.

#+end_quote

It was early evening--as in not curfew yet--when Harry and his friends resolved to go to London to rescue Sirius. There was no question of students being out of bed in the climax of the fifth book.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore wasn't even at the school--he had been driven away by Fudge and Umbridge. And by the time he gets word of what happened, it's been hours. He goes immediately to fix the problem himself instead of alerting the Aurors because who knows how long that will take?

#+begin_quote
  After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Harry was not physically injured enough to need medical attention. The others were and were sent straight to Madam Pomfrey.

Dumbledore tells Harry the truth of the prophecy because he realizes that if he doesn't do it /now,/ he'll lose Harry forever, and that this should have been done long ago.

Harry is demanding answers. Dumbledore agrees that he has the right to know.

#+begin_quote
  And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

The Dursleys suck, but Dumbledore also acknowledges that what they did to Dudley was worse. Which is also what would have happened had Harry gone anywhere else.

#+begin_quote
  I'll say it again for those who missed it - Dumbledore had one fucking job as Headmaster of a boarding school and he failed at every level. Even worse he ~maliciously~ groomed students to become suicide bombers.
#+end_quote

No, Dumbledore inspired his students to fight for justice. To fight the Dark Arts and those who practice them.

#+begin_quote
  So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.
#+end_quote

In most instances, he did as good a job as he could have, given that he did not have the benefit of hindsight. And he was opposed by the government at every turn, which only goes to prove that even a fictional government destroys everything it touches.

**** I love your whole comment, but I do have to comment on this part, unless I somehow missing the context of your response.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He does, doesn't he? "The Aurors on on their way" is exactly what Dumbledore tells Voldemort, and then obviously moments later they show up.

#+begin_quote
  “Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with amazement. “You --- here --- I --- I ---”

  He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him, and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, “Seize him!”
#+end_quote

It seems as though Fudge and the Aurors are there as a response to this emergency, and not for their regular work day.

I suppose we could say that Dumbledore himself might not have called the Aurors but that someone else did, but then still it would be one of the Order under Dumbledore's leadership. Or else we could say that there's an automatic security system that called the Aurors and have even less reason to blame Dumbledore, specifically.

He also does not go immediately to the Ministry either, but stays to question Kreacher. While this could appear like the wrong choice, I think it shows that Dumbledore insists on being well-informed so he does not make a mistake. (I also don't imagnie that interogating Kreacher took more than a few minutes anyway).

But I love your entire comment. The original comment is kind of funny, because there's really nothing Dumbledore can do right, is there? Blaming him for telling Harry about the prophecy that night? Did they not read that chapter or something and see that Harry would not fair well if Dumbledore had waited until the morning? Ah well...

  McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.
#+end_quote

It seems a common practice - Hagrid is mad at Harry, Ron, and Hermione for dropping his class in HBP and then when they are making up, he admits that even with Time Turners, their schedules would be too full, and Hermione says they'd destroyed all of them so they couldn't have used Time Turners to take Care of Magical Creatures anyway.

Anyway, amusing read. I always like seeing assumptions made about the rules of the Wizarding World.
