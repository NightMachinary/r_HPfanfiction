I found the link via DLP [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=4005&highlight=Teeth][here]], apparently it was deleted from ff.net. I'd like to read it and I was hoping that someone has a link to it or copied it.


** Do you know why it was deleted? If the author took it down, then there's Rule #6 to think about...

*** No idea, I never got to read it in the first place nor did I look at the author's page; so I don't know what the reasoning for removing it was.

** I honestly thought you meant linkffn(9406877) for a second and had a tiny moment of panic. Oh boy.

The fic you're actually looking for seems familiar to me, but I can't say I know why it was taken down. It does seem like a few people saved and archived copies of it further down in the thread you linked, so it seems possible you may be able to find one if you ask around some.
