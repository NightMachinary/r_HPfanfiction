Hi guys, I am brand new to the Drarry ship. I've read mostly Dramione. I love dark and long fics. But seriously any fic recs are welcome. For reference, I've read and liked The Auction, Manacled and The Fallout for Dramione. Any like those but for Drarry would be AMAZING!


** I've been reading both ships for the first time this year, and I still find it kind of funny that so many of the top stories for Draco/Hermione are dark, angsty war AUs and so many of the top stories for Draco/Harry seem to be fluffy comedies. Thus far, I'd say my personal favorite has been [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn by Saras_Girl]] which isn't quite so dark but is certainly long. An adult Harry gets a glimpse of how his life might have been if things had gone a little differently, and everything spirals from there.

** I really like this one, mostly for the magical house, but it's Drarry and really well written. The author's other fics are also really well written and also Drarry.
