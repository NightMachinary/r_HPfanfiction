*** Yup, this fic's Harry overcompensating to convince us he's hard, and just comes off as an unlikable yob. Cut down on the edgelord shit and they might have a decent fic.

** Is this a crackfic? I don't want to insult you, OP. But in the first paragraph you state that you're going to 'hit me with some knowledge' as if you just finished watching some rapping show and now you believe you're a rapper.

I also stopped reading at 'Surprised, motherfuckers?'
