For me, it's The Cursed Child (For obvious reasons), The Deathly Hallows, because there were more plot holes than a number of holes in swiss cheese. The writing was worse than the previous book too. And finally The Half-Blood Prince. I feel like it spawned millions of bad, cliche Jealous Hermione/Bitch Hermione fics. The characters felt off as well. In my head canon, neither of these books, are canon.

It was all according to Dumbledore's plan:

“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”

My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

** Ignoring CC, from 3rd worst to worst:

- 3: Chamber of Secrets - Chamber was just a let down for me. It somehow was consistently unbelievable, annoying, and is the book that made me start hating Dumbledore as a character (which only got worse as the series went on to my great sadness). Looking back I don't think its that bad, but since it was the 2nd in the series I expected more, and compared to the next in the series (Prisoner of Azkaban) its utter rubbish. .

- 2: Half Blood Prince - I don't know... I just... didn't enjoy myself. The series began moving in a direction that no longer sucked me in but spit me out. Plot choices were made that I felt were done by an author who had gotten bored and was just patching holes trying to not have the ship sink. It definitely had its stellar moments but I cant forgive or forget some of the plot choices.

- 1: Deathly Hallows - It just felt rushed, and full of holes. There were so many things that concluded in ways I hated (like the relationships) and I was left completely unsatisfied which was only made worse because it was the finale. I almost quit reading half way through and that is saying something.

** Every book after Order of the Phoenix was bad for me.

HBP had to much angst and made Harry look paranoid as well as made Draco go from a bully and brat to a emo weakling.

DH had some good fights but was more filler to me and didn't do what others seemed to do and made Voldemort and his side OP then lets them get their asses kicked by a school of students and the remains of the Order.

CC was just trash and seemed more like lame fanfiction on par with a beta read Fifty Shades of Grey. Personally I never figured Harry would name his kid after a man who plotted his death and a man who basically handed over his fathers life and his in hopes of hooking up with his mom.

For me the whole series went from cannon to fanfiction from book 5 to Make a Wish. Linkffn(2318355)

** Cursed Child doesn't count, but if it did it would be at the top of the list.

Otherwise, my least favorites are Chamber of Secrets, Sorcerers Stone and Deathly Hallows.

CoS and SS are great kid books, but they're rather shallow and boring compared to later entries in the series. They don't have the length, emotion or quality of writing that the later books have. Whenever I'm rereading I'm excited to get to Prisoner of Azkaban, because that marked a change in tone and depth of content that really made the world and characters come alive.

Deathly Hallows is very frustrating compared to the previous books, and it lacks a lot of the whimsy and magic that made the setting so inviting. The plot is also weaker than the previous books, and the Deathly Hallows themselves were an unexciting plot device.

** 1. Deathly Hallows: Ruins the Magic of the story with attempts at being Dark Fantasy and it just flops. At times it takes itself too seriously and at other times it doesn't take things serious enough. I felt like with all the loss Harry has been through, he would have learnt some cool new spells, but instead, we're relegated to seeing the same boring things happen over and over again, with his wand saving him as a plot device twice instead of the usual once per book. I could write an essay, but I'll just say that it wasn't a good send-off, and as the hype died down around it, I feel everyone agreed on it.

2. Goblet of Fire: Harry is finally put into a dangerous situation where he has foresight into it, I thought as I read his name coming out of the Goblet to bated breath in the Great Hall. I expected him to panic, I expected him to use this as fuel to learn more Magic than he has ever learned, to learn as many Spells as he could to survive. Instead, Harry is as reactionary as ever, allowing the plot to hit him when it's convenient and nearly getting his ass kicked by Voldemort. What follows after is Harry not learning in the slightest and continuing to be a Hot Head who doesn't learn from his actions. I'm not so much as upset with the book itself, as I'm upset that it started the trend of Bad Books.

3. Order Of The Phoenix: Straight out of the blue, Harry is put in a war, now watch as he trains everyone except for himself with the DA for no reason because he is the only one that actually needs to fight Voldemort. So we get a lot of angst and sadness at the world from Harry before finally getting a really Epic Duel at the end between two of the most powerful Wizards in the series. Admittedly it was a slow duel, but the Magic was enough to keep you interested.

Special Mentions to HPB and CC, because it's more of the same BS I pointed out, and re-writing the same thing would be redundant.

** (Most Despised to least despised) (worst 3 or 4 depending on whether you consider CC canon)

The Cursed Child is an abomination. It can't and shouldn't be considered canon. It's a terrible fanon of life after the end of war. Considering CC can't be canon.

The Deathly Hallows was just overly drawn out. I mean shorten the stupid camping trips. I don't give a shit that they are cooking or setting up the tent. Just give interesting snippets of the camping and snippets of what is happening everywhere else. To much filler. To many plot holes.

The Half-Blood Prince Is just the mourning book of the series. Godfather that he barely knew died so am going to be an angsty emo kid. Hermione gives more shits about Harry using a book with better instructions than their friendship. Ron = side character. Ginny = Sudden emotional interest out of no where. (Barely mentioned in the rest of the series but becomes a main character in the last 2 books).

The Order of the Phoenix. The place where J.k. Rowling started running out of ideas, making and leaving previous plot holes still open, making characters idiots. E.g. I have a communication mirror, maybe I should use that instead of a floo. I am the great Dumbledore, maybe I shouldn't be afraid of looking a kid in the eyes. Snape, knows Harry won't understand hint, still hints about black being safe in a shity way. This is where JK Rowling started writing noticeably worse.

** I find it very odd that most people's least favourite book seems to be Half-Blood Prince, it's my favourite in the entire series. I suppose it just depends really on what you like in your books? I can very easily see why you wouldn't like it very much if you read mainly for plot, and obviously while you do need a good one, my favourite thing is usually just learning more about characters and them interacting with each other so the chapters of Harry and Dumbledore going through the memories and then talking about them afterwards were some of my favourites.

My least favourites (not including cursed child, which I read the beginning of, discovered all the spoilers were true and then stopped in disgust) are probably Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Order of the Phoenix. Philosopher's Stone is a great introduction to the series and I love it dearly but compared to the later books in the series, it is still definitely a children's book and hasn't aged very well in comparison when it comes to older readers. I have the same feelings about Chamber of Secrets, though I do think this one had the worst plot too, it's definitely my least favourite book and film of the lot. Usually when I'm rereading or rewatching the films, I just skip these two and start with Prisoner of Azkaban. The main problem I have the Order of the Phoenix is that it's just too long - JK Rowling did say herself that she didn't do her normal edit to cut it down when she finished that one and that if she could go back and make it shorter she would. There was just a lot of tangents I didn't care about, especially the stuff about Grawp, those are my least favourite parts of the entire series. I didn't hate 'emo' Harry as everyone else seems to be calling him, I thought it was a pretty in-character reaction for someone who has gone through so much shit but then is being treated as if he's some child that needs to kept safe all of sudden.

2. Half-Blood Prince. While many like the Draco storyline in this book, I felt Harry's obsession with it off-putting and boring. Also, the whole Ron/Hermione fiasco was silly. I felt like the book just dragged on and on from one plot point to the next with no real direction. The only saving grace in this book was Dumbledore's memories of Voldemort. Even the battle at the end didn't do anything for me.

3. Deathly Hallows. Like many users stated already, it was full of plot holes and unnecessary angst. In addition, that awful, awful epilogue was a piece of trash JK Rowling found in the sewers of London, and decided to staple in at the end. Terrible ending.

Idk why but I never liked CoS much. I always got pissed off that Harry wouldn't go tell Dumbledore "I'm hearing strange threatening voices in the walls before each new student gets attacked, oh and I found this weird diary that writes back to me."

I don't like reading PS that much anymore since Harry is too young for me to get invested. PoA is ok but just nothing really special to me and OotP just felt too long. Plus emo Harry got on my nerves.

** Alright. Not counting Cursed Child (otherwise move everything else back):

#3: Goblet of Fire. Might be fanfiction bias, but fuck me has the fanfiction scene spoiled my enjoyment for this book. Ron goes cliché mode despite the fact he should know better, Cho lust, a lack of focus on Sirius (who IMO should've been pretty much the main focus other than Harry, simply because I don't really know, actually. I guess because compared to OotP way too much of the bonding between the two happens offscreen).

#2: Philosopher's Stone. It's what introduced us to the series, but it's like Red/Blue/Yellow in that it feels way too simplistic and lackluster compared to its following sequels. I appreciate thwt the reader's meant to age with the series, but now that it's been 20 years that really doesn't work past the first read.

#1: Chamber of Secrets. Pretty much feels like a repeat of PS, with nothing really new and worth rereading for, minus the title scene near the end of the book.

** I haven't ever rad CS, so I won't count it.

1. DH. They were out of Hogwarts and finally able to take part in the secret guerilla war that's broken out, and instead we get camping, Hermione and Ron questioning Harry's leadership skills /again/, and nothing about the war in itself, except from a short radio programme and the grand finale.

2. HBP. I really did like this one the first time I read it: things finally seem to be going Harry's way, Hermione becoming more human (she's always been the voice of reason, and not much more than that, at least since after Lockhart was fired), and the fleshing out of other characters, like Ginny and even Voldemort. Then there are things that simply don't rhyme anymore: Did Smith forget about Ron's third game the year before? Why would Hermione and Ron simply discard his suspicions about Malfoy? Why didn't Snape and Dumbledore help Malfoy, considering that Snape /swore/ to do so? Why didn't the ministry catch more DEs or stop the infiltration?

3. CoS. I don't really mind this one, but I happen to like PS, GoF OotP and PoA more. I like that this book builds on the prejudice from the previous books, but I don't really like how the teachers didn't stop the Heir of Slytherin rumours, but then again, Hogwarts treatment of bullying does leave a lot to be desired. (Also, Fudge should have seen throught Malfoy's obvious evil behaviour in Hagrid's hut.)

** If cursed child counts then, it has the first place. I don't like the plot, I don't like that they made Ron act like a fool. Next will be Half-Blood Prince because the characters acted rather OOC. Voldemort's story is fine but not enough to fill the whole book and in HBP Harry and Ginny romance started and for me, those parts are almost unreadable. And then Order of the Pheonix because Sirius died.

** (It's been a while since I've read these, so they might not be completely accurate...) Cursed Child doesn't really count, as JKR didn't write it, IIRC. The worst for me would be:

- Chamber of Secrets - It's just...meh. Doesn't compare to the greatness of the other books. Plot didn't do much for me.

- Order of the Phoenix - OOC Harry, and Umbridge seems more evil than Voldemort.

- Deathly Hallows - I don't think it was necessarily rushed like others are saying - quite the opposite, in fact. Way too much filler. The battle/ending were great. Epilogue was not so great, but yeah.

Lupin asks Hermione if she checked the lunar chart and realized he was always ill at the full moon or did she realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw him. Hermione replies with, "Both." And that's when he tells her that she's the cleverest witch of her age that he'd ever met. It's flattery in a sense, but not in the way of him being biased for her.

*********** But if Remus is trying to get Hermione onto his side, how is that biased? All he did was make a comment on how clever Hermione was in that she pieced together that he was a werewolf through means in which other students weren't able to. That's not him being biased; that's him showing flattery at Hermione's cleverness. Besides, how can you say that "he was only trying to get her to his side"? I understand in where you are going with it, but that's not what happened at all in the book. Remus is a good character, meaning that he fights for the good side (Order of the Phoenix). In addition, Hermione is good too (fighting through Dumbledore's Army, something that was of her own creation). There's no need for him to be biased to her (which he isn't), as they are on the same side in vying for Harry to defeat Voldemort.

What I meant by getting her on his side: Sirius Black was considered as the man who betrayed Harry's parent and is trying to kill Harry. Remus, is at this moment the only one who believe Sirius (because he saw Pettigrew on the map). And Hermione guessed that Remus was a werewolf. All those three fact mean that they are actually two side (both goods) one with Sirius and Remus and one with Ron, Hermione and Harry. When I say getting her on his side, I mean getting her to believe Sirius innocence, and that's why he has to flatter her.
