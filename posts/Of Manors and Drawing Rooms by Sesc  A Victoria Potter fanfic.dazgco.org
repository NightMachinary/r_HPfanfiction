Well, this is a first for me.

Sesc has written a fanfic in the Victoria Potter universe. It's an AU take on Victoria's time at Malfoy Manor during Christmas of Second Year, with tone and elements inspired by Ellory's Jane Austen-esque "Pureblood Culture" series.

Needless to say, I am immensely flattered.

For those of you not familiar with Sesc, he is the author of (inter alia) Unatoned, a masterpiece in the noir style. FFN profile:
