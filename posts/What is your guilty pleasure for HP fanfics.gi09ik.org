** Domestic fluff. Just watching how these characters work in situations with no stakes and what people do with them is more interesting than forced plot circumstances for drama.

*** Yup. Sometimes, you just want to see the characters in situations with no drama or conflict.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]]. I know it's objectively bad. I comment when people recommend it(I'm not recommending it by the way) to let others know of its flaws. Yet somehow, I still read it and eagerly await each chapter. When I read, I critique every line and every plot point (though they're not common - it has abysmal pacing). A guilty pleasure, through and through.

*** Objectively bad? I've seen it recced a few times (I've never read it myself though) and people seem to be singing it's praises

**** 2 million words and third year isn't over yet. 11 year olds thinking about women in the context of sex at all at all times. Capitalization used incorrectly. Slytherin dynamics where children physically attack each other over house points with some weird power intrigue that's only entertaining if you're really good at suspending disbelief. The character arcs repeat with regards to Ron's relationships with his friends and family.

** Harry grows up in a loving family and brother/sister.

Reading about harry going on adventures with his siblings and his parents are always fun to read

** Harry/Lily Evans

It's like, /REALLY/ guilty pleasure but I somehow manage to like it, sadly most of that pairing is smut sooo..

Yes I know incest isnt supposed to be a thing but for fucks sake why do you have to describe her as a redheaded goddess like female..

Also powerful Harry or timetravel Harry

** Dumbledore!bashing, coupled with Weasleys!bashing, for some reason.

And oh, those 'Dumbledore and Molly signing a marriage contract to make Harry marry Ginny' fics. Bonus points if Gold-digger!Molly and Ginny are included.

One more: After Harry offs Voldemort, once the prophecy comes to light, the Minister for Magic puts Harry on trial on trumped up charges like 'not taking care of You-Know-Who within an appropriate time period' and drains the Potter coffers of /every/ Galleon, Sickle and Knut. Years later, Harry comes back with a vengeance 'Count of Monte Cristo' style.

  I remember this is only one chapter with the Ministry declaring the Potter coffers forfeit and just ends there.
