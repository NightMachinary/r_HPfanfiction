Are there any stories where Harry joins Voldemort at the end of the TWT. The only preferences I have about the story(but by all means I won't mind if you ignore a couple of them apart from the word count) is when Harry joins, he doesn't take the dark mark, and if possible Voldemort either sees him as an equal(whether, because Harry actually is or not I leave to you), and that Harry is granted the highest of privileges(meaning second to only Voldemort), and if possible Wormtail gets his just desserts, lastly could the story have at least 40k+ words, and preferably, but not required, be complete.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** is there a fic that fulfills the above criteria and doesn't have slash or harem?

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

From what I recall (and I don't recall much), this one had Harry joining Voldemort (sort of), and a spectacular plot twist at the end. It had a half-finished sequel, too.

Eh, not really. I saw it coming and I know I'm not the only one. I really wanted this to be a "Voldemort is actually the good guy" story but instead it was what it is. I didn't care for it by the end and never read the sequel.
