It's canon that there are magical diseases and illnesses. Some examples include dragon pox and spattergroit. However, fanfiction can be terribly creative with the emphasis generally on 'terribly.' What is the best or worse example of a wizarding ailment you've come across in fanfiction?

For extra credit, come up with an illness of your own.


** I forget the particulars, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117317/5/The-List][The List]], Harry has the incurable, fatal disease known as Succorbentis (what a stupid name) that eventually leads to madness and suicide/death. The victim's magic turns against the body and they can no longer use magic without harming themselves and progressing the disease. Lives can be prolonged by some sort of chemotherapy inspired treatment that is extremely painful.

Why did the author inflict this on Harry? To make friends and nice characters behave meanly and to make villains and enemies into friends. To simplify it, to get Draco and Harry into bed.

My fanfiction illness is [[http://healthh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gardner-syndrome-pictures-2.jpg][Cystic Pearl Opalescent Wombat]], or CPOW. It's pronounced "ka-pow" and although the name is clunky, it reveals some pertinant information. CPOW is a disease usually found in Wizarding Australia. Susceptible wizards and witches who come in contact with the dung of a carrier Wigaloo Wombat are affected for approximately three to seven moon cycles. They produce large, bony, immovable lumps that eventually work itself free from the body. These pearls are pretty to look at, but next to useless. Their only known function is in a male leg hair voluminizer potion (Gilderoy Lockhart was rumored to have been poisoned with it by a jealous rival just after his second Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award). It's an unsightly affliction but relatively harmless and time-limited.

** I haven't seen any of the awful fanon examples you mentioned, but I'll keep an eye out in the future.

For the extra credit, I'll admit to writing an outline for an unpublished story that involved Draco Malfoy contracting a magical STI from a Hogwarts Thestral. There was only the barest hint of the disease's source and certainly no graphic material. I really dislike his character so I wanted to bash him a little bit. Not my finest moment.

What does everyone else think of JKR's assertion that wizards/witches are immune to Muggle illnesses?

**** From Pottermore's final chapters on GoF:

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after meeting with Fenrir Greyback.
#+end_quote

Her blithely waving a magic wand over human immunology makes me cringe a bit, but I can follow her logic.

***** Ironically, I find it completely logical. Perhaps I've been in this fandom for too long, but this all seems kind of self evident, aside from wizards being naturally hardier than muggles. Magical injuries are of course going to be harder to heal than mundane injuries, because magical injuries have foreign magic fighting against the healing, especially in the case of dark magic. Hit somebody with a /diffindo/, and you'll cut them. Hit them with a Sectumsempra, and unless you know the specific countercurse to that spell, they'll scar if they're lucky, and bleed out if they aren't. Bill Weasley is scarred for much the same reason, the werewolf curse is inert unless the attacker is in a transformed state. He scarred because Greyback was partially transformed, and there was enough magic in the saliva to fight against the healing.

And this is probably fanon, but didn't Mrs Lovegood's spell not just go wrong, but go /explosively/ wrong? Even wizards aren't immune to concussive force, which is arguably a mundane cause of death.

**** Is there any canon basis for the generally accepted fanon that wizards live much longer than muggles? My guess would be no, simply because of the range of possible ages, from an expectation of living a maximum of 150 years to some fics where wizards can live to be over 300.

***** Well, Aunt Muriel was 107 and seemed to be somewhat lively. Bagshot was even older, as Muriel was a little girl when the Albus/Grindelwald thing went down. Griselda Marchbanks also probably was approaching 130 or older, and still working, and I highly doubt that'd be possible for a normal person.

I think its safe to say that magicals are at least healthier in old age than muggles, and probably live a little bit longer on average.

Additionally, the oldest known wizard in 1991 was [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Barry_Wee_Willie_Winkle][755.]]

While it's only three examples, it seems that magicals have the potential to vastly outlive muggles.

***** I think there were some early interviews where JK Rowling said Dumbledore was around 300 years old, and that's where the concept comes from. Or maybe she said he was 150 and wizards could possibly live to 300. I definitely recall reading that she wanted the natural wizard lifespan to be roughly twice that of a muggle.

But those were long ago and she revised it down before actually putting anything in the books that could pinpoint his age.

****** Yes! This is the interview I recalled, specifically this question:

#+begin_quote
  Question: How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  J.K. Rowling: Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure she also revised McGonagall's age downwards when her original timeline would have had McGonagall in school with Voldemort.

*** I don't think that it's very plausible. If magic is a kind of hereditary gene mutation, like Down's syndrome which alters the chromosomes, then wizards would still be affected by Muggle illnesses but in a different way. Also, because of their unique genetic makeup, they would suffer from weaknesses long eradicated by Muggle medicine, or simply non-existent to Muggles, which creates the illusion of having magical illnesses.

So wizards who frequent the back rooms of shady bars may not have AIDS, but brightly coloured boils sprouting from the expected area. They call it Nymph's Wrath.

Another explanation could be that the ambient magic in their surroundings protect/mutate muggle diseases, so that's why Muggle-borns still remember having mumps or flu when they were young, but may contract dragon pox in school.

I'll admit to drafting a story in which the Death Eaters were a group of Pureblood elitists suffering from serious Muggle diseases- it was a blast to research. Voldemort had lupus, the Malfoys had Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, and Snape was afflicted with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

Gah! Don't be logical! Can't apply Muggle logic to magic!

The idea of Voldemort succumbing to a Muggle illness is lovely! Extra lovely if it could be cured/managed with dirty Muggle medicine- I once read a story where diabetes did him in.

***** logic... yeah when you can create drinkable water from nothing, increase mass of things, vanish things into non-being or you know any of the magic we see like bone regrowing or mending then anything is game.

I am very much against witches and wizard having muggle diseases, getting them I suppose is possible (though unlikely due to lack of contact), but curing them should be easy. We know there are dreamless sleep potions, pepper up may be the cure for the common cold. In everything we see magic does override the mundane and I don't think that should change for health/diseases.

More to the point I honestly think it takes away from the story, and magic of the world, to inflict muggle diseases. It smacks of the stories where they never use magic in the first place. Magic should be used to solve everything. Wet clothes? hot air charm, broke a plate? reparo, dog piss on the carpet? vanish and/or scourgify etc. these are bad examples, but so many problems we encounter could be fixed with magic. Generally stories that reinforce muggle stuff take me out of the world. It should be more magical, not less. Introduce problems of a magical nature that can't be, or are tough to fix via magic. Sometimes the muggled issues seem very minor, but what they communicate is that magic isn't all that great (a major problem for me). ex. I read a story where muggle shoes were totally better. I'm not sure why that would be with magic you could surely make them softer/more cushioned, fitted better, probably 'worked in' so no getting blisters from new shoes, maybe warmer or more breezy- they at should at least have magical materials for that and more. The day to day muggle problems really shouldn't be a problem imo.

Not always. Moody's prosthetic leg is a wooden stump, even though his eye is amazing. Nobody suggests that Harry get magical contacts so that his glasses don't fall off during Quidditch or world-saving. Slughorn claims to suffer from some type of rheumatism. And their treatment of mental health, especially for children, is downright awful (though comparable to ours probably 100 years ago).
