/A/n: I decided to bring y'all this prompt after giving a whole speech to the mirror about it./

The character, muggle-born or heir of an ancient and noble house dies and is thrown to the past with not objective at all, but they know, in their first life they were an outsider who never interfered in anything of interest. They have a whole bunch of ideas of how to reform the magic world and its politics and since they are no one, this time they are not losing the chance to do a change.

The first thing they do is go to Gringotts for an inheritance test to see if they have a match with some prominent house or even family in the magic world. Goblins are skeptical when they result to be the last member of an ancient house that everyone believed extinct; this can result in two ways, the character decides to use the power of the family name or hides it until it can be politically active.

Since the ministry noticed their magic, they receive a letter to assist to Hogwarts. (And if you are asking where the character is living, I'll let you decide it).

In Hogwarts, the character ends up in Slytherin (or another house if it fits better on your fic), where they start to build up their way into politics. Muggleborn or not, the character attracts the attention of prominent names because of their controversial ideas of reforming everything:

​

- The introduction to the magic world.
- Culture and Traditions; get classes about it.
- Bloodlines and theories of how they work; with this, they introduce genetics to everyone (Example: Why and how muggle-borns appear and why Squibs are the reason). This opens the door to pureblood families realizing their inbreeding is actually what causes the apparition of Squibs, their lack of new genes causes their children to have recessive magic genes.\\
- Creatures and their rights. No one realizes how much power they can get if they give basic rights to them.
- Different kinds of magic, witches, and wizards.
- Implementation of laws to enforce/permit the free practice of rituals, beliefs, and arts.
- Gods, Goddess, and prayers.
- Enforce the separation of the magic world and the muggle world but introduce the actual information, studies, careers, and more that the magic world lacks.
- Let squibs keep contact with the magic world and influence them to get into politics or careers that will help the magic world to remain as secret and safe as possible.
- Introduce child protective services to keep all children safe from abusive guardians. This is something that would prevent children to grow resented with the world itself and is something that no one talks about.
- Reviews and proficiency exams for professors and directors of magic schools.
- Higher education advice. (A/n: This is something I noticed we usually forget in fics).

​

/A/n: As someone that likes to read novel-size fics, when the fics introduce this kind of topic I know it's going to be good. All of this together helps with world construction too./

/Also, if y'all have some fic recommendation similar to this, comment it, please./


** i mean for the magical world to ge into the higher education, it kinda needs to have a larger population, the system they have in place kinda works the same, eg to become an auror, you need certain grades and undergo training in laws and spells to become an effective one.
