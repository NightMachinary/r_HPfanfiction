Hi all, I am looking for a fic that I read earlier this month about an SI or OC of some sorts that creates a space station to escape the trace involving a vanishing cabinet. I also recall that in the end he [[/spoiler][used a the base to fire a laser down upon the death eaters spoiler]] Edit: Sorry about the messed up syntax on the spoiler tag, I edited it a couple of times until I figured out what I was doing wrong with the tag


** Che... I feel like this is something by Esama, but i'm not sure.

*** Esama has a fic about a spaceship but it's not an SI/OC fic and doesn't really involve Death Eaters. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346]])
