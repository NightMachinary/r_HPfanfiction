Are there any ok or good fics where a sentient Hogwarts plays a large role in the plot or affects other characters storylines and development?

I prefer complete.

Don't care about shipping or bashing.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.

** linkffn(The Merging) Definitely not the focus of the story, but features a sentient Hogwarts that heavily adds Harry's development in the middle part of the story. Phenomenal fic all around I think.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847]])

A complete Hermione-centric time-travel fic. Hogwarts sends her back to prevent the carnage of the final battle and regularly communicates with her through the Room of Requirement and a house-elf. I never got around to finishing it, but it's well-written, it does drag on a bit though.
