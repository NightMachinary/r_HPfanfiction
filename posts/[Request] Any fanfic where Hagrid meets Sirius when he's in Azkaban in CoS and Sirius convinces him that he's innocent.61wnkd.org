Was reading a fic the other day which mentioned Hagrid's stint in Azkaban in CoS, which got me thinking, what if he had been in a cell next to Sirius' or something, and Sirius had managed to convince him of his innocence. As we all know, Hagrid's a pretty good guy, and I get the feeling he had trouble ever truly believing Sirius had actually betrayed the Potter's, except for the overwhelming evidence against him. (Or at least what counts as evidence in the Wizarding world.)

Not entirely sure where you would go from there that isn't just the stock Sirius raises Harry trope. Maybe a fic parodying the Harry-goes-to-Azkaban-then-breaks-out-with-Sirius trope where Hagrid hadn't been released for whatever reason, and then broke out of Azkaban with Sirius, hijinks and misadventures ensue a la Fugitives of Azkaban. Except better, because Hagrid isn't capable of any kind of subtlety.


** You know, I'm also half surprised that Hagrid didn't come home with a pet dementor he named Binky or something.

** I too, want this now.

I wonder...suppose a slight change in Chamber of Secrets: when Fudge comes with a couple of aurors (instead of Dumbledore) to haul Hagrid away, Harry (under the invisibility cloak as per canon) is caught in his company, and Lucius catching up to them (after serving dismissal papers to Dumbledore in his office convinces Fudge that the parselmouth Harry is obviously suspect as well.

With Hagrid and Harry both tossed into Azkaban, they run into Sirius, who explains how he was never tried, is innocent, Peter's behind it (and who knows where he is), et-cetera.

They team up to break out, while /all/ of the Weasleys team up to break in, Dumbledore sends a disguised Fawkes, Dobby has enough and starts working on a little sabotage...

...I jest. To my knowledge, considering Sirius Black died at 36 (thanks to Bellatrix), and that he was sent to Azkaban some 14 years before that, he might be one of the youngest wizards to ever be sent there. I don't know if any school-age witches or wizards have been sent to Azkaban in canon.

******* It would be 1 year, since wizard are 17 before they start their final year at school, I think, making him turn 18 either during his final year or shortly afterwords, so he would turn 19 around a year after he finished Hogwarts, at most. If he had a birthday really early in the year like Hermione, he could have conceivably been fresh out of Hogwarts (~three months) when he was caught.

Also, that's I really interesting idea. Wonder what would have happened if he hadn't been caught with the Death Eaters?

** Sirius was likely in the area for high risk inmates.

Hagrid, as wild and dangerous as he looks, is well known by all as a rather harmless wandless woodsman. He was likely in a minimum security area.

You do know that Hagrid is responsible for hatching and raising Aragog, hatching baby Norbeta, breeding Blast-Ended Skrewts, smuggling a small giant across the country, handling hippogriffs and thestrals and ridiculously oversized pumpkins, and beating a squad of (admittedly incompetent) Aurors (and Umbridge) despite being outnumbered five to one, with his bare hands?

**** We know this, others likely don't, otherwise he'd be long gone.

It really seems like the majority of people don't even know he's half-giant either as Draco, bastion of "excellent" breeding, would have instantly mentioned and verbally pilloried him for it during his and harry's first meeting.

And please don't use events out of order as part of your arguments when discussing a fixed point in time.

*** Yes but no. At that point, he's in Azkaban because everyone thinks he is the Heir of Slytherin and was putting up a front when pretending to be harmless. You do /not/ lock the Heir of Slytherin in a low-security area.

**** Fudge may have been a fucking moron but one would think that career law enforcement personnel would listen to advice from Dumbledore who would likely pass along something like "the Minister wants him there. I know he's not guilty, Amelia."

"Of course, Headmaster. We'll keep him in the low security area until this is all cleared up."

"Amelia, please, you're no longer my student. It's Albus."

The tips of her ears pinkened as she nodded, once again guilty of falling back into a heavily ingrained role.

Albus said goodday then pulled his head out of the fire.
