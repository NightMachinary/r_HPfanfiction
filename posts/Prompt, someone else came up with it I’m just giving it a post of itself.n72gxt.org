I never like the 'JKR is Skeeter' theory, but another witch who actually hates Rita Skeeter? Definitely!

Here is my version/prompt:

The Harry Potter series is a disinformation campaign and propaganda piece initiated by Hermione Granger, but ultimately approved by Harry Potter. Its main purpose was to test Muggles' reaction to the concept of magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded their most optimistic expectation. Not only did most Muggles like the story, but many of them would even flash wands in the public, and things got a lot safer for real wizards. Furthermore, they made billions of Pounds off those gullible Muggles.

In the real version however, the line between good and evil was far more murky. The real Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power). The winners of war simply bashed him into oblivion.

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World. Their key conflict was how Wizarding Britain should be governed. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn the Ministry into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books so fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war. His chief lieutenant Bellatrix Lestrange was indeed a fanatic and sadistic warrior, but on the other hand, Frank Longbottom was the Order's chief henchmen who had killed and tortured many Death Eaters.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Wizard Britain, silenced most critics, and used propaganda heavily to legitimize their cause. To their credits, the overall living standard and opportunities for the masses have significantly improved under their rule, and they did eventually earn their legitimacy.


** Honestly if I ever went back in time, buy the location of hogwarts from the films, buy and build the Leaky cauldron, publish Harry Potter under the name of Roy E, Guild, and hire people to hang out in the leaky cauldron and act in character, whenever anyone comes in have them get all disgruntled about “that blond headed wanker” and just gaslight the world
