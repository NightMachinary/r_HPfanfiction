I don't know if you've heard, but in France our gouvernement is trying to make filming cops against the law. That added to the police many fuckups give me anti-Auror Harry need. After all, Harry don't have that many good memory of the gouvernement helping him. I'd like to read something where he is adamant about not going to be an auror.


** I always felt that the whole Auror thing was no different than the whole relationship with Ginny. He did both of those things because people expected it of him. By the End of the series I feel that harry is a broken individual with really no sense of self. Willing to do whatever others ask about him. I mean with the name of Albus Severus? Two of the people who are really responsible for messing with his life the most? I feel that by Book four's end harry is for all intents and purposes a slave who has no idea of what it means to be free. Infact he would probably break if he was free to choose his own life. (A Man Chooses. A Slave Obeys.)

**** No matter how long its been. That one scene shall always stick with me. No Matter what else he was, That one quote is honestly an incredibly good point. And it can be applied to many different scenarios.

*** I read HP as a child and loved it. If I read it now for the first time, I would have hated it. Harry is basically a lucky dumb jock. That is why I Iove fanfiction. I can choose to read a fic with a smarter and more interesting Harry. The universe is cool, charachters are mostly ok.

Same as Naruto and Twillight. I like the universe, but charachters are ok or really badly written.

**** I agree that many of the characters in HP and Naruto are rather awful when looked from the lenses of an adult eye. Naruto is way too idealistic for me to enjoy as a character. Plus the whole Talk-No-Justu makes the whole plot too 2D for me. I, Naruto am always right there fore your argument is invalid. But with HP its a different problem. I find the actions of almost every adult horrible. They are either evil, abusive, neglectful, Incompetent, lacking in morals, guilty of turning a blind eye to something wrong or in some cases more than one of these. Snape and Dumbledore were awful individuals yet we are supposed to treat them as if they were grey and complicated heroes.

***** Snape deserved Lily /vomits/

Kakashi is so cool as a charachter. But if he was my teacher, I would have hated him. Genius who doesn't know/want to teach.

** How in the hell Would Making it illegal to film the police be in anyone's Best interest let alone the general population?

... Are you going to have to disconnect your security cameras in your store or your home if you have to call the police because someone broke in?

If you are in public and it's perfectly legal to film in public random by passers and other things if a cop suddenly pops up?

And you know camera keep people as honest as possible in those situations... that's how you document police abuse of power as well as any possible issues if the person being arrest assaults and officer. For both parties involved cameras keep people p el as to as possible... You can't really dispute the fact someone got hit in the face if you have it on video from 3 different angles because the security camera and someone's iPhone recorded it.....

The police are public officials at least while there on the streets on duty so at least when it comes to their job their right of privacy should be about the same as the president of France or the mayor of Paris if someone wants to record them in public at least from what I think I know of French law correct me if I'm wrong it's perfectly legal to record a public figure in public

*** That wasn't what it was about. The law would have made it illegal to expose the identity of officers for the purpose of causing them or their families harm. The guy who wrote it has done some questionable things before, he is pretty good at optics it seems

** This isn't what you're asking for, but it's close. In /Turn/ linkao3(879852) epilogue Harry is shown an AU where he didn't marry Ginny and he didn't become an Auror. And slowly Harry realizes that his alternate self is happy while his actual self is just drifting along with expectations. No Ginny bashing.
