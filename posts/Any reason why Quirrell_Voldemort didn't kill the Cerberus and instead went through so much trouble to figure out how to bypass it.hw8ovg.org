Being one of the people who set up the protections for the stone, Quirrell must have been at least aware of what was in all the rooms even if he didn't have the solution to all the charms and once he is past the dog, he easily bypasses all the other traps until he gets to the mirror. Voldemort had no qualms with killing so I'm wondering why didn't he just cast a killing curse on it rather than trying to figure out how to calm it.

  “And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.”
#+end_quote

It's more convoluted for plot reasons, but Dumbledore is always the answer as to why Voldemort doesn't do the easiest thing.

*** And for good reason. It only took ~33ish days in a Dumbledore-free world to take control of Britain.

** Secrecy is powerful. What would be the better option:

1. Having literally the only wizard possible of delaying/stymieing your plans for total domination being aware of your "resurrection" essentially immediately, or
2. Having literally the only wizard possible of delaying/stymieing your plans for total domination being unaware of your "resurrection" essentially immediately.

I had always assumed that Voldemort wanted to use the Stone to resurrect himself, /and then not steal it/ to keep himself secret. If successful at doing so, he would have been in the clear. Excepting the fact that Snape would have snitched.

I never thought of it this way. I figured he always intended to kill off Quirrell as his scapegoat, faking either a horrible ritual accident or mugging-gone-wrong.

That would potentially also work. The goal was to return secretly. Having Dumbledore find out was always the worst-case scenario.

And Quirrell is pretty much dead already. He did drink a bunch of Unicorn blood.

***** Also, according to Dumbledore, he was doomed as soon as he accepted possession. That tells me that he was always going to die when Voldie left his body.

** Yes and no. If Dumbledore was smart he had the traps built back to front. In other words, he prepped the mirror room, he then went and got Snape and he did the potion puzzle. Then Quirrell was brought in for the troll, then Mcgonagall for the chess set, flitwick with the keys, and then sprout for the Devil's Snare and finally Hagrid with fluffy. Basically Dumbledore would be the only one who knew all the traps and would have to get threw them to install the mirror with the stone.

If Dumbledore was smart he would illusion a long hallway so none of the other teachers would know how many rooms made up the trap as they were brought in to do their piece. Of course, if he was really smart none of the solutions for the traps would be down there in the trap. Eg all the potions were draught of living death, correct key not in the room, no chess game played just stone attackers, Devil's Snare as well as a plant that gets violent with sunlight. Of course, if he did that we wouldn't have three first years saving the day.

If Dumbledore did the setup like I described above then Quirrell/Voldemort would not know how many challenges were there nor how difficult they would be. If he kills Fluffy right off the bat and then hits a challenge he can't get through then he's lost the element of surprise and informed Dumbledore that Voldemort is in the school. By using stealth to try to get through the challenges he keeps that knowledge that Voldemort is there.

*** I guess my headcanon was always that those traps were intentionally set to be passable for the trio because Dumbledore wanted to test Harry and also wanted to give him the opportunity to come face to face with Voldemort, knowing that Voldemort could not do anything to Harry. The witches and wizards that came up with those shitty traps were the same ones that performed extraordinary magic when they were protecting Hogwarts from the Death Eaters' invasion.

Realistically, I think that being the first book, JK didn't have yet a clear idea of how powerful she wants to make the magic and she also wrote that as a children's book. When I first read the book at 11, I thought the traps were pretty cool.

** Cerberi are a protected and regulated species at the ICW level. Killing one would attract the attention of ICW regulators who, unlike the British MoM, have a reputation for being at least somewhat competent.

** Because it was book 1. In Methods of Rationality, he does indeed kill the dog, and then raises it as an Inferius to guard the door. And he deals with the key room and chess set and troll using fiendfyre.
