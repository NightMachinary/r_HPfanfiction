#+begin_quote
  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

*** This fic has been on my to-do list for a while, but one thing about the premise puzzles me. Why would the goblet need to justify picking Harry? He's literally the only option for his school (even though said school doesn't exist).

**** It is explained as "If there is sufficient doubt in the champion's ability to compete, the Goblet will show the memories of the champions to prove their worthiness." The fact that Harry is the only champion for his school causes complications of the Stargate-Variety (As explained in the Author's Notes)
