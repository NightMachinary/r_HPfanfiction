Mental illness can be depression, anxiety, PTSD, personality disorders etc. Please no romione, dramione, or intergenerational ships (eg. Snamione, McGonagall/Hermione etc.)


** The Confectionary Chronicles has Hermione struggling with a variety of things - bit of PTSD, bit of depression. It's a Supernatural crossover, but you don't need to know or enjoy Supernatural to read the fic - I haven't seen a single episode and know pretty much nothing about the show beyond 'they have a gay angel and go to hell a few times'.

It does start with a vivid but inexplicit suicide scene, so if you don't want to read that, skip to the part after the first line-break that starts "After the funeral, Helen and Richard decide to move away from the area.". It's referred back to throughout the story, but the basic gist is that Hermione's sister was bullied by people at her school and took her life and Hermione finds the body.

  Non-canon compliant, sort-of retelling, of Half-Blood Prince. But with Hermione Granger as the main character.Hermione Granger seeks to navigate her 6th year after sending her parents to Australia with new memories. Minerva McGonagall is finding recovering from "the stunner incident" a difficult and long-winded task. Hermione helps her heal and finds a new book, filled with comments about Transfiguration and after one too many nasty remarks nearly kills another student with one of the spells within. With Professor McGonagall in charge of her punishment, will things sour? Or will they discover that family is what you make of it and perhaps they just might come through this war in one piece. Together.
