** When Fleur first realized that 'arry Potter wasn't affected by her allure she nearly squealed. She new what that meant! When a boy wasn't attracted at all to a Veela, that almost always was a sign they were gay. It couldn't be anything else!

Certainly not some incredibly rare magical power that blocked her allure. That would be ridiculous.

There was no doubt about it. 'Arry Potter, boy who lived, was into other guys. And Fluer, a certified romantic expert who had read dozens upon dozens of strange books from Japan called /magma/ knew exactly what to do! She'd get her fellow champion a date to the Yule Ball in no time! She'd be the perfect wingwoman in disguise!

So with a little bit of planning she was able to put her plan into motion.

When everything was ready she tracked down 'Arry in the library. She grabbed over half a dozen books and, barely suppressing a smile, said, "'Arry! Could you please 'arry zese books for me? Zey are so heavy!"

Harry looked up from his homework, giving her a confused but polite smile, "Of course, Fleur."

Fleur almost giggled. The boy was so nice, perfect for who she planned to matchmake him with!

So the two set off down the corridors. And with so many books in Harry's arms the short boy could barely see above the stack, completely unaware of what was in front of him. Perfect.

At the end of the hallway one Draco Malfoy was speedingily walking towards the pair, eyes cast down on the confession letter in his hands. The note said to meet them in the library. And well... The Yule Ball was in a week and he needed a date (other than Pansy, hopefully). So here Draco was, nearly running to the library to find this secret admirer, unaware of the people in front of him.

Meanwhile, Fleur sneaks away. She'd let these two have their moment.

Harry was just starting to regret taking on so many heavy books when all of a sudden he ran into a wall. With a gasp, all of Fleur's books go flying and, trying to catching them, he falls forward and onto the wall.

But then the wall /falls down with him/ and he suddenly finds himself acutely aware of how fleshy and warm it is. And how it's /groaning/.

"Oh Merlin I'm so sorry!" Harry frantically scrambles off the /person/. His face burns in embarrasment.

He pats the ground around him, looking for his glasses that fell off in the fall, "I was just carrying so many books that I didn't see-"

"Oh sod off Potter!"

Harry's blood runs cold and he can't help but grimace, "Oh. It's you."

"Yes it's me! Don't be daft."

Harry ignores him in favor of picking up his glasses and sliding them on.

And there Draco was, in all his arrogant glory. Although there was a little satisfaction to be had in the young heir's messed up hair.

Harry groans.

Draco sneers.

"What're you doing here anyways, Potter? Finally decided to study? You were always dumber than the rest of us lot."

"I'm carrying Fluer's books. Which is something a decent person does. Not like /you/ would know."

The other student looks around, one eyebrow arched, "I don't see her."

Harry whirls around, "Huh? But she was just here..."

Draco snickers.

"Never mind that. What are you doing here?"

"I'll have you know, that I got a letter from an admirer asking me on a date! Really, it's no surprise that I've got witches just dying to spend time with me."

Draco smugly flashes him the letter.

Harry snorts, "Poor girl doesn't know what a big mistake she's making."

"Oh buzz off."

But Harry isn't listening. He's busy collecting his books. And it's then that he spots a peice of parchment laying on the ground. He's positive it wasn't there before. Fleur hasn't had him carrying any of her homework? Did she?

But he reaches down to pick it up anyways, quickly skimming the writing. And his heart drops into his stomach.

'/Dear Draco,/

/I've always admired you. You're so smart and attractive. Would you like to go to the Yule Ball with me?/

/Signed, your secret admirer,/

/Harry Potter/'

"WHAT!?" Harry screams.

He starts choking on air.

Draco's head snaps in his direction. And like a hawk his eyes go towards the letter in his enemy's hands.

"What is it Potter?" He jeers.

"N-nothing!"

Just as Harry is about to rip up the parchment, Draco snatches it out his hands reading it quickly.

Harry goes to grab the letter but the damage is done.

Draco's face goes slack jawed, "Signed your secret admirer... Harry Potter..."

Draco whips out his own confession letter and compares it to the one his most sworn enemy -- or at least he /thought/ he was his enemy -- had been holding. Was Potter really this love sick admirer he was supposed to meet?

After a moment he gives Harry a look, face straightening into something almost composed. He tugs at his collar, suddenly aware of how hot it felt.

"I uh... I didn't know you swung that way Potter."

Harry is literally willing to risk Azkaban to get out of this. So he points his want to the boy without any remorse.

"Obliviate."

A few unforgivables may also have been cast in the ensuing duel.

·+{~{[]}~}+· ·+{~{[]}~}+· ·+{~{[]}~}+·

In another part of the castle Fluer is left unaware of the criminal acts being commited at this moment. Instead, she smiles as she pulls out a notebook and starts coming up with ship names.

By now she's certain they've tripped over eachother. Draco would have then helped the boy up, and then they would've found the forged confession note that she snuck onto the top of the pile of books. And because neither had a date they'd simply go together! It'd be just like her romance novels where the cold hearted aristocrat falls for the handsome and brash hero!

And it was such an obvious pairing too! She's surprised no one else saw their animosity as what it truly was, sexual tension. And lots of it.

Now then... Harloy or Drarry?

  ( Fleur was, in Harry's opinion, the worst type of good person. If she was any worse than she was, she'd certainly be a bad person, someone who took glee from the suffering of others, but she doesn't, not really.She was just very fond of taking the mickey out of people.Which isn't much better, honestly. Harry had thought he'd gotten rid of the groomed pigeon after fourth year, after his inability to feel her allure became apparent. She got real fucking fascinated then, started taking on worryingly fox-like smiles and a too-focused interest in his day-to-day life.It was how she caught him snogging Ludlow St John - a lovable, if somewhat dim fifth year in Hufflepuff - after he and Parvati had finished mechanically going through the motions of being dates, the girl in question going off to no doubt kiss Lavender in a broom closet or something. Fleur had been, of course, smug as she had ever been, and from then on in the girl had just not stopped when it came to nosing her way into his business and teasing him. )In which the visit to the Burrow before Harry's sixth year goes quite differently.

***** It probably doesn't go by veela's own preferences, otherwise Ron wouldn't have been affected (unless Fleur and the stadium veelas like the attention of horny 14 year-olds very much). Moreover, we know not every male can be charmed - gay Albus Dumbledore and married Arthur Weasley don't seem to be affected. I'd say it amplifies other people's attraction. In this interpretation being a veela of any sexuality would suck. Just think of all then men who say things like 'she was asking for it' irl... and then imagine that they are using it against a veela girl and the worst thing is that they're kind of right, because she is magically making herself irresistible, just not for them specifically. The charm can probably be turned down (and then up) a bit to make veela's life easier, but it not being very selective would suck anyway.

I mean Harry's only real male role model is Vernon, and if that's not a dead bedroom marriage there's probably significant heavy machinery involved.

Actually, now that I do a little thinking on it, every adult male he interacts with on a regular basis up to that point is either broken, gay, or part-human except Arthur.

The veela allure trope is a bad trope, nearly as bad as the Lord Potter trope. If you like reading the same trash over and over again, that's up to you. The allure trope turns Fleur into a single dimensional character - if you like reading about that all the time, then do so. But don't blame anyone else for having some standards.

I was responding to a comment thread where a person was talking about Fleur's ego - "if he doesn't find me attractive, he has to be gay!" reeks of an ego the size of the moon - when someone else said that it was a natural response to this shit allure. That's when you barged in with your bull.
