I am looking stories with op Harry, can be political genius or just kickass, thought as I want read ones that are actually done well they should be slice of life types. (From outside fanfiction death march is good example for style)


** The linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter?) series is my favourite of the type. linkffn(Make a Wish) also comes to mind, and though it isn't grammatically perfect, I like it quite a lot anyway.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** There's also the still-in-progress linkffn(One Punch Wizard by MrWriterWriter), which has a different flavor than Make a Wish etc. because Harry is just a kid. Read it for the first time last week and was pretty happy with it!

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

** linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot) From the same author as Make a Wish, Harry and friends go back in time and stop the second war before it can begin. The focus is on them adjusting to life as kids and their shared experiences.

** Ao3, If Them's The Rules. Very dark at times, but deals very well with general life and things like that. It's very realistic in regards to flaws and all that, and it's quite a level-headed story if you're into that. It's an ongoing work, but has updated quite recently. I don't think Harry's OP, but he is very powerful and can definitely hold his own.
