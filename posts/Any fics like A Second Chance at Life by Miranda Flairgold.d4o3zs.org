Like the title say. I love the series and wondered if there are any more fics like it.


** There is a wizarding school fanfic that is worth reading--it is not a Harry Potter story, but a stand-alone story called Mother of Learning by Nobody103. linkfp(2961893). It is nearly complete--102 of the 103 chapters have been posted. It features a groundhog day-like situation, where a 15-year old wizard-in-training keeps reliving the first month of school. It features lots of interesting creatures (including demons) and advanced magic.

My only real complaint about it is that the female characters are underdeveloped and weak.

  Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog Day' style setup in a fantasy world.
