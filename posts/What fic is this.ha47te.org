I'm looking for a fic where after harry defeats Voldemort he is sent to an alternate universe to help them defeat their Voldemort. This is a Harry/Harry fic where they both feel like the other is the only one they can trust. Thanks for any help ðŸ˜Š


** I think that it might be Faerietayle by Kamerreon.
