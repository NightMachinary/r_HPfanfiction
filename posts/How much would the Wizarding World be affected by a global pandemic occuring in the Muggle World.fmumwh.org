Just a thought I had, what with everything going on right now.


** It is canon that while wizards do not have any special immunity to muggle diseases, they can cure them extremely easily with magic.

The only injuries or diseases that are difficult to heal for wizards are ones caused by magic, like Moody's missing limbs, or Dragonpox.

** from what i've seen, it's a not-uncommon trope that wizards/witches are immune to most "Muggle diseases." depending on the fic, that can include viral/bacterial diseases, autoimmune and chronic illnesses, and things like cancer.

of course, when you look into it this trope makes very little sense bc the logical extrapolation of that is that wizards don't ever get infected wounds, or the common cold, or headaches, all of which happen or are strongly implied to happen in canon; Moody has lost multiple limbs, Pepper-Up Potion exists, and Harry's headaches aren't seen as unique to him.

*** I don't think they're immune, but they can cure them with spells or potions.

** Wizards could technically get the Coronavirus. They can get colds and such after all. They'd just have better chances of containing the spread.

** They'd ignore it completely until they were almost all infected. Doubly so if Fudge was in charge.

** How much food is produced for muggles?

How many muggleborns live mixed with muggles?

Exactly, how is it the inmune system of a wizard?

** From [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fmcq8u/where_did_the_idea_come_from_that_witches_and/fl3ltlk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]], wizards can catch everything muggles can catch but can cure all of them. So close to zero.

** Well, in principle, they're self-isolating from muggles already. And have cures for muggle ailments.

It'd be a bigger issue for muggleborns and fics where Harry and co. send their kids to muggle primaries (which, despite Harry's experiences at school, I think Harry would).

** I don't think wizards are immune to it at all. It'll prob be a HUGE wake up call- wizards and muggles are affected by the same things.

**** No, it's not. Let me rephrase: it'll be a wakeup call to wizards in the way that they are not superior to muggles regarding things like these. Their abilities do NOT protect them from this. I'm not saying that someone with the ideaology that wizards are better because of their blood will feel differently- they're more likely to blame it on the muggle- but people who view muggles more as pets, will definetely see a flaw. Also, IF many wizards think that they are immune to this just because they are magical, they'll be wrong. They just refuse to see it. Saying it's a wake up call doesn't mean they acknowledge it. IF someone is a racist and believes that white people have better immune systems than black people, then it IS a huge wakeup call to the, they might just choose to ignore it. I'm not saying they'll stop- I'm saying it'll once again prove to them that they aren't superior. Whether they choose to accept that or not is their decision.
