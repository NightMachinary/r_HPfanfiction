  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** None of the above. Dumbledore is and always will be a "big picture" guy. A significant portion of Deathly Hallows is all about how Dumbledore is not a perfect person, he makes mistakes and has faults. Many of Dumbledore's decisions around Harry were pretty terrible but I cannot even imagine the stress he was under. I mean imagine the situation of Harry Potter:

1. He and Voldemort are destined for conflict.
2. He might have some of Voldemort's soul inside him; this probably scared Dumbledore more than he ever admitted and was probably why he always made it a point to talk with Harry at the end of every year.
3. Death Eaters were out for blood; and I imagine the wizarding world didn't return to "normal" for at least 2-3 years.
4. Who could he trust when Black had already betrayed the Potters... Few people can imagine a world where you can legitimately trust no one. Dumbledore's best choice was honestly to take Harry outside the Magical World.\\
5. Voldemort was still around but Dumbledore had no clue which immortality ritual he even used. Dumbledore could have assumed Voldemort made a horcrux, he never would have guess 5+, let alone what items were used or where they were hidden. I imagine he retracted all of Riddle's life post Hogwarts after finding the Diary.

I honestly just wish that more stories played up the difficult situation Dumbledore was in and write him accordingly.

**** I wouldn't say he was focused on redeeming people too much. That is pretty big fanfiction trope. He didn't chase down Snape and get him to turn to the light. I will say that he does want to redeem people but lets go over your points:

Arresting Malfoy or expelling him would kill Draco but furthermore it would also potentially put Snape in jeopardy as a spy, which would be the worst thing possible with Dumbledore dying soon. I do agree that he should not have let him run free throughout book 6 but once again Dumbledore was looking at the big picture in securing Snape's position among the Death Eaters.

I don't quite get how leaving Harry with the Dursleys was for their redemption, redemption from what?

  Well he doesn't chase down Voldemort or any of the elder Malfoys/Blacks either. I think more from the perspective of "he won't take action against people because he wants them to be redeemed." Otherwise it's hard to explain his relative inaction throughout the series.

In real life, headmasters of schools and the ceremonial heads of international organisations don't go around all vigilante style and murder people left, right and centre. Governments do sometimes (for shame), but individuals who do that we call murderers or terrorists. It's baffling to me that people have the default position of "mass murder is right!" when it comes to fiction. Or worse, that great power justifies it. Half at least of all superharry stories are deeply fascistic in the same way judge dredd is.

*** I mostly agree, but if Dumbledore knew that there was a piece of soul in Harry, he knew of the Horcrux issue. When he learned of the Diary, he knew Voldemort had created more than one, and the difficulty just grew. If he didn't know of the soul in Harry until later than that, he was entirely grooming a martyr from the beginning, regardless of the true necessity.

** Senile is boring; it's only for crack. For serious fiction, making Dumbledore "Bad" very seldom works- because you see, if you take away Dumbledore's morality, you basically create a Voldemort /who knows how important love is/ and thus you create a bit of a Gary Stu villain. No, I like Dumbledore good, though it often creates the problem of "why doesn't he step in and solve everything."

**** I agree with the redeeming people thing, but individual things just don't seem to go that way. Returning Harry to the Dursleys every year was specifically for the sacrificial protection, not well being of because he thought the Dursleys would magically become accepting. Perhaps he first time, but not after that. The protection was just more important, "I knew you would (suffer)" "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years"

He brought Lockhart on specifically to discredit him and reveal him as a fraud, using Harry's presence as bait, and knowing full well that there'd be an entire year's worth of students not learning anything useful in defense (which McGonagall called him on). Plus Dumbledore knew the position was Cursed. There was zero thought of Lockhart redeeming himself, that was straight up revenge for the two wizards Dumbledore knew. At least according to the Pottermore entry, he brushed that off saying students would learn what not to do. To me that says his overall goal was more important than the individual costs.

I don't think it's necessarily a "greater good" thing, just some of the things he does make him not entirely a "good" character, just has good goals and plans.

Edit: spelling, and also I see it kinda like how Hermione is a "good" character with a bit of a ruthless streak in her teen years.

******** Hiring Remus really was a questionable choice. I don't recall if it's canon/Pottermore canon that it had to do directly with Sirius escaping, but it's too convenient not to be related. He also used bribery then as well, promising wolfsbane (and Pottermore says that was the persuading factor).

Remus may have done well in the role, may have been one of the best defense teachers they had, but as we saw at the end of the year he was still directly dangerous to the students when he missed his potion due to a distraction. He wasn't honest with staff about how a murderer (in his eyes) was getting into the school. That's extremely poor judgment on Remus' part.

I really do want to know Dumbledore's direct motives for hiring him, I think it'd be interesting.

******** That's understandable then. Taking Pottermore as canon does alter the viewpoint a bit, making one thing seem like something else, leading to different interpretations.

I would agree with you though, going by the books themselves Dumbledore's thing was redemption.

However, McGonagall watched the house for a full day before Harry was brought and she tried telling Dumbledore that they were awful people. It had to have been something he considered since he didn't just ignore her. That plays into it, not just the 'living as a Muggle' which truly might be awful when you don't know what's happening. Perhaps it's both, just making a hard decision with little information.

********* Well, she didn't tell him exactly why they were awful. And going with a previously raised point about the “difficult” years bit possibly being about the inability to do magic as a kid due to being with muggles, it was possible for Dumbledore to treat her comment about them as them being the most mugglish muggles ever. Well, that and there's the fact that most of the wizarding world doesn't seem to care about emotional trauma and wizards are quite harder to kill than muggles, so though I do not think it justifies the choice I feel it serves as a sufficient explanation as to why Dumbledore might have interpreted McGonagall's objection as the “he'll be unable to use magic until Hogwarts” possibility rather than the “they'll hurt him” one.

As for Lockhart, honestly it feels as if Madam Rowling didn't think the revelation about Dumbledore hiring Lockhart to expose him through. So let me counter that with a “what if” thing:

What if Dumbledore really had hired Lockhart hoping to expose it because there was nobody else applying for the position and the only alternatives were either relying on the ministry to appoint someone or tracking down some friend of his to take the position? And what if Dumbledore had done it hoping that Lockhart would let his guard down due to the presence of the Boy-Who-Lived and expose himself in September or maybe October at the latest and then he could plead to the minister to lend him one of his aurors to teach after Lockhart would have gotten outed? What if he'd been hoping that Lockhart wouldn't do things as stupid as requiring all the students to buy all of his overpriced books, but he didn't have a say in whatever books any teacher assigns and that was the why of the silly book list?

** I have enjoyed all of those characterizations at one point at least. However, its very specific when which of them tends to work (for me).

Senile: Given his old age, its not surprising that his brain would ask for retirement as well. There are fics out there that make this characterization working by using something a lot of old people do. They deny loosing their touch. In those fics, not telling Harry secrets and forgetting that Lily was not a well-loved relative of the Dursleys comes from his slowly fading memory.

Bad: He is a political powerhouse. Thats just fact. Given that you're either a sycophant or ruthless to make it to the top in the real world political arena (and stay there), the leap is not that far to stating that Dumbles is bad, or downright evil. I like this type of Dumbles a lot if it doesn't end up in bashing.

Good: If you portray him as good, then stick close to Rowlings characterization of the wise old wizard that truly knows best. Theres a reason why Dumbledore is one of my all time favourite characters in fiction.

In all three categories, I love it when he actually packs a punch. I personally always write him as a wizard of immense power/knowledge. Its, I think, one of the cores of his character, to be this legendary warlock.

** In fluff and romance I prefer Dumbledore as the happy grandfatherly type, who simply enjoys his job and simply doesn't care if people find that some of his behaviours are a bit weird - he's lived for so long, he has earned the right to basically do whatever he fucking wants.

In realistic or dark fics I like seeing him as the same person, only through no fault of his own burdened with too much at once. Some of his favourite students died at the hands of another student of his, who created an army to erradicate a large percentage of the population, the government is infiltrated by agents of voldemort, the pureblood-ideology is rooted so deeply in the heads of the people, that even the moderates are fueling the hate, by not actively opposing it. The enemies try to take away his position as headmaster to get access to the minds of the next generation when they are the most vulnerable to manipulation, former allies like sirius seem to have switched sides, people he wouldn't have thought possible of succumbing to the darkness have turned against those who love them (snape), and the war has killed so many good people that there are not enough experienced and/or trustworthy people to rely on.

Dumbledore hates the greater good with a passion, but life isn't fair and generally doesn't care whether you hate something or not.

Dumbledore portrayed as a politician out of options is - in my opinion - the best portrayal.

People like to say he is evil because he made some questionable decisions - but never consider it from his perspective: he can't give up the position of the supreme wugmump, if he doesn't want the justice-system to fall in the hands of those who consider not being of pure blood a crime, he cannot give up his position in the wizengamot, if he doesn't want the law fall into the hands of those who want the moderates to follow their vision of lawfullness, he cannot give up his position at hogwarts, because it would leave a whole generation vulnerable, he cannot take care of harry, because there is simply a limit to how much a single person (no matter how powerful) can handle.

He's a remarkable man who had to fight a losing battle, and managed to not give an inch for 10 fucking years, until harry appeared, and with him even more problems that shifted his focus to his position as headmaster.

In these 10 years he also wasn't able to find a replacement. Bones can't become minister, leader of the wizengamot or anything without losing her current position, and without an executive force that actually wants to imprison people who break the law, all changes at the political level are meaningless.

He cannot give his headmaster-position to anyone (even if he trusts his staff to a great degree), because the press and opposition would tear him apart, and would probably manage to either install a ministry-approved replacement, or atleast fill up the position of whoever he promotes.

So, now he has the choice of either sacrificing the law, sacrificing the justice, sacrifice a whole generation or sacrifice harry, by basically telling him “you are on your own now kiddo, good luck with voldemort“.

And being the great person he is he choses neither, he doesn't go the simply route of sacrificing a single person for the benefit of the masses, no, instead he decides to take harrys burden on himself aswell, he shields him from the public where he can, he allows him to attend school like every normal child, he allows him to choose his own path.

But at the same time he also recognizes that he cannot shield him forever.

So he tries to show him the right way (or what he considers right), teaches valuable life lessons, all in the hope that harry will grow up to become the replacement he so desperately needs.

And then he finds out that life still is not fair and that harry was destined to die at the hands of voldemort, because the horcrux would revive him.

And still he doesn't choose the easy route of guilt-tripping harry into sacrificing himself, or killing him himself, he allows harry to make this choice for himself.

That he shaped harry into a good person, a worthy successor, who just like him is willing to take the burden for other people, might be seen as manipulation, but that's only the perspective of a person who learned to differentiate between Harry and the boy-who-lived, yet failed to do the same for Dumbledore and the leader of the light.

** Depends on what you mean by "good," doesn't it?

If you are going to deal with the source material seriously and not ignore a whole slew of problems associated with his decisions - some explicit and some implicit - without him being evil, then you have to also incorporate some combination of: making mistakes, overlooking the obvious, arrogance, thinking the ends justify the means, ignoring the suffering of others, not even trying to get the input or advice of others, and more.

You can be a "good" person with all of that, if one focuses on the intentions and goals, but those harmed by your actions won't think of you as very "good" when it comes to their own lives, regardless of how much "good" you might be doing elsewhere.

The key word here is "combination" - if you put all of the blame on any one thing, he'll end up being evil, senile, a caricature, or something like that. If you spread the blame far enough around, you can probably avoid the negative labels. Mostly.

And that's a potentially very interesting character, though it's a difficult balancing act to do. It's what I'm trying in my story, at any rate: a Dumbledore who has the best of intentions and who genuinely wants good things to happen, but through a combination of ignorance, arrogance, focusing on the big picture/end goals, self-isolation, mistrust of others, and more, makes a lot of mistakes that cause a lot of harm - most of which he's unaware of.
