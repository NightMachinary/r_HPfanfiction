** Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy has a lot of Remus/Tonks in it. The main ship is HP/OC but the author uses Remus and Tonks as the second set of main characters and they get a ton of page time. It delves into aspects of Tonks' life and her struggles that I haven't seen in too many fics.

On mobile and don't have the linkffn right now, sry.

** linkffn(A Little More Time by Jess Pallas) is my favorite story with this pairing, not that I've read too many. Teddy Lupin goes back in time to the Battle of Hogwarts and brings his parents into the future. The ministry isn't happy and wants them dead. Lots of legal drama.

linkffn(2619309) is a pretty enjoyable one-shot. The author has other Remus/Tonks stories too, though I've yet to read them.

linkffn(Chasing Grindylows by Firetoflame) just got over, I'd following it for sometime. It isn't too bad, but nothing I'd really recommend either.

** linkffn(There'll Be Bluebirds by little0bird)

Books 5-7 from Remus' POV, told through both "regular" third person that the majority of fics use, and Teddy reading letters written by Remus when Teddy is about 14. The Tonks/Lupin romance is a large focus of the story.
