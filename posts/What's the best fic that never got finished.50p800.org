You know what I mean. That fic that has no hope of being touched again since it hasn't been updated in five years but you're dying to find out what happens.


** Many names come to mind. Here's a few:

Stories: A Shadowed Soul Linkffn(3659524)

Stories: Prince of the Dark Kingdom Linkffn(3766574)

Stories: On the Way to Greatness Linkffn(4745329)

Stories: Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Stories: Building Bridges Linkffn(6427995)

**** IIRC, every time there's been a long pause in updating, it's followed up by pretty rapidly regular updates of GIANT chapters (10k+ usually). I think it's entirely possible that the author is just taking a break to finish writing the fic and then will update the rest of the monster as necessary.

  When I went to bed, I found him. His passing looked peaceful and I can only hope it was.

  Thank you all for being a part of our lives for so many years. You've brought us a great deal of happiness.
