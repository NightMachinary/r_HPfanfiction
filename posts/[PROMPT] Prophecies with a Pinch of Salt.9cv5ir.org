Trelawney was completely and utterly hammered at the time she delivered the Prophecy - there are some portions that were barely words, let alone actually coherent. The Prophecy that we ended up with was Dumbledore's best attempts to decipher her ramblings.

So some parts are... open to interpretation.

Write a scene or short story in which a highly unexpected solution to the prophecy is found, and given unusual amounts of leeway.

*/REQUIREMENTS:/*

- scene or short story, so basically 200+ words

- The Prophecy is an unreliable source

- Voldemort's defeat is almost entirely freestyled

*/BONUS POINTS FOR:/*

- the Vanquishing is entirely accidental

- Luna being the only person to actually figure out how the prophecy applies to the events

- the Vanquishing happening in the middle of one of those Harry/Voldemort pre-showdown trash talks

- a Marauder being involved somehow


** Not exactly what you're looking for, but in my story (/The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/) I had a /very/ novel interpretation of the Prophecy that makes it no longer Voldemort nor Harry's problem, nor, really, anyone's. [[/spoiler][They have Sirius create an alias of The Other, and ceremonially dub an ant and a hamster Either and Neither. Then they have Sirius in full The Other garb crush the ant, and give Neither to the Granger parents as a pet. Bingo --- /Either must die at the hands of the Other/ - he did - and /Neither can live while the Other survives/ - since the Other doesn't give a damn about the Grangers' hamster, so it /can live/ while he /survives/, no problem.]]

*** Heh. When in doubt about a prophecy, just redefine the words used to make them fit whatever you want.

There was that time a year or so ago I was wondering about the subject of tampering with language. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kme0o/whats_a_minor_thing_in_fanfiction_that_drives_you/dbqct2t/]]
