*** So you know, this isn't like [[/r/TOMT][r/TOMT]]. You don't need to reply to your post for it to show up.

***** Sorry, referred to the wrong subreddit, there's another subreddit dedicated to finding various media, be it books, movies, cartoons, etc, called [[/r/tipofmytongue][r/tipofmytongue]], and they have an automod set up to only approve posts if the OP replies to their own post, to discourage bad faith posts(posts where users are looking for something, but never follow up with any of the responses)
