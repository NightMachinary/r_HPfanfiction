** linkao3(in another life by drifting_melody)

Technically I'm working on the sequel, but nonetheless! It's a twinfic with a close sibling relationship and I put a lot of effort into developing my characters and friendships. No bashing, even though it might seem like it at first

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I am currently writing the second year of my: "A wizard in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"-series.

It works with the premise that Dudley is a wizard too. There isn't much change before the series: The Dursleys pinnend all strange things that happened around Dudley on Harry. The idea is, that being magical doesn't suddenly fix Dudleys personality like it often happens in such fanfics. He tries all the shit he did in the muggle-world in Hogwarts too. Sometimes it's working, more often it isn't so it takes time until Dudley changes.

The series is outlined till year 6 and I vaguely know how I will end it. I've finished year one now and also the holidays after. Year one was only from Harrys perspective with one interlude from Dumbledores perspective, but I plan to add different perspectives in later years. The chamber of Secrets is open now and Mrs. Norris is still running around, so there will be changes, some smaller, some bigger.

I think I will start posting it after finishing year 3 at least, because I hate it when series are discontinued so I want to have roughly half of it done before I start posting it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13809245/1/The-Fifth-Champion][The Fifth Champion]]

Summary: "Ron!" Harry started, from the corner of the room, shooting up from his seat. Ron gulped. "Hi mate," he offered, with a weak smile. Bloody hell. Oneshot, what if Ron was selected by the Goblet of Fire?

This is a oneshot I released a few months ago, but I've received a few messages asking me to expand more on this idea since then. I've decided to continue it, and am working out the finer details right now :D

Ron is one of my favourite characters in HP, and I think this fic will allow me to flesh out his character. Time to give my boy the recognition he deserves :D

Wish me luck, and if anyone has suggestions on different tasks for the Triwizard Tournament, I'd be glad to hear you out!

*** I think the next chapter should be Hermione getting called up as well, because Harry copied off Ron, who copied off Hermione :D

In terms of alternative tasks, I've seen so many ideas over the years they've all been done to death, but that doesn't matter because you just write it your way, differently. Generally having the contestants visible is a good start. Some ideas I've enjoyed: a broom race, with additional tasks such as saving someone like in the second task, or a "magical ironman" type thing where you have to go from one place to the next, using only magical methods of travel that are not teleportation (or only magical creatures?). A duelling championship. A "nerdy" olympiad: arithmancy problems, runes, or any Hogwarts topic; a simple wand-accuracy competition like bows and arrows; something like a "show" where the competitors have to just make a visually impressive piece of magic somehow (synchronising charms and transfiguration, potions and everyhting else they want, but alone); introduce unofficial partners to each champion so there is an equal number of competitors again, then you can have team sports of some sort, etc etc... There's a lot out there :) Good luck!

** Outlined and started year five of my female Slytherin Harry series. It always feels a little overwhelming to look at twenty five chapters worth of an outline (I'm giving a rough estimate for this fic of 200k, but it could easily go over) and realize that all of that has to come from my head. I like the direction it's going though and I've had the end of this fic planned since I started this series.

For anyone who wants to read the series (currently posting year three) they're on AO3 and ffn.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** The story I've been working on since COVID started is still in-process. I don't think it will conclude until the end of the year, at this rate. It's a detective noir thriller, so I keep thinking I've hit various critical points, but the action just hasn't let up, so now it's gotten rather chase scene/dueling/conflict intense and not showing any signs of stopping. Trying to keep wizard battles interesting by not repeating situations or opponents or too many types of combat spells is a whole part time job. But I kind of love it.

Also, I posted /two/ chapters last week. Who am I?

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a young metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** After quite a few false starts, I am on my way to finish the first chapter of my first fic. It aims to be a direct continuation to the main series (chronologically speaking).

After the battle of Hogwarts, Harry takes part in an important clean-up operation. While he was asleep, the Order reclaimed control of the Ministry of Magic with the help of Ron, Hermione and Neville.

The next step ? Take back Azkaban, where Dolores Umbridge and the remaining Voldemort regime sympathisers have taken refuge.

Time is of the essence. One of the Muggleborn prisoners is a pregnant woman who is about to give birth, and NOBODY knows how the birth of a pure infant soul will affect the behaviour of the Dementors around.

1-G67 stuck his helmeted head up through the hatch of the commander's cupola, “I dunno man like we've been polishing this thing for two days, if we take it out in that rain, it'll rust, man.” The metal faceplate gave his voice a tinny quality.

“Move out!” 1-G1 shouted.

“Sure, whatever, man.” The great Shoggoth MBT started up with a rumble, its treads began to move, and a second later, the tank crashed through the barn doors and rode off into the night.

“1-G1! It's 15-J1!” 1-G88 said.

“What the hell does he want?”

“He says he's sorry.”

** Hi. I've come out of fanfiction writing retirement to the best community around. Dramione has been the key to my heart for fifteen years. I blame buffy.

I'm writing a dark fantasy romance with a bit of Lovecraftian Eldritch horror mixed in. Its not getting very much traction, so i am thinking about hiring an artist to create some visuals.

[Heart of the Castle] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28929624/chapters/70981194]])

Summary:

Amid a lifetime of madness, a price is paid with the life of a lover. And you should know fear, dear friend. She will burn down worlds to bring him back.

The price of power would always be blood.

It could be yours. It could be theirs. Or, it could be everyones.

** My first fanfic ever, titled: Sublatis Anchoris Te. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31351145][linkao3(31351145)]]

Features an OC with a new lineage and ties in with Harry's story - so significant plot diversion. Main themes: family, loneliness, magical progression, solidarity, spell creation.

I only have my preface out at the moment. I am unsure of how the writing comes across to other people as I have no previous experience with this at all. So I would greatly appreciate any and all feedback (please be as critical as you like)!

** I posted a minor crack fic, since I'm not ready yet to post a full-on long fic. It's a crossover oneshot no less.

*Fandoms*: Harry Potter and Naruto.

*Summary*:

Naruto and Harry have many similarities.

And this fic blatantly exploits that fact in a shitty crossover as a bad attempt at humor.

Or Harry and Naruto drink in a bar together.

** I decided to try my hand at writing a fic after falling down the fanfic rabbit hole last November. It's based on an idea I got from a post here for a Marauders-era story that mostly details their lives throughout Hogwarts, but each year will still have its own "adventure." I've started writing the first few paragraphs and I'm doing research to make it fairly canon-compliant.

I'm open to any thoughts and ideas!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31214912/chapters/77151347][A Grim Tale of Grandmas, Schnitzels and Ghosts]]

Summary: After PoA and an adventure with Dummbledore to recover his brother's corpse, Sirius now shares his mind with Padfoot, a grim, a scenthound for the Underworld, blessed by Death, that only has two objectives in life: the destruction of /unlife/ and the gathering of wayward souls. In this chapter, he travels to magical Vienna with Harry and Remus and they all have a good time. Harry in particular is excited to be travelling with the entertaining leftover Marauders, and in one day feels the love of his mother, the pride of his father, and finds unexpected family linkao3(31214912)

In next week's chapter, they will come face-to-face with some of the greatest horrors carried out in the history of humanity, by wizards and muggles alike.

Sequel to the previous shortfic, A Grim Tale of Brothers, Pumpkins and Giants, although I'm posting it as one fic on ffn thanks to the lack of a Series feature. linkffn(13739888) linkao3(27401833)

  Set a few weeks after Sirius' adventure with Dumbledore and, more importantly, his newly awakened grim consciousness. It is decided that Harry should travel to Vienna with Remus and his godfather to seek the advice of an old and wise wizard. Harry is delighted at the fun-filled holiday with his newly acquired leftover Marauders, but it soon emerges the Austrians could use the help of a grim with some of their own wounds almost sixty years in the making. Is there a difference between muggle and magical ghosts or souls? What does it mean when wayward souls cannot move on and escape death for too long? Can we speak to those who have passed on, or are they too busy experiencing the next great adventure? Is having a family the same thing as having relatives, and can we choose? Why are wizards incapable of understanding the basic concept of two pedals and a steering wheel? What is it like to be on holiday when you're Harry Potter?

** *Harry Potter and The Lost Child - Chapter 13 out now!*

*Excerpt:*

Rain poured heavily onto the grassy hills near Nether Loxwich. In the distance, some quarter of a mile or so away, the small lights of the Muggle village gleamed and flickered through the darkness. Lightning struck nearby trees with excessive frequency, and the thunders that followed sounded unnaturally strong. The fine people of Nether Loxwich would have been suspicious of the unusual cold and harsh weather were it not for the fact that they had all been struck by the sudden and intense urge to leave the village immediately. Taking their children and pets and leaving all their possessions behind, running off to the other side of the country for the next few days.

*Check it out:*

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a fix of the (in my opinion) less than great Cursed Child. I guess I just wanted to give these characters the sequel they deserve. This is a second/next generation canon-compliant (though not with CC obviously) continuation of the series I love so much.

You can find it here:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224]]

and here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

This story is meant to provide an alternative for people who would like to know ‘what happened after the story' and would rather not bother with the hot mess that is CC (again my opinion).

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon-compliant (except for CC of course), the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Reviews/kudos/comments/suggestions/insults are always welcome!

Doing a new chapter every other week bc I'm SUPER busy but I will probably start writing one per week once I'm done with my studies.

** I am still writing my newest fic: Carly Potter and The Serpent's Spy (It's a fic about Harry's twin sister) Here's the short description :)

/❝Trust no one, not even our closest friends❞/

/It all started when Carly, twin sister of the famous Harry Potter, received a letter from a gigantic man stating that she and her brother will attend a magic school for witches and wizards called Hogwarts, their parents apparently attended this school. As Carly adjusted in the magical school, she became a magical prodigy. In her very first year, things have gone unusual, even for wizarding standards. An unknown student slipped up and spilled information about 'getting to know the Potters more' and that unknown student called themselves 'The Serpent's Spy'. Carly teams up with her new trustworthy friends, Ophelia and Victoria, to catch this spy to protect Harry, no matter what it takes, like getting killed, or worse, expelled./

/But was Harry really the target victim?/

/{Book 1 of 2}/

/{Philosopher's Stone - Goblet of Fire}/

I post chapters every other Saturday and Sunday 5 am Eastern Time. So my next update would be, next week Saturday, May 22. Thank you for your time!

Mostly just typo fixes this time; spelling errors, missing quote marks, etc - including some revisions by the author himself, from the chapter posted on Royal Road. Plus a minor continuity fix in chapter 28.

With FFN deleting the story in 2019 and ignoring all appeals, the eBook is now the only source of chapter 43. Plus it has a fanart cover, fancy typeface, includes two authorised one-shots, and as mentioned, fixes a lot of minor errors.
