I kinda want to write a story like this and want to know if potter fans would even read it


** The big difference would be that the Skaven, in their original design, are suited for a grimdark scenario, but not really the world of HP.

Which means if you decide to make such a society, you'll have to extensively worldbuild for it. If you're up for that, then I can see people reading it.
