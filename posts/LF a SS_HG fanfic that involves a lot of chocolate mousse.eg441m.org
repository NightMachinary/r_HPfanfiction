:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Like, I vaguely remember the fanfic and I think it was novel length (might be mistaken), but I clearly remember that there was a lot of secret chocolate mousse sending.

Like Snape would send a flute of mousse to the Gryffindor's table, but only for Hermione(it even stings Ron once whe he reaches for it). It even starts a lot of issues whe he stops sending it to her for some reason and when she doesn't eat it once.

It has been bugging me for a while now that I can't remember what fic that is, please help

Thanks in advance and sorry for any grammar mistakes, not my native language ;)

**** You can. Just look at the part of the URL after =/s/=: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity]] , that's the story ID, so if you put it into =linkffn()=, you get the proper link, linkffn(4776976).
