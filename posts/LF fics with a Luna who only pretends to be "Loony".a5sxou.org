I'm looking for fics where her personality as described in canon is just a mask she wears. Her "Loony" persona could be something that she did just for kicks (because she likes people thinking she's ridiculous when she really isn't), or because she's actually super dark (nobody pays attention to the crazy girl who spouts ridiculous things) or anything in between. What's important is that Luna CHOOSES to play the part of "Loony" even though she is not. Double bonus points if other characters discover who she really is. Thanks in advance!

*** Whoa, a 2nd Person perspective? Like a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel? Wow, that's...I didn't even think people made that. (I didn't even realize you could DO that!) Do you make decisions and skip to certain chapters based on them too?

**** I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started it either. I eventually got past it, although I think it would have been just as good or better written in the more standard first or third person.

It definitely has a Choose Your Own Adventure feel, but I'm kind of glad it's not. I always died in those.

***** You're not alone there. Now it makes me wonder if somebody DID write a Choose Your Own Adventure-styled Harry Potter fanfic.

** linkffn(8312363) has a Luna like that. Fair warning though, the warning at the start of the fic isn't kidding when it says "contains graphic torture, rape, blood and gore".

** The second chapter (maybe an omake?) of the /Obligatory Marriage Law Fic/ has Luna playing Loony for a very particular reason. It's a silly parody fic with a very cliche Hermione et al, but not bad at all for what it's trying to be. linkffn(5802874)

*** I don't know if she was really playing Loony. The way the story was written, we don't know of how she interacts with anybody except Harry. Still though, I appreciate you providing a recommendation. :)
