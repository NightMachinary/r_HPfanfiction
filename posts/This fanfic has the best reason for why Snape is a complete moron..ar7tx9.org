  /“So...how come you're been hiding the youngsters from me?”/

  /Dauntless scoffed out loud and said, “You explicitly said you were looking to corrupt them. What did you expect Sirius?”/

  /I frowned a little before responding, “People don't usually pick things like that up.”/

  /His eyebrows disappeared into his hairline when he replied, “Really? Explicitly saying you have dastardly plans isn't supposed to tip people off?”/

  /This time it was my turn to scoff, “Oh, please Nick. Once I actually told a rival of mine I was doing something shady after dark at a specific location. He actually followed me there...things got a little weird after that but still...my point stands.”/

Great story, gotta recommend it to everyone, but it's a crossover with [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][*Worm*]], and it assumes knowledge of both properties.


** The lack of punctuation is killing me.

  “Oh, please Nick"

It sounds so dirty when you don't use commas for protection.

Kids, remember your commas!!!

** I love how Snape is barely referenced, and is still "a complete moron" according to title ^{^}

*** I know, it only needs that minor reference in order to show what a moron he is. It's great writing.

** The lack of punctuation; come on you guys! Also I really hope you are joking, how does this story prove that Snape is a moron? He's not even mentioned, or just barely.

** I always figured Sirius did /something/ beyond what we see in canon to encourage Snape to do what he did that day. Severus may be many things, but he isn't intellectually or logically stupid, which that incident portray him as (and never before or again).

*** Intellectual =/= Savvy

Snape was desperate to find out the Marauders secret. I don't think he took a second to decide to go out there and attempt to expose them. Snape was also a 15 year old boy. Not the 30 year old man we see in the books. Being a spy certainly makes one a lot more savvy and not as willing to jump headfirst into a situation you know nothing about. At age 30, I do not believe Snape would've acted the same way.

**** I was referring to his already existing intellect and pragmatic thinking as a teen. This is someone who fooled one of the most notorious Dark Lords at 17-19ish years old (I highly doubt he wasn't already hiding things when he joined in first place -- or Voldemort would have picked up on his feelings for a muggleborn, treated is as a weakness and demanded it removed). You are obviously correct in that his spying experience makes him more savvy and forced more pragmatic decision making in general, but I still have a hard time believing that he as a 15-16 year old who isn't a Crabbe or Goyle decided "I am going to follow the instructions of a guy who has bullied me for years" without hesitation. It just seems irrational and stupid as a whole.
