When I enter a fandom's FanFiction I generally have a character or scene I want to read so I go on AO3 first and mark the character or pairing I want and sort it by kudos and just make my way down page by page and just go from there in the beginning. How do you start your search? Do you go by the latest updated fic, search a specific scene or trope, or go off of master fic lists or is there another way you start? I'm really curious!


** I've been reading primary in AO3 lately, so my story filtering is specific to that site. If I'm getting into a new fandom because I am interested in a particular pairing I'll search by that first, then filter out specific tags/warnings that I don't enjoy unless I'm in a very specific mood. I limit by completed, no crossovers, English. Once I've been into a fandom a while I'll leave off those limitations, but I don't want my first foray into a fandom to be an incomplete or a crossover. I tend to sort by bookmarks rather than kudos, because I want stories that people not only liked, but liked enough to share or read again to be at the top of the list. Then, like you said, I start going though the pages and read or download anything that catches my fancy.

There's a few pairings that are long-term favorites, and for those I've already done the process above, sometimes multiple times. For those I will filter by newest first and/or allow incomplete works or crossovers so I am more likely to see stories that I haven't read yet.

For some fandoms (like Harry Potter) that I've read a ton of, I'll start at the fandom level and filter out all of the common pairings to see if I can find something new.

There are a couple of fandoms I'm into that I've never actually seen/read the source material, but I was browsing stories filtered by a specific tag rather than a pairing and that fandom kept coming up. So I read a few, liked them, and now I seek them out specifically.

** Actually, lately I don't search for stories at all. I just wait here, what's recommended by others. The results are pretty good so far.

** I more search by exclusion? I think I'm aro but I know Im not all that fond of romance or stories where that's the focus. So searching by pairing doesnt make sense to me? Because I'll deal with any pairing if the story and plot are good.

So I filter by what I don't like. Crossovers, specific pairings, tropes I'm really not fond of. And then I'll sort by either Kudos or Comments and work from there ðŸ˜€.

I find I come across more stories I never would have thought I liked that way ðŸ˜€

** I tend to search for a particular pairing first and then read the first stories whose summaries peak my interest. If i like that story i will read others by that same author (especially if they have the same pairing or others i'm interested in). Then if the site provides the feature i will read stories/authors that the author i just read likes within that same fandom figuring if I liked the first author's work i'm likely to like the stories/authors they like. (Now that's a crapshoot to some extent but i find that often an author writes and reads stories with the same pairings eg., if the author likes writing a Harry/Hermione pairing or a Harry/Tonks pairing then it's a pretty good bet they will recommend/bookmark etc stories or authors who write the same pairings.
