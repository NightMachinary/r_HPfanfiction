  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

********** Not so. I've been reading it- it's decent- and Harry is trained in necromancy, charms, and enchantment before he ever reaches hogwarts. No, he's not a superwizard, but he's described as "leagues ahead" of his classmates, Petri is surprised by his ability to perform certain kinds of magic- stating that he couldn't have done better himself- and Ulrich is utterly astonished by Harry's abilities as a ten year old. It's another one of the many, many fics where he's tutored in magic by some benefactor, with massive amounts of magical theory. So yes, it absolutely fits my description.

I wasn't trying to "pigeonhole the fic into a negative stereotype." I was pointing out that that form of reductionist description is invalid. Lumping fics into simplified, broad categories like that does many writers a massive disservice. While this fic /does/ fit the description of "Harry is found by a powerul wizard who teaches him all about magic long before he gets to Hogwarts," and is even complete with other common tropes from such stories, summing it up with just that sentence would clearly not be a fair description. the same goes for many of the stories which begin at or near the point of canon. Many of the most creative, well written fics I've read start at ysars 1-3, but they're not just another one of the "thousand or so canon rehash fics."

*********** Some reasons why your "reductionist description" is inaccurate (and thus why I said 'wrong on all counts' in my previous comment):

#+begin_quote
  Harry is trained in necromancy, charms, and enchantment before he ever reaches hogwarts. No, he's not a superwizard, but he's described as "leagues ahead" of his classmates,
#+end_quote

Harry's training was deeply specialized to the point that he only knew how to perform the few spells/tasks that Petri needed him to know for his role as unpaid assistant/slave labor. That eventually changed about a year before Harry got his letter, but when he arrives at Hogwarts he is still only 'leagues ahead' of his classmates when it comes to a few particular spells and Petri's extremely spotty coverage of theory. After that point his drive to learn pushes him ahead of most of his yearmates, but not much farther than other similarly enthusiastic students (such as the people in Charms Club).

#+begin_quote
  Petri is surprised by his ability to perform certain kinds of magic- stating that he couldn't have done better himself
#+end_quote

Later in the story someone explains that it's actually extremely common for wizards to have an innate talent for at least one of the many different forms of divination, with a lot of variation in where each person's talent lies. Roughly 50% of wizards have a particular knack for at least one form. In that context, Harry's talent isn't actually very special.

#+begin_quote
  Ulrich is utterly astonished by Harry's abilities as a ten year old. It's another one of the many, many fics where he's tutored in magic by some benefactor, with massive amounts of magical theory. So yes, it absolutely fits my description.
#+end_quote

Ulrich is an unreliable source of information due to his nature at the time of that conversation. His perspective on the matter is unlikely to be accurate, and Harry rightly treats it with skepticism. Also, to call Petri a "benefactor" would be a bizarre misrepresentation of his behavior towards Harry.

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't trying to "pigeonhole the fic into a negative stereotype." I was pointing out that that form of reductionist description is invalid.

#+end_quote

If you meant your previous comment as a 'take that' over my use of the term "canon rehash", then you landed way off base. I don't see anything inherently negative about fics starting at year 1 and/or following the stations of canon. There's also nothing inherently negative about that sort of story being extremely common. "Canon rehash" is simply a descriptive term for a large category of fics that Blood Crest does not fall into. That you assumed the phrase has negative connotations says more about your own opinions than it does mine.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  All Harry knew that day was that his Aunt Petunia had begun to scream. When he came from his cupboard to see what was wrong, he found her sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles. She was gibbering as that evening's three-kilogram chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled through the window and out into the back yard.

  In which Harry Potter animates the dead. Dumbledore disapproves. Other forces... not so much.

Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** You could try linkffn (Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse)

It's not necromancer focus like you may be asking for (grammar check anyone?) but it does have more than a few moments. And does go into some details. Ish. Good read, unfortunately unfinished and seems to be a dead fic.

  Harry Potter walked the corridors of the school angry and pissed off. He was invisible to everyone due to the fact he was wearing his invisibility cloak.

  "Don't bother old man I know the truth. I overheard you last night," Harry cut him off before he could say anything else. "You have betrayed me and my family and now you and the rest of your follows are going to weep the whirlwind you have caused," he shouted.

  Dumbledore glanced in alarm at Snape and McGonagall, before pulling his wand and shouting the stunning curse, as did his fellow Order members. They were shell shocked when the curses failed to strike Harry and seemingly splashed against an invisible shield.

  "Wrong move," Harry hissed, his eyes seeming to glow a fiery green almost like the Avada Kedavra curse itself. "Learning what I did last night combined with everything else in my life, plus a little provocation by Malfoy and his cronies helped unleashed my hidden power," he explained, while raising his right hand. "The power of the Necromancer," he shouted so the whole hall could hear him.

This is so full of bad clichés it reads like a parody.
