looking for great fics that have come out at least semi recently.


** That depends on the type of fics you enjoy. Personally, the only fic that started in the past couple months that I'm following is linkffn(13116300) .

TMR finds himself back in time after his death. Has a few problems that I could pick on, and takes some liberties with his personality. But otherwise was a quite decent read, with good prose and worldbuilding.

#+begin_quote
  As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.

  Voldemort won't kill his Horcrux and Harry can't die any other way. Enter twenty years later and explore the new world. Told from Neville's POV but still very much Harry's story.

** I've been really enjoying this fic which came out in June. Basically 5 versions of Harry (1 same as canon otherwise, 4 slightly AU), can communicate with each other mentally. Other than minor differences in their background their universes all seem to be basically the same, so they help each other with the challenges they end up all facing by sharing information. It does a good job of still being easy to follow while showing the 5 worlds and giving each Harry a distinct personality. Also it seems to update at least once a week which is nice.

** Oldie but goodie (if you're into independent Harry Fics) is "Honor Thy Blood" on Fanfiction.net Harry gets Avada'd in the graveyard scene in GOF and is saved by someone everyone thought was dead, he gets stronger and takes an active role in the Second War; I recommend it to everyone and would reread it anytime.

Maybe not the best but I can't wait for updates. I love how much magic is used, the variety of spells/potions, idk, it kind of makes the magic of HP extra magical. The pairing is tagged but so far the plot's nowhere near that.

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)
