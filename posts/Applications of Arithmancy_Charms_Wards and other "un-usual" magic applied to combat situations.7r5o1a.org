So... im looking for fics that use the not-so-often applied branches of magic,- make em interesting and also apply them for the (hopefully inadvertly coming) action in the fic?

Ah and feel free to throw runes into the mix,- altho ive already red several ones that do the rune-branch pretty good

e: just noticed i went overboard with "applying" apply into this post. Sorry for applying too much.


** There's a story where Harry's pulled to a new dimension and horribly disformed as it happens. He becomes the new divination professor and uses it successfully in combat situations to mcgonagalls disbelief. I forgot the name and i think it's essentially abandoned.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Probably the best ones are The Arithmancer and its sequel, Lady Archimedes, which updates every other Saturday. In these, Hermione is a math prodigy and sometimes even makes use of university-level math to solve problems. However, a deep understanding of math is not needed to enjoy this fanfiction. linkffn(10070079) linkffn(11463030)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765600/1/The-Past-and-Future-War][The Past and Future War]] by AlexDnD. I think. All I remember is the fact Bill does a lot of curse breaking.

linkffn(10765600) Status: Ongoing

Also...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur. The author somehow made Dudley more likable and he throws weaponized potion bottles. Neat fic overall.
