Does anybody else copy down things that sound good to use for themselves? I've accumulated a fair number, waiting for an opportune point in my stories to come along where they'd fit in nicely. Is this a common thing?

I mean I /can/ do my own bon mots, but some of the ones I find seem just so good, so not using them is like ignoring money lying on the ground. But it still makes be feel very guilty.

Here are some examples which I've not yet used.

#+begin_quote
  Her laugh sounded like somebody shoving a stick up a hyena's arse. A shrill ululating squeal, followed by a sharp, high-pitched yelp.
#+end_quote

From somebody on reddit describing an ex.

#+begin_quote
  She looked bored and skeptical, the way a Doberman might look at a growling Chihuahua.
#+end_quote

This comes from a forum comment about an issue of an on-line comic in which a small, but angry character is looking like they want to start a fight with a very big, strong character.

#+begin_quote
  He had the expression of an undertaker who's lost the body.
#+end_quote

This came out of a book. In all fairness, I'm 99% sure the author stole if from elsewhere, so that's Ok then.


** Mostly, it's the opposite. I read something, I see an author do something completely stupid, so I'll try and write a similar scene, except without that jarring nonsense.

**** u/CryptidGrimnoir:
#+begin_quote
  Often when reading something, I go "I could totally write this, except better!"
#+end_quote

But the thing is, it's not the obvious trash only: it can be an actual book from an actual author and I'd still think I could write the same thing except better.

I do that too, and I think it's the mark of a good writer.

Heck John C. Wright was so disgusted that "If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love" won a prestigious Nebula, that he wrote a short story using the same premise

Original: [[https://www.apex-magazine.com/if-you-were-a-dinosaur-my-love/]]

Wright's response. For context, Wright claims to have written his in a single afternoon: [[http://www.scifiwright.com/2014/11/the-queen-of-the-tyrant-lizards/]]

**** I mean, actually books from actual authors are not all made of the same quality, and the majority are gonna be mediocre.

*** I can relate to that. Whenever I read a scene that I don't like I get an idea how I can improve my own stories. For example, while reading a lot of honesty atrocious political scenes I change how I write politics. While never considering "oh shit, the Blacks just reclaimed their Wizengamot seat, guess it's time to bend over" I got rid of stuff like different ranks of the Noble Houses and the idea of a Potter seat.

I removed Neville as a replacement for Ron simply because it has been done a thousand times and instead put Tonks in the best mate/big sister role, changed the main ship to a strong friendship while creating another pairing because I got higher standards and it was not working to my satisfaction and reworked the background story a lot in order to avoid some clich√© elements.

To sum it up I use others as a "how not to" guide instead of copying them.

** I've never taken complete lines, no. A few words in a line that I find humorous or something, a few times, yeah. Like in one of the Thor: Ragnarok trailers where that goddess of Death says "Asgard is dead." I found that line badass so I wrote down in my little 'Dialogue Ideas' section of my notes document, "The Ministry is dead."

I do kinda take ideas though, and use them in my own way. Like in The Lie I've Lived, Harry comforts Fleur, when she's in her little safe haven, in his animagus form and she doesn't know.

In my fic, I'll be having something similar happen. To be fair, I had already thought of it somewhat before I read The Lie I've Lived but it was a rough idea. That story helped me plan the specifics of my own scenario.

*** Kind of related to your 'the Ministry is dead' comment: the Patronus message at the Weasley wedding always sends chills down my spine.

"The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They're coming."

No matter how shitty the MoM was most of the time, they were a bastion of magical society. I got chills just typing it then.

** Hilariously enough the last two quotes work better in the situation described before the quotes. An ex looking completely disinterested and bored by my actions after I run into them would sting & make great fodder for self deprecating humor. And the undertaker quote would segue well (with a bit of tweaking) into a "this guy is looking for a replacement dead body, how about yours?" fight description.

  Good writers borrow from other writers. Great writers steal outright.

Though I think that quote refers to plots, not dialogue.

** With how much exposure we get to creative media nowadays in film, TV, books, comics, video games, hell even music videos, I think it's safe to say I steal a lot, without even realising that I'm doing it.

I've written stuff then looked back a few weeks later and realised that I've half-nicked it from another story or from a moment I saw in a film somewhere, and I've just sort of accepted it as my extremely lacking creative process by now.

** I will admit I copy things but do not publish them on sites. I also do what others do and read something and use the setting or idea in a different way. Though some friends I let read my works will point out I am copying some old fic idea be it a good way by improving or not.

An example I can give is I am working on a spin off of the Mr. Black series and a Beginning a New Path series involving games. Till I finish them I won't ask permission from the original authors because I want them to see the whole idea not just part of it.

** I've never knowingly copied a line of prose in that way apart from a few very short specific quotes from canon. But I have found that a couple of times I have used the same descriptive phrases for the same things from canon without realising, which is a bit embarrassing and one day I will either rewrite those bits or get rid of the story depending on how real life plays out. But I would never, ever do it deliberately.

** Everybody seems a lot more conscientious and honest then me. I suppose the slight guilty feeling I get is justified.

It is something to think about, given I am writing strictly for my own amusement. . I should be presenting the best writing the I can do, and just see how that goes.
