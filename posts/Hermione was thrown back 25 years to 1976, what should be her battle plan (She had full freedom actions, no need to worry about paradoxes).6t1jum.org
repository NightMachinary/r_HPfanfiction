EDIT1: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t1jum/hermione_was_thrown_back_25_years_to_1976_what/dlh9s6f/][Very good points]] from [[/u/play_the_puck]]. I agree that her very presence in this new time line, even without any action, could cause things to diverge. Under this uncertainty, how could she best employ her future knowledge, maximize her own gains, and minimize losses on her side?

EDIT2: A major point is whether Dumbledore could be trusted. If the answer was yes, then the overall task would be significantly easier, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]. If not, then things would be harder. However, it was ALWAYS a good idea to write an anonymous letter to Dumbledore about Horcruxes and their suspected locations, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]], a Wormtail time travel fic.


** Disregard my earlier idiotic comment...

There's a big decision involved in these time travel scenarios (and I think both paths have a lot of merit):

1. Try to change as little as possible, so that you can use your knowledge of the future at the most appropriate time (research how to trap a spirit for 15 years and catch Voldemort when he's at Hogwarts, keep him contained forever, the end)

2. Screw that and just go crazy (make Trelawney go away, offer a lucrative potions scholarship for Snape in the States, accidentally kill a rat and reimburse the Weasleys for their loss, destroy a few Horcruxes... see what other opportunities develop)

I'm really not sure which of these two is better... comes down to pragmatism vs idealism.

*** 1) working relies on history repeating itself exactly as Hermione remembers, which is pretty problematic when it comes to free will implications. Why would everyone make the exact same decisions as in the original timeline? What if a spell that missed originally hit its target this time and the Potters die before their time? If Hermione isn't required by Time and Magic to not create paradoxes, then the new timeline can diverge without her interference as well.

*** I don't think it does come down to pragmatism vs. idealism. You have two kinds of knowledge:

- Knowledge about the state of things right now (1976)
- Knowledge about what might happen.

If you change the state, what might happen will obviously change. However, is the knowledge of the state of things in 1976 enough to win the war? If so: How?

If not, the only alternative is to completely avoid mutating the state in 1976 - this would only be possible by becoming a hermit - and then, at a more favorable point in time (November 1981), go ahead and mutate the history as quickly as possible, and using all your knowledge.

As soon as you start visibly altering the state, you can't really rely on your knowledge of anything about the future.

In 1976 I'd try to remove myself as far as possible from the situation, and hope that James and Lily die the same way, looking for hints that things develop differently than last time.

As soon as Voldemort dies I would try to work together with Albus Dumbledore to remove the Horcruxes and make sure that Voldemort stays vanquished. If I notice things going any different (someone I know to be alive in the future dies, ...) I would try to give a few selected individuals (Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore, Flitwick, Newt Scamader, ...) all the information I have.

** Since Harry is a child of prophecy, it's likely that event are going to play out a certain way regardless of how Hermione changes things. Harry will be born to those that defied Voldemort three times, etc.

I think that Hermione memory charms the Dursleys and sends them to Majorca after ensuring that they live healthier, less abrasice lives. Then she assumed the identity of Petunia and adopts Harry as her own before raising him in a manner that will allow him to "safely" complete the prophecy before he goes off to Hogwarts.

******* The prophecy made in Hermione's old time line was meaningless because Voldemort in this time didn't know it. If Snape hadn't reported it to Voldemort, then the last one would have been equally meaningless.

So should she wait until 1980 for Trelawney to make the same one as before? How could she be certain that the prophecy would remain the same? Her very presence in this new time line could very well cause a NEW prophecy to be made.

To be frank, I don't give a damn about the prophecy. I only want to know the most efficient plan to defeat Voldemort and his minions.

2. Expose Voldemort's half blood heritage and somehow neuter the power of purebloods. Anonymous tips to an up and coming Mad-Eye or Rufus might help take out some of the bigger supporters.

Further, the minister/commander in chief personally ordering the arrest of an individual that was previously expelled (but not tried, presumably because he was a juvenile and deemed not a threat with no wand, or something) from the only magic school in the country for indirectly killing another student in similar circumstances (which sounds like probable enough cause to detain someone until you can get a grand jury to indict them or something) is a bit different than sending an anonymous tip to what amounts to a rising star in the police force.

Further, what good does revealing Voldemort's half-blood status do? His followers are radical terrorists that have been branded with his mark. They're not going to suddenly stop following him because it turns out he's a half-blood, they're just going to rationalize it.

** tell dumbledore everything give him her memories in a vial, let him use Legilimency and Veritaserum and if nescesarry let him place her her under a unbreakable vow that she will do what ever is necessary to get rid of voldemort.

That is the most logical thing to do for hermione in a situation like that because he is much more powerful than her in every way that matters and she doesn't really have any reason to mistrust him. the only question is how much hermione knows? because I doubt harry told her everything about dumbledore and what effect seeing the resurection stone has on him( I assume that dumbldore could find out the location of the stone by himself) So its probable that dumbledore would die much earlier than in canon and may even become to weak to protect hogwarts on his own. So its possible that even if they manage to make voldemort mortal they wouldn't be able to to kill him once and for all. One way they could try would be to try having voldemort offer somebody(preferably hermioine or dumbledore) a chance to give up their lifes for somebody they love. Voldemort who doesent know about love protection would attack the other(s) anyway and die(or not)

*** Time travel is a major genre in the HP fandom, so it makes sense to discuss this topic here on [[/r/HPFanfiction]].

There are mainly three time travel mechanisms:

1. Time turner: travelers' freedom of actions is severely limited. Paradoxes are a major risk, so it's my least favorite form of time travels.

2. Memory: travelers send their memories and powers back to their younger self. The limitation is how far they can go back. Hermione to Marauder Era doesn't work with this mechanism.

3. Alternate dimensions: it offers travelers maximum freedom of actions. They can also retain their original physical bodies. However, the new dimension may differ in minor or major details, and that introduces new challenges for them. Their advance knowledge might not be useful or even counterproductive in cases.

--------------

Hermione in Marauder Era is done fairly often. Her advantages in this time are however limited. For examples, most horcrux locations are unknown at this time, and enemy compositions are also less clear to her. On the other hand, she could find new, competent allies in the Marauders, Longbottoms, and Boneses. She could also prevent Peter from defecting and Severus from joining Voldemort.

** I think it depends on what age she was when she's thrown back in time. If she's a teenager, she can be the "rare Hogwarts transfer student." Otherwise, if she is older (post DH), then she has to make herself known and try to join the Order.

As a teen, she can influence students around her, causing some to not join the Death Eaters (Snape, Regulus, Peter, Barty). She could easily be recruited after Hogwarts like the Marauders.

If Hermione is older when sent back in time, then she should try to pass off as a Seer to the Order and guide them. This is dependent on how much Hermione knew about the First Wizarding War prior to her time travel. She should still target Horcruxes (with the help of Dumbledore).

Since there is no chance of paradox, there doesn't have to be canon pairings that we know of. I think Hermione would want to orchestrate the circumstances in which Harry would be born.

She would debate letting James and Lily survive, because she has the best chance of procuring Horcruxes while Voldemort is temporarily defeated and weak.

Interference seems to be likely to disturb the unique set of circumstances that allowed Harry to defeat Voldemort. Without that method they would have to defeat Voldemort in a conventional magical duel, which it is not clear is possible.

Even if her future knowledge allowed the rapid destruction of Voldemort's horcruxes and organization, you still have to defeat the man himself. Something that Dumbledore cannot do.

*** Interesting point.

On the other hand, consider it from Voldemort's point of view: he is now mortal again, but he can't make any more horcruxes. It's not clear whether or not he knows the fate that awaits him after death, but, in any case, his pathological fear of death will make him /very/ risk-averse. This means that defeating him personally might be something that won't even be necessary at that point; or, perhaps, a surrender could be negotiated.

That said, a plan that would save lives net-net, but is also very much a "Hard (Wo)Man making Hard Decisions while Hard" plan, might go something like this:

1. Change as little as possible until the Halloween of 1981.
2. Give Dumbledore the knowledge-dump, /but/ don't tell him that Harry is a horcrux.
3. Help him eliminate all other horcruxes.
4. Walk into 4 Privet drive and kill Harry. (Since Hermione didn't kill any of his relatives after offering to spare them, she can do it.)
