I didn't get into fanfiction until many years after the end of the movies, so I missed the age of fanfics before the books were all out. My only interaction with fanfiction at that time was a friend of my brother that said he had found a leaked copy of book seven online (it was a fanfic) and that was it.

So now I am interested to see what I missed from the pre DH, HBP, and even OotP era. I'd prefer pre HBP, but am still interested in pre DH as well. I'd like both the fics that have aged well through the changing fandom and fics that may have not (through now overused tropes, etc) as long as the writing is good. I'd especially like interesting, cool, and reasonable ideas of what people thought “the power he knows not” could be.

Thanks!

*** I have to second this recommendation with far more than a simple upvote can provide. This fic, and the trilogy as a whole, has a far more realistically mature feel to it than probably no less than 90% of fics currently being written. The plot has more nuance, polish and planning to it than all but one of the 91 fics that have been updated in the last 24 hours (that appear in FFN based on my filters). There is a proper building of mystery and suspense leading to twist/revelation leading to climax.

** I always enjoy a chance to recommend linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). Unfortunately unfinished, but it's a healthy length and does wrap up a decent amount of the plot, with some fascinating divergences from canon because of when it was written (pre-OOTP to pre-HBP). It's essentially a massive AU from 5th year on and I think the author did a great job of keeping magic /magical/. It has my favorite "Power he knows not" of any fic I've read and some amazing side characters: Moody gets fleshed out very nicely, there's an amazing villain in the OC Gallowbraid, a highly original Nicolas Flamel, and more! I really can't recommend it enough.

For a less effusive recommendation, you could check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded). I just finished this recently and will hesitantly recommend it. It has some very cool ideas, but wraps up the story poorly and doesn't follow through on the potential of most of the ideas the author laid out. It's also needlessly dark by the end of the story. However, the execution is technically sound and it's another interesting look at how someone writing pre-HBP fanfiction viewed the HP world.
