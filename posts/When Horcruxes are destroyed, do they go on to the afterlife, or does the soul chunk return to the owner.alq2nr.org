** The soul-shards certainly don't return to the person --- only the person experiencing remorse for the murder that created the Horcrux will allow the broken soul to be rejoined.

What /does/ happen to them is a bit up in the air. What Hermione reads from Dumbledore's book in /Deathly Hallows/ suggests that the soul-shard ceases to exist altogether, but the one shard whose fate we know for sure --- Scardemort --- instead seems to be stuck in limbo forever, without enough psychic strength to move into the Afterlife, nor to come back to the world as a ghost. (This is canonically the fate of the main Lord Voldemort himself.) Some think that was a special case, with the Horcrux only getting that far because it had hitched a ride with Harry's soul, but most likely it's the case with every Horcrux and Hermione's book was wrong/misunderstood.

** Dumbledore mentions that for the souls to merge back together the caster has to feel profound remorse for their actions.

*** Indeed. From what I understood. They can't get to afterlife as they're not whole but they won't come back to the caster either as he needs to feel deep remorse of his action for that. I think they will either be stuck in-between as was the soul shard in Harry's scar or just be destroyed but no ghosting possible or "next great adventure"/"going on" as one might expect after death if not staying as a ghost.

I would even say that, if the Resurrection Stone is indeed real (as opposed to one that would only show you what your subconscious expects to see) and summoning the departed souls from beyond, it wouldn't be able to get Tom's soul as it's incomplete and not really in the afterlife.

** We actually see this play out in canon in book 7 with the destruction of Harry's scar Horcrux. The whole scene at 9 3/4 seems to be a gateway to the afterlife and the Horcrux was also present there. Meaning that the destroyed piece of soul passes on to that point. What happens with it there is anyone's guess
