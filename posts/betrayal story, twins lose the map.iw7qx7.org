:END:
so there was a story i read a while ago. and i cant remember what its called. i do know the weasley twins burn harrys stuff or something over a perceived slight, or the tournament or something. anyways after this happens the map doesn't work for the twins anymore since they betrayed harry, and they give it back to him. i think the map also says that lupin is toeing the line of betrayal. ore something. anyways, hope someone knows, i remember licki6ng that fic


** No I read this once too it was bc of the chamber and he was chased off c everyone thought he was the heir of slitherin and then Sirius is taken out of azcaban ( spelled wrong) and Dumbledore sends Lupin to find Harry after Sirius has already found him and he's “toeing the line” out of inactivity I can't remember where it comes from either but this might help

  The fallout from the Dueling Club was worse than in Canon and leads to the release of one Sirius Black from Azkaban. And he is not amused. 1 SLASH couple.
