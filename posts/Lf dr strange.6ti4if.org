A crossover featuring dr strange, please. Length doesn't matter, but grammer does.


** He's in the two "Son of the Archer" stories. He doesn't have a very big role in the first one, though he is the one who introduces Ron (who in this story was kidnapped as a baby and through circumstances ended up adopted by movieverse-Hawkeye) to magic. He's got a larger role in the second story, mentoring Ron through shared dreams while Ron's at Hogwarts.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** I don't know if I'd call him a /massive/ player. That makes me think he's a primary protagonist, which he is not. He's got a very important part to play but was mostly absent from the first story. In the sequel he has a larger role however.
