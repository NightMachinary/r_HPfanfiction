*** Many times, I'd agree with you. But there are also a lot of pranks that are done very well, and are the ones I'm curious about.

murkybluematter has written thoughtful and creative prank scenes that I've enjoyed (bathroom grape juice, school-wide notes). Her take on pranks is mostly what I'm thinking of -- ones that are decidedly not malicious, and designed to create a happy atmosphere. Pranks that include everyone, require effort, and expand on uses for magic. Another example was a fic where a Hogwarts hallway was enchanted to not let anyone pass unless they tapped out "God Save the Queen" across musically-charmed tiles. I'm not impressed by the magical equivalent of a whoopee cushion, no, but the ones that are absolutely riveting and effective for the story.

** I have to agree partly with what was said above: pranks sometimes derail the story too much, making it look silly.

Anyway, there's a funny one that I remember (although not very innovative) : Harry had somehow put a spell on Snape, and whenever he entered a room his cape would billow wildly and the Batman's theme would be heard from ... somewhere around. Not sure of what story that was from.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

**** It's one of my most favorite fanfics ever, I didn't like the last/fourth part as much as the rest, but especially the second part is worth it on its own, and even the last part still had great things in it.

The way bonds and life debts work is a big part of the story, and I really like the way both were done here. I can't say too much without spoiling things, but they're well worked out concepts in this story. No two kids kissing creating a soul bond or anything like that.
