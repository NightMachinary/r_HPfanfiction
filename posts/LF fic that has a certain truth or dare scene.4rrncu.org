In the story Harry is playing truth or dare with the quitich team and after some drinking he gets dare into trying to steal the underwear from I think Susan bones. After somehow managing to get there she wakes up to him crying because he freaks out saying he couldn't do it and ruin her peace of mind or something like that. I just remembered liking that scene.


** I seem to think Sirius planned the twins getting him drunk

** Is it linkffn(Padfoot, Docteur D'amour by Fibinaci)? If not, I think this has a similar scene.

  Complete, Sirius thinks Harry could do with some female attention but his efforts lead to more than he might have been willing to bargain for, both for Harry and himself.
