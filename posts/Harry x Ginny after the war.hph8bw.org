:END:
Hi all. What's that post-battle fanfiction that centers around harry x ginny? Some events that happen early on are Dumvledore's Army meeting at shell cottage to formally disband and the weasely siblings all hanging out on the roof of the burrow to talk about and remember Fred. The story begins immediately after the battle and ron and hermione sleep in the same room as harry in the boy's dormitory tower. Ron and hermione leave for australia and theres a separate story about that

The author has also written another separate story of young ginny being very cute with her brothers
