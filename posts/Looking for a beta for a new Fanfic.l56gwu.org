** Well first off, good luck with your story. It's always good to see new stories appearing.

But. This needs far, far more than a beta. You've got "Deathly Hollows" rather than "Deathly Hallows" in the summary, and that's only the beginning.

I don't know what those exam scores are. It *looks* like Harry's OWL results (given the astronomy, herbology, etc scores being present) but if so, how come he's graduating at this point? How come the final battle has been fought? Why is he getting those results while at Hogwarts? Why have you leveled Harry's scores up without explanation?

You have Harry recognising the people on stage with McGonagall and then repeat their names again, which seems like padding. You introduce "Magistra Verpara" and then call her "Magtirsa" seven times just below. There are dozens of spelling mistakes throughout, culminating in the brilliant "See you shorty". The grammar is often incorrect too.

And of course you say the story is rated MA, which is a classification explicitly banned from ffn.

Chapter one is only 1400 words and if I were to beta it, I'd end up pretty much rewriting it rather than editing what's there.

I wonder if it might be better if you find someone willing to become a co-author, where they do most of the actual writing while you come up with the majority of the plot?

*** I have to second this.

I was a beta for a few people. I saw my role as the final editor. Like, the author thought they had a publishable product, and I was the final set of eyes.

If an author sent me something that was absolutely riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, I'd be insulted. That would tell me you didn't even bother to re-read your work and run it through spell check, which is the author's job, and the absolute */bare minimum/* an author should do before sending the work to a beta.

Don't forget, a beta's job can be pretty thankless. Comments and kudos for the story will always go to the author, even though a fantastic beta can have a profound impact on making a story better. A beta has all of the work and none of the credit. The only real credit and appreciation a beta gets is from the author.

By not even proofreading your work, you're telling me that my time is worth less than yours, which is disrespectful.

Now, if this story does represent your best effort at proofreading, you need to develop some new techniques to get it up to an acceptable level, /before/ you look at finding a beta.

A few suggestions: read your story out loud. Sometimes when reading silently, your mind can subconsciously fill in errors and skip over mistakes, but that tends to happen less when you actually read it out loud. Or instead of proofreading on the computer screen, print out the story, and edit it that way. I often find just looking at the story in a different format is enough of a “jolt” for my brain to start looking critically at what I've written. I'm sure there are other techniques you can find online if you don't like those.

Best of luck.
