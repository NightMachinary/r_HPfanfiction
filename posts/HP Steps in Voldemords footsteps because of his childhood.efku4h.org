** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): When the Ministry and Wizengamot turned out to be incorrigible after Voldemort's defeat, Harry snapped, declared himself the new Dark Lord, and began with vigilante killings of remaining Death Eaters. Unlike in most other dark!Harry fics, Hermione, Ron, the Weasleys, and most DA veterans are standing resolutely behind him.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
