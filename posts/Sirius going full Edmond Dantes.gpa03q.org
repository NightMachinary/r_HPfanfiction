There's a lot of "Harry goes to Azkaban because of some bullshit and gets revenge" fics, but I haven't seen the same for Sirius, who actually DID go to Azkaban. Are there any Edmond Dantes style Sirius fics?


** Ish. I've read a few where he changes his name at some point. One of them he straight up persuaded Fudge that he was Stubby Broadman and got him to sign over all of his stuff to himself. And that's the snag, because all of the Sirius-y fics that I've read are comedy.

** Are "Harry wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban and breaks free to wreak his awesome revenge" fics just shitty Count of Monte Cristo knockoffs? Or is the Count of Monte Cristo really just a revenge wank "Harry wrongfully imprisoned" style story masquerading as classic literature?

*** I await to see the day where someone writes a decent "escape from Azkaban and revenge" fic, there's certainly some potential there, especially for Sirius who would have access to the Black gold, he could learn from another innocent prisoner, impersonate someone, escape and wreak havoc on Crouch and whoever he thinks is responsible while searching for Peter AND helping Harry.

For Harry it would have to be a bit different(he is young), maybe he is arrested for the whole CoS fiasco, meets Sirius in Azkaban, they both see Peter in the newspaper and they both escape and wreck whoever is responsible for their imprisonment (maybe Malfoy).

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!

*** The commentary I wrote on FFnet:

#+begin_quote
  Congratulations, you managed to write a story, where the only true heroes are Ron and Hermione. After all, they were right, Sirius in your story corrupted Harry until he was worse than Voldemort. Protecting criminals, including murderers of his parents, and protecting them from punishment of all other crimes, makes both Sirius and Harry accessories to their crimes. Good ol' Tommy was right, there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.

  Is that what you meant, or did I misunderstand you somewhere?

*** Ok, but how is his interactions with Harry. I can believe him wanting revenge on Remus, Dumbledore, and such, but is this a revenge fic just for the sake of revenge, or does it actually seem believable. There's zero reason for him to hate Harry, heck I could see them kind of bonding over their "prisons," Azkaban, and Durzkaban.

**** Fatherly. Harry takes him from the Dursleys, they get on well and eventually Sirius adopts Harry via the obligatory adoption ritual.

One thing I'll mention is that I've read this story several times and today when I looked over it, it seems to have been changed in some ways. There were scenes that I don't remember. I didn't look too closely to see if things had been removed.
