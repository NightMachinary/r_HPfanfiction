Im sure we have all seen the fics with Remus bashing, and wondered; why did Remus never check up on Harry? Why didn't he contact Harry when he started Hogwarts? Why didnt he tell Harry he knew his parents in 3'rd year or contact him in 4'th?

And im sure a lot of us have seen fics (particularly Dumbledore bashing) where it is explained away.

So im looking for a fic where Harry sits down at breakfast on september 2'nd in first year and promptly recieves a Letter from Moony desperate to get to know his best friends son now that the mailwards no longer block mail from the wizarding world, and if he wants to know stories about his parents, want to meet, etc etc etc. Then hopefully Moony takes him away from the dursleys because fuck everyone else, Harry is family. With him becoming a father figure and confidant to Harry.

Anything like that? With a Moony that was blocked from Harry by dark creature wards and mailwards and now come in like an avenging angel that is gonna do right by his cub?


** "Remus Lupin, PI" should fit your request.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

  Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house.

** It would be nice to see a story about how Remus was working behind the scenes to keep Harry safe. I'd read that.
