Ive read quite a few Fanfictions in which Harry is Loki by rebirth or is possed by Loki or gets wild with Loki. Probably because girls tend to like the look of the actor of Marvel Loki. Whatever.

I am looking for fanfictions, no matter how little words, about Harry (Lightningbolt-Scar, cmon!) as Odin, Thor or Zeus incarnate/child of them.

And I need to note at this point: I have a strong dislike for the Marvelverse.

*** So I wasn't on the Hiddleston train until I saw him in Kong Skull Island. As Loki he's so pasty and greasy, but in Kong he had color and clean hair. Suddenly I understand!

** Though he's not Odin, Thor, or Zeus, I wrote a couple that have similar power stakes for Harry. You might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this link]] [[/spoiler][Harry as Cthulhu]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][this other]] [[/spoiler][Harry as Chuck Norris's son]].

Neither should be read though; both are quite horrible.

*** Ah indeed, I have most of them. While they were quite fun to read, they were more like fix-it fanfictions from different POVs, I think.

**** A kinda massive multi-story idea.

From the TVTropes summary:

/Take the Harry Potter from the prologue of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. He performs the same ritual, except something goes wrong; instead of being sent back in time, he becomes detached from any one reality, kind of a cross between Quantum Leap and Sliders. He drifts around the multiverse, encounters pretty much every fanfic trope on the list, and helps where he can and how he can, sometimes with something big, like directly destroying all of Voldemort's horcruxes, sometimes with something small, like a few words of advice to nudge a character away from the path of evil. He doesn't know what he needs to do in a given universe. Once he has accomplished his intended task he (involuntarily) moves on amidst phoenix song and a prolonged flash of blue light. Sometimes the main reason he is in a universe is to acquire an item or piece of knowledge that he needs in his next destination./

It all starts here: linkffn(2673584) and then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2198557/dunuelos][Dunuelos]] expanded on the idea.

  After spending half his life trying to rid the world of Voldemort, Harry Potter finally succeeds. However, the price has been high. Too high. Unfortunately, when Harry risks his life to go back and ‘do things right', something goes wrong...

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What will a God do now it has lived life from the perspective of a human, will this lead to good things or bad?
