Things that are common in many fics or that made a big impression on you from a fic and took root in your head as canonical.

The first one that strikes me is Lavender Brown surviving the Battle of Hogwarts. I genuinely am unsure if that's canon or not. What's one that always gets you?

** I think it often surprises me just how little development so many side-characters had. Fanfiction built some sort of go-to personality for so many characters, its hard to be accurate. Its rather simple when it comes to Daphne, or Tracy... but its really weird how little development even some Order members had. Tonks, for example, is barely a 3 dimensional character in the books, but fanfiction built /so much/ onto her, I caught myself making a lot of assumptions from fanon.

Pepper-Up Potion is actually not a magical uber-coffeine shot, but merely a cure for colds and (probably) hypothermia.

*** My head canon says that Voldemort's uprising was a reaction to Nobby Leach being elected to Minister, and Dumbledore was the driving force behind granting more rights to Muggleborns. Voldemort originally feared Dumbledore and wanted to avoid a direct confrontation with him. Since Voldemort had his horcruxes, he could simply outlast Dumbledore. But with Nobby Leach, reactionary Purebloods feared they could no longer afford to wait.

As long as Dumbledore exerted strong influences, the British Ministry was holding up Muggleborn rights, probably more so than any other magical nations. It could explain Muggleborns' complacency despite Voldemort's return. So when the Ministry suddenly moved against them, too many were caught off guard.

Umbridge was not originally known to be anti-Muggleborns, being a half-blood herself. She had been taking the rather popular anti Werewolf stance for a long time. But people like her would do ANYTHING to gain more power.

The War itself was mainly fought between ideologically opposed Purebloods, who dominated the DA, the Order, and Voldemort's Inner Circle. Known Muggleborn participation, apart from Hermione, Dean, and Justin, was nonexistent.

***** Voldemort brought out most hardcore blood purists from the shadow and they got destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts.

Voldemort also destroyed large numbers of 'Old Families' on the opposing side.

The result was a huge power vacuum after the War. The Ministry's own forces had to be decimated as well since Voldemort even drafted Minister Thickness to the frontline. The only credible and organized military after the Battle was the Order and the DA. Hogwarts, being the only school in magical Britain and key to its future, was now solidly in Harry's camp. As more and more students of their generation made into positions of power, the less and less influence believers of blood purity would have.

On the blood purity side, there were also significant defections. By the time Hermione became Minister, former blood purity die-hard, the Malfoys, was firmly on the 'enlightened' side.

The subject is kind of odd when you think about it, it's just a class where they learn to read runes from ancient civilisations, likely to be able to decode spells from those periods of time. But runes in most fiction consist of channelling magic through a certain 'template' for an effect (Eg, In Elder Scrolls Games you can place a Fire Rune in front of yourself and whoever treads on it gets blasted away).

*** thats because fanfiction take a harry potter subject and give it the fantasy treatment, runes was always an intresting subject, especially when you have true names in magic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name]].

its the whole base of knowing how to use fire rune give you a control over fire becuase you used magical language for it.

**** It is a quality of phoenix feather core wands, actually. They can be used to cast at least some of the simpler spells when not held but simply in proximity. It's part of why they are called “independent” wands.

Edit: Since I don't remember where exactly I'd found this particular bit and it is not the source I'd thought it was, and the source could very well be an off-handed remark of Madame Rowling's in some interview in which she did, at least once, make conflicting statements which makes the canonicity of stuff said in them possibly dubious, feel free to disregard this claim that I made as nonsense if you want.

******* I believe what I read is the same source as yours; it first came from Pottermore when the site came out, it's among some of the earliest Pottermore material to be released. This is the relevant excerpt I just found:

"This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike."

Doesn't mention anything about casting simpler spells simply by being in close proximity though, just that they tend to have initiative.

******** Hmm ... I've gotten the sources confused then, I do know there was a word about it but if it's not that article then it could be pretty much anything.

That said, with my luck that “anything” could very well be something Madame Rowling just off-handedly mentioned in some interview (I did get through as many of them as I could at one time, looking for ... something, I don't remember what it was), which would make its canonicity doubtful---as she did, in at least one case, give two different and pretty much mutually exclusive answers about the same thing (the Hogwarts letters)---so feel free to disregard my claim about it being about the wand core as nonsense if you want because I do know at least some people, including myself, treat stuff she said in interviews that pertains to the actual lore as a possibility but not absolute truth, and some other people pay no mind whatsoever to stuff she said in them. And, as lazy as it may sound, I really don't want to expend the effort on looking through all of my history only to find out that it indeed was just the case and the source was, sadly, of dubious quality due to the aforementioned example.

Oh well, I hope you will not take it as any kind of sarcasm when I spend a line complaining that sometimes finding the actual truth in the so-called truth inserted into the lore of this particular series can be a right nightmare.

*** Yeah, what exactly the purpose is behind Ancient Runes and Arithmancy is one of those strange things where I actually hate the JKR explanation.

In truth her magical system is very... I wouldn't say poorly constructed, but barely constructed at all. In a way it takes the Tolkien approach where it is inherently mysterious and somewhat unknowable. At this level it makes sense for Ancient Runes to just be a language course and Arithmancy to be a slightly less hogwash version of Divination.

On the other hand, the whole precise pronunciation of incantations and precise wand movement bit makes it feel like a more logical and robust magical system more akin to the Kingkiller Chronicle and so forth. Looking from this angle, it is perfectly understandable that we would like to see a scientific approach to protection (wards), objects (enchantments), and spell creation. These seem like things Hermione would be interested in more than a different kind of Divination, so... Arithmancy and Ancient Runes.

JKR's magic is almost boring in many ways, and there are two things that have found I hate in fics: HP movie-esque magical guns (no incantations or wand movements), and when several chapters go by without the main character using or mentioning magic. It's a magical fucking world, show me some magic. I'm a sucker for romance and fluff, but the setting is still magical in nature.

**** Yeah the magic system is very vague-which is fine it works for the story. It becomes more of a problem when people are writing fics, and don't know how to explore the magical aspect of the world. For this reason I'm perfectly okay with people adding depth to subjects (Runes, Astronomy and Arithmancy) that wasn't in the books and is not consistent with Pottermore.

Although, I've always imagined that Arithmancy has more of a place in rituals and such (magic numbers such as 7) then it's common fanfic application as spell creation.
