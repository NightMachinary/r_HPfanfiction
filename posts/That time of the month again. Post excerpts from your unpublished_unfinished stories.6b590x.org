Behold. A bit from my secret shame: a genderbend, romance focused fem!Harry/Tom Riddle story. FemMoD!Harry (going by Lily Hart) goes back in time to convince Tom not to become Voldemort.

••

Not long into their journey the compartment door slid open to reveal a pair of older boys with sneers apparently permanently stuck to their faces. They had ordered the two first years out, but it was only when the uglier one used the word "mudbloods" that Lily had shown any sign of hearing them.

"No, no. I think I like this compartment. Tom? Do you like this compartment?" She asked casually. He eyed her for a moment, then nodded.

"Yes, I think I do as well." He expected her to tell them to leave once she got his backing but instead she looked to her owl.

"Hedwig? Do you like the compartment?" The owl gave a screech. Smart bird. "There. It seems we have more votes than you. Oh! Hold on, I forgot someone. Tom? Will you ask Jörmungandr if he likes the compartment?" Lily drew the snake from where it had been curled on her lap and Tom's lips quirked into a cruel smile at the sound of the two teens stifling gasps.

"Of course," he said. If he'd thought their reaction to the snake was amusing, their reaction to him speaking to it was even better.

"Oh Merlin," one of them muttered, voice a mix of horror and awe.

"He said he's very comfortable. Why didn't you just ask him yourself?" Lily smiled.

"Parseltongue makes my throat hurt," she said and he knew she was lying, but their guests apparently didn't.

"Both of them?!" The ugly one whispered.

"There. Four to two. I'm afraid you've been outvoted. Goodbye." As if her words were a spell of their own, the two boys fled the compartment without looking back, slamming the door behind them. Lily giggled and her wide smile was back. "That was fun, wasn't it?" She laughed.


** Here's the start of my Harry/fem!Harry, and also the only thing written for it so far. It's just a few paragraphs summarizing the events of the summer before the encounter that leads to the meeting of Harry and fem!Harry.

--------------

The first days of July had brought to Surrey an unprecedented heat wave, from which the people of Little Whinging had shielded themselves by staying indoors. Ever since Harry had returned to Privet Drive, he had scarcely seen a cloud in the sky, so he was quite relieved when he woke up to the sound of rain against his bedroom window. After he'd hauled himself downstairs to grab a slice of plain toast---his usual breakfast---he decided that not all was well with the rain.

Following the events that had taken place at the end of his fourth year, he had fallen into the habit of obsessively listening to the news. The Dursleys did not permit him to do this, but he'd been able to figure out a trick. In light of the striking heat, the Dursleys had opted to leave their windows open during the day to let in the breeze. By lying down in the garden next to the window, he was able to overhear the news on the television. To his immense frustration, he'd not once heard a report that could have hinted at any wizard activity, and hardly anything newsworthy in the first place.

Now that it was raining, he couldn't listen to the news at all. He was as glad as anyone to have some respite from the heat and drought, but he wasn't about to lie down in the pouring rain to listen to the news presenters drone on about cats who love to swim or other such stories.

He busied himself with homework for the majority of the day, stopping only at lunchtime and in the afternoon, when he received a letter from a rather grumpy-looking owl. He suspected the rain had rather soured its mood. He gave it some leftover bread to cheer it up before it flew off.

** My WIP is a Post Deathly Hallows murder mystery.

*The Logline is*:

Six years after the Battle of Hogwarts, war veterans from both sides begin to die in increasingly violent and suspicious circumstances. Are they simply unrelated incidents, as The Ministry asserts, or is something more sinister afoot, as Hermione begins to suspect? When someone unexpected returns to Hermione's life, will they prove to be an ally in her investigation - or a stone cold killer?

*Excerpt*:

The warm sun against her cheeks felt wonderful as she turned into Lymden Lane and immediately spied her destination. The main building was the first cottage in a row of small redbrick townhouses, Number 1 (which was closest to her) had a white weatherboard extension which looked like a home office or perhaps an artist's studio, with a large picture window facing her, a midnight blue mug steamed on the window sill.

“Good,” she thought “someone is at home.”

As Hermione was walking up to the front door, she could hear whistling and a radio blaring. She lifted her hand to the heavy brass knocker, but she stopped short, as something faintly electric whispered across the skin of her fingertips, a chilly sense of unease settling into the pit of her stomach. She stepped back into the roadway and ran a careful eye over the building's façade. Nothing. She scanned the street, but it lay quiet, even the birds had stilled, and the world felt like it was holding its breath as she drew her wand.

“Aparecium” she whispered.

There was no response. She shook her head and tucked her wand away again. Perhaps the mysterious charmed object she was here investigating was responsible for that merest breath of magic. “The sooner it's safely contained the better if that is the case,” she thought. So with fresh determination, she seized the door knocker, but in the heartbeat between lifting it and hearing it thump against the wood of the door, the feather light touch came again, running across her palms and up her arms, raising the hair like static electricity. A thought rang bell-like through the vaulted confines of her mind. “Something extraordinary is about to happen”.

A second or two later the door was opened by a smiling, dark-haired, man that for the briefest instant her eyes refused to recognise, and then she was looking down the length of his wand pointing at her, his dark eyes cold, and flat. She hadn't even seen him move.

“No,” he said in a steady voice that held no fear or malice, only an implacable resolve.

** Currently writing a Slytherin!Harry fic. I have the whole plot planned, now just putting flesh to the bones. Here's a bit from September in first year:

“Did you hear what Malfoy said?” Daphne asked. “He said you were trying to get back at him, which means he is admitting he did something.”

“Could be about Tracey though,” said Theo.

“But we don't have to make anyone else think that,” said Harry. “What do you think Filch would do for Malfoy's detention if he knew who gave him the note that got Professor Sprout upset with our poor old caretaker?”

“Oh, please tell Filch! Please tell him!” begged Daphne, laughing.

Harry nodded as seriously as he could. “It would be the honourable thing to do. We should thank him for the tour and let him know that we have a possible lead on the note writer. How he takes it and what he does with it is up to him. Same as what happened with Tracey -- we are not guilty for what others do with information we provide.”

** Idea for a Dresden Files Crossover:

The cavern was lit brightly, lanterns and lights strung around the room, and it should have been brightly lit, with only a few small shadows. Instead, the lights seemed to be powerless against the darkness. Not the natural darkness of the cavern, but the darkness that its inhabitants had within their souls.

On a stone altar, a girl was struggling, her school uniform ripped and bloodied. Her blonde hair was stained with dirt and blood, the make-up she had been wearing smeared and running with tears, snot and still more crimson blood.

“My dad will-” the girl began, only for one of the dark robed figures to tighten the ropes binding her, her words cut off in a gasp of pain.

“Dear, dear child. Your father has never bested me. Neither he nor any of his predecessors. Even the damnable Asian fell to me, eventually.”

The girl took a deep breath, glaring at the man who stood out like a sore thumb among the dark clad cultists and hulking demonic figures in the room. He was clad in a perfect light grey italian suit, leaning on a cane and smiling. But the smile did not reach his eyes, which were filled with hatred and loathing.

“God will-” the girl began again, only to be cut off by the man's laughter.

“God? God? You invoke his name, here, in this place? My dear, you violated his protection yourself, with your own choices. Why, some would say you came here of your own free will.” he leered down at the girl. “Dear, dear child. Don't you know? Your so-called ‘god' does so love his free will. It was your doom, and it will be his, one day.”

Before the girl could reply, a distant shout lf “Fuego!” echoed through the cave system, and a blast of heat could be felt. The distant sounds of crashing swords echoed as well.

She grinned at the man in the suit. “My dad is here, and Harry is with him as well! You don't have a chance.”

The man let out a heavy sigh, drawing a dagger from within his suit that seemed to suck the struggling light into it.

“Oh, I don't know. I thought I'd finish before they even arrived.”

The girls face paled, and she screamed. But with a soft, sickening squelch, it was cut off. It should have been the end of the story.

But it was the beginning.

Later....

Higher up in the castle, Minerva McGonagall was leading a still shaking Sybill Trawlaney to her quarters. “Just take a rest now, Sybill. It will be christmas tomorrow. You shall feel better then.”

But instead of a reply that would have made sense, Sybill just said in a sing-song-voice. “Thirty coins the price of death Silver for the hearts last breath Champion comes from nowhere far Sword in hand as the door stands ajar Not his own hand to wield the blade But that of a tender maid The dark lord stretches out his hand, and death falls throughout the land One that's marked By deaths own hand Shall be defeated while he stands unless he takes another path One marked by the Lamb's wrath”

Sybill slumped in Minerva's arms, and McGonagle groaned. “Albus will be thrilled. That makes three.”

** *A bit of a spoiler, but sure...*

They arrived to a pile of notices left by messenger owls; warnings of possible underage use of magic by Ron and/or Ginny. "The Trace," Bill explained. "It'd read as you, if you were close enough when something was cast without an adult family member around. But, since we're purebloods, it's up to Mum to hold her children accountable."

"Toss 'em into the fire?" she asked.

"No, the proper thing to do would be to have Mum sign the forms and send them all back. Doesn't matter right now, though. Stack them somewhere."

Ginny nodded and collected them up. She put the collection in a sorting slot on the writing desk.

Bringing her Mum back to familiar walls didn't seem to do much for her crying, so Ginny once again took the lead. She was on the Floo regularly, negotiating with the outside world. The Floo provided an effective mask for her, as she found new value in her trick of mimicking voices to speak as her Mum.

With Imelda Mincing at the Ministry - "I do not care where he left off on the paperwork. Send his personal effects home and I'd like a complete report on his pension and owed pay."

The hospital - "What do you mean, 'Would it be okay if the body wasn't there'? Where is my -- Arthur's body?"

An old, coughing wizard from the Department of Mysteries - "It's ours, so give it back, intact and presentable!"

The undertakers - "Why did they send it to you? No- never mind. For once they erred in our favour. What? No, we aren't 'coming 'round before five so you can meet your mates for a pint' - you're going to deliver it to us intact and properly shrouded, Thursday morning as promised ... or you'll get such a howler! Oh, you think that's an idle threat? MEMBERS OF THE WIZENGAMOT FEAR MY HOWLER! IT'S BEEN NOMINATED AS THE FOURTH UNFORGIVABLE!"

** Harry turned the diary, page by page, fingers tracing over its leather spine. The book itself was radiant, brimming with a darkness so soothing and so achingly familiar that with Harry's depravity he only craved for more.

This was Voldemort, and despite Harry's itch to throw the book away and never touch it again, he couldn't help but want to hang onto it forever.

Harry placed the diary carefully on his bed covers as he dipped his quill into some ink. He let it hover above the page for a moment.

And then he wrote one word, the only word that mattered.

/Tom/

Tom's name sank into the page, and Harry was left staring at the same blank page.

“It's not a very good diary,” Harry mumbled.

The silence rang around him, just like it had for days. Harry flicked another page and placed the nib of the quill to the page once more. This time Harry held it in place, watching as the black ink absorbed into the page.

The diary hummed, and Harry flexed his fingers backwards at the tingling sensation. There was definitely something there, something Harry desperately longed for, and it wasn't due to the Mirror of Erised's influence.

** Linkffn(Henrietta Potter and the Secret of the Horcrux) Voldemort's soul binds with Henrietta's and she stumbles upon Salazar's secret hideaway (extreamly abridged version). The following is her meeting with the Grangers after she witnessed Hermione apparate accidentally after nearly drowning.

**“Apperated.” Henrietta supplied.

The father turned to Henrietta, “She... what?”

“She apparated.”

“What's ‘apparated'?” Hermione asked, still sniffling. Her parents seemed just as confused as their daughter, regarding Henrietta in a confused manner.

“Has the terminology changed in the last millennium?” Henrietta asked, eyeing them with just as much confusion as they did her. It seemed that her response was not one they anticipated and their confusion became marred by a sort of stunned silence. A sigh left her lips as she decided to give the mages a demonstration to put them on the right page, “This is appereation.”

With a slight twist on the spot, Henrietta disapparated a few feet to the side with a loud crack. When she focused back on the three Grangers, she found them all looking at her with dumbfound expressions. A sinking feeling began to fester in Henrietta's gut, but she beat it down until she had reason to act on it.

“You... you...” the Mother began.

Only for the father to finish for her, “You teleported.”

Henrietta cocked her head to the side like a confused bird, until the tail end of a memory reminded her what ‘teleported' meant, “We're using muggle terminology, now?” she asked. Her response seemed to fall on deaf ears as it seemed they were still hung up on her apparition, worryingly enough.**

******* There are several wikis devoted to Harry Potter that contain articles for [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Apparition][Apparition]] and thus spell the words correctly. Typing "Harry Potter app" into your favorite search engine and then looking at the suggestions for completion shows the correct spelling within the first three or four listings.

I'm not trying to put you down or anything, but if you have trouble spelling something like this in the future, try following the processes I mentioned.

** This is from my fanfic that, for some reason, people asked for more. I still have no idea why.

--------------

Daphne was just getting off to buy lunch - the same usual gruel food as everyday, offered by the cafeteria the Ministry had and that Daphne bought every day because it was cheap - when she accidentally hit Blaise, which was a mystery in itself, especially considering Blaise didn't work there.

“You.”, Daphne started, pulling Blaise to a small niche where people weren't walking to get to their lunch. “Last I've heard, Blaise, you were swindling off people's money in Italy.”

“Tell Pansy to be a sweetheart and stop gossiping so much, I was mooching off them,”, he replied, and Daphne smiled. Blaise hugged her, the familiar smell of cologne involving Daphne for one second. “I missed you.”

“Oh, me too. But really, what you're doing here? Did you run out of people to get money from?”, Daphne asked, letting go of him, and he offered her a glittering smile.

Blaise had done his seventh year again, and after that, he set off to Italy to have a glamorous lifestyle. There were some talks of him having a myriad of lovers who paid his every whim, and Daphne knew it wasn't, probably, just rumors. Still, it wasn't like she could trust Pansy as a source.

** Oh, I'm always late with these, but here you go anyway:

As soon as she and Merrythought left the Great Hall, they felt the floor tremoring and a green mist stung their eyes and throats. "There!" Edwina screamed, and the professor saw a cloud of grey smoke in the air with some type of rat twisting around, screeching in pain. On the floor, about eight students were rolling around, unable to get up no matter how hard they tried. Then they saw the tall, rigid figure of Stateira McElroy, one hand holding her raised wand, the other balled up and pressed to her mouth, blood dripping down her chin.

"FINITE INCANTATEM!" Professor Merrythought bellowed as someone grabbed Stateira's robes and yanked, causing her to stumble and lift the smoke. It started to dissipate as Bruin Weasley, back to his original form but now bloodied and bruised, fell to the floor, whimpering. Next to him, Prewett was still bound and struggling.

Professor Merrythought's voice came out rather calm for the circumstance. "Miss McElroy, lower your wand."

The girl's face was still a mask of rage, but she followed the command. She didn't seem to be able to unlock her muscles, so Professor Merrythought took a moment to survey the shell-shocked students, shivering Weasley, and the Gryffindor prefect slumped against the wall, unmoving.

"What have you done, you wretched girl?" Professor Merrythought whispered.

"Things got so fucked up so fast," I sat down on the bench beside John. "It's barely passed Halloween and all ready this universe is fucked."

John glanced at me. "Why? That Hermananeno girl or whatever the hell her name is got saved."

"Yeah, but now she hates Harry Potter! She's like the main character that constantly saves their asses! You can't have Harry Potter without Hermione!"

John shrugged. He hadn't read Harry Potter.

"And what the heck was Gus doing there anyway? It's his fault she hates them now."

John laughed. "Nigga spent half the day outside the girl's bathroom telling the girl he'd treat her like a goddess."

I shuddered. "Dude is such neckbeard. She's eleven and he's already trying to get it in."

"It won't work."

"Doesn't matter, it's still shady as hell. We are way to old to pulling that crap."

"Do you remember how old we were before we arrived here?"

I frowned. I hated not knowing anything about my previous life. "No, but I'm old enough not to follow an eleven year old girl to the bathroom!"

** Edit: this story is slowly becoming a massive crossover where characters from disparate universes (harry potter, tron legacy, how to train your dragon, warehouse 13, halo, and more will be trapped in a minecraft seed).

Pottercraft 4:

Myka Day 1(Potter day 96):

Seem to be in some sort of pocket dimension caused by an artifact. Thankfully I have my Tesla and a solar panel to charge it. Have yet to see any dangers but the other book in the chest had information about them and how to assemble things in insane ways that shouldn't work but did. I now have a surprisingly well balanced stone sword.

Myka added a few more thoughts then looked at the map she had found in the chest. It began to fill in but the resolution reminded her of her first phone, an ancient Nokia that playing Snake on was considered high tech. She looked around. She was at a beach and there was a creek leading to it. Common sense said to follow the beach but Girl Guide training said to follow the creek. Then she remembered the rule was to follow it downstream. "I'm as downstream as I can get," she muttered, kneeling to retie her boots, thankful she had elected to wear the boots Latimer had bought her as a gift after she had broken a heel during a chase. She took out her Farnsworth and tried to contact Arnie again. Static. Scowling, she set off southwards.

Day 2:

Tesla makes the green creatures explode. And skeletons are archers here. And there are spiders so big I am now never going to sleep again.

She turned the page and began designing a hideaway for the next night. A three by four by four cuboid with a torch suspended in the air she decided would be an excellent safe-house and quickly built from nearby blocks.

Day 3:

Found another chest. Am now wearing armour. Glad Pete isn't here to make Wonder Woman jokes. Besides, I look more like Jeanne d'Arc. I wonder how he and Leanne and Artie are. And Mrs. Franklin.

Myka spent another day trudging southwards, following the stream.

Day 5:

Killed a sheep today, have to ignore my vegetarian diet due to circumstances. Now I understand what Piers was saying in his column at University. I feel horrible and have completely lost my appetite but if I don't eat, I killed this creature for no reason....

She finished putting thin strips of meat on the reed-like sticks then stuck them in the dirt, creating a makeshift smoker from an L-shaped cavity in the ground. She left it to work and went to fish and harvest carrots and potatoes.

Day 7:

Noticed the mountain is changing, have changed my path that way.
