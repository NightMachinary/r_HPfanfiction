We know at least two other people (Barty junior and Tome Riddle) had 12 OWLs, so did they also get time turners? Does everyone who takes more than 3 optional classes get time turners? So were there other students in Harry's time at Hogwarts who had time turners?


** I think time turners were a fairly recent invention. Not 100% sure.

According to wiki Hogwarts students could apply for a time turner if they had a good enough reason and passed some stringent checks.

Percy had 12 owls and considering how quickly he got a pretty cushy job in the ministry he was probably the type of person who would be given a time turner.

Thinking about it, it might be a Department of Mysteries recruitment strategy in a "Here smart kids, look at what cool toys we have" way.

*** Haha for a minute I was confused here about Percy owning 12 pet owls.

** My headcanon is that Hogwarts has a bit of a staffing problem due to a historically low number of students.

There's empty classrooms, abandoned hallways, and just generally a lot of unused space at Hogwarts, so it's not unreasonable to say that there's fewer students than usual. And considering that they're coming of off two generations with big wars (grindlewald then voldemort) and traditionally small family sizes... Yeah.

Since there's fewer students, there's fewer teachers. Since there's fewer teachers, there's less flexibility in who can take what class when.

Percy probably needed a time turner because each of the core classes only has 2 sessions being taught (ravenclaw/hufflepuff or griffindor/slyther or whatever the actual house combination is). But Barty Jr or Tom Riddle probably didn't, because there were probably more teachers teaching more classes of the same grade year and so they didn't get stuck with taking 2 or 3 classes at the same time.

**** But you could easily fit all electives into one day parallel to each other. Each professor holds the same class five times each day, Mondays for third years, Tuesday for fourth and so on.

** B E C A U S E P L O T . . .

But to rationalize it though, I have other questions:

- Did Hermione get access to a time-turner because she is a friend of Harry ? (Discrete push by Dumbledore to get more help for the Boy-who-lived).
- Could it be because she is a brilliant muggleborn ? (help minimize the cultural gap between brilliant muggle-raised and brilliant wizard-raised by giving a bit more study time to the muggle-raised student).
- Could it only happen under Dumbledore's Headmastership (brilliant of course, but quite mad...) ?
- Who exactly in the Ministry provided the time-turner and did they know what would be its use?
- Was Hermione used as a sort of test subject to determine what would happen to a person who used a time turner very regularly? (small capacity time-turner, controlled environment, easily observed, mudblood guinea pig...)

*** I'd like to read a fic about the last point. A fic where the ministry constantly uses hogwarts students for (psychological/magical?) experiments.

** The only known characters to receive all twelve O.W.L.s are Percy Weasley, Bill Weasley, and Barty Crouch Jr. However, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it is revealed that attempting this would cause a timetable clash during that year; Minerva McGonagall had to write several letters to the Ministry in order to obtain a Time-Turner for Hermione Granger so that she would be able to attend all her classes when she attempted to take all twelve subjects in her third year (although she ultimately dropped two when she was not able to cope with so many subjects). It is unclear how Percy, Bill, and Barty Crouch Jr were able to make a similar accomplishment as Hermione's was the only Time-Turner to ever enter Hogwarts according to J.K. Rowling.[6] It should be noted that Barty Crouch Jr obtaining twelve O.W.L.s was mentioned by his father during a bout of insane rambling due to the damage to his mind from fighting the Imperius Curse and could have been a delusional mistake on the part of Barty Crouch Snr. On the other hand, all three had parents connected in some way with the Ministry, so this is fairly plausible

** The others grew up in Wizarding families. You dont have to take the class to take the test. They probably just studied in the summer or got tutors. Hermione wouldnt have access to the same resources.

** In our muggle world, you would get your extra credits by self study, taking credits during holidays, rigorous tutelage in topics that cover multiple subjects (such as physics covering enough math), or sitting exams in non-exam years.

** Cause Rowling wanted to show how amazing Hermione is. Giving a 13 years old girl, a device that can alter time just so she can study more. How could anything go wrong?

Obviously /s

Ps: does someone has a fic where Harry steal Hermione time Turner and she got in troubles?

** author thought it sounded cool so wrote it.

to backward justify it however: how is a time turner acquired by anyone? an employee authorizes it.

mcgonagall knew the desk clerk of the department and just asked for it. they said okay. simple as that. why didn't that happen in the past? the old clerk used to say no.
