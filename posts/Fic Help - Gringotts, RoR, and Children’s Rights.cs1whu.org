I've got an idea for a fic but I need some help with the details.

First of all how much do you think it would cost to open a vault at Gringotts? Would it be one lump sum? A monthly fee? Would the money earn interest? Do you think their exchange rate would be fair or outlandishly ridiculous?

I'd also like anyone's ideas on what might be in the RoRs room of ‘hidden things'. I got the impression from the book that it included things that were lost, banished, or broken. The thing is, I'm not sure how many things, how many useful things, or how much variety of things to put in there.

Lastly is in regards to children's rights in the WW. I'd always got the impression that there weren't any, or only very few rights protecting children. What do you think? Would a child be able to find a job over the summer? What about stay in a hotel alone? Would people even raise an eyebrow at a child shopping alone? Is child abuse even considered a thing?

Thanks for reading, I'm really looking forward to your opinions!


** I have no idea about banks so I can't really help you with that besides saying that the Goblins probably won't grow your fortune for you. Especially when they don't have strict orders to do so. (looking at you trillionaire Harry)

I always thought that the room was used by students to hide things and a lot of the time they couldn't retrieve what they hid because they couldn't find the room again. Perhaps it could also be used by House Eleves as a place to store things that can't simply be vanished because they're enchanted or otherwise magical.

Wizarding law seems pretty backwards to me. But I think with how low birth rates are, especially in pureblood circles every magical child would be protected and cherished (and spoiled rotten.)

*** Thank you, that's really helpful! I think you're probably right about how children are treated in the Wizarding World, especially pureblood children. Do you think the WW as a whole would feel the same way about muggleborn kids, or would they only want to protect/cherish their own children?

**** It probably depends if they believe in pureblood superiority.

But in most societies "newcomers" are sadly never treated equally to "old blood" and established families. And they are often faced with bigotry like we see in the books.

There is of course also the route many "pro-dark" authors take. Which is saying that Muggleborns disrespect their traditions and want to mugglefy everything. That is even supported with Hermione'd SPEW.

So I would say the answer to you question depends in which circles you ask it.

** I suspect my headcanon around Gringotts is different than most peoples'. I don't think there is a charge for a vault. For one, I don't think the more bigoted purebloods would deign to give Goblins money. I believe, for the goblins, simply being the sole possessor of the accumulated wealth of the wizarding world would be worth housing it. They make their money through the other activities we see them engaging in: we know they employ cursebreakers, who could either be hired out or employed by Gringotts itself to aquire more treasure; they are the sole means of currency exchange in the magical world, and they are the finest smiths in the world. I should clarify that I don't necessarily think I'm /right,/ but it's what works for me.

I always pictured the room of hidden things as a sort of lost and found for Hogwarts. I think most of what we see in it when Harry visits it is things that have been left behind or (poorly) hidden by students that the house elves found and decided to store instead of simply vanishing away. The good thing about the Room of Requirement, in general, though, is that its very nature means that whatever you as the writer want to be in there can be.

Lastly, I think it's important to separate the "wizarding world" as a whole from the Ministry of Magic. Functionally, what the wizarding public wants is only as relevant as the Ministry of Magic chooses to make it. Would the Ministry have the standing to intervene for muggleborn kids?

There's a lot of opinions on /how/ abusive the Dursleys are towards Harry, but we know he is routinely denied food as punishment, Petunia threw a frying pan at his head, and Vernon choked Harry, so it's clearly not a healthy household for him. There's no indication that the Ministry has any clue about how Harry's treated. And he's /Harry Potter./ If they're that clueless about how the literal most famous wizard in the world is being treated, it's unlikely that they're concerned with how muggleborns are treated.

*** I really like your theory on Gringotts and honestly it probably makes the most sense - especially if we're going with the general folklore around Goblins hoarding wealth.

I suppose my only worry with the Room of Hidden things is making it too much of a power source. A room full of important and useful magical items seems a bit too convienent, but I think there could be a good crap to awesome ratio for the stuff in there if that makes sense?

Thanks for sharing your ideas!

** I'd say /*everything*/ that's lost ends up there. Doesn't have to be useful, just lost.

^{also a mountain of lost socks would be quite amusing}

** Generally speaking, law will have progressed somewhat faster in muggle society, and even there Children's Law is at best described as a fledgling field.

That said, child abuse as a crime is a somewhat older concept, and I would expect it to have filtered through to the wizarding world, but given that Umbridge got away with having her methods called 'medieval', it does not yet appear to have the same level of stigma(or didn't in the 90s) as would be ascribed to it these days.

Admittedly she was in a somewhat unique and powerful position, but it would take a rather large amount of populist or political capital to get away with it if it were as stigmatised as it is in our society these days(provided, obviously, it gets discovered.)

** As for Gringotts, I believe I once read a fic where if the goblins had to dig out a new vault there was a massive fee, and the vaults were leased out to wizards for a fee.

** I doubt there's interest with a freaking monopoly on banking.

The exchange rate is hard to judge, because Rowling sucks at math.

I'd say there's vault rental fees as it seems that it is closer to a safety deposit box than an actual bank.

I'd say they have rights, but Harry is weird because he essentially has no one looking out solely for him.

** Concerning Gringotts, from what we saw, it only provide "Vaults". Wizard pay to have a vault (I would guess a pretty important inital cost, and then either nothing or some really low upkeep cost) and Gringotts promise to them that anything inside won't be stolen.\\
Also, since the money is stuck inside the vaults and not "working", it cannot earn any interest. Anyways I doubt Goblins would earn interest for wizard because :

- The whole magical society does not have the size to support a modern economy with things like stock market, it looks more like a little town where investment and loans are made between 2 individuals.
- Wizards and Goblins seem to, as best, dislike each other. I don't see wizards trusting Goblins with "using" their money, and even if they did, I imagine Goblins could just make "bad investments" just to spit on him.

If the bank is making money, it's probably thanks to its other services (exchange between magical and muggle currencies, curse breaker expeditions . . .), though I personally dislike the whole "Gringotts is the one that deal with will and magical contract and also happen to be able to take care of living Horcruxe without killing the host even if Harry is supposed to be the first Living Horcruxe).

​

For The Room of Hidding Things, I think everything inside is either useless or broken. Most of the "lost things" are probably of little value or people would have looked for it seriously enough for the elves to notice, as for the hidden one, the owner would have come back for it. But the main reason for it is Voldemort. He probably plundered the room during his time there. So anything still there is either pretty new (like than 40/50 years old), or so broken Riddle considered it useless.

​

Finally for the children. I think we do not have enough elements to judge. Most of what we see in canon is from Harry's eye, and even if it was for a reason, it's not like Harry's situation is a normal one. I would guess that the principe of child abuse exist (when abused children can turn into some kind of crazy magical monster, you try to limit it), but it is very different to Muggles one, for example, wizard d'ont care for physical injury since they can heal almost anything is a moment, also scaring a children half to death to make him use accidental magic seem to be socially acceptable (Neville).\\
Concerning children's job, I don't think it really exist. Since anything a children could do can be done a lot faster thanks to a wand or a House elve, what would be the point? I guess some children could de simple work like maning the counter of a shop to earn a little money, but it would be more of a allowance than a salary.\\
Also, children shopping alone seem to be acceptable (starting 11 at least, can't be sure before). While he didn't like it, Dumbledore left Riddle shop alone before his 1st year without fighting the decision too much, and Harry could live alone in the Leaky Cauldron for 2 weeks when he was only 13.
