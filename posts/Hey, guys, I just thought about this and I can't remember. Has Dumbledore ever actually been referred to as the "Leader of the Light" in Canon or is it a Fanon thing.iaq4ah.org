What about him saying "For the Greater Good"?


** No, 'the Light' doesen't exist in canon.

Dumbledore did use "For the Greater Good" in a letter he wrote to Grindelwald when they were still close, but he ended up rejecting that ideology and never see him use it outside of that context.

*** elphias doge does refer to him working for The Greater Good in his obituary

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: *working always for the greater good* and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
#+end_quote

i highly doubt albus himself associated with it, though

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, I --- I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. “I think that's the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but ‘For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.”

kinda funny that elphias uses that phrasing, lol.

**** To be fair, "He worked for the greater good" is a pretty good way to sum up Dumbledore's life. The phrasing only pose a problem when you link it to Grinderwald, and his campaign or terror slogan, but (as seen in the marriage chapter in DH), Doge refused to admit any link between Dumbledore and Grinderwald outside of their duel

***** yeah, i mean, harry agrees with albus too:

#+begin_quote
  Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the *greater good* than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?”

  A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

  “I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.

  “Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth. “Why didn't he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here's how to survive'?”

  “Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the *greater good!* This is war!
#+end_quote

also this ootp passage is such a big oof

#+begin_quote
  “Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.” “I don't ---”

  “I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

  “Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have --- and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined --- not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hand

** There being a "Light side" in general is fanon, Dumbledore being considered its leader even moreso.

He uses "For The Greater Good" exactly once, in a letter to Grindelwald back when he was still on that side - and it's all but stated he regrets ever following that ideology. He never uses it in person, in any of the books.

**** If it counts that it's...

1. Not capitalized,

2. Within the context, he's outright rejecting the philosophy or at least stating his regret at ever following it back when Grindelwald was still a free man.

He uses the phrase "greater good" there exactly once.

** Nobody ever called Dumbledore the "Leader of the Light". I'm also pretty sure that anyone calling him as such would have been rebuked, the man is supposed to be humble.

Concerning "For the Greater Good", Dumbledore did use it once in a letter he sent to Grinderwald (before they had their falling out), but it was probably a youthfull error, when he made great plan to "change the world". He never used again in Canon (at least in front of Harry), and while he never gave a clear opinion of that sentence, he probably hated it considering its link to the death of his sister and Grinderwald war.

**** I think this is why Dumbledore is such a great character. He doesn't demand respect and reverence from others like Voldemort (or in a lesser measure Fudge) would. Hell, he even left Fudge slander him for a full year without even defending himself, and didn't even show any grudge when the truth came to light.

But at the same time, he knows where he stands and doesn't hide his power behind false modesty. All the quote you used could come as bragging if used by someone else, but from Dumbledore, it's more like he is just stating a fact.

Though in hindsight, I'm not sure "humble" is truly the best word to describe him.

**** There's a difference between arrogance and confidence. That difference is whether you can actually back up your claims. Whether you can bite, just as well as you can bark.

And Dumbledore definitely has a strong bite.
