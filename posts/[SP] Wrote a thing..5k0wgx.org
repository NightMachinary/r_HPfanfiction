So I can't write. I admit this. But I get ideas, and I wish people would write them because I think they've potential to make a story I would read. For some reason, I decided to actually try write this one. I don't think it's a particularly unique or astounding idea, but I wrote it. It's Ginny-centric, and the first two chapters aren't even a proper story, just background snippets of conversations Ginny has had during her childhood, to give relevant information.

I got this idea after reading a Harry-shows-up-in-fourth-year fic, and thus wasn't around to save Ginny. The idea was what if no one saved her, and eventually I got the idea that the Sorting Hat itself comes when help is called for. I know it's not canon, but meh. It's not a serious, proper fic.

Lemme know what you think! Corrections and criticisms alike. Nice things, too.

  Ginny manages to fight the Diary before petrifying Hermione. Starts off with a few snippets of conversations Ginny had, showing how she grew up on the Boy Who Lived stories, and also the inspiration for the pickled toad poem. I'm going to pretend Ginny didn't send it, the twins did. Ginny doesn't realise different toads can be different colours, and neither did 12 yr old Charlie.
