...and the person you're keeping them from figuring them out anyway & not holding it against you.

I figure Lupin-at-school fics with the Marauders figuring out he's a werewolf might fit this, but anything else?

Remus/Sirius story, one of if not the best out there. Remus keeping secrets plays a large role in the story, and it isn't just him being a werewolf.

Really, most Remus/Sirius stories have a lot of what you're looking for. Almost all of them have the whole "oh no I'm a werewolf" secret, and one or the other (sometimes both) hide the whole "oh no he's my best friend but I love him" secret too.

** A lot of time turner fics are surprisingly like this. Some are outright "oh, you're from the future and you aren't going to change any events /cough James and Lily cough/? That's cool, let's still be friends". A few are "omg you didn't stop James and Lily from dying, what the hell is wrong with you?! But guess what, in a few weeks, I'm not going to be angry anymore and accept that this must have been a difficult decision for you... And oh yeah, let's still be besties".

I love this story, but the second situation happens in linkffn(Pride of Time)

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
