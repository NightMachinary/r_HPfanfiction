Sirius and Remus are my 2 favourite characters but I find that sometimes they way they're portrayed really bothers me. In a lot of fics, they seem really cheesy, but in canon, they're both quite serious and hard, like people who have had crappy lives and bear scars. What I'm looking for are stories about them where they're flawed, where Remus has actually lived a hard life that's left a mark, where Sirius' head is a little fucked up. I'm tired of seeing them in one dimension. I hope that all made sense, lol.

AU, canon, slash,friendship, I'm cool with everything. Thanks.

  Four years ago, Remus Lupin lost his friends to death and betrayal. Now he finds himself betrayed once more, and in a place where death may very well be preferred. Winner of the 2009 Hourglass Awards Admin's Choice Award for Drama at The Unknowable Room

Exactly. I hate all these fics where Sirius is this one dimensional playboy/prankster. And those fics where Sirius and Remus raise Harry and they are perfect guardians and everything is sunshine and butterflies.

I recommend linkffn(Prince of the dark Kingdom). Sirius and Remus are both werewolves and they have to live under Voldemort's rule.

[[http://wotcher-wombat.livejournal.com/5719.html][Scenes from the Hog's Head]] is a pretty great character study of Sirius.

Also try [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1][All These Complications]]. First war AU where Regulus decides to confide in Sirius about his knowledge of Horcruxes. Remus's struggle with his lycanthropy and lack of trust from his friends is especially well portrayed.

** I'll leave these here anyway. Starfishstar writes thoughtful, character-driven Remus stories: linkffn(11666329)

And this is mine for what it's worth (Most of my stories are about Sirius. It's an OC romance, so if you don't like OCs you'll want to avoid this). I think you can safely say his head is pretty fucked-up in this one. linkffn(11171435)

  In which Remus and Tonks fight battles, arrest criminals, befriend werewolves, overcome inner demons and, despite it all, find themselves a happy ending. A love story, and a story of the Order years. (My Remus/Tonks epic, years in the making! This is the second half of the story, set in the Half-Blood Prince year.)

** Well, off the top of my head you've got Oblivious, and its sequels. Not necessarily hard, but not milquetoasts either. Seemed pretty IC. linkffn(2063033)

And there's Consequences ([[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2008/08/10/]]) which was written before Hallows, so there are canon inconsistencies, but tbh, that's for the better.

Um...I used to have tons saved. Remus is my bae. I'll see if I can find any more.
