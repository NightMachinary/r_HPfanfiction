One of those things which makes me wonder. You have school of around thousand of students (and how many adults), who are completely dependent in their magic (with one exception) on their wands, and yet there is no opportunity to fix those thin fragile wooden sticks on which everything depends?


** There doesn't appear to be such a thing as wand repair in canon. With the exception of Harry fixing his holly wand with the Elder Wand, in every case where somebody's wand breaks there's no mention of fixing it being an option (Ron taped his back together, with disastrous results), instead it has to be replaced.

** Rude that the teachers apparently don't care when a student is obviously struggling in their classes with a broken wand, too. McGonagall and Flitwick should have been all over Ron in CoS for his spark spitting, spell backfiring, menace.

*** Not the teacher's responsibility that the student has all the materials they need. That is the job of the student and or their parent(s).

Based upon Tom Riddle getting money from Dumbledore to buy his school things, we know even poor students can afford to buy a new wand.

If Molly Weasley wanted, she probably could have shown up early on a Saturday, taken Ron via Floo to Diagon Alley and bought him a new wand. She choose not to as a form of punishment. This is a parenting decision. Possibly driven by lack of money as well, but I doubt it.

We don't know all the details, but maybe McGonagall even wrote to Molly and Arthur and asked them to get Ron a working wand. Once they refused, the matter was out of her hands.

***** Heh. Yeah, considering what a wand can do, it's less "Writing with a broken pencil" and more "Trying to disarm bombs with a broken multitool". But it's not surprising in the slightest McG didn't care - she sent firsties out into the forest with Hagrid, no? (I can never remember if that's canon or not, just that there's debate over it)

****** Don't worry about it, canon doesn't tell us that.

McGonagall assigned them detention, but didn't say what they'd be doing, then filch took them to Hagrid for their detention. So either she approved it or passed it off to either filch or Hagrid who decided to be an asshat/buffoon about it.

******* I'm not overly worried either way - I just know I'm not even close to expert on what's canon or what isn't, so it's best to put in a disclaimer so people know I'm not trying to pass off what I say as definitively canon. Like the fandom version of "Well, somebody told me that-", I guess. :D

But okay, cool. Good to know. Either way, that's a pretty uncaring image. :)

******* Orrrr Dumbledore stuck his oar in to ensure that Harry went into the Forbidden Forest and learned about the properties of unicorn blood. It's a pivotal plot point as meeting Firenze allows Harry to realise that Voldemort is never going to stop trying to return, and that he is in fact at the school.

Plus: they were in detention for helping Hagrid; Hagrid thinks they'll have an easier detention with him than with Filch, and he sort of owes them one; Hagrid underestimates the dangers of the Forbidden Forest.

It does make for a great corruption-start in 'Magic is about belief' fics though - Ron starts to do worse and starts to lose belief in himself, plants the seed of resentment towards everyone else for not helping him/doing better than him. :)

********* But if he's had that crappy wand since day one, he wouldn't get worse - he'd start worse and remain crap (especially since Hermione would probably be convinced it was because he was a slacker, given how often she had to push them to work or do anything scholastic, thereby pushing him further into the things he finds fun in order to keep some self-esteem ["I can't do this classroom shite, but I'm really good at chess" kind of a deal]).

But yes, that could work and bond the trio together even more as well. Depends on what interpretation/angle a writer wanted to take their story in - there's room for everything in fanfiction. :)

** And I don't recall any fanfiction that has repairing a wand as a possibility. In fact in several fics it is quite clear that once a wand is snapped the "magic" is gone. And the owner of the wand has to get a new one.

**** And Ollivanders is the place everyone gets their wands. A focus on maintaining traditions like that can often override convenience or common sense. But also, they can teleport whenever they like. They can pop to London, grab a wand, and be back in less than a day. The only reason Ron never got his repaired or replaced was plot convenience for shenanigans and Molly's determination.

******* It's because Ollivander makes the best wands. His family's been in the business since 382BC...

Plus his "wand chooses the wizard" way of working means people are guaranteed a good match with their wand, and because he only uses the three cores proven to be the most reliable and powerful - we know that other cores exist and are used perfectly well, but Ollivander refuses them for various reasons.

******** Fair point.

I wonder if that's just Ollivander being all hipster-artisinal ("These aren't just any wands, these are M&S wands" :D) about his process or if that's how wands are supposed to work. Is it ever directly stated in canon? Is it like getting a bespoke suit tailored to fit vs buying one off the peg?

Though it does make the Weasley's even worse with money, if they resort to reusing shit wands instead of buying cheaper ones. They are the people who went on a holiday instead of paying for their needed stuff and also paid for taxis from frickin' Devon to London in fourth year (in case you're not British, that's upward of a four-hour drive and is quite incredibly expensive) so that's perfectly in character.

  "These aren't just any wands, these are M&S wands"
#+end_quote

That's hilarious. Especially if you picture that scene with the M&S ad music over the top!

I'm re-reading (isn't everyone in these strange times?!) and haven't yet reached fourth year yet - keep getting distracted by these pesky fanfics! - but I'd never clocked that the Weasleys a) lived in Devon, or b) got a taxi from there to London! That's insane!

Though don't get me started on the state of rail in this country (I am UK, btw)!

Because I'm writing a fic where I want my OC to have a very specific wand, I've been reading whatever I can find on wand lore. Ollivander maintains that you get the best results by letting the wand choose the wizard, and he's the one who narrowed down the cores to just the three "supreme" cores - apparently after watching his father having difficulties with inferior cores.

It's also said to be historically common for wizards to have used heirloom wands, or to take a core of their choosing to a wandmaker to be incorporated into a wand.

Though there's lots on Pottermore about wand makers in other parts of the world using different, locally available, magical ingredients for cores, so perhaps Ollivander didn't narrow down just the three best cores, more like best and also easy enough to source in the UK?

********** I mean, it might be fanon. It's been literal years since I've read the books, so my knowledge of canon vs fanon is sketchy at best.

And yep. Definitely not a path we want to start down (since we would be walking after the train was cancelled :D). But it's less about the trains and more about Rowling's incredible inconsistency with travel - Dumbledore using a broom in book one when apparition would make more sense, using brooms then she invents side-along which would've made the whole seven-potters thing idiotically pointless, etc.

And ah, okay. Fair enough.

And yeah, probably a good reason for Ollivander to only use three types of core, if you want an in-world explanation for it. More than likely it's just Rowling's inconsistent worldbuilding breaking itself again. My advice - take what little there is in canon and just make up what you need to make it actually make sense for your story. If that's the explanation you wanna go for, go for it.

Might be worth making a post asking for input, if the question mark at the end was asking for an opinion on your best and easiest to source idea. I'm afraid I don't have enough canon knowledge to say whether it would fit or not.

** In all honesty, the only time I've ever seen a Magical Focus repaired is in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, and that's practically standard in most there.

Kinda sad how the only version of Magical Foci I've ever come across that actually gets repairs done is used by the only group of Spacefaring Mages I know of, and not Harry Potter, which is far more widely known.

** Like lots of people have said, wands generally get replaced, rather than repaired.

Broken wands are shown to work, to a greater or lesser extent though.

Ron's hand-me-down wand with its exposed core still works well enough. Once it's snapped and held together with spellotape it becomes unpredictable and temperamental.

However, there is a broken wand that we are told was snapped in half that is shown to work fairly reliably - the first wand we're introduced to: Hagrid's.

He keeps the broken pieces hidden in an umbrella, but he's able to partially transfigure Dudley, magically command boats (including a Muggle, unenchanted boat), and open the entrance to Diagon Alley (as an aside, why does this require a wand? How do other magical creatures get in???).

I expect it's very common in fics to explore wand lore because of how fascinating it is. I have a partially created fic of my own that has a character who gets Ollivander's help in re-housing the core of an heirloom wand - Ollivander concludes the core/wood pairing chosen by the original wandmaker was poor, and agrees to place the core into a different wand, trying various types before settling on the ideal pairing. Of course in my fic, the owner of the heirloom wand has to first demonstrate that the magical core actually works for him, as Ollivander stands by his ethos that "the wand chooses the wizard".
