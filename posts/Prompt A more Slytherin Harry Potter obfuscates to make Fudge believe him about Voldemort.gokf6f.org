"What are you on about, Minister? Of course Voldemort is dead! No magic can bring back the dead." Harry scoffed irritably. Behind Fudge, Dumbledore and Snape's eyes rose to their hairlines. "But, but you just said that he's back! Who are you talking about, boy?" Fudge stuttered. "Back FROM THE CONTINENT, Minister. He bragged about learning a bunch of Dark Magic, and how he was going to pick up where Voldemort left off, etc." Harry lied wildly. Dumbledore's eyes twinkled madly, while several people who knew the truth were gaping. "Why haven't we heard of him before tonight?" Fudge asked suspiciously. "He's been biding his time since '81, presumably learning more Dark Magic and or waiting for an opportunity to bring all of his followers together." Harry explained.


** Voldemort is dead! He can't be back! He isn't!" Fudge blustered, his bowler hat being crushed in his hands.

"Who said he was ever dead?"

Fudge turned around extremely fast for someone of his portly size.

"What are you on about, boy?"

"Look, did they found a body back in '81?"

Fudge stopped, his face paling even more, "No, there was no body" he said faintly, before regaining some color and turning to Dumbledore, his finger pointed accusingly.

"You said he was dead, you did!"

Dumbledore was looking at Harry with an amused expression before calmly turning to the Minister. "My dear Cornelius, I never said he was dead, just defeated, vanquished was another term, never dead"

The short man began hyperventilating, he turned on Harry again "But-But, you're the Boy Who Lived, you-"

"Boy Who /Lived,/ not Boy who /Killed,/ Minister" the man now was lost for words, turning to the occupants in the room looking for a solution. Harry waited a few moments before continuing.

"He probably used Dark Magic to survive, and now he returned to Britain, and has gathered some of his followers back, I wager in no time they will return to their terrorist attacks."

"Attacks!?" Fudge said appalled "certainly not! He ca-can't!" he looked around the room, again, before his color returned and his face took an angry expression "Lies, all lies! This is all a ruse, by you and Dumbledore to increase your fame, I don't believe it."

There was a flash of something in Harry's eyes, but it was so fast only Dumbledore caught it. Harry immediately assumed a downcast expression and spoke with a regretful voice.

"You leave me no choice Minister, than to leave." there were several gasps in the Infirmary.

Fudge focused on the boy again, his confusion clear on his face "Leave, leave what?"

"Britain, of course, I don't feel safe here anymore, my own Chief of State won't protect his people from a terrorist group, I have no recourse but to leave the Isles, probably to France, I hear Beauxbatons is a very nice, I certainly liked the students." he then turned to Dumbledore, who had also assumed a sad expression "Headmaster, It pains me a lot, but I would like to request a transfer out of Hogwarts, I don't feel safe in England anymore, would you help me with Madame Maxime?"

Dumbledore's face aged a decade and his eyes even moistened "Of course Mr. Potter, if you no longer believe you are safe in Britain, I will have the papers ready by the end of the week."

Fudge paled again, he even dropped his hat, "What!? Harry Potter, /leave/ Hogwarts? Leave Britain?" he looked between Harry and Dumbledore, before turning to Harry and advancing on him now panicking"You /can't/! You-You are... /you/"

Harry had to hold his smile "Of course I can" he nodded with a sad expression "I wonder what the papers will say, I am famous of course, they will ask, and I will have to tell about what happened, to explain things you, you know"

Now Fudge was furious again "Absolutely /not!/ You have no proof You-Know-Who is back!"

"They won't even need it."

"What are you on about it boy?"

"Why, Minister, I will just tell how I was entered against my will in a dangerous Tournament sponsored and organized by /your/ Ministry, I will tell how a terrorist who was listed as dead, infiltrated it and put several lives in danger. I will tell how, on the last task, again organized by /your/ staff, Bulgaria's National Hero was subjected to an Unforgivable and forced to use the Cruciatus Curse, /another/ Unforgivable on Fleur Delacour" the Minister took a step back at the genuine anger on the boy's eyes, now considering the consequences to this "Did you know her father is influential in the French Ministry? And that Krum is friends with the Bulgarian Minister? I wonder if they won't complain to the ICW..." Fudge's eyes widened.

Supreme Mugwump Dumbledore nodded solemnly "There are certainly grounds for that, and they can testify under Veritaserum, even supply memories"

Fudge gulped, and Harry continued.

"And that's not even talking about the Dark Blood Ritual where they forcefully took my blood with a cursed blade" here Harry extended his scarred arm " The Prophet may not like me, but I am sure their papers will be interested in why I am moving there, and I will tell them that all this made me feel unsafe in my homeland, because despite undeniable evidence that /at the very least/ there's a terrorist organization powerful enough to hijack a National event, Britain's Minister for Magic, chose to ignore it all and pretend nothing happened."

Harry sighed "Why, they may even question your own security Minister."

Fudge was pale, sweating, and even shivering by now, but he faintly asked "W-What?"

"Maybe you aren't doing anything because like many of your current advisors had been in the last War, you are under compulsion spells, maybe even the Imperius, surely that's the only explanation for inaction despite all that happened?"

Fudge knew when he was beaten, he knew now it wouldn't even matter if Voldemort was back or not, he would be put under international scrutiny, he couldn't contain foreign citizens, even his loyalty could be questioned if he resisted too much, and there were many countries just waiting to undermine him any way they could.

He nodded faintly and his shoulders shagged while he turned to Dumbledore, completely missing the grin on Harry Potter's face.

"What should I do, Albus?"

NOTE: I personally believe Fudge was just in denial, because he wouldn't know what to do if Voldemort was back, so he chose not to believe and fought a war he was much more comfortable with, a political one.

Of course the plot needed Harry to be lambasted by the government and then Umbridge so there's that too.

**** i know of a story like that, but i cant remember its name for the life of me. the premise is that Harry is a natural Legilmans and Dumbledore acts as a mentor figure to him throughout his time in Hogwarts. He becomes close freinds with Daphne, and the Triwizard is set in Buexbatons. Im pretty sure hes disdainful towards Vella because their allure is a cheap trick compared to what he can do, but im not certain about that

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Harry heavily sat down on a boulder, desperately trying to shunt the burning pain in his forehead away. One small solace in all of this was that he reached the cup seconds before Cedric did, or what else would have happened?

So he listened to Fudge's mind slowly coming to a conclusion, and knew he had to act fast before the man's mind became set in stone.

"Now that I have some time to breathe, I agree. It can't be him, he's dead, they didn't even find his wand. No, it has to be a copycat."

That speck of 'hope' tore Fudge from his maddened blabbering, effectively disrupting a train of thought that would definitely have led to outright denial.

"A what?"

Harry thought it was somewhat disgusting how spineless Fudge was, clinging to his words like a frightened child.

"A copycat killer. I'm sure the Aurors occasionally get them - someone who was inspired by another killer and uses the same methods, leaves the same calling cards, that sort of thing."

One of the Minister's bodyguards perked up.

"For the record, we do get some of those, but less often than the muggle world."

That worked to Harry's favor. Only a bit more, and Fudge would swallow it hook, line and sinker.

"There, see? It must be a dark wizard inspired by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! He certainly made me believe it was a resurrection of some sort. This new wizard seems to even have figured out the secret to the Dark Mark, minister! He was able to activate and call a group of wizards in Death Eater attire via the dark mark of the wizard who led the ritual!"

Had Lucius Malfoy been there, the plan might have gone worse, but without his favourite advisor in all matters Dark, Fudge's mind quickly solidified around the notion of a copycat dark lord.

"Of course, that makes perfect sense, Harry my boy! It cannot be You-Know-Who, it just can't! But there have been dark wizards in the past who tried to emulate his methods, and we dealt with those quickly enough..."

Albus, giving Harry a wink, put his hand on Fudges' shoulder and led him off.

"The fact that this new player was able to penetrate Hogwarts and the security you provided is grave news, Cornelius. Perhaps we should Mobilize the Aurors before this new threat can grow any larger? We could even reactivate some of the veterans.."

--------------

Barty Crouch Jr, under the guise of Moody, wanted to do nothing more than curse the stupid grin off the brat's face. All the planning, all the preparing for a single moment of absolute fear and chaos that would allow his master to swoop in and shatter the ministry for good, and the boy had ruined it.

They'd all pay.

He briskly walked into the forest, shedding his stolen form in the process, spun on the spot and disapparated to parts unknown.

*** This would be interesting with crouch jr living. Would Crouch kill Moody before leaving? Most fanfics I see tend to have Moody as one of the more deadly order members and is the one who is usually more militant against the death eaters. Voldemort loses a year but gains Crouch Jr. Dumbledore gains early ministry action (if it helps) but Ioses Moody.

*** The best part is that it's technically true, from a certain point of view. Voldemort is legally dead, though I doubt that the Ministry ever bothered to issue a death certificate; he has been in Europe, biding his time; and he did come back from Europe, no need to mention the fact that it was as a creepy baby-like creature that was just transferred to a homunculus.
