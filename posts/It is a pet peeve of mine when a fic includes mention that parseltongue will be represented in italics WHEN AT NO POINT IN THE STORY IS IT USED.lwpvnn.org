** I hate that goddamn shitty paragraph they stick at the top of a story. It's so cringe-worthy it pretty much makes me want to X out of a story, no matter how well-written it is.

E.g.

/Thoughts/, $Parseltongue$, ~Mind Speech~, et cetera.

If you can't imply something through dialogue and actions/body-language, fucking learn how to. It's not hard.

**** Agreed! When I see that, it... doesn't really inspire confidence, sadly.

Amusing enough, writing an attractive summary actually has a lot in common with copywriting. If you have experience in that field, writing summaries is a lot easier because you're literally just writing a description/summary for your own 'product' than a client's.

***** A line of random characters is fine to differentiate. But when your dividers are:

#+begin_quote
  === This is a flashback ===

  === End of flashback ===

  === Hermione POV ===
#+end_quote

...etc, that's just annoying. If I can't tell from the story, then fix it before posting.

I'm perfectly fine with putting date references, especially if there are time skips in the story, but TBH I often skip right over them unless I get confused and need to go back to check. I usually don't care whether it's been three days or four, unless something was supposed to happen on the third day.

******* I think a problem is that a lot of fan-fiction writers don't really read printed books or books published to a high standard (e.g. printing houses' products)? They mostly read fanfiction, which has its own troubles a lot of the time (such as the foibles mentioned in this thread), so it's replicated as part of their own writing.

***** I presume this was on FFn?

The thing about FFn reviews is that most of them are just mindless bits of praise -- pretty much empty calories. Then you have people who post useful reviews with actual criticism, that you can dissect to see if they have valid points -- unfortunately, these types of reviewers quickly learn not to bother in the future, as a lot of authors just snap back with a "don't like? Don't read" or insult anyone who don't mindlessly praise their work.

Then there are the people who insist that you're writing incorrectly (grammar and syntax, for example) and that X, Y, and Z are correct (even insisting that the awful $Parseltongue$ type paragraph at the top of the page be used).

And then finally you have the people who try to tell you or demand you to write the story in the way they want (I especially see this with reviewers demanding that the pairing be Harry/Hermione, even in stories where Hermione isn't a factor than a background character, or slash).

Fanfiction.net. It can be a cringefest. :)

**** Yupp-erino! Seeing whole pages or paragraphs in italics is a bit wince-worthy.

Some authors get around this by putting a time and date at the top, but that's a bit heavy-handed, too.

A good way around this is to mention it in story, like a character glancing at the Daily Prophet and noting the date alongside the headline(s).

** I dislike parseltongue in italics, or any other kind of special font. Just write in such a way that people know Harry's speaking with a snake.

I have a similar dislike of authors writing thoughts in realtime, in an otherwise past tense, third person story. I find it breaks the flow.

*** Italics I can understand -- heck, I'd even use them:

Harry leaned in close to the hissing and twitching adder. /"Hello there."/

He ignored the sharp intake of breath from Daphne, and he paid no attention to Pansy's slow, backward crawling.

/"You taste of fish."/

Harry blinked. /"Okay...?/

What a rude little bugger!

Rude Little Bugger promptly coiled, turned, and slithered deep into a burrow on the Lake's bank.

"It's ironic, isn't it?" A shaky laugh escaped Pansy. "A Slytherin who's afraid of snakes." She looked away, unwilling to meet their eyes, and the shame burning through her felt almost physical. "I'm a Merlin-damned embarrassment!"

"I think your caution is warranted in this case," Daphne said a little shakily.

Harry looked at her, frowning. "Why?"

"Because, I mean if I remember my textbook correctly, but I could just be wrong---"

"Daphne!"

She twitched and adjusted her glasses. "I think that was a baby basilisk. Er, hatching, I think?"

Pansy suddenly looked as though Death itself had just jogged by.

...Huh, the Grim Reaper in a jogging suit, like the one his Aunt Petunia wore during her "exercising and socializing" phase a few years back. He wasn't sure if that'd be hilarious or terrifying.

Imagine being brought to your final destination by a skeleton wearing a neon pink or blue patterned jogging suit!

Although, Daphne in a jogging suit like that would be more eye-pleasing... He bit his lip. Perhaps he should tell her how he feels about her now?

He glanced over, and winced a little at seeing her trying to hold and comfort a now hyperventilating Pansy.

Later, then. There were still a few more Hogsmeade weekends left in the year, after all.

*** So uhh, mild differential thing I'd like clarified, especially because I tend to focus on the flow of a story more than anything:

Do you mean something like this:

"Harry idly looked at the map, his eyes crawling across various areas before landing on Gryffindor Tower and the 3rd Year dorms where Ron had just taken Scabbers.

A single name caught his eye; Peter Pettigrew.

Except, wasn't that one of the names of his fathers friends...?"

Or something like this:

"Harry idly looked at the map, his eyes crawling across various areas before landing on Gryffindor Tower and the 3rd Year dorms where Ron had just taken Scabbers.

A single name caught his eye; Peter Pettigrew.

/Isn't that one of Dad's friends?/"

**** I think both ways can be good, you just need to know they have different effects.

The first keeps the narrative smooth so you don't get distracted.

The second gives us a special insight into Harry's thoughts. Maybe it is significant that Harry thinks in that way which builds his character. As opposed to keeping him as a vehicle the reader can mostly ignore.

It's a pretty bad fanon trope. It may have been unique at one point in time (a lot of ideas are, even the terrible Indie-Harry cliches), but it's been replicated so many times over so many fics over so many years... kind of like a clone of a clone of a clone that has degenerated with each subsequent generation.
