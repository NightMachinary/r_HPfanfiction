I have read through almost all of the first 5 pages of completed H/Hr stories on fanfiction.net and I am wondering if there are any stories on other sites that I should read. Anything goes, preferably no excessive bashing.


** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][portkey.org]] It has everything.

**** It depends on what I'm in the mood for. Searching for stories on fanfiction.net is alot easier, but porkey narrows down the topic much more to my preference.

** I have a big old folder, but without reading through them all again here's the one I'll link you: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/amethyst_jackson/KLFTB.html][Kissing Lessons for the Beginner]]. I won't swear to you that the writing is the best, but it's funny and not in a loopy, ridiculous way. That makes it a nice change from a lot of H/Hr writers who take it so damn /seriously/ (not that I don't like a lot of those as well).

** Quite a few H/Hr stories can be found among the collection at [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors.net]]. (Registration generally required to read.)
