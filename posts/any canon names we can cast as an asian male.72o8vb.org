No matter how obscure!

I pretty sure the original 40 Su Li is intended to be a girl, but I'm open to going that direction. Su is actually a Chinese surname, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe they were Johnny Cash fans.

Wayne Hopkins, Roger Malone, Oliver Rivers, Stephen Corn, Stewart Ackerly seem unlikely. I'm pretty sure we can eliminate Terry Boot and Michael Corner (isn't michael blonde?). Probably not Eddie Carmichel (the ravenclaw selling magical adderal), either.

What about some of those randoms that are sprinkled throughout? I'm willing to ignore the movies. Some of the more obscure names seem unlikely, like Stebbins & Harper, even without a first name.

Miles Blethley, Terence Higgs, Peregrine Derrick, C Warrington, Urquhart, and Lucian Bole (misc slytherin quidditch players) also seem like unlikely asian surnames. I suppose its possible the "Bradley" Ron talks about on the Ravenclaw team could be a Bradley Chen, but the usage seemed to indicate it was a surname (Roger Davies is Davies). Ritchie Coote and Jimmy Peakes sound like pasty englishmen to me.

More obscure: B Dunstan, K Bundy or S Capper? Probably not. Bob, the guy with the fire breathing chicken at the minisntry? Kevin, the little kid who stole his dad's wand at the Goblet? Probably too old or too young. August Pye? Doesn't seem plausible asian, plus too old. I'm looking for a student.

Derek, the random first year from Azkaban who stayed over the holidays? Well, that's my best guess. Pretty common for parents to give a very anglicized first name to a second generation kid.


** A name does have to sound Asian to belong to an Asian person, either because of a change in last name during immigration or adoption. Or, maybe the kid is Eurasian, with an Asian mom and a Caucasian dad, so he has a Caucasian sounding surname. Those are just a few examples of Asian people with white sounding names. Also, I don't know a single Asian person born in the US with a first name that doesn't sound "American". I can't imagine naming conventions are that different in the U.K.

** If you're looking at the obscure, mentioned-only-once names, you might as well just pick an OC.

Alternately, if you're that stuck on canon names, you could say they're adopted, or have one white English parent, or are the child of immigrant (grand)parents that gave the kid an English name in an attempt to assimilate more (possibly the adults legally changed their own names for the same purpose).

Debatable. While the character will essentially be an OC, someone who's making a "single-point-of-departure" fic where everything is supposed to be consistent with canon may not want to make up a new Hogwarts student out of thin air who would surely have been mentioned somewhere in the canon timeline.

** Are you asking which of those names sound Asian, or which characters you can cast as Asian? Because those are very different questions. You can cast any character as any race. It's a magical universe, not too much of a stretch to imagine Asian characters with anglicised names, especially considering these people exist in our universe...

** You can imagine any number of backgrounds to get a WASP-y name on an Asian dude, and Rowling endorses reading characters as any race or ethnicity you want --

But that's rather thin on the ground when you want your readers to understand, unavoidably and to their core, that this person is Korean or Vietnamese or Mongolian. So you'd have to bring it up again and again, rub our faces in it, make it a plot point. Which might not be what you're after.

So maybe change someone's name, or create an OC and link them to the existing students via their relatives?

** Just a side note -- Su might be a Chinese surname, but if you're going to use Su Li, Li is the much more obvious surname choice. It's many times more common.

** If the characters have surnames, then none of the ones you've listed above are very 'Asian' surnames. I believe in some parts of India, children have their fathers' first names as surnames, so that's something you might be able to use. Peregrine Derrick, for example, has a last name that could be a first name. However, you'll probably be hard-pressed to find anyone named Peregrine.

If only the characters' first names are known, sure, you could cast some as Asians, so long as you give them a surname that sounds Asian. Using anglicised first names is fairly common in some parts of Asia. I, for one, was born in Asia, and have an anglicised first name, like many others in my home country.

** I mean, you can just take the name Wayne Hopkins and make him an Asian character. Adoption does exist.

** No, sadly not - at least not in Harry's year. You can look here:

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/1991#Individuals_that_started_at_Hogwarts]]

This list contains all names that can be considered canonical in any way, even from the movie-credits.
