** Was it linkffn( End Of the Line)? Because there were some chapters in that one that made me cry too.

**** It's a crossover in that it takes some Discworld concepts, but no knowledge of the series is needed to understand it. Honestly, if I didn't know better I wouldn't think it was a crossover at all.

**** I've read this fic earlier, and I wasn't even aware that it was a crossover until now. It's a series of unrelated HP characters right as they've died, with various experiences, from depressing to heartwarming.

***** Death (the Guard) and associates (including the random teacher on a school trip in one of the chapters) are very much Discworld characters. But they are not the main focus of the story.
