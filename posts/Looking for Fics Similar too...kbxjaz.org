Looking for fanfiction similar to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] by EvansEntranced. (The Dursleys abandon Harry in the countryside at age 6. He learns to fend for himself in the woods, discovers his magic and comes to the conclusion he is a forest elf.) Also it's sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8509020/1/The-Handbook-of-Elf-Psychology][The Handbook of Elf Psychology]]. Things I love about it: Light-hearted, Self-sufficient Harry, Parseltongue/snake friend, Magical creatures, Exasperated!Snape, Confused and oblivious Harry, House Elves,

(I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it!)

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft
