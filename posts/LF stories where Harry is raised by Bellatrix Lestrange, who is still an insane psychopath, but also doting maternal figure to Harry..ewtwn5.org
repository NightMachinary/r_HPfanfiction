  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Harry's only friend is also Voldemort's daughter. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey, strong, intelligent Harry.Harry x Fleur.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
