I've heard of this thing called Shifting and apparently it's where you transport yourself to a fandom of you choice (obvs HP) and it's supposedly very realistic.

Is it safe to do this?

Is it actually possible?

Have you done it before, and if so, what was it like?

I never dream (unless its a nightmare) so does that mean I can't shift?


** In Ireland. Shifting means to kiss or snog and I really misunderstood this question.

I also think your describing dreaming.

*** Sounds like lucid dreaming.

** They call it Reality Shifting, theres prob a subreddit for it tbh. If you want the psychological answer behind it, it's a powerful form of dissassociation/lucid dreaming depending on if you manage it awake or asleep. So is it possible? Probably. I'd be surprised if absolutely everyone who's said theyve done it were just doing it for clout.

** Shifting, as an objective experience, is not possible.

Shifting, as a subjective experience, is possible, but be aware that you're only /shifting/ into an altered state of consciousness.

(When I was a theist, I stumbled into learning how to trigger "visions" and other religious experiences with the right prep work. Reality shifting isn't exactly the same thing as my visions, but they're in the same category.)
