From what I understand, his Hulk transformations closest counterpart in Harry Potter universe is werewolf transformation. Werewolf cannot become animagi. What is your opinion on Bruce Banner's possibility of being an animagus, and if he can what would his form be?

I am not writing a fic, just wondering.

Can't they? Where does it say so? I know that an Animagus in animal form is immune to werewolf bites, but I didn't know the reverse held.

*** I do not know if it is confirmed canon but I inferred it from the behaviour of the Marauders and the nature of lycantrophy in HP books. I think if werewolf could become animagi, Remus Lupin would have with the other marauders. As you said an animagus cannot become infected while transformed. Maybe an animagi werewolf would not transform into a werewolf if he spent the full moon night in his animagi form as well? Plus animagus form is determined by the personality/inner nature of the animagi (according to harrypotter.fandom.com) and lycantrophy is a disease?curse? that permanently changes the nature of the werewolf. This change in the nature of the werewolf may affect his possibility of becoming an animagi. Animagus transformation is described as a "kind of Self-Transfiguration, but not a charm or transfiguration" in WOMBAT test answers, so if the nature of lycantrophy is curse based the two magics may conflict. To conclude, I am not sure. It sounded right in my head, but I might just be wrong.

Why? The entire point of the Marauders learning Animagussery was so that they could keep Lupin company while he was in lupine form. He could hardly keep company to himself, could he? Plus, Lupin is the caring-about-the-rules-a-little-bit one. He might have tolerated his friends' egregious lawbreaking but been more than a little queasy about becoming an unregistered Animagus /himself/, especially since the punishment would likely be much harder for a werewolf. ...Not to mention that "turning into an animal" would have bad mental associations for him, so who's to say that all rules aside, he'd even enjoy doing it?

The only real reason I can see that a werewolf couldn't become an Animagus that I can see from canon is that, if he doesn't have Wolfsbane Potion, the werewolf in lupine form wouldn't be able to keep the Mandrake leaf in his mouth during the full moon. But that's only if you accept the Pottermore version of the Animagus ritual, and few people do, because it's daft. Ignoring /that/, though, it's imaginable that the fatigue that comes with the lycanthrope transformations might make the Animagus ritual harder or more dangerous to perform.

Either way, though, I do think a werewolf Animagus would turn into a wolf regardless of whether they were in animal form when the Full Moon rose.

That is a point I have overlooked...

***** Apart from the difficulties with the Pottermore ritual, many of the ways in the Fandom would also conflict with werewolves. Many of the fics I have read goes with method of meditating until the person finds their "inner animal" and then either drinking a potion/doing a ritual/having somebody transfigure them. A werewolf might have problems with the meditation part due to the dominance the werewolf part has on the mind of the wizard without the wolfbane potion. It's effect spillover to the personality of the wizard/witch as well, i.e. Bill Weasley likes rare steak after becoming a werewolf. This spillover /might/ effect the meditation in the fan theories.

The part about Remus Lupin having no reason/lack of interest was a nice point that I did not think of. But this does not effect the main question, as Bruce Banner transforms when he is angry and as you said the process of transformation would be hard (if possible) for the werewolves who spend most of their time human, can Hulk even become an animagi?

That's fanon, though. There is no "wolf" split-personality as is sometimes depicted; the transformed werewolf simply loses logical thinking and gains a(n absolutely un-wolf-like, and explicitly so) craving for human flesh.

When it comes to /that/ question, the cheating answer is: no, because he's a Muggle. And the slightly less cheating answer is: yes, because the Hulk transformation, for all that it maybe kinda looks like lycanthropy, is not a magical one and thus has zero bearing on magical theory.

******* I think reading too much fanfic may have muddled my brains...

Though on the case of Banner, can non-humans become animagi, as in goblins or other near-humans?

Maybe Hulk more close to the other near-humans than to werewolves because his changes are genetic, making him not a human.

******** It's a good thought. Hm... Goblins /can/ probably transform into animals, or they could if the spell were developed; we are after all told that the only reason they don't use magic to the same extent as wizards is that the wizards got there first when it came to inventing wands, and have denied them to everyone else to secure their power in the Wizarding World. That being said, an “Anikobold” (you wouldn't call him an Ani/magus/: /magus/ means wizard, after all) might not get there by using the exact same ritual as the wizards, if that ritual was developed precisely for humans. We do know that Polyjuice Potion doesn't work right on nonhumans or partial nonhumans, even when they are fully able to perform wizard magic: see Hagrid during the Battle of the Seven Potters.

All this being said, it's not entirely clear whether this incompatibility has to do with Hagrid's different physical form or genes, or if it's to do with his having, to some extent, Giant /magic/ alongside his wizard magic (i.e. his relative magic-resistance). If that is so, then the problem wouldn't exist for the Hulk, as his change later in life wouldn't mean he wasn't still, /magically speaking/, a human, with a human soul and human magic.
