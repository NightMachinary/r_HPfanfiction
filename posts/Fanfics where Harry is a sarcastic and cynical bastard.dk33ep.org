** Well... for sarcastic and cynical just read the books. Harry is a sarcastic asshole in canon. He's not a bastard though.

For fanfics... linkffn(12798308) - he's pretty much as you describe.

linkffn(11669575) - probably also qualifies. But it's soooooooo bad, the ASoIaF sequel is better in my opinion.

linkffn(3559907) - and an oldie but a goodie.

** linffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes by Peeve's Best Friend)

Unfortunately abandoned but exactly what you are looking for. Beware tho Potter are evil in this fic, tho my theory is Dark Magic affected them.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)
