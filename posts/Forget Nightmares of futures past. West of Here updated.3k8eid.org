  "What is it with the females around here 'bouts always stripping me naked?" he grumbled at finding himself once again without a stitch of clothing on his person and the sheet doing little to mask his joy at er... rising with the dawn. "I swear, if it ain't Pomfrey having herself a go at my expense, then it's Katie playing the jealous card and Hermione the prude, whilst the rest of the crowd ogles my bits. Neither one of those two are foolin' anybody. I bet Ron's got a story to tell when he's in his cups and that Katie kisses like she's starving and your tongue's a beef steak hot off the spit." He grumbled to himself.

****** I'm curious, where 'west of here' did Harry end up that he picked up speech patterns like that? Certainly not earth, it must be a dimension hopping fic or something.

**** I have not! Which means I shouldn't criticize much, and I likely went overboard. It could be that story as a whole may be good. What do you like about it?

***** Because its MASSIVELY AU. Basically Harry gets transported to the US west during cowboy and Indian times. That's why he talks that way. When he finally gets put back into his own time line he is much harsher and acts a bit like Sirius Black is portrayed in FanFics.

****** Are Harry and the consequences of his absence to the wizarding world the only thing that is changed? Or are their other AU aspects (changed magical system, OC characters, etc)

His speech patterns came across as hokey to me. What did people sound like back then and out west? I'm not sure. Maybe like that. I do like the element of Harry being harsher due to his experiences.

******* His dissappearence is the only major change in the oringinal world flows naturally in his absence (Tom has taken over, Hogwarts is the last holding of the "light" Hermione has married Ron.

The old west has an OC tribe that teach him a different brand of magic, he uses weapons magic instead of wanded magic.

His speech is reflected of spaghetti wester cowboy talk.

** Updated to completion?? I'm not quite sure if the last line is a cliff-hanger ride-into-the-sunset kind of ending or just set-up for the next chapter.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
