I've seen fics where he is master of fire magic, or transfiguration, runes, dark arts, or some nebulous, poorly described "shadow magic". I have yet to encounter any where he uses lightning and electricity, due to his lightning bolt scar. Anyone know of any fics like that? I prefer no death eater pairings and no smut. Anything else goes.


** Not really what your looking for but the black queen series has fem!harry using a lightning spell in almost every chapter and one of the wizards Trying to kill her has power of over storms

** There was a fic I read a while back where Harry picked up some survivalist spells and really took to a lightning bolt curse. It's why I want to see storm mage! Harry so much in the first place. But people have shit taste and electricity doesn't have the same edge potential as “the flames of hell” or “forbidden arts of necromancy” so most people probably won't write it.
