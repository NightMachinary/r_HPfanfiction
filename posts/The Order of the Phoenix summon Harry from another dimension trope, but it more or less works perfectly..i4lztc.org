They summon someone to defeat Voldemort and get exactly what they wanted. Some 50+ year old Head of the DMLE Harry, or 150+ year old semi-retired Headmaster Harry, or something. At this point in his life he's Voldemort's equal or more and he knows what to do. He's pretty peeved about getting kidnapped like that, but they're not assholes about it and he's very understanding, works with them, has some interesting interactions, possibly a badass Harry & Dumbledore teamup scene or two, then he gets sent home.

 

It doesn't have to be /exactly/ like that, but that's the sort of thing I'm looking for. I've never seen this sort of play on the trope.

Anybody have any recommendations?


** I'd love to see something like that

What kinda peeves me in those kinds of fics Is that the Harry that they bring back Usually hides their identity from the Order Like Why What do you have to gain from that, other then withholding information that really doesn't effect anything Idk, just annoys me for some reason

*** I've never seen this trope done right. The author always does one of these:

- Idiot Harry, who hides his identity from the Order and then laments his misfortune instead of doing literally anything useful at all

- Whipped Harry, who bends and acquiesces to all their demands, this can be with a side note of story-long hidden resentment for extra flavor

- Edgelord Harry, who has spiky hair and a trenchcoat and uses guns for some reason, and also speaks like Dumbledore in My Immortal

I doubt most authors can actually write good characters. I, like many others, have my favourite caricature Harrys, but I'd really like to see a Harry that is an actual character for once instead of just having a single trait that is more of a hinderance to the story instead of a boon.

Also, most authors have no idea what a BAMF actually is. It isn't being edgy, or being "dark" or "evil". It's being supremely capable in every single way. Every BAMF is by definition a Gary Stu because they cannot fail (and that's ok). Duke Nukem would be a BAMF. So would Doomguy.

All these, coupled with a serious drought of creativity in this fanfiction community are one of the major reasons why so many stories are pretty much objectively bad.

Think about it - how often have you read scenes that are copied from the books 1:1, or suffered through plotlines that never changed deeper than superficially despite becoming increasingly logically inconsistent? How often have you read a crossover where Harry just becomes someone else, or steals all the lines of another character? I can count the Doctor Who crossovers where Harry is a timelord and doesn't just become the Doctor 2.0, spouting cringey moffat lines without the cinematic setup to make them work on one hand, because there are none and I just shake my fist in despair.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

**** Team-up wise, yeah this is a good fic. There is also one where harry is kicked out in his second year. and Dumbledore is never reinstated as a headmaster. That team-up is also pretty sick. I don't really like the whole idea of Dumbledore's character tbh. He was too important and too modest about everything. There something immensely likable about the canon him. I like fics that don't bash him. But intellectually i don't approve of his actions. That is why Dumbledore bashing fics don't really bother me, unless the bashing is too irritating and becomes the central part of the fic.

“But Voldemort is still a threat now!” Cried someone who looked to be Nymphadora Tonks. Her hair was pink and short, which contrasted from the long bluebell he was used to.

Harry Potter, former Slytherin, now minister of magic, had been kidnapped - to put it honestly and bluntly- into a different dimension. At age 27, he was the youngest minister of magic in his earth, and had defeated his Voldemort 10 years before.

He wasn't being held captive, really, not physically, anyway. Sure, he wasn't tied to a chair, handcuffed, or physically restrained in any way. However, he was surrounded by what appeared to be the dimensions best fighters, all of whom were in the middle of the war and trying to determine if he was a threat or an ally.

He contemplated trying to fight them all. That would probably be more trouble than its result.

“So,” he began dryly. “Why do you need me, when you have a Harry Potter of your own?”

“He's only a child!” Shrieked the twin of Molly Weasley. Harry cringed slightly. He had liked the woman, as overbearing on her children as she was. It never really bothered him.

“Fine. I'll train this... Version of me to defeat Voldemort.” He reluctantly answered, wondering whether he was ever going to get a break.

“Thank you for agreeing, my boy.” Dumbledore spoke up as he entered the room. “We do have someone who would like to see you.”

Harry turned his face and emotions to stone as Sirius Black walked in, resisting the urge to strike.

“Bloody hell...” Sirius whispered, looking at the man who had Lily's green eyes but James's messy black hair.

“I suppose he's not a traitor in this universe?” Harry inquired, ignoring the astounded man.

“Whatever do you mean?” Mrs. Weasley said.

“In my world, Sirius Black was the second secret keeper of my parents, after Remus Lupin stepped down from the post. He had joined the Knights of Walpurgis, desperate for his family's approval. He then betrayed my parents to Voldemort, leaving Remus as the fall man!” Harry roared, barely restraining himself from standing up and killing the man. He thought he would have had more control than this, but seeing the face that had haunted his dreams for years brought back the nightmares.

Dumbledore was unruffled, therefore choosing to ignore his outburst and asking Harry to tell a bit about himself. The former auror and war hero did not let his guard down.

“I am 27 years of age, former auror and head of Magical Law Enforcement, youngest minister of magic, and I defeated Voldemort when I was seventeen with no skills but my own.”

“That makes no sense!” Tonks said. “Where were the order of the Phoenix?”

“They left me for dead. I am a Slytherin, through and through. One thing I learned when surviving seven years in the house of snakes is that injuries don't matter when they can be healed right away, but the pain never fully leaves you.”

“My apologies that you had to endure that, my boy.” Dumbledore tried to placate him.

“I had to climb my way from nothing, research by myself, because it didn't matter if you were a Slytherin when you were a... mudblood.” He spat out the slur like it was the scum of the earth.

“I endured the word for years. My year mates and those in my house blamed me for their parents going to Azkaban. I was in the pit of snakes, and all I could do was remain invisible and take the bearings like I had every year before from my relatives.” His breathing was ragged. He had waited so long to get this out, because he knew that at very sight of any weakness, his position could've been taken from him.

“So, yes, I will train your little Gryffindor golden boy, I will make sure he is prepared. I will make sure that no one ever breaks him like they did me.”

They all looked astounded, Molly Weasley exchanging a look with Tonks. Why had no one helped this boy? What happened to him to make him go into Slytherin?

“I'd like to be shown to my room. Then, perhaps, we can sit down for a nice meal, and... talk.” It was a dangerous word. Did they really want to know more?

Dumbledore agreed, nodding at Tonks to show him to his room. He stepped up. On the way, he remained in his facade of calm, helping her up as she tripped over different things laying around the hallways.

“You're quite different from the ‘Dora I know.” He commented after the sixth time she had nearly face-planted.

“Oh?” Tonks said. “What am I then? Tall? A janitor? No, don't tell me.... Am I Veela?”

Harry chuckled. “Still shorter than me. We're quite good friends, you know. Partners on the auror force. Your hair is just a bit different, as is your face, but I learned to recognize you anywhere.”

“How?” She looked dumbfounded.

“Speech patterns.” He said simply, turning the corner and striding along. She jogged to keep up with him.

“How good of friends are we?” She asked.

“You were part of my wedding party.” He refused to elaborate, giving her only a secretive smirk. She glanced down, finally noticing the Celtic knot ring on his finger.

“Handsome man like you? Who's the lucky lady? Anyone I would know?” He gave her wink.

“Spoilers.” Huffing, Tonks stopped at a door in the middle of the third floor.

“Lovely.” He said, pushing it open carefully. There was a rickety bed in the corner, with different suitcases lined up against the wall. He reached into his pocket, retrieving his wand- Tonks noticed it strangely resembled Dumbledore's- and what looked like a small suitcase.

With a concise movement, the suitcase was enlarged and had begun to unpack. Harry turned back to Tonks, offering his arm with a handsome and roguish grin.

“Now, my good lady, I think it's time I met everyone.” She accepted it and they walked down the stairs once more in silence.

He paused at the end of the staircase, drawing his confidence like he did each time he had to enter the great hall, flashing back to the torment.

“Are you alright?” Tonks inquired. He nodded stiffly, stepping down into the landing. The chatter immediately stopped and everyone at the long table stared at him in comedic fashion.

“Blimey, Harry!” A voice cried. “He looks like you!”

“Em,” Dumbledore hesitated. “May I introduce... Harry Potter?” The hubbub erupted, and he steeled himself to the noise. A great flash appeared, leaving everyone blinking and their ears ringing.

“If you'd allow me to explain myself.” He said quietly. “My name is Harry James Potter. I am from what appears to be a different dimension.”

The other Harry stared at him, memorizing and recognizing each of the features that he saw in the mirror each morning. The green eyes he was complimented on were unobscured by glasses, though they were the same colour. They had the same colour hair too, although this man's hair was a bit longer. He had the beginnings of a beard, something that Harry wished he could do. The one thing that drew his attention, was the long, red, and scabby scar than ran down this man's face.

“I believe we all should eat.” He commanded the room and the attention surrounding him, and they all dig into their meals.

Nymphadora looked between the two of them, noticing and marveling at the similarities and differences that thirteen years and a different life had made.

She wondered, though.... Was he prophesied?

  In a parallel dimension, Albus Dumbledore has done everything he can think of to stop Voldemort. That is until he hears a prophecy about a hero traveling across worlds to save them. Can our Harry handle being summoned to this new reality? REWRITTEN!

  Out of desperation, Dumbledore uses strange magic to summon someone who has the knowledge on how to defeat Voldemort, only what what he got wasn't expected. Self-insert.

  Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.
