** You should check out They Shook Hands. It's about a world where Harry shook Draco's hand and they became best friends. Umbridge doesn't arrive until year 5 (obviously) but they do an interesting take on her as an actually useful Defense teacher and someone that Harry ends up looking up to as she takes an interest in him and his dueling skills. Not sure how to link this though so just search they shook hands on fanfiction.net.

** Linkffn(Insidious Inquisitor by Yunaine) questionable quality (esp. w.r.t. Dumbledore) but enjoyable while it lasts.

** She's pretty different in my story "Patron" - she is attractive, on the outside. Fired from the Ministry, she's recruited by Voldemort and used for a few plots of his. She doesn't appear until a bit into the story, though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** It's the Real Us as in the one where Harry and Hermione start experimenting at age 11 yes.

However, insofar as to say that in reality the actuality of such an act happening within a school during this current Era we live in is not so far as to officially say that despite the official reasonings by school officials, the unofficial answer is that the persons in question in said works would be in correlation with modern day practices by British youth today.
