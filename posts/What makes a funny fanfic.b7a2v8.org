Personal tastes aside, what differentiates a legitimately funny (or even hilarious) fic with something that tries too hard or isn't funny at all? Even if it doesn't quite match your sense of humour, you wouldn't deny that it brought some chuckles.


** - Succinctness. A good joke stops while it's good, instead of beating itself to death. Example being joke variations of Voldemort's name, like Moldyshorts. If he's referred to with a joke name every time, it gets old.

- Set-ups and payoffs. Foreshadowing and Chekhov's guns are useful for more than the mystery genre. Set up a joke in the beginning, eg, "Sirius likes chasing tennis balls", then have it pay off later on, and it makes it more hilarious in hindsight.

- Good writing. A lot of humor wouldn't work if the author isn't competent with writing wordplay, dialogue, and has a sense of comedic timing. Great situational comedy moments come from character banter.

- Organic humor. A joke or humorous observation is made by a character while /in-character/, rather than the story being twisted into a certain plot direction just to create a punchline. If you look at The Office, many of the workplace shenanigans happen because Michael Scott makes terrible decisions befitting of his character's personality, rather than just happening because the writers wanted it to happen. If you, as the audience, feel that the author is "trying too hard", then it means the story has broken your suspension of disbelief, and that is a failure of good writing.

If it's something you're interested in, writing effective comedy is something you can learn if you look into screenwriting. It's not limited to fanfiction.

** I think that really is entirely a matter of opinion --- whether someone is "trying too hard", for example. Excess itself in sufficient quality can become comical; that's the whole point of crackfics. Everyone will have jokes they think are perfect which others find too subtle or complex, and ones they find hilarious which others find overdone and too-oft-repeated. /There is no objective metric of humor./ And that's okay!

*** This isn't even limited to different people. I might find a fic "overdone" one day, then come back to it a week later when I'm in a different mood and think it's hilarious.

Which isn't too say it's completely random. There's definitely techniques you can learn that people use to maximize the impact of jokes, but ultimately whether the joke works or not is going to depend a lot on the reader.
