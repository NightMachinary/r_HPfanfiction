** I think people forget what it is like to actually be in immediate danger for your life.

- The war had lasted for ten years, with seemingly no stopping Voldemort at any point.
- We don't know if Voldemort had anything on Peter: for all we know, he could have been bargaining to save someone else's life and had no other option but to submit. Voldemort is immortal and practically brags about it, the idea of him coming back to follow up on his threats is not hard to believe at all.
- Its easy to be brave when you are in your quiet home, drinking tea, and complaining about your day. Its /hard/ to be brave when you are facing down a group of individuals that have murdered, tortured, controlled, and possibly raped countless hundreds of people and have literally no reason to make an exception for you.

The bottom line is we really have no idea what caused him to turn traitor. Pretty much everyone can be broken; don't let tv and movies fool you. And wizards/witches are not exactly battle-hardened war veterans; they are mostly a bunch of isolationist busy-bodies who don't think too much about any given thing. Breaking/convincing someone with magic is likely unbelievably easy.

** When he betrayed the Potters he was aready a death eater and spy for Voldemort for over a year, Sirius even calls out his lie when he pretends that he was forced to betray the Potters. He also mentioned how Voldemort was winning and he would gain nothing by refusing him.

#+begin_quote
  “You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black, who was shaking too. “Do you deny it?” Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.

  “Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no idea... he has weapons you can't imagine... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me ---”

  <“DON'T LIE!” bellowed Black. “YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!”

  “He --- he was taking over everywhere!” gasped Pettigrew. “Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him?”

  “What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?” said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. “Only innocent lives, Peter!”

  “You don't understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He would have killed me, Sirius!”

  “THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black. “DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!” Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.

  “You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Goodbye, Peter.”

Suppose, Peter Pettigrew is captured by the Death Eaters; Voldemort sees opportunity, and press-gangs him as a spy. You have to remember, Voldemort is a master of Legilimency, he could sift right through Peter's mind, learn about all of his boltholes, his animagus ability, and who all his loved ones are.

He can't tell anyone once he 'escapes' and returns to the Order; if he does, then Voldemort will kill him the next time he reads his mind. If he tries to run and hide, then the Death Eaters will track him down (knowing all of his secrets and friends) and kill him. In either case, Peter will die, and then so will everyone he knows. So he has to wait, and be an unwilling spy, and hope that something happens to make Voldemort's knowledge of him useless.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
And then, James & Lily make him their Secret Keeper. He can't say no, or admit to any misgivings, lest Voldemort know he passed up the opportunity; all Peter can do is mumble yes and try to let his body language give something away. Maybe he somehow holds on to the secret for a year before Voldemort finds out. Maybe he has no choice but to tell the secret early, but Voldemort chooses to sit on it until James & Lily believe they're safe, or they risk becoming a threat again, and/or waits for Halloween.

So, then he's cornered by Sirius Black. Did Peter really cause that explosion that killed a dozen muggles? The same Peter that McGonagall called stupid and foolish and not in the same league as the other Marauders? Did he do it by accident or by purpose? Was it in fact someone else trying to assassinate the both of them? Nobody knows for sure.

But that day, Peter faked his death and disappeared. Why did he never willingly reveal himself? Was he afraid that his (unwillingly) helping Voldemort would be used against him? Did he believe whoever tried to kill him and Sirius with that blast would return? Was he too paranoid to go back to a normal lifestyle? Who knows...?

** I personally don't believe but I've heard arguments that he really loved them, but he felt that Voldemort was winning, so in hopes of protecting his friends when Voldemort does win, he goes and serves him in exchange of him not harming them in any way.

Obviously, it backfired on him if that's the case.

This contains mention of Peter eventually submitting to Voldemort, though he tries to bargain like Snape; where Snape wants Lily to live, Peter wants James, Lily, Sirius and Lupin to all be spared. Obviously Voldemort lied.

**** I really love fics like linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin) that humanise Peter and actually give him a personality, and make him an actual Marauder and friends with the rest of them. He's high-ranking in the Department of International Magical Cooperation and travels a lot. He was obviously a marauder for a reason and I don't like how Rowling wrote him in Snape's Worst Memory.

You know, in canon, he's actually very smart. He only seemed bad at dueling and transfiguration. That leaves room for a lot of subjects for him to be good at. He was quite shrewd and very clever. Obviously he wasn't /just/ a pathetic turncoat. I mean, at a different turn of events where he doesn't turn out as a traitor I can see him as quite successful in his own right, if only overshadowed by Sirius and James.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

1. He didn't have the fame and fortune like James and Sirius nor the skills and talent like the rest of the Marauders .
2. Voldemort was winning the war and Peter found an opportunity to end up on the winning side and get the fame.
3. He was scared of the Dark Lord and thought that betraying the Potter's would elevate him in the inner circle

** Fear. Pure, unadulated fear. The moment he was faced with Lord Voldemort he broke down into sobs and promised to become a traitor if he just let him live, thus becoming a spy for the Death Eaters; and when he became the Secret-Keeper betraying Voldemort was so alien, so out of the question, so dangerous it was, that he went to him and blabbed without a second thought. Not because he /liked/ any of it: he truly /did/ love his friends, and thought Voldemort was a horrible maniac; but because he just couldn't cope with the danger to him personally.

** We're given very little material on how the Marauders interacted as a group, but I think it's obvious that Peter was never considered 'equal' to Sirius, Remus and James. My headcanon is that he was always the weaker one, the one who tagged along but wasn't quite part of the group. Possibly he knew that, and stuck alongside them not out of a sense of true friendship and loyalty, but only because he'd admired and wanted to be like them. But eventually, he realised that he wasn't one of them, no matter how much he wished it, and that realisation weakened his ties to the group even more. All the reasons people have already said apply: he's a coward, he was afraid, he was threatened, etc., but I think another reason is that he simply didn't feel a strong sense of loyalty to the Potters and perhaps felt he wasn't truly friends with them anyway, and that made it easy for him to betray them in order to save himself.

** Off the top of my head:

1. He's a coward and ratted (see what I did there xD) his friends out because he thought Voldemort was winning at the time.

2. Voldemort/his DEs felt that PP was the weakest link of the Order and threatened/promised him regarding friends/family/himself to convince him to comply.

3. Dumbledore is a jerk and manipulated the events :>
