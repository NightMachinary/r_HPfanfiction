So I have been looking for this fic for a while, and I finally found it! But the site that hosted it is down now, and I've managed to find screenshots of every chapter except chapter 51. The author's name is Anna, if that helps! If anyone could send it to me (or even just a full text version of the story) I would really aprpeciate it!

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20050203184609/http://www.witchfics.org:80/anna/romanholiday/index.html][Here]] is the web archive of the story if anyone is interested (only chapter 51 is missing).


** I've got the whole fic as a pdf, epub, and azw3. Drop me a PM with your email and I'll send it to you. (Don't forget to mention what format you want it.)

On a related note, I saved that whole site, but everything except Roman Holiday, The Fire and the Rose I & II, The Other Side of Darkness, and Survivals and Rememberances are in html because I haven't got around to converting them all yet. If anyone wants me to, I will (or I'll just share the HTML files), but obviously the more that needs converting the longer it takes me.

*** Do you also have Ten Too Many by Flibbins? There's a version up on ff.net that references a complete version that was up on Granger enchanted, but I've never been able to track it down.

**** Sorry, no. GE went down before I knew about it; I've only got a handful of fics from there that I picked up from other people, and that isn't one of them.
