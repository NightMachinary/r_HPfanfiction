** I don't know if this qualifies, but...

So I got a new laptop awhile back and figured I'd christen it by doing a rewrite of one of my old stories ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][this bit of rubbish]], penned a decade or so ago), and post it along with the 130k word sequel that's been written and lying fallow. When they're done, I'll post the whole thing in one go.

I'd like to think I've learned a bit about fiction writing in the past decade. (If nothing else, my French fluency has improved substantially and I should have fewer cringe-worthy errors with Fleur's and her father's phrasing.) We'll see what folks think.

** Alrighty. My current project is a fairly AU series called the Chessmaster which follows Harry through all seven years of Hogwarts. There's world building going on (I have over fifty pages on google docs dedicated to this) as well as politics at play. I've always loved political AUs but got bogged down in cliches and unrealistic plot lines. I'm subverting that. This might scare some people, but I'm working on writing a realistic Lord Potter fic (not a Lord Potter-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin fic -- don't worry!). I've done a bunch of research on historical UK, and actually based my Wizengamot system on 16th-18th century British government. Anyways, I can see I'm rambling a bit here, so I'll just pop the link in linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn by Flye Autumne) and duck for cover.

** I was cleaning my computer when I stumbled across this old short story I wrote as an entry for a contest on a fan-site. The theme of the contest was extreme emotion. I thought I would post it here before I delete the file. (I hope this is an okay place to post.)

* Terror
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: terror
  :END:
I felt a tingle as our lips met. The tingling didn't stop, the signals in my nerve endings redoubled and swept across my brain. Pain. Something was wrong. Fear. Huge amounts of adrenalin were being released in my body bringing time to almost a stand still. My fight or flight response screaming at me to get away. I froze, trapped in this moment. I didn't think anything like this would happen.

There was nothing I could do to pull my body away. Panic. I was stuck in my head until I could calm down, but nobody could calm down in this situation. My skin grew cold. My mind is processing faster than my body. Everything is numb, I can no longer feel my body, only my consciousness exists in this moment. Isolation. I want to cry, but my body can't keep up. I want to run and hide, but I can't move. More than anything I want this to stop. Regret.

I feel like an eternity has passed, the last of the adrenalin is leaving my brain so my body can take action. Time is beginning to resume. The numbness is ebbing. I feel the tattered threadbare cloth in my hands. I feel the stone floor beneath my feet. My legs give out despite the chemicals pumping through my blood. As I hit the floor a happy thought finally reaches my mind after all this time. 'Our lips are no longer touching, I'm free.' I began to scream in a happy terror as my eyes burn, flooding with tears. I close my eyes. I no longer have to look at it.

Someone grabs my arm and drags me away. They whisper soothing words, but I'm too distraught to understand their meaning. After a while I stop screaming, my throat is raw even though it's only been seconds, sobbing is much easier on the vocal cords. I blink my eyes, but they burn from the tears. I only manage to catch a glimpse at a face. I've seen this person before. The memories buried under fear an eternity ago resurface. This face is a friend.

I try to say their name between sobs. I stutter a bit before calling out to my friend. They put me in a hug and I cry into their shoulder. The sobs slowly calm down into tremors. I look at them desperately. "We need to leave!" I whisper as tears stream down my cheeks. A moment later we're gone.

After a month in St. Mungo's I finally felt stable enough to care for myself. Calming draughts and cheering charms were the most effective treatment second only to daily visits from my friends. I finally feel like I can joke a bit, I tell my friends the one I've been working on for weeks. "That is the last time I ever kiss a dementor."

**** This is actually covering from first year through seventh, although it more just vaguely goes over the first three years and points out important events rather than retelling every single detail. Major canon divergences start occurring the summer after third year.

The soul bond itself is a huge plot point in an of itself, but it's more of a twin-souls sort of bond. More detail is explained about it in his 5th year, which is the major turning point of the fic. Sorry I'm being super vague about it, but it's a huge spoiler for what is to come, lol.

Whether he chooses to accept it or fight it, he must act or risk losing everything he's fought for and everything that could have been.

** This is the first in a planned trilogy and it's rough at times, the beginning especially. If you know linkffn(Renegade Cause) then you'll find some similarity, though my plot isn't as complex.

I wrote what I like: Dark!Harry, Sirius (kinda wasted in canon), conflicts on multiple fronts and factionalism, Voldemort as a competent enemy. This was the result. I attempted to avoid the pitfalls of Indy fics, though I recognize that I failed in some ways. Still, I think I did get some things right. I loathe to divulge details because spoilers, but if you want to ask more specific questions, I will answer.

*** Okay, real talk. This is probably the best all around Character driven story I have read in the last 3 months. You have alot of mysteries going on at once, which matches your story. You have a dumbledore who isn't insane but old and withered, a Voldemort that knows how to play the fucking game, and a Harry who is struggling to understand how he is going to do what needs done.

That doesn't mention the three characters that drive the story for me, and your emphasis of the slowly maddening of those who stray too far.

You do have some issues. You didn't hit Indy fic level, but instead fell into the "dark magic solves all" issue, along with another issue that either hasn't been explored, or wasn't touched deep enough. You mentioned how Dark magic is alike a drug... and it effected those who use it, who crave to want to use more... however you didn't portray this in battle. You have Harry, who supposedly has this addiction, using a bludgeoning spell as his favorite spell. Not a dark curse, but a basic combat spell.

Otherwise, great story. I am going to enjoy reading this for as long as you publish it.

**** Thank you for the praise, before anything else.

I find it curious that Lesser Evils came of as a character driven story to you, because I definitely didn't write it that way. I always put my plot first. I had some major plot points charted out and filled the holes in between as I wrote, though I admit that some moments came to me literally as I wrote the scene and those came from the characters, I think. It's a way to write that works for me.

On the Dark magic angle, I took what you pointed out into account, but the idea of "I am now a Dark wizard and so shall switch from the Common Spellbook to the Dark Spellbook" seemed to silly and game-like to me. I also don't like the concept that every mundane spell has a Dark equivalent that Dafk wizards would prefer. HP magic being concept-based, I see no reason to invent a Dark Stunner when the canon stunner is a perfectly good spell. I lean more towards the idea that Dark magic by itself is just a different set of techniques and spells, but if you give in to the temptation, it won't change what spells you use (with exceptions) but rather it will.change you, if you let it. I hinted (perhaps not enough) that Moody, who can use all 3 Unforgivables, is not a Dark wizard because he resisted the pull of Dark magic. Dumbledore on the other hand, has always felt vulnerable, felt the temptation, and so to ensure he doesn't change in ways he doesn't want, he refuses to even touch Dark magic at all (think of Gandalf refusing the Ring because he'd be tempted to use it for good, when the Ring is only capable of evil). I'm not saying Dark magic will literally turn one evil or that it itself is evil. Rather, Dark magic loosens some impulses and you still have a say, to a point, in /how/ you change because of it, but go far enough and all paths eventually converge.

** Beyond the Veil.

Linkffn(12132088)

It's a mass effect X Harry Potter crossover where Harry gets tossed into the Mass Effect setting. Chaos ensues. Mild slow-burn romance included.

~150k words right now-- will probably be completed around 200k (if I don't write a sequel in Mass Effect Andromeda) It's a project I've been working on for a while now. I'm also currently rewriting the first chapter, as it's a bit of an info dump.

It isn't complete, but it's getting there.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Now where it goes, on the other hand... That's still a mystery. But hey! Adventure, right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.

***** It just seemed out of left field. I would say whether it is a good choice depends on what your reasoning is behind the decision. Until the story progresses and we find out */why/* it's just an "Okay, that happened" type of situation for me.

I can honestly say I've never read a fanfic where Ginny had that background. So at least you're treading some new ground with it.

As for the rest of the story...I don't like your Harry. He's really passive, he should be more upset at Dumbledore (which means he should actually be upset instead of so accepting and passive) especially when Dumbledore tries to fix his mistakes with Harry. And having Quirrel as his tutor? WTF was that? I had assumed Quirrel was NOT possessed with how you, and your Dumbledore, treated him in the story. The non-swerve threw me.

** Normally I am not one for self promotion and prefer finding readers naturally, but I just thought I'd put this up on here in case anyone was interested.

Link: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12353582/1/The-Assistant]]).

Main character is Percy Weasley and asks what if he had never left the family but instead of joining the Order, he found his own way of fighting back using his own contacts. Explores Ministry politics in a way similar to the canon system (no inherited Wizengamot seats, for example), uses some characters likel Amelia Bones or Penelope Clearwater, and the relationship with his family since there's still some tension due some difference on values. Fundamentally, it's a coming-of-age story as Percy learns to understand his parents and the other authority figures he has come to realize aren't so infallible. Some Ron and Ginny as well.

There's no pairings planned. There is Audrey, a bit. 7 chapters and a prologue at the moment and another will be out one of these days.

** linkffn(The Carriage Held)

A Harrymort fic as told by Severus Snape. It updates every Sunday, and there's going to be 21 chapters, so it'll be done in about five weeks (very exciting!).

It was originally going to be a Snape-mentors-Harry fic, but I wanted to have the horcrux influencing Harry, and then quickly realized that Harrymort was actually just a way more fun character than Harry was. One of my readers was a little upset at the change in protagonists, but most people (disclaimer: of the people who left reviews) are pretty into it and I'm pleased. I've since tried to make it more clear that the fic isn't really about Harry that much, and I think that's helped.

It's my first longer fic, so it's not perfect, but I've had a good time writing it.

  Severus Snape finds himself wrapped up in the mystery that is Harry Potter, while struggling with a few more mysteries of his own. (OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.)

** I've been working on a canon rewrite called Harry Potter and the Girl in Red (First Year: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6835726)]]). It's a D&D crossover with a similar premise to that of Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20)]]) (stick a D&D character in the Harry Potter Universe and go from there).

My OC, Rose, is an acquired taste, although she ends up taking a backseat to the other characters as the story progresses. My writing wasn't all that good when I started, and I accidentally made Rose a Mary Sue, so I don't blame you if you can't get past that. If you can, I do my best to utilize the other characters throughout, thus giving everyone a chance to shine.

Her presence has an impact on the other students, and thus alters the plot. There's still a troll attack, but it's not in the bathroom and hardly resembles the original. The basilisk still roams the school, but it doesn't die in the Chamber of Secrets, and killing it is a team effort.

I keep a buffer of chapters, so while I'm finishing up publishing year three, I'm finishing up writing year four. I have plans going through year seven, and have every intention of finishing it.

I know there are a lot of elements I use that people on here don't like (OC, not Harry-centric), so I know it's not for everyone. Check it out if it seems like something you might like.

** I haven't updated this in a while, but it isn't abandoned. I have just been trying to work on a few of my older fics that hadn't had much attention recently. I have a few of those done now though, so I will be returning to this soon.

Scarlet Fox, my crossover with Miraculous Ladybug, can be read fandom blind. Basically on the Miraculous side of things, Harry earns a magic necklace that allows him to transform into a fox themed hero with illusion based powers.

Said necklace comes with its very own Kwami companion (demi god like creature which is bound to the necklace and gives it its powers) that resembles a fox (in this case) given to him by the guy who is the guardian of all the other Miraculous when they're not in use.

The Kwami is supposed to give advice on how to use the powers and she does- when she feels like it.

Naturally, Harry decides to use this newfound power to fight against Voldemort.

Aside from the interaction with the Miraculous Guardian and Trixx (the Fox Kwami), there aren't any other interactions on the Miraculous side of things for Harry (for now). You also learn about the Fox Miraculous' power alongside Harry in the story, so that part shouldn't be confusing either.

  After an encounter with Master Fu in London, Harry receives his own Miraculous. Using it to become Scarlet Fox, a hero who takes Magical Britain by storm, he discovers that this is what was meant by "the power he knows not", becoming a game changer in his struggle against Voldemort.

  The Final Task did more than just damage Harry. Voldemort's uprising sparked a will within him, a will to change. Waves of Change is coming, and Harry is going to ride it out to fulfil the responsibility bestowed upon him since before he was born. One peculiar French witch might just be the catalyst to his victory. It's not just another love story between a witch and a wizard.

** Lol this is actually just my idea trove. Since I kinda have a problem with writing an actual fanfic. One being I'm lazy and two I just kinda write as the wind breezes, meaning I don't plan anything for a story. I also seem to have a problem taking stories that already have foundations and making into a new story. Feels like I'm taking old meat scraps and turning it into a different meal.

** I just updated my long Slytherin!Harry AU, The Serpent's Gaze. I'm onto the fifth and final book now, which is fun; I'm about 270k into the series, and into the fifth book I just passed 20k today. This last book is probably going to be the longest in the series, but I am excited about it.

So it's a Slytherin Harry AU, and in the fifth book I'm now able to grapple with Voldemort's rise. It's a no-Horcrux AU, so that palaver isn't in sight, and I'm enjoying the casualties I get to write in the war, as well as increasingly complex relationships!

If anyone has any feedback or criticism I'd love to hear it!

Once I finish the fifth book I'm going to back and rewrite the first one, though - as it stands it's something of a rehash, whereas from book two onwards it's original plotlines, and I want to go back and rewrite it with a better original plot.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

HP/Warcraft crossover. Elune doesnt like how the 2 chosen ones are treated in their own worlds so she makes plans to bring them together. So she takes Illidan on a trip across the worlds to Harry Potter so they can help eachother. Writing this because i love Harry using strange magics and because i dont like how Illidan is treated in the World of Warcraft. So im using it to resolve my own frustration. It starts in Azeroth, moves to HP where it will stay for a while during Hogwards years and will continue back in Azeroth to focus on Illidan again. Pairing is Illidan Stormrage/Tyrande Whisperwind and Harry Potter/probably Shandris Feathermoon though still not decided for Harry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12607087/1/Escaping-the-Monotony-of-Life]] Title: Escaping the Monotony of Life Rating: T

The first few chapters start a little slow as I was struggling to get comfortable with my writing. I hadn't started a new fic in over 10 years.

It's an AU that takes place 5 years after the war. Ginny is the protagonist and she joins a potions business with Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy. According to the reviews I've gotten, it is very realistic and funny. The plot is largely driven by economics and romance/friendship but it is verrryyyy slow-burn.

Overall I'd describe it as a fun and exciting slice-of-life slow-burn fic.

Edit: Don't really want to share my plans for it due to spoilers. But I'd say I have 10-15 chapters left.

  It has been five years since the war ended and peace has finally been restored. Now Ginny has to struggle with the monotonous reality of being a witch in her early 20s'. That is until she is offered the opportunity of a lifetime from the least likely person. Not compliant with Cursed Child. Rated T for alcohol use, some profanity, and light suggestive themes.

** Hi, I'm fairly new to reddit, but I thought I might give this a try. The fic that I am currently writing is called Our Own Demons and it's a HP and MCU crossover with Harry as the main character. I know that that might not appeal to a lot of people, but I thought I might put it out there.

It's about 88K right now and I update every other Sunday (or I try to.)

My summary: Tony Stark. Genius. Billionaire. Philanthropist. Ironman. (Reckless. Lonely. Father.)

Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. Wizard. (The Master of Death. Survivor. Breaking.)

Tony Stark never thought he would be a father. But when a lawyer comes knocking and truths become evident, he realizes that he can't let his son walk out of his life. For Harry, acknowledging his relationship with Tony is a last-ditch effort to gain freedom and control over his life. Although the journey might not be easy, Tony and Harry learn to heal and become a family, facing trials and tribulations on the way such as a scheming Death, a Mad Titian, Dark Wizards, dangerous Doctors, and living Wards. Minor Peter Parker/Harry Potter. No pairings for Tony. Strong T rating for talk of sensitive subject matter. No explicit sexual content, but an author who uses too much bad language.

(Look forward to Runic magic, Quantum Theory, Peter Parker, and lots of Marvel cameos)

...

It's not as angsty as it sounds, and I'm doing a lot of research into Quantum Physics to actually get into theories about how magic works. I planning to get into philosophical existential questions about free will and choices, with Harry being fated to be the Master of Death. The goal for the fanfiction is around 300k, and I try to make my story unpredictable to some extent.

Anyways, if anyone is interested, let me know what you think :)

Just thought to ask someone to read and to say if idea is interesting / worth continuing. OC character is sent from the future to kill Harry, I'm thinking about changing a past Canon events before year 4 and it should be told in the pov of Harry.

** Ariana The basement walls seemed to close in on me. The dank dark walls pushed close threatening to squish me. Flashes of light my father's yells the screams of the boys Suddenly I felt it the scream erupted out of me. The walls repelled back and eventually broke shattering to pieces around me falling to the ground. My mother ran in and took me into her arms. Screaming I wriggled free black mass surrounding me consuming all taking everything in it's path. I shook from the power screaming. Then as suddenly as it started it stopped and I was left on the ground panting, tears streaming down my face all my energy gone drained out of me along with the black mass. I looked around the basement that had become my home my flimsy bed had thrown against the wall shattered and now lying in pieces on the fall. My blankets were lying on the floor tattered pieces still floated through the air drifting and swaying, hovering in the air. My eyes followed on brightly coloured piece as it floated to the floor and landed on a dark still lump. My mind suddenly took in what it was and a heartbreaking sob exited my chest as a rushed across the room towards my mother's body. I grasped and flipped it over. I looked at her face and felt my heart sink. this is my new story i'm writing. is it good any opinions?? the rest can be found at [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/117970724-ariana]]

** linkffn(A Pot of Gold by Dakeyras) - NSFW

Context: this was written partially as a way to win an argument (mostly unrelated, it had to do with Rule 35 at one point), but I kinda got into it, mostly for the absurd premise. The story is about equal parts set in/focused on the Harry Potter and Naruto settings, but the only Harry Potter character who's mentioned by name is Rita Skeeter.

I'd love to get some feedback on it, even if it's just a short note about something you particularly liked/disliked.

I'm working on a longer fic for Harry Potter as well, but it's slow going because my focus is split between four or five different things and I've just started a year-long internship, which keeps me busy.

** I'm currently working on a bit of a coming of age story featuring Teddy. The basic gist is Teddy wants to be an Auror and Harry doesn't want him to. It's set in my consistent AU Potterverse as all of my other stories and goes along with California Dreamin' and The Thunderbird's Egg. I'm not planning on posting any of it until it's done, but my plan is to post a chapter a day and right now it's looking like 10 or so chapters. Here is a snippet from chapter 1:

A few minutes later they were cruising down the main road from the school and on the way to the perennially busy Bay Bridge. Harry took a sheaf of papers out of his satchel and leafed through them, grading pen in his mouth. “So,” he asked around it, “have you finished filling out those university applications?”

Teddy groaned inwardly and focused on the road ahead, pretending he hadn't heard his godfather. He felt Harry's eyes on him and he flicked his own for a quick look. “Mostly,” he said when he confirmed that he was definitely being stared at.

“When do you plan to finish those? There's a deadline, you know.”

“I know.”

“What are your top three choices?”

Teddy was silent before finally sighing. “I don't have a top three.”

“Are you just going with one or two?” Harry asked with a note of concern in his voice. “You know that's risky if you don't get into either one.”

“I don't know if I want to go to university, all right?” Teddy blurted out as he merged carefully onto the busy freeway.

Harry was blessedly silent for a moment. “Do you want to apprentice instead? I'm sure Ginny can get you into a position at SF Thaumaturgical---”

“No, I don't want to be a Healer. Where did you get that idea?” Teddy shot him a look of amazement.

“Do you want to do a business internship with Jacob, then? You know he'd love to have you.”

“No way,” Teddy said emphatically. He liked Jacob, but he was best in small doses and he just couldn't imagine spending the entire day with the man.

“Quidditch tryout? I've still got some friends on English teams and I could probably get you one. What about magineering?”

Teddy tilted his head to one side and then shook it. “Nah.”

“Do you want to go back to England? Ron could probably get you in at his firm,” Harry said, rustling the papers around in his lap. Teddy shook his head again. The thought of working all day in a law office just gave him the willies. “What then? Tell me and I'll help you, yeah?”

Teddy took a deep breath and gripped the steering wheel tighter as he steered the big car on the approach to the bridge. “I want to be an Auror. Like you and Mum.” As he knew he would be, Harry was silent and Teddy forced himself to maintain his relaxed position, looking as if he hadn't just dropped an atomic bomb in the middle of the car.

The rest of the ride to the parking garage was silent, Teddy acutely aware of Harry radiating disapproval in the seat next to him. He stole a glance at him as he made a right turn, feeling his stomach sink at the expression on his godfather's face as he pretended to focus on the papers in front of him. That furrow between his brows usually meant “We'll talk later, but I'm too angry right now to be civil to you.”

“Good job,” Harry said when Teddy parked the car and shut off the engine, almost making him jump in his seat.

“Thanks,” Teddy said quietly, handing him back the keys. Harry made no move to get out of the car, so he settled back in the seat, waiting for Harry to say what he was going to say.

“Teddy, I want you to listen to me, all right? Really listen,” he said slowly, clearly in “godfather mode.”

“I'm listening.” Teddy crossed his arms, looking straight ahead at the blank cement wall of the parking garage.

“Being an Auror is a tough, dangerous job and Gin and I want you to consider all of your options. You can do anything you put your mind to and we would hate to see you box yourself into a situation that might not be the best fit for you, yeah?” Teddy noted the use of his godmother's name and ‘we' in Harry's statements. “You're excellent at Potions and Transfiguration and I've never seen anyone as good at puzzles as you are. You're a better flyer than me or Gin put together and we know that there are so many other things that you can do.”

Teddy tried to take the praise to heart, but he couldn't help but hear that to Harry, he was too good to be a common Auror like his mother was and he felt a wave of resentment. “So you're saying that my mum was only fit to be an Auror? That she couldn't have done anything else?”

“No, God no! Your mum was amazing, but ... listen, we just don't want you to get hurt. Running after Dark wizards is not a thing to be entered into lightly,” Harry said and Teddy felt him put his hand on his shoulder.

“You came out all right,” Teddy said truculently, choosing not to shake Harry's hand off of him.

“By the skin of my teeth. I've been shot, stabbed, hexed within an inch of my life, had my nose broken more times than I can count and I'm pretty sure I've regrown all of the bones in my body at some point,” Harry said, sounding like he was warming to his subject. “If I'd stayed in, I'd probably look like old Mad-Eye by now.”

“Yeah, but you and Ron went in even though you knew it was dangerous.”

“Teddy, we grew up in a different time and didn't have the same opportunities as you do now. Walking down the street was dangerous and we just ... traded one for the other,” he said, his voice softening toward the end.

Teddy sighed, feeling the persuasion in Harry's words in spite of himself. “But I'm a Metamorphmagus, just like her,” he said quietly. “I never knew her and if I become an Auror, then maybe ...”

Harry's hand squeezed his shoulder tightly. “I know. You have no obligation, yeah? I did, so I fulfilled it until I couldn't anymore. I don't want you to have to do that.” Teddy was silent and he heard Harry sigh. “Just promise me you'll finish the applications and write your essays, all right? Before break.”

“Yeah, fine. I will.” They got out of the car and Harry Apparated them home. Ginny was giving James his dinner and the baby screeched happily at their sudden arrival. Teddy watched as Harry kissed his wife hello and picked up his son, bouncing the crowing baby in his arms as he listened to Ginny tell him all about the amazing things James had done that day. He felt an old, familiar longing wash over him and he heaved a sigh as he went into his bedroom and shut the door.
