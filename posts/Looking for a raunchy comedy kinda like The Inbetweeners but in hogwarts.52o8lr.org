Doesn't matter the era. Marauders Harry and the gang, next gen, OC, or even Fred and george. I just want a funny story about stupid teenage boys trying to get laid but failing miserably (most of the time). I was watching The Inbetweeners on Netflix and decided I really want to read a story like this. Preferably novel length. Thanks!


** Gah I would love this too! Closest are probably some marauder fics, but I haven't read any that are raunchy like The Inbetweeners.

I hope someone has some good ones!

** I'd be down for that, it would be a nice change from the angst filled stuff I usually read... Maybe I could laugh instead of accidently crying when reading in public... The struggle !
