Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, would rather it be completed, but it's fine if it's not.

*NO Weasley bashing* please, am fine with Dumbledore bashing if need be, but NO Weasley bashing.

Can be as Canon or as AU as possible.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes and the like.

Would also rather NOT have Seer Luna please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors]] - there's some stuff I don't quite like that I can't put into words, but it is a very well-written and thought-out story. I recommend it.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Tales from the Special Branch is an amazing multi-part Drarry that totally fits your request. Harry commands a special Auror team (including several former Slytherins) to search out dark wizards. It's exciting, well-paced, and has a ton of plot twists. Two caveats: first it's already over one million words and isn't complete, and updates are slow (I think the author has been ill). And second, it's incredibly smutty, so if that's a concern it's probably not your thing - or you can just skip through those scenes and the plot is still great. (The first story is just a smutty one shot so you could even skip that and jump to installment #2.) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/661862]]

*** I was about to recommend this, too.

These are stories about the "Muggle Interface Team," a subgroup of the Aurors that was established by Harry Potter when he was already the head of the Aurors.

In the author's own words: "A series of stories about the Aurors (and police officer) who make up the Auror Office's Muggle Interface Team. The core stories feature Aurors Bones and Brown, and Detective Inspector Beadle. Other characters will also appear."

They are part of Northumbrian's larger post-Battle of Hogwarts universe, which still respects canon, canon being the 7 Harry Potter books, but ignores anything else after that, because keeping up with everything JKR says and does after the books' end is too much.

So yes, as warning, Harry & Ginny, and Ron & Hermione end up together, but the author, I think, has shown how the pairs can actually work. He has also shown the career progression of Harry within the Auror ranks and DMLE quite well. A lot of the other characters get fleshed out, too, like Neville Longbottom, Susan Bones and Lavender Brown. The series also introduces a lot of original characters who I found fun to read.

**** linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian) linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian)

These are also by Northumbrian but occur far earlier than the events of MIT series. They show the time that Harry and Ron were still trainees, and when they were new Aurors.

To be honest, I can't recall the events of these stories as well as the others though I am sure that I've read them. That's because of my weird bias for Northumbrian's stories that were further away from the Battle of Hogwarts (BOH). I think I just skimmed the ones that were immediately post-BOH. This may be because the first Northumbrian story I read was linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh), which has Auror action mixed with slice of life.

It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.
