Five years after the final battle Harry changed, After the first of his son ,James. Instead of the loving man they all knew, Brilliant friend and caring brother, He became cold and distant obsessed with power And paranoid about security. By the time he was 27 he was the head of the Auror department, Which he had turned into his personal army, Hermione Ran for election that same year and got a Bitter dose of reality When she won, her rose color glasses were Swiftly ripped from her, And she saw Harry for what he had become. A New Voldemort in the making.

She had had to stripe Him of his power quickly, It had nearly killed her to do it. But Harry had to be stopped, he had held a wand to her throat when she fired him, Halfway through The Avada before Rongot the drop on him, He was Forcibly removed from ministry and disappeared for a while Until he resurfaced in north Africa with an army. Intent on invasion, Harry had to be stopped , and he was. The man sitting in chains before was who the Norwegians said he was. He best friend , her brother, the monster that the world Expected her to guard them from.
