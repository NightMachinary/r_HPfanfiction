Yea, if you read the above and clicked, I'm actually kinda surprised: the title is a bit of a doozy.

So, what I remember is pretty much what's above: Harry had a sister who I'm /pretty sure/ was Girl-Who-Lived, and after shenanigans on the Express, she thought there was something between her brother and either female!Draco or Draco's sis (can't remember which, just that they were a female Malfoy).

I don't remember the quality, I don't remember the length, I just have that bit stuck in my head and want to try and (re)read it to I can be at peace.


** After some googlefu it might be [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1382][Twins]] . I haven't read it, but the tags seem to match.
