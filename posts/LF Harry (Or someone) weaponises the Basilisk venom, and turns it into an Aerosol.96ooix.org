It'd make an interesting way to wipe out a room full of death eaters. A canister thrown into the room, and within a minute or two, they're all dead, save for possibly Voldemort who would be immune, or have a protection against it.


** It seems partially interesting and partially strange as Basilisk venom, as his name indicate, is a venom and not a poison (topic also brought up in another thread this week) so it shouldn't be eaten or breathed to be dangerous but injected in the blood.

But we could consider it as more than just a venom because of his seemingly corrosive nature and magical properties

*** If it can be absorbed by a Sword stabbing through a Basilisk's skull, it could be harvested as a liquid, and then turned gaseous.

**** He's saying that technically, as a venom simply inhaling or ingesting the venom isn't necessarily lethal because venom has to get into the bloodstream to cause an effect whereas poisons are effective when ingested.

So simply aerosolizing a venom won't be lethal unless you can guarantee your targets will all have open wounds on their skin or along their respiratory tract.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) has this I believe, though it's not a huge part of the plot

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Given the rarity and difficulty of aquiring basilisk venom, why not transfigure a cup of hot water into a cup of hot sarin? As it evaporates, it would gas the room with nobody noticing, since it's a colorless, odorless liquid and gas?

**** How much venom can you harvest? How well can you store/transport it? How well can you aerosolize it? How big of a room can it fill before losing effectiveness? How well does non-injected venom kill (some snake venom you can safely drink as long as you have no open wounds)? Can the victims see the aerosol? Can they smell it? If they can, can they cast bubble head charms fast enough or appropriate away?

Given the finite, likely un-duplicateable quantity of venom you have, all those questions become critically important in determining the success of such an attack. Meanwhile, conjured sarin is functionally unlimited in quantity, meaning you can go all out with the delivery method and, done right, the only warning signs come far too late to avoid a lethal dose.

And if you're transfiguring dangerous chemicals, why not Carbon Monoxide (delerium), Chlorine (burning), hydrogen cyanide (for that Nazi vibe), Chlorine triflouride (chemical feindfyre), or thioacetone (the most disgusting smell in the world, bar none)? I'm sure wizards could conjure them up far too easily and use them better than we could.

***** Wizards would have to understand them, to at least know what they're transfiguring. It'd be more likely to grow what they've already got. Soem kind of Muggleborn/Muggleraised Mad Scientist wizard going a little nuts? I'd go for that.

****** Then, if not muggle chemistry - which potioneers and alchemists might know anyway - I'd imagine it would be some sort of more common ingredient or potion. If it's the latter, well, I'd say you could get /really/ creative with that.
