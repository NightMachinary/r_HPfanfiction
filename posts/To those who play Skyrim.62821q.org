Would you rather see a Harry/other character is sent to Nirn and chills with the dragon born or a character (probably Draco cause, c'mon. It fits) being dragonborn and the dragons of earth reawakening the ability to shout and be rampaging jerks? I can't decide which one I want to go with and figure I'll let potential future readers decide.

**** The lore of the Elder Scrolls universe is so straight up bizarre, labyrinthine and different that to just make it a situation of "that's how things used to be until whatever happened and now we are reawakening this stuff with dragons and what not" is a huge missed opportunity and a boring cop-out.

** I vastly prefer the one set on Nirn. I really can't picture any canon character as the Dragonborn. Besides, canon dragons already exist as mindless beasts, though you could portray then as completely different species.

It has the potential to be very interesting, but I would urge the greatest caution. By Tamrielic standards, Harry is kinda squishy. In a world of divine and semidivine immortals and constant violence, he might be something of a glass cannon.

That does, of course, assume his magic still works in Tamriel. I highly recommend you work out how the magic systems interact before writing too much of the story.

**** The thing is that unless you somehow change it so that all the dragons in the HP-verse are somehow TES dragons (hard to do if you don't want to half-arse it), there isn't really any point in bringing the dragonborn to the HP verse. Bringing the Dragonborn, as in the character from a particular playthrough with a particular personality, sure, that could work, especially if done as a crack fic (as a certain story called “No Need for Halkeginian Logic” shows fairly well), but just a class, not really.

And really, TES has many things that are disruptive enough to other verses and interesting enough to explore if you get into them in-depth (the very system of magic for one thing), that I think there isn't really any need to make any character from another verse take any of the player character roles from the TES games.

****** It's not as much about “interfering” as it is about the fact that TES magic has quite wide boundaries and if you actually introduce it properly instead of making it just point-and-shoot (lore-wise, it is much more than that, oh so much more) it can be a very disruptive element simply because of the possibilities it brings. This is especially the case when you bring it into a universe where many things are only superficially established, such as the Harry Potter universe in which most things aren't explored in any way that could ever be called in-depth by anyone.

TES lore has a lot of crazy stuff going for it. Some of it has magic, and it is no less crazy than the rest. And even without the craziness, you have things like the soul gems, or the entirety of the school of summoning.

******** It is quite likely that you have either not researched the TES magic deeply enough, then, or that you have taken HP magic as present in fanon.

The wand magic found in Harry Potter, the actual one shown in the books without any fanon additions, is a fairly imprecise magic system, often relying on power or range over precision. Comparing it to a power source, HP magic would be like getting power from explosives---anything that needs a constant, low-level amount of power, is basically a no-go for at least most wizards and witches if not for everyone as far as the wanded magic goes. People do tend to forget about it because it is simply easier to make the magic system as precise as it suits them, but many things are actually impossible to achieve with just a spell simply due to the precision it would require. The TES system, on the other hand, has no such a problem as in terms of power its comparison would be an adjustable power generator, and that one actually has a knob that goes to quite a high denominator. Sure, none of its effects are anywhere near as ... final, let's say, as the HP magic, but even the basic ability to use the TES magic can, if given to someone who has access to a magic system like the HP one, be a literal game-changer.

The HP magic can be disruptive it put to good use, sure, I'll give you that; as such, Harry could do some extraordinary things in the land of TES. The same goes for the reverse, though.

********** Hmm ... let me put it this way, then: after the second task, how were the people who went into the lake warmed? By /a blast of hot air/, from a wizard who would have known and used a warming charm if they existed. And that is a fairly good spell to represent HP magic: you can adjust how hot (power) or how big (range) the blast is, but you cannot make it into a low-power stream of hot air, it requires too much precision; you could, of course, make it into a series of low-power blasts, but for one that requires multiple castings and for two it still is not actually a constant effect.

Another example, during their first year, Hermione warmed the trio during their winter walks by /summoning a bluebell flame/ and /carrying it around in a jar/. Again, you have a spell with a possible to set power (the heat of the flame) and range (the duration of the flame, unless it is somehow dispelled), but despite its effect it cannot be called a constant one because it /summons/ the flame and the flame's warmth is only a consequence of the flame's presence. You could make an argument that by that point Hermione wouldn't know any other spell for warming people, but there is a counter-argument that we have never ever actually seen anyone use that spell that she used so we could presume it to be fairly darn obscure and as such her to be capable of finding a more convenient spell if one actually was there to be found.

Another one, the ever-so-famous levitating charm. The power you would presume to be automatic and it isn't certain if there actually is a “range” to it, but it /has manual control/ and with that there is no talk about precision whatsoever because if there were then you could just flick to the destination and whatever it is you are levitating would get there by itself.

Certainly, the summoning charm does that bit, once you cast it on something it does get to you by itself, but there is nearly no control over the quality of the journey, so to say, to the point where it is advised not to try to summon anything living via use of this charm---which, by the way, cannot be done directly but only via summoning something that will take them with itself, such as their clothes; one would presume that the reason this is so is because the HP magic has something of a mind and living creatures of any kind have at least a tiny bit of magic in them. but that is just a guess---due to the quite substantial possibility of it resulting in injury.

Yet another one, the disarming charm. We do know its power can be set for it is highlighted that the one Harry hit Snape in the shrieking shack with was stronger than usual, but you can't really control the effect and send the person you are hitting or the wand somewhere else, it's always just “item goes to you, person goes backwards”.

And they aren't the only spells that do that. The only spells that have anything even resembling a /constant/ effects are those that summon things the desired effect is a consequence of summoning rather than an actual effect. That in itself does not mean every single spell you will ever see will be one with no precision whatsoever, nor does it mean that every single TES scroll will be the epitome of precision, no, but it does mean that precision is not HP magic's forte. Some of its spells can be used for things that you would think require precision but they really don't if you have a spell just for that (which HP magic often enough has, for versatility quite /is/ its strength), that too is true, but if you take a person with HP magic and give them additional access to another magic system, one with actual precision and with things to it besides precision, well ... it is going to end up disrupting the status quo quite a bit unless you make power of any kind completely irrelevant in your story.

** I hate Draco. If anything he may be a Were-Weasel, but I rather just have him being hunted by Hircine. If you write a story with Draco as a lead I won't read it. So yea... that limits my choice here.

Take Harry and let him just roflstomp into the College of Winterhold to start off the adventure. I'd also enjoy Tonks and Remus dropping in there after their death. I don't know.

Just don't take Draco, I guess. Or Snape for that matter.

***** Do you mind if I ask what you think a grown up Draco would be like? Would he recognise that he was a prat and change or not? After his history and that of his father I could easily imagine Draco basically retreating from the public left to rue his life choices, then again he might be so fast in his beliefs that he continues to campaign against muggleborns etc.

****** I don't think people like Draco change on a fundamental level easily. He has been indoctrinated to think like this from the very beginning of his life. The moment he understood words he heard that there are people who are beneath him - by law of nature and magic. He kept hearing this all his life. All bad came from muggleborn, blood traitors and muggles themselves in his world.

The question is, will he recognize that the ideology itself is the problem and not just Voldemort "misusing the facts".

If I use Neo-Nazis as a comparison group to Pureblood Supremacists, then its more likely that Draco will find himself an explanation that condemns the things that caused him and his family pain - Voldemort - but simultaneously agree with his worldview.

On the other side, there are Neo-Nazis who did 180° turns and so there could very well be Death Eaters who change their views in a radical way. I can see Draco having the necessary mental capabilities to step back and take a good look at himself.

Its really open. Rowling obviously let Draco be redeemed. Personal experience tells me that Draco won't change, but only mellow out in his views. He would still see the main obligation to "fit in" and "knowing their place" lying with the new muggleborns. He would not want their death, but equal treatment wouldn't even compute in his brains as his concept of wizards and witches never even included them.

In the end its all just depending on how you explain it.

****** Everything before and beyond canon is at the authors discretion, of course. It still remains true that with changes to the canon character, you may find that you eventually just end up writing an OC, /especially/ if you don't show the character becoming what he is in the story. I don't know your story, so this is all hypothetical.

But if you want to write a crossover, you should use a recognizable character from canon that doesn't have to be morphed into something not utterly repugnant. Draco would need way too much time to change, and your crossover wouldn't start for way too long because of it, which is why I'd recommend a character from the hero's side of canon.
