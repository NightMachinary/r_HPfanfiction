Sooo, I am quite new to HP fanfic world and there is one couple that has gotten my full attention recently: Harry and Daphne.

I am not sure how well received this pair is but the fact that it brings a girl from Slytherin is enough for me.

Thing is, all fanfics I have read involve her and Harry through a contract marriage and miraculously their relationship just works.

I am looking for a fic with this pair where they don't get together with a contract (if they do, then there must be some buildup, no “I love you, and you just came into my life two months ago” tropes).

Romance (or at bit of it) is a must and smut is a huge plus. It must be completed or near completion (though if there is a new o dropped hidden gem I will gladly give them a read)

Ravenclaw Harry is a plus too, tho if he ends up with the lions then he must be more talented than the books portrayed him (seriously, Harry is supposedly son of two talented wizards) Not necessarily looking for a powerful demigod Harry but if the requirements above mentioned are met then it is fine, grey Harry is fine.

Thanks, I read the rules on mobile and I didn't see an specific flair I must use. If I need one I will add it

*** About the Legacy, the author looks like he/she is a bit masochistic. Harry/Daphne go through some kind of untreatable damage due torture? Is there ntr or rape? If you want, send me a PM.

******* I have to thank you. The legacy was amazing. A shame the story is dropped and the author acts like a jerk. But he is right, he/she owes us nothing. I wish the best for the author.

Harry and Daphne were injured, but nothing lasting and irreparable. I hope that when the story is finished, perhaps by 2020 (being really optimist here), it keeps that way. A happy ending is needed there. They do have a beautiful romance and the author wrote chapter 80 beautifully.

I don't really want to start the mind arts, I want it to be more complete, 23 chapters is too little for my liking. But seeing how good the legacy as your recommendation was I might give in.

********* Do you have any recommendations for a smart talented Harry? I don't mean an overpowered one, I mean one that is confident and is talented with magic. After reading a couple of fanfics I really came to hate what Rowling did with Harry in canon. Ron was a huge bad influence on him, taking divination as elective and not taking his studies seriously when he knew a Dark Lord was after him.
