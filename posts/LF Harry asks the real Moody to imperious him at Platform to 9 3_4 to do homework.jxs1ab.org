:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Older fic from ffn (maybe cross posted on ao3 but idk). Post GoF. Harry is being escorted to the Dursley's after leaving the train, but Harry asks Moody to imperious him to do him homework early, try hard, and maybe get fit? Since Harry asked it to be placed on him, he didn't try to fight it off and welcomed the initiative to do things.

My brain is telling me it was most likely OP Harry. Other than this I can't remember specifically this was!
