  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** Honestly, it's a nice suggestion, but is unremarkable, due to its canon-rehash qualities. I'd stay away from it.

** Dudley is a wizard in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8864658/14/By-Baker-Street-Station-I-Sat-Down-and-Wept][/By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept/]], and Petunia is also a witch. I find it a pretty fun read athough it does get a tiny bit crazy as it goes on. Updates sporadically.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
