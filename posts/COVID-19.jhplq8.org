The main part of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child plays in 2020. However, the writers did not know at the time how different our world would be in 2020. How would the Cursed Child change if COVID was included?


** It probably wouldn't since, iirc, wizards and witches aren't affected by the same kinds of diseases and sicknesses as muggles. The Wizarding World would probably just chock it up to an odd muggle fashion trend.

Hopefully my fanon isn't interfering with my canon

*** Ronald weasley stepped into the potter house after a day in muggle london

"Bonkers harry I tell you, muggle fashion is annoying to keep up'' "whats going on Ron'' ''I was going into muggle London to get some chocolates, you know for hermione, she has this brand of muggle ones she loves, and everyone was wearing a bloody mask on their face. I thought it was that muggle costume holiday at first and then everyone started jeering at me and asking where mine was Madness harry, The muggles are completely mad and muggle fashion trends are completely Ridiculous. First it was everyone walking around in ripped clothing and now everyone is wearing a mask.'' Ron replied red in the face.

''I will have to inform my Field Aurors they will start needing to wear masks to blend in'' harry replied deeply sighing ''I barely just recovered from the skinny Jean fiasco. Half my Aurors threatened to walk out when we updated the muggle world clothing requirements I manage to talk them back and now bloody masks. I should have retired when you did ron'' Ron smirked, and Pulled something from his pocket 'this might cheer you up' Harry looked down 'fuck off ron, I aint fooling for it this time. you offer me a candy to cheer me up and then next minute I am a bloody bird'

** I don't really recall any part of Cursed Child happening in the Muggle world. So I don't think it would be different at all.

** Well, they never really went into the muggle world, so it's unlikely they catch it. But even if they came into contact with another witch or wizard who DID and contracted it from them and they suffered symptoms... they'd take Pepper-Up potion and be fine.
