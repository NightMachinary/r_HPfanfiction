Feeling the "badass" itch again. If y'all could recommend some fics where Harry or his friends are well-known to be dangerous. The sort of people who can defuse situations by arriving, since the aggressors don't feel like dying today. Bonus points for a badass golden trio, or D.A., additional bonus points for a snarky POV. I'd appreciate leaving bashing out of it, since bashing in general, outside of bashing Dolores umbridge, rubs me the wrong way. Many thanks in advance.


** You know, I feel like this is surprisingly rare. Seems to me that even fics that have a powerful/badass Harry often do not have him being widely known for it - it's more like he just developed his skill and so it's something new that his enemies are still learning. Training montage power up, time travel, dimension travel, that sort of thing.

Even so, I really ought to be able to think of some better examples than these, but here they are:

Linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has a bit of this. A little ways into the story it becomes publicly known that Harry, with Sirius providing support, defeated Voldemort in a duel. There's a scene later where Harry is faced with something like two dozen Death Eaters who are clearly intimidated. He fights his way through them and ends up routing them.

Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) - Only one small part of the fic is really relevant to the request. The last fifth or so of chapter 6. Harry and Daphne are ambushed by 8 or so mercenaries and after a brief conversation it's the mercenaries who are the more nervous ones.

Linkffn(12381694) - This is a series of unrelated one-shots set in the same universe as the previous fic. In the first one, Harry and Daphne corner a couple that has something they need. Harry's reputation as being both honorable and badass is a large part of convincing them to surrender, despite the fact that one of the couple is an international dueling champion.

*** Thanks. Black comedy is on my "frequent read" list, mostly because nonjon is a truly funny author. I've heard some rough stuff about the tone in contractual invalidation, but that source was fairly biased so maybe I'll give it another look.

**** I read Contractual Invalidation recently and enjoyed it. but there are two things I'd preface a recommendation with. One, the Daphne in it is /nothing/ like the common fanon interpretation. She's very much a pureblood elite in it. And two, Harry comes off as /incredibly manipulative/. Uncomfortably so at times. But the payoff was amazing in my opinion. So it's a fic I do recommend as well.

***** Harry's manipulativeness was actually one of my favorite things about this fic. It's pretty rare to see fics with a manipulative Harry that isn't dark. Granted, parts of the Ministry event were kind of jarring but at the same time extremely satisfying and had a great payoff like you said.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Starfox5 typically has badass trio with competent not bashed other characters. For example Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has badass Hermione as main character with her own badass muggleborn group similar to the DA being extremely dangerous and feared, Harry and Ron are badass fighters trained by Moody and Dumbledore, and the Umbridge bashing is taken a bit too literally.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** A big part of canon Umbridge "charm" comes from the fact that she is the perfect blend between "evil" and "believable". She is the abusive teacher, the superior who takes pleasure into tormenting you.

By trying to make Umbridge "worse" (let's say by making her a pedophil as an example), fanfics authors take the risk of losing this believable part. And without it, Umbridge is just another caricatural vilain, and a pretty average one at that, that would fall short compared to a big one like Voldemort.
