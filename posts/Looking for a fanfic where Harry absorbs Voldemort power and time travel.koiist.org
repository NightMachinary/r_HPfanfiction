Hello everyone

I started reading a fic years ago but didn't finish it and can't find it anymore. It has Harry killing Voldemort like in canon but absorbing his power, he ends up too powerful and start learning elemental magic, then I don't remember how, he travels back in time with Hermione, Ron and Ginny I believe.
