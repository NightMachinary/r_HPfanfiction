*** That's only because people don't seem to realise that making Harry into an arsehole would change how people in the past reacted to him, and thus his current situation. They just want the vindication of telling off authority figures, and little children.

**** TBF, everyone expected Harry to be this do-good-or-die-trying hero from the very beginning due to being the Boy-Who-Lived, and since no one has seen or heard from him for 10 years since he "defeated" Voldemort, the public has created that perception on their own and warped things to fit their expectations. Harry following that expectation is largely in part of this initial "starting state" -- the events leading up to Hogwarts in first year caused Harry to automatically hate Slytherin, because everyone around him automatically acted like he should be hating Slytherin on principle.

But I agree with your assessment when it comes to Fanfics: most Dark/OP!Harry fics have everyone around him acting similarly to canon even when Harry himself is different.

** I remember reading a fic where canon HP is thrown into the body of pussy!HP. Pussy!HP was essentially a coward, and was raised by Pettigrew's mother, after Sirius, James and Lily somehow wind up in Azkaban. I think the dimensional body hopping happens in fourth year or fifth year. Can't be sure.

Anyone know that story?

** I'd like to see the opposite, actually, since there's a lot of Dark!Harry and OP!Harry fics where everyone expects the consummate Gryffindor to be self-sacrificing and righteous by all expectations. It would be neat to see see an OP!Harry killed by his own foolishness and a Good!/Kind!Harry take over and everyone's like "Uhhh... Harry, are you okay?"

*** It can be a little jarring when you are subverting the usual OP Harry tropes and yet the reviews and PMs ask for more of the same shit. Some people are actually very passionate in their demands and I had more than one reviewer telling me how my AUs were supposed to work.

Not even that, they want more of the same. That's why I am actually surprised by the reviews on my latest story since no one has yet complained about the lack of the usual stuff like declarations of undying love or bashing.

First off, I wouldn't call this Harry necessarily evil. Harry and Ron get sent back in time to 4th year after living as alcoholics and Harry was working as an executioner. They retain all their memories and magical skills. They use their knowledge and lack of caring about morality to try and end the war and also just mess around.

It's more of a joke fic than anything, but there is definitely chaos and death.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
