Like in a "okay, what can we use this for?" way.

Where a quite simple piece of magic is used in an unusual way to do something awesome.

For example using an expanded bag to manipulate spacetime in just the right way to manipulate gravity, creating a strong pushing force and using it to increase acceleration of a broom.


** There's "How Can We Weaponize This" but I really didn't like how it was written and how unrelatable the main character was.

"The Arithmancer" and its sequels have some very nice elements of this. In that fic, Arithmancy is the basis of Spellcrafting, and it basically follows a mathwiz!Hermione who uses all sorts of more "out there" mathematical concepts to make interesting spells.

** The one that comes immediately to mind is linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day by MisterQ). I think I've read a couple of others, but I'm away from home without access to my database of stories I've read.
