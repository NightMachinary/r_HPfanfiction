Edit: Let's all just pretend Lockhart doesn't lose his memories at the end of CoS because i totally forgot about it


** While that might be amusing, given Lockhart's state of being post /Chamber of Secrets/, this just strikes me as being cruel to someone who has already lose everything about themselves.

**** Yeah but you said it's time travel too, so if he went back to pre-CoS, he likely played that whole year differently anyway (No way he'd let Ginny go through it again... not to mention the only reason he /didn't/ get obliviated (and no one died) the first go round is, as our esteemed Transfiguration Professor would put it, "sheer dumb luck")

Personally, I'd get Tom's signature from the diary as well. No idea what the contract would do to him, but it would at /least/ piss him off.

** I can think of another few people that could do with being in a magically enforced battle to the death.

Or just the canon GoF, that's fine too, I guess.
