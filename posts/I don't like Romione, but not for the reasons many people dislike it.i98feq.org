I like Ron as character, but I'm not sure if Hermione is the right person for him and here's why.

Ron was a bit of an underachiever who wanted to be recognized for his skills instead of being overshadowed. With him being with Hermione, it's pretty much guaranteed that he will be overshadowed all his life and this doesn't seem to be something he wanted. Hermione seems like the dominant kind of woman who needed someone supportive. I don't think Ron is the one suited for this role.

I think Rowling mentioned somewhere than Ron and Hermione might need couples counceling. Perhaps this is the reason?


** I absolutely agree! I really think if he was with Lavender or someone who admired and respected him, he'd be happy. I feel like Hermione doesn't respect him much, and would have been better with someone else (but not Harry - I think Ginny is more suited to Harry than Hermione is). But I feel Hermione enjoys Ron's sweetness and for Ron, well I don't really understand why he's into her; she's pretty yes, but so are others. And I do think he'll always be overshadowed by her academic intellect and ambition.

*** Exactly! Lavender was literally his perfect girl. She was doting, passionate, supportive. I feel like he was the type to want the housewife kinda partner and that Hermione would be the one to have the amitious passionate-in pursuing knowlege kind of guy. I feel like she'd want to see and change the world while he just wanted to do quidditch and raise a happy family.

**** Glad to see my comment resonated! Yeah I think Hermione is the type who wants someone who can match her more; I don't think she wants someone to simplify her life or hold back her ambition, even if she might need it. And as for Ron, I think he needs to feel strong and capable in order to gain self-love and confidence. Hermione doesn't compliment him enough and is so intellectual, whereas Ron is more about the heart. I think that -could- be a good, balanced relationship, but I just don't see Hermione respect Ron enough to feel that she deserves him. Ron may be horribly unreasonable, obnoxious, stupid sometimes, but at his core he is a tender heart that wants to dote and be doted upon, in my opinion. So even though Lavender seems ditzy, I think she suits Ron more. She is more than willing to dote on him.

***** Totally agree! i always felt like hermione was the kind to need someone who could challenge her intellectually and ron was finding his identity, away from his family and harry's shadow. and after we saw the jealousy he acted on for Hermione, i think Lavender would appreciate him caring that much while hermione would feel constricted. i think its less on -could- they have a relationship (yes imo if they both worked at it), but -should- they, when they could match someone else so much better

If we interpret that Lavender survived the battle with some werewolf scars then she could fit really well with Ron. Give them a post-Hogwarts adventure where she learns her new skills and he gets to lead the agenda away from Harry/Hermione.

*** Yup. Lav Lav was a bit cringy with the baby-talk pet names and the sucking his face instead of getting to know him better, but they were teens. They're /supposed/ to be cringy, and at least it was sweet. Hermione might have been capable of sweetness, but she'd been bossy with him so long that's a hard habit to break.

And really, their school days is where Hermione and Ron would make the /most/ sense to me. I myself was a bossy national merit scholar who dated a dropout. Those idealistic teen years are the perfect time to develop a sweetness that looks beyond the superficial to find the best in a person. Even if what's best turns out to be the hot sex ;)

But the reality of that kind of relationship is really hard. Major mismatches of intellect, work ethic, and long-term goals, altogether as a package, is nearly insurmountable. I just don't see Hermione and Ron making it work.

And it's not that Hermione didn't respect him, they were just oo differed and had no interest they shared. They were arguing all the time, and Ron was basically looking down on Hermione because she spends so much time with her eyes glued to books. She did the same and looked down on Ron when he slacked off again to play chest or marvel about the wonders of Quidditch.

Its kinda funny through. How the only whose reputation was ruined by that past story was James. While Sirius is still loved by everyone, even when he was always egging James or directly doing bad stuff to Snape himself (Probably because we at least got to know his adult charismatic crazy self, while James was just dead from the start).

And the same with Lupin, who even without participating never did anything to stop them and even laughed about it from a distance.

Meanwhile, fanfic writers have all the characters, all the plot points, and all of the world building already set up as a foundation for them to work with.

********** An inherent aspect of fiction is its complete lack of originality. Stories are just continuations of age-old literary traditions that were defined thousands of years ago, they're all built on moral platitudes and preexisting narrative structures that have become synonymous with writing itself. I don't fucking care if you borrow elements from the works of other writers so long as you transform their ideas into something unique that lends credibility to your own creative nous. GRRM nicked entire character arcs from other authors without really doing anything unique with them; they were just absorbed into his amorpheous blob of a story which is void of both potency and intellectual profundity.

Compare Paul Atreides to Jon Snow for example:

#+begin_quote
  The Fremen are a group of people in the fictional Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. First appearing in the 1965 novel Dune, the Fremen inhabit the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), which is the sole known source in the universe of the all-important spice melange. Long overlooked by the rest of the Imperium and considered backward savages, in reality they are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers. The Fremen had come to the planet thousands of years before the events of the novel as the Zensunni Wanderers, a religious sect in retreat. As humans in extremis, over time they adapted their culture and way of life to survive and thrive in the incredibly harsh conditions of Arrakis. The Fremen are distinguished by their fierce fighting abilities. Paul and the Atreides come to the desert planet Arrakis, but Paul's father Duke Leto is soon killed by the Harkonnens and Paul and his mother Lady Jessica are forced to flee into the desert. They are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet's native Fremen, and Chani is the Fremen woman put in charge of protecting and guiding Paul. They soon become lovers, and Paul rises as a religious leader among the Fremen, and is called Muad'Dib.

  I read this book series entitled Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, and Game of Thrones is a complete rip-off of it. So many similarities it is almost like a incest loving fan fic. There's a Storm King (Night King) who brings the winter and wants to wipe out mankind. He used to be a person. He has the semi-immortal white haired Norns working for him (White Walkers) and he raises the army of the dead to fight for him. He also has giants. There's a one handed prince, horse lords, a red comet in the sky, a princess who escapes north dressed as a boy and disguises herself later as “Marya”, there are dragons, white haired “Targaryen” fairy like folk called the Sithi, there are three special swords that the main character, supposedly a peasant boy named Simon (You see where this is going Jon Snow) weilds one of. The other is made from a fallen star (Dawn).

Wow, a special sword. How very unique to this particular series, and to no other series or historical myth in all of history. /s

Seriously, though. Excaibur. The Sword in the Stone. Every Hero on their hero's journey has one, especially if they're from a royal/ magical bloodline. It's not at all unique. Aragorn had one too.

#+begin_quote
  The other is made from a fallen star (Dawn).
#+end_quote

Again, Space Swords. Not exactly unique. It's a concept that captures the imagination. In fact, there are four known blades in real life that are actually made of meteorite.

Look, sorry for the mounds of sarcasm, but seriously, the fantasy genre gets inspiration from a few main sources: Lord of the Rings (And through it, Christianity), world mythology, and world history.

Everything's been done before. Half the things from Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn that you listed, was probably inspired by LOTR.

** I agree with you, although my main complaint about Romione is that their hardcore shippers treated Hermione as a prize for Ron so much of the time (Ron did x and y, so he /deserves/ the best girl in the series. Ron liked her first, so she should be his OTP). They didn't even seem to /like/ Hermione as a character. In a lot of R/Hr fanfics from the early 2000s, she was a caricature of herself, extra bossy and judgmental.

Times may have changed, I don't know. I have wartime flashbacks to the great shipping wars of 200whatever, so I'm not all that active in the HP fandom anymore. But even as a 15-year-old, when I read GoF and realized that Ron had a crush, I never once thought it would be a lasting relationship. Ron cheating on his driving test by bewitching a defenseless Muggle was not a shining testament to his maturity, either.

** Teenage Ron and Hermione don't suit, you're right. I could see their characters evolving to become more compatible though. I think as an adult Ron loses his inadequacy complex and Hermione relaxes a bit. Ron makes her happy and soothes her worries- she's never not going to have too much on her plate so he's really good at bringing her back from a stress spiral. Ron can in turn talk about his achievements with her and relax, make her laugh which makes him feel good, etc. Once they're not teenagers going through a war and become more well-rounded adults, I could see them being capable of a strong healthy relationship.

** Agreed. Ron and Hermione don't even have anything common other than Harry and Hogwarts. Ron is very laid-back, preferring play over work, and has deep insecurities and doubts about himself. Insecurities that'll only become more self-destructing if he remains under the shadow of someone who's indefinitely better at everything than him. Hermione on the other hand, is very focused and determined and doesn't like to waste time. She'll find it nothing more than a waste of time if she stays with Ron, it'll feel like she's getting dragged back by his slowness.

Ron would be much better off with someone who, first and foremost, likes him for who he is, rather than who he should be. Hermione doesn't have that for Ron - he barely scratched E.E. in his OWLs with her help, and didn't bother to finish his NEWTs - she doesn't shy away from making her stance clear on what she thinks of his laziness. I genuinely think that Lavendar would've been a great pair for him. She loved and respected him, and was more drawn towards Ron's personality rather than Ron's abilities.

He needed someone who would appreciate and admire him, while Hermione often scolded him over every little thing and treated him with condescension. And she underestimated him, like /a lot/.

She needed someone who would challenge her, someone as driven and passionate about stuff as her. Someone who would support her instead of laughing at her dedication and ambition the way Ron often does in canon.

** Ron was always the ordinary guy surrounded by extraordinary/special people. Or at the very least they always stood out.

-Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived.

-Hermione is 'the cleverest witch of her age'.

-Bill is the 'coolest' family member, and the eldest sibling.

-Charlie was the Quidditch captain who could've gone professional. But instead he became a dragon tamer(I forgot what the job is actually called).

-Percy was the Head Boy and academically the most brilliant. Became 'the prick' of the family for some time.

-Fred and George were the 'Practical Jokers' who were brilliant wizards from whom Flitwick was so impressed he left little of their magic effects as it is in Hogwarts. They started a highly successful business in a time when most of the shops were closing.

-Ginny is the only girl and the youngest sibling. She went on to become a professional Quidditch player.

-Fleur, his sister-in-law, is a quarter veela and a Triwizard Champion.

And Ron is... good at chess.

Ron is too real, too relatable, he hits too close to home. He reminds us of our ordinary selves.

If you want to write a good Ron. Give him something special, even a gimmick, even if it feels superficial. But he needs to have something to make him stand out, something to make him unique.

It's not Ron not being good enough for Hermione in a "he's evil/he's a dick/whatever" way, but rather that I always figured that they both wanted different things, and I can't see a relationship between the 2 work well. Hermione would (just like she always were) be annoyed over some of Ron's day-to-day behaviour, while Ron would be annoyed over a wife that seems to put work over marriage. Not that Hermione would do that per se, but that I could see Ron feel that way, simply due to how she is as a person.

** I would disagree with you. I think that a big part of Ron's character growth arc is to learn to value those close to him over his desire for glory. We see this both times when him and Harry have a row, him always being the first one to want to make peace even if that means staying in Harry's shadow. It is also seen with the Hufflepuff cup because despite being his idea to go into the chamber of secrets and him being the one to figure how to open it without being a parslemouth, he still lets Hermione have a go at destroying the Horcrux. He also doesn't take credit for it, even if it's one of his more significant achievements in the series, when they meet Harry. It's Hermione who tells the story.

I also don't think that Ron and Hermione have a bad dynamic. They bicker a lot but he always defends Hermione, even against Harry, something that Harry never does when Ron is especially mean to her. But I would say that they also act awkward around each other, quite like anyone around their crush when they are uncertain if their crush likes them back. However when they open up about their feelings, they become supportive of one another. I would think Hermione would never allow Ron to feel outshone, as shown by the example above.

Finally I think all the members of the trio achieve their different kind of fame:

- Harry - as the legendary hero who defeated the darkest wizard;
- Hermione - as the rights activist and eventually Minister for Magic (which, while an achievement, is not always a great thing seeing as what people usually think of politicians);
- Ron - (assuming he achieves the same notoriety as Zonko or the Weasley twins) as a beloved famous figure to whom common people can more easily relate.

Which I think is really befitting of the way they were initially written. Despite JK coming back and forth in later years on them, I always felt like they really completed each other with Harry being the moral compass, Hermione the intellect and Ron representing the humanity.

Now I initially thought that this refered to his insecurity - with how he is now in such companies as Flamel and Dumbledore - and how this means he will be remembered.

But you got me thinking - maybe it's not about the fame, at least entirely. Think of Ron's growth throughout the series, how he always stood in the shadow of his friend.

It took a lot of growth, as I see it, for the fact that his reaction to his greatest achievement worth celebrating - helping his friend destroy Voldemort - doesn't make him angry, anymore, that he's a "sideckick" to Harry, but rather proud, proud of the part he had.

He did grow.

They both had insecurities about their value as a partner, but Hermione's issues are mostly resolved in-story whereas Ron's insecurity about always being in the shadow of Harry/his brothers is mostly left unaddressed - the only thing that shows Ron that he is 'good enough' for Hermione is that Hermione picks him and Harry explicitly tells him he isn't interested in Hermione. It wouldn't be good for his self-worth to be so tied to his relationship.

Hermione can often get carried away with her passions in a way that would make Ron feel forgotten, and I think Ron would respond to that feeling really badly, causing Hermione to respond badly in turn.

Hermione would dismiss these problems as Ron being immature and something he'd grow out of, but I think Ron would more clearly see that a lot of his happiness is wrapped up in someone who doesn't naturally do things that make him happy.

** Allow me to put in my oar for Ron and Luna.

Ron needs someone whose loyalty matches his own, someone with Luna's quiet fierceness. She needs someone with a big heart who can draw her out of the world she inhabits by herself, but also join her there. They make each other laugh. Luna is certainly not a Quidditch fanatic, but she is an enthusiastic supporter and her commentary is golden. She genuinely finds Ron's impressions hilarious. They are both kind and generous souls who place a high value on friendship. They both understand being overlooked on the sidelines and would make the other feel as though they were the only one in the room -- Luna with her singular focus, and Ron with open affection (once his self confidence has ascended from rock bottom, of course). They could also learn from each other -- Ron not to care what others think, and Luna to be at ease in a group.

Lastly, I think Luna joining the Weasley Clan would be absolutely adorable! It would certainly be overwhelming at first; Molly fussing over her, getting four older brothers, stumbling across experimental joke merchandise, the chaos that is the Burrow. I can see her getting along with Arthur well -- they're both fascinated by things that others scoff at and Arthur is more of a quiet soul, in contrast with Molly. But I think that, after growing accustomed to the Weasleys, Luna would thrive like Harry did. (Luna and Harry both spent most of their childhoods alone and a little overlooked. While Xeno loves Luna dearly, I imagine he would often get lost in his research, experiments, or grief for Pandora; I think that when she died, a great deal of joy and light left with her, causing Xeno to dull and Luna to spend a lot of time alone.)

I disagree with this statement. The idea that Ron is a underachiever or an everyman has always baffled me. He found him to be neither of those things. As early as the first book, we see a bravery in Ron that is certainly extraordinary. He voluntarily gets hit in the head by a stone sword at the age of 11. There is no reason for the reader or Ron himself to believe that this wouldn't kill him, but he does it anyway. That is not a characteristic of an everyman.

Secondly, I disagree with the idea that Ron wanted to be "recongized for his skills". I thought that up until the locket scene in book 7. It was there that I realized that Ron felt that he had no value. He felt like he never really had a seat at the table. We see that growth in the epilogue. He makes a joke about the people at the train staring at him, when they are really staring at Harry. He's comfortable not being "the guy".

Second - All indications we get via Pottermore or expanded universe plants Ron as an equal to his brother when it comes to the joke shop. Sure there are jokes about his brother thinking little of him in Half Blood Prince - but a war won and some maturing done he proved himself to be as loved and as much of an equal as any of the other brothers.

Lets ignore that the "joke shop" is largely stated to be the most successeful business in magic britain as of the end of the series - almost expanding to Hogsmeade per the time of Half Blood Prince and making enough money for the twins to use real dragon leather skin jackets, but it pisses me off how you not only throw shade at Ron for working for family (despite the fact that he is good at what he does -) but also that you need to throw him under the bus.

I'm not a fan of Ron in particular - he reminds me too much of me - insecure, easy to anger, jealous - I see in him a reflectino of my worst qualities - but this is what I hate about shippers - they can't love a pairing without throwing a character in the shit.

Why can't you write Dramione or Harmony without making Ron to be a monster? It's perfectly feasible - immensely so, that Ron and Hermione tried it, it didn't work out, they remain friends - It's very much less believable that Hermione found Ron was still cheating on her with Lavender Brown and oh by the way - he's suddenly a blood supremacist who thinks someone like "her" should not be better positioned than her (and yes, while I won't name names -. I've had that happen in a fic I read). People grow apart, sometimes things don't work out - but that doesn't mean the ex is a monster the likes never seen since Umbridge. C'mon!

This is an important point though. Ron's youngest-son syndrome isn't helped by being an employee of an older brothers' business as opposed to striking out on his own. Even Ron, fellow auror felt a bit too much like remaining Harry's sidekick.

I'd prefer Quidditch for Ron, that's where he got self confidence on his own towards the end, it's a well established interest regardless of his siblings' sharing it, and the never followed up on chess-as-strategist thing could serve well as a Captain or coach.

- Firstly she seems very controlling and domineering. This can be seen from how much she nags him and harry. No man wants a nagging woman.

Yet when she saw him with lavender, what did she do? She attacked him with sharp pointed beaks of multiple birds. What if one of them poked his eye and turned him blind?

- Thirdly, I dont think she would be very supportive of ron even though he would probably be supportive of her.

Now onto Ron's supposed intelligence. Ron is almost at the level of harry intellectually. Both got the same number of owls. Harry did a bit better in defense though. Harry has the upper hand on both ron and hermione in terms of raw magical power. Now OWLs were standardized tests and ron got those score due to his own ability only and not not hermiones help. So if harry can keep up with hermione intellectually then ron can as well. Now about hermiones help with homework. I dont know why but people seem to forget that almost everytime she helped ron she helped harry too.

Hermione is someone who while brilliant at school would not be as brilliant outside of it. She has the least amount of instincts among the trio, and has shown to freeze up in crunch situations( no matter what the movies made you believe, that didn't happen in the books).

I would have been perfectly happy if JKR had not included this romantic BS altogether in the story and focused more on world building and a more solid plot. There is so much that can be done with this story but I feel a lot of the content in Books 6 and 7 was focused on bloody relationships.

*** That's my main issue with Hermione - her being intelligent is not enough to make her a good romantic partner, other characteristics need to be involved. She is a fan favorite mostly because she is the female protagonist and the only girl that is explored in-depth. Her stealing some of Book!Ron's character development in the movies and being played by an actress that is more conventionally attractive than how she was intended in the books also boosted her popularity.

To me, Romione would be like Molly and Arthur - Hermione is in charge most of the time, but when it comes to things Ron cares about, he'll put his foot down. No matter how nice she seems, not many people can put up with a Molly Weasley in their life.

Do you really expect that Hermione, Ron, and Harry would each never get a real relationship(Cho wasn't really a relationship, and Hermione and Victor don't seem as if they were a couple in that sense long either)?

Also most teenagers dont think about relationships everyday. At least where I grew up. I didn't and I was a mostly normal kid where I grew up. Some of the people did but most of them just concentrated on other stuff.

But as I said earlier, it's highly opinionated and subjective. If you like romance, cool. Awesome. It's your interest and I respect that. But I find it boring and mostly unnecessary to the plot.

Malfoy would have probably died if the creator of that spell hadn't saved him. Harry and malfoy are enemies and it makes sense something like this happened between them. And I think malfoy mostly deserved it.

Now ron and hermione are best friends. They are not in a relationship. So ron is free to go with lavender anytime. What gives hermione the right to attack him? In real world this would be physical assault and is punishable under law in almost every country.

Losing an eye is not recoverable even by magic. For proof, ask MadEye. Btw recall who blinded the basilisk and how? Right. It was a bird and they poked its eyes out with their beaks and talons.

this. since rowling never specified, we will never actually know whether or not bird pecking could render someone blind permenantly, we can only guess based on canon. in hp uni its not whether or not an injury took place, rather whether or not the injury is permenant. so you cant confidently say that Hermione was endangering Ron if we dont even know if bird pecking is dangerous (remember whether or not it causes blindness is irrelevant if the hp uni could fix it like skelegro). And in my opinion, since I chose to regard that spell as something fixable like the bat-boogy hex, due to it being an injury from a non-dark magic spell and not something born with like short-sightedness, it is the EQUIVILENT as a slap/punch since both things are temporary and fixable (imo).

Lets assume what you are saying is true. So it's alright if it's done temporarily? Would you be saying the same thing if ron had done something similar to hermione at the yule ball for example? Just a small injury which a little magic can't fix? Lol.

You are delusional. Just because an injury is fixable doesnt mean it is not painful. Is it alright to poke someone's eye out just because it can be fixed later on? Also I'm pretty sure magic can't fix a popped out eye. There's enough indication for that at least as I stated in earlier comment. If magic could heal a popped out eyeball then why couldnt it heal myopia and related diseases since most wizrds use spectacles? This leads us to assume that eyes are a special case and magic is not very effective there. The one making assumptions is YOU and not me.

Will poolpping out your eyeball cause similar pain as a slap/punch? Is it something you do to your friends in real life? Now let's assume it was a slap/punch. What gave hermione the right to do even that? Will you be okay with that if ron did the same thing at the yule ball?

You are justifying something which is pretty hard to justify. This is one of the lowest points of hermiones plot. I am surprised ron remained her friend after this happened.

Throughout the books he's constantly dismissing Hermione's opinions, beliefs, interests, and work ethic. Hermione, on the other hand, takes a holier-than-thou attitude towards Wix and their culture and looks down her nose at anyone (including Ron) that doesn't Follow The Rules, or who doesn't share her academic mania, or whose interests don't interest her.

*** I'm not going to address the issue of their compatibility, aside from a note of my belief in their compatibility.

But I'd note that by definitions of competency, Ron is competent and skilled with magic. His OWL scores are firmly above average and he qualifies as an auror, a branch noted for the difficulty of entrance. He does this well after spending a year with an unideal wand and a year with a wand that is straight up broken. He does this maintaining a healthy life/study balance. Additionally, like it or not, chess skill is correlated with intelligence.

Compare this to Hermione, whose vaunted intelligence and extreme study habits net her imperfect OWL scores, no academic accolades of any note, and and whose combat performance is incredibly horrid for the supposed magical skill she possesses. Hermione mutes a death eater and immediately disregards him, having studied to a level where silent casting is taught. Ron duels three death eaters and ends up with a less severe injury than Hermione. While clearly not in the right mind, he manages a summoning spell.

I think dedication is part of it, certainly, but I don't think you can look at ten Os and 1 E and say that it was mostly down to dedication rather than intelligence. Especially not when talking about a girl who seems to have a perfect memory, has never had trouble understanding magical theory, got 120% on her first Charms exam and managed to---among other things---successfully brew Polyjuice Potion at the age of 13 and cast a very good Protean Charm that, we are told, is N.E.W.T. level stuff before even taking her O.W.L.s.

I think the difference between Hermione and, say, the Marauders and Dumbledore can be explained as a lack of desire to experiment, not to mention that if Rowling had shown her getting awards and doing research she would have been, compared to everyone else around her, too overpowered.

Hermione is book smart, she's driven, ambitious. She doesn't play around and is brutally honest when it comes to her opinions, and she's also a bit vicious in her actions (doesn't mean she's a bad person, it's just true).

Ron is more street smarts, he isn't an idiot but he's nowhere near Hermione's level. He more of an emotional guy than academic. He's laidback and easy-going.

Hermione needs someone to kind of banter with? Like someone that challenges her opinions, that keeps her on her toes? Somebody that pushes her to keep getting better. That doesn't make it easy for her. Someone that understands her ambition, her thirst for knowledge.

Ron like I said is more into the emotional aspects of things. He needs someone that's supportive, that values him, that doesn't underestimate him (which love her but Hermione does a lot). Someone caring, not too bossy and that believes in him. Someone that trusts him to take the lead.

So to me while Ron and Hermione make great friends, as a couple their dynamic feels kind of unbalanced.

Hermione can just kind of steam roll over Ron which would get annoying eventually. While Ron wouldn't get Hermione's need to be one of the best, or be able to keep her engaged mentally.

This is just my opinion though so... 🤷

** Honestly, I think that Rowling only put them together because Harry was too perfect for Hermione as a boyfriend. At least, most expected Harry and Hermione to end up together since they have good chemistry.

Ginny had too little personality in my opinion. She was basically just a girl that was a little bit obsessed with Harry in the beginning, and they ended up together because she had no competition due to Harry's /adventurous/ lifestyle at his time in Hogwarts. Yes, she was literally the only girl that could end up with Harry. His environment and lifestyle only allowed her or Hermione as a potential partner, everyone else couldn't meet the standards to join the resistance against Voldemort and his lackeys.

And Ginny is more the kind of girl you get together in your puberty just to have a girlfriend. Her only connection with Harry was through her family. She could use her brothers to get close to him. Take that away and he would never really paid much attention to her - maybe just a little since he might be worried of her mental health after the Chamber of Secrets incident.

Hermione, on the other hand, experienced a lot of crazy stuff with Harry. They were like siblings in some way, like family, and some might say that this was the reason they never developed romantic feelings for each other. But my experience is that girls that are such good friends that you see them already like a family (as a sister, but let us not say that because it's weird) are the best you can hope for (if you want something serious, and lasting).

Anyways, I dislike Harrinny because it felt too forced for my taste - as if Rowling planned that before she even finished writing the first book. It was so damn obvious in most scenes that Ginny was only in the room since she needed a stronger presence in Harry's life so that their relationship could be justified.

Harry should have fallen for Hermione during the Yule Ball... but nooooooooooo... >:(

** I absolutely agree with this too!! Hermione would be bored with him. She needs someone to intellectually stimulate her (I'm writing as a Dramione shipper but there is canon proof that Draco is intelligent) and Ron just wouldn't be able to do it because he's never been able to. He's smart in his own way but not the sort of book smart that Hermione needs to push her forward. I feel like he would also expect Hermione to play the stay at home mum role to Rose and Hugo because he was coddled by a stay at home mum as a child of 7 his whole life. Like remember how frustrated he gets with her when she's unable to make “good food” when they're on the run? This is just one example of his domestic dependency on women (which lots of other women, including Lavender as I see in the comments, would be happy to do). Hermione is a career-driven woman.

They would both live to resent the other and probably divorce.

** They actually are the perfect fit. Its like they say, opposites attract, and yes Ron and Hermione were different, but those differences helped those two grow close to each other. And basically Ron would never be under shadowed, considering he helped take down Voldemort.

** For them to be together happily, he would have to deal with his feelings of inadequacy and or accept being overshadowed as a price worth a relationship that fulfills him in some way. idk I'm not for or against romio

** On the other hand, Ron growing out of that sense of worthlessness is part of character development. That's how he and Hermione would work.

** I'm not sure. I dislike Ron/Hr also, but that's mostly because Hermione is my favorite girl in the series, so I want her to have a really great hubby.

Ron and Hermione, though, might actually work /because/ Ron is so mediocre. I mean, we all agree Hr is super ambitious and extremely intelligent. Ron - unmotivated, humorous, average in every way - might be someone that can just exist to emotionally support his wife.

I mean, Harry or someone with more ability and intelligence would also have drive and ambition. Ron is the kind of wizard that ends up stocking shelves at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He'd have nothing going on but keeping Hr happy.

** I feel like Ron wouldn't be able to catch up with Hermione and her complex mind. I absolutely love Ron's character but honestly I'd rather have Hermione with Tom Riddle rather than him. My guess is that JKR didn't want to pair Hermione with another dude because it would steer away from the plot and distract readers. Dramione would've been an amazing pairing, yet too powerful, and would require a book or two.

** I just think Molly and Dumbasdoor trained Ron and Ginny to try and befriend Harry and for Ginny to marry him via love potions. There's different parts in the books and movies where you can see that when Harry and Hermione aren't around Ron and Ginny there is a different demeanor in the way the characters act. Especially since Harry didn't really return Ginnys feeling then all of a sudden he did.

**** Just sit down and think about and how manipulated harry was. Dumbledore admitted to placing him into that home to abuse and mold him to die. So once harry felt love something that would feel foreign to him from the Dursleys.

So If he was given heavily diluted love potions to only reinforce the feeling and then they stopped the potions he would still be addicted to feeling loved for who he is.

No matter if he starts losing that feeling of love and more for another they only have to give the diluted portion to him again to reinforce theirs.

Everyone comes at this as a stupid opinion but just sit back and think about it with an open mind after taking a philosophy or psychology class and you'll look at it differently and from a more clear picture that can show the different strings that are connected, but keep branching off.

J.K. Rowling encouraged fanfictions for people to create a different story or ending. She's not being greedy in protecting her art.

Instead she's encouraging others to start their own stories whether based off hers, or as a new creative story. Because if one person can inspire so many others to write about it, they pass on a seperate hope and encouragement others themselves need to get their wheels turning. An avalanches always start as a trickle.
