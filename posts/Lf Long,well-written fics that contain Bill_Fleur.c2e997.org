Most underrated pairing IMO. I'm fine if they're not the focus.


** linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC). My two objections are that in my headcannon Audrey is Muggle ;) ... linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) forever!) and that nobody explained to me why Muggleborns (they are Muggleborns after all!) cannot just go to the St. Pancras station and board Eurostar.

***** I don't think so, they hung out in central London out side grimmald place for months.

Poly juice is actually pretty hard and time consuming to make so not doable for everyone

****** Except somebody in the Order brewed litres of it: so much so that even a year of camping in the woods (and occasional use of it ... Christmas trip to the Godric's Hollow) they had enough for Hermione to pretend to be Bellatrix Lestrange in the end of April. There is no reason why the same person brew same amount for liberating all those Muggleborns.

******* But you would still have to find the muggleborns, get them the polyjuice , have them use it and get on the train. Ride the train to Europe then get from the train station to the safe house network. Way less risk to just do what they do in Order of Mercy.

******** It is quite certain, that some Order of Mercy would be necessary, I have no disputes about that. I was just objecting to too complicated transport of Muggleborns to Dover and jumping them to Calais by portkey (or however it was done).

*** Also I second Order of Mercy, I'm reading it currently and real enjoy it. Fair warning it does have dabbles of smut in it.
