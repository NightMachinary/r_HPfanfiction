The only one I can think of is Stunning Shifts, but I'm sure there are others. I feel like I've read at least one body switching fic, where canon Harry switches places with a Harry that's been raised by his parents. I think it's interesting to have AU harry confronting a physical representation of what he would have been, and vice versa. Can anyone help me out?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] by nonjon is great, although it's more of an AU!Harry meeting other AU!Harries.

** I know of a fanfic like this, "Deepest Reflections", but it's the third one in a series, so you need to read the first two for it to make sense. Also, AU Harry hasn't exactly been /raised/ by his parents, but his parents are alive and he lives with them now. It's a pretty interesting premise and series of fanfics, so I do recommend reading all three =)
