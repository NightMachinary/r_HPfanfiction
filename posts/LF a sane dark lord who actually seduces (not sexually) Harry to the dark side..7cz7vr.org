When I say seduces I mean over time. Not "Harry join me and i'll bring your parents back" and Harry says "ok". It should take time and effort for Voldemort to turn Harry to the dark. I ask for a mostly sane dark lord because I don't believe an insane dark lord would have the patience and finesse to slowly seduce Harry to his side.


** Maybe linkffn(3766574) somewhat fits? It's been a while since I've read it, and it hasn't been updated in three years.

I'd definitely be interested in reading something like what you're asking for though.

Depends on what kind of insanity we're talking about. Canon!Voldemort's insanity was not amenable to it, but a Dark Lord who was /obsessed/ to the point of insanity with turning Harry, enough to pool all his resources towards it and try again and again for years and years? I would hardly call that a "mostly sane" Dark Lord, but he just might succeed eventually.

*** A dark lord whose goals were more gray would have more of a chance I think. I'm going to 'cure the world of hunger and disease' but wizards have to rule the world first and destroy the statute of secrecy. He/she could take Harry to a children's hospital and just cure every child on the brink of death. That would confuse him. If the dark lord wanted to uplift elves too it would probably make Hermione conflicted too.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
