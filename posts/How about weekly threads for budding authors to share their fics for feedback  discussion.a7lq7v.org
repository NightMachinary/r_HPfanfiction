** (a) Weekly is way too recent. I'm quite sure that there won't be enough content.

(b) Saying we need a special thread for this makes it sound like these kinds of threads aren't welcome otherwise? I'm always happy when aspiring authors submit their ideas and rough drafts for review.

** There is a weekly fic showcase in [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]. I don't know if anyone gets readers that way. While I like the idea in principle, I do feel this sub can be quite polarised. Certain sorts of fics would get a favourable response while others would get ripped apart but most would probably just be ignored. There are better places to look for feedback and critique.

** Not sure how willing a lot of the sub would be for this one, to be honest, simply because a lot of the time people will get downvoted a lot not for the fic's quality itself, but based on the fact that it includes a character or ship that the redditors on the sub don't personally like.

I feel like it'd just cause a lot of drama rather than actually getting people the thoughtful feedback they wanted.

**** On the other hand, sometimes tearing a concept apart can do you a lot of good. I remember one of my first ideas was a Harry/Luna soulbound story. I sank over 20k words into that idea before I realised that soulbonds, in 98% of the cases, are shit and the set-up is very forced.

I would have been very glad if I had a place where someone would have told me exactly how bad that concept was before wasting a month on it and another one on new iterations of the same.

Don't get me wrong, simply saying "Your idea sucks" won't do anyone any good. But a detailed reasoning why it sucks can be very welcome and helpful. Even those ranting reviews which try to tear your story apart can be useful. Take the time to look at every point they raise and either dismiss it as irrelevant or fix the issues addressed.

***** I second this,

Useful actionable feedback is some of the best stuff I've gotten as an author. Sometimes it will be something I consider for the future, but other times it shows me where I have to go back and fix because it is breaking the story.
