So it's said in cannon that strong willed people can resist partially or completely the imperius, but how strong willed do you need to be ?

Not to do mugglewanking, but do you think that a soldier who went through a Hell Week training or a spec ops would be strong willed enough ?


** I think it could be possible for muggles/squibs/anyone to resist, too.

If I remember correctly, in canon 14 years old Harry started resisting it. And it probably comes from his being a bit paranoid etc. He probably would have been just much more better at resisting it after having experienced the whole trauma of having Voldemort in his mind. (The same way it would be logical for Ginny to be able to resist just as much after the trauma of her first year).

But if trauma and paranoia must work similarly in muggles, such as in your exemple of a soldat or anyone being on the look out for drugs slipped to them ; I feel like even people who do yoga/méditation constantly would be able to know their minds and feel the spell taking effect and be more or less able to resist it.

But then again, common people are not all traumatised or paranoid and not everyone practice mindfulness (not sure if it's the word), so if the wizard doesn't make you do something totally abhorrent like « kill your mother that you love so deeply » (I reckon most everyone will stop and fight against such an order), you'll probably not stand much chance either.

So, let's say you do a crossover with Sherlock : the Holmes brothers will probably be able to completely fight it, whereas someone like Molly or even most of the police wouldn't---even if some would feel the effects.

(And then, I guess there is also the variant of how powerful the wizard is. Where fighting off Fake Moody's spell is already something, it must be quite different to try and fight off Dumbledore's or Voldemort's).

*** Agreed, but Harry seemed to have a stronger détermination than Voldemort in the graveyard, unless it was a détermination in steel reinforced by plot.

**** Complete and utter bull for me. I hate the fact that Harry an aimless 14 year old was more determined than Voldemort, probably the most determined person in Harry Potter in a contest of wills. I would rather Harry just be stronger magically or some bs like that.

***** My headcanon is that Voldemort perceived the three unforgivables as human weaknesses: powerlessness, pain and death. He went on to conquer all of them. The Horcrux inside Harry was the voice he kept hearing when it was telling him to resist while under the Imperius curse.

** Not that this is ever really elaborated on by J.K., but here's my thoughts. The ability to resist the imperious would depend on:

1) How far away the requested action was from the person's natural inclinations. So, imperiousing someone to kiss their crush would be much easier than imperiousing them to kill their best friend. 2) The relative magical power of both the caster and the victim. 3) How relatively strong or weak the individual was in terms of their identity and sense of self. Someone more independent who likes to make their own decisions would be harder to imperious, whereas an easy-going person who didn't mind going with the flow would be easier. 4) How much practice the person has resisting the Imperious. (With the thought that practice would make one more aware of what was happening and therefore more able to fight back.)

So imperiousing people like Amelia Bones and Bellatrix Lestrange would be nearly impossible, whereas someone like Ron Weasley (and Harry Potter) should've been pretty easy. This doesn't quite square with canon, but I think Rowling often didn't think things out logically and instead went with whatever the story demanded.
