If you've read any of barsen'thor stories, you know a good deal of them is Harry meet's death, death sends him to another universe to do her bidding, usually crossovers. Mine is similar to that in it's going to be the star wars universe. It's going to be set during the clone wars and his main goal is to take over the galaxy from the republic and the separatists for himself. But for the life of me, I can't think of a valid reason for why he would want to do that. So if you have any ideas on what I can use to motivate him it would be tremendously helpful.


** Magically forced to do it somehow, a third party in the war tries to recruit him (Gray Jedi? Snoke?) and succeeds. Maybe he could meet an alternative, bitter Ahsoka who wants to destroy the Sith but also wants revenge against the Jedi? Could be a setup for a pairing. Maybe he meets the Jedi and realises how corrupt they are. If you want a Beta, I'd be willing to help, although I appreciate that this is obviously at an early stage.

** For a different take on it, you could make Harry the Big Bad and write it from the perspective of a Sith or Jedi trying to stop him.

*** I like this. I can picture them joining forces to fight a common enemy while trying to come out ahead of the other side in the end.

** He thinks the dark and light sides will destroy the universe with their conflict and the only way to save it is to conquer them both?

** Not related to your question but I looked up her author you mentioned. Are all the fics so full of grammar errors? I tried to read one at random and could not get past the first few chapters. Does the content in his fics make up for the mistakes?

*** I don't really like any of the author's fics, although the MoD thing is good when done right. I personally like parodies of it too. I think He's Not Dead Yet was one, although I'm not entirely confident in that title.
