Hey

Pretty much what the title says.

I would like to read a story where they are either full siblings and Rowena actually takes her husband's name or they were half-siblings of some kind. And they break up the house symbol of a griffin apart, so Rowena gets the head part and the eagle and Godric gets the body part and the loin as their symbols.

I would love to read that.
