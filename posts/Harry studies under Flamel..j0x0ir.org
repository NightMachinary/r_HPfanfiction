:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am trying to find a fic where Harry manages to take the Stone at the end of first year with him, and finds Flamel waiting for him in his room. Flamel then decides to teach him alchemy. Cant remember the name of this fic. Also I think Perenelle is a Veela with a strong and kinda overbearing personality.

Dont know if this helps, but I remember reading that the Stone is an exception to the equivalent exchange law in the fanfiction.

Pls help!!


** Might be this linkffn(8670912) and it's sequel linkffn(9196576)

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

  One year ends and another begins. During this year, Harry Potter studies under Nicolas Flamel, is forced to deal with a Vampire Princess, and learns there is yet another danger lurking within the walls of Hogwarts, one that's been around since the time of the Founders. What's a poor student with perfect memory to do? Sequel to Gift of Memories. Warning: Character Death!
