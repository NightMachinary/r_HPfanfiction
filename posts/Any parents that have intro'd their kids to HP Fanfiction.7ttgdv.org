My almost 10 yr old is a huge HP fan and reads and re-reads the books over and over (like me). I would love to intro him to FF but a lot of the ones I've ready aren't exactly kid-friendly. Any one have recs of fics that are ok for kids that can handle themes like those from the actual canon, but maybe want to keep it a little clean?

** I'm quite certain that WhiteSquirrel is a perfectly kid-friendly author. The Albus Potter series might be friendly too, based on what I remember being mentioned, but I haven't read it myself yet.

** My son is only 1 so too young for HP in general but I think a good rec is linkffn(Not From Others by FloreatCastellum). IIRC there were some violent sections in the fic but nothing sexually explicit. Give it a read first to make sure you're comfortable. It's Deathly Hallows from Ginny's POV.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** A good entry point for a child into fanfiction is linkffn(The Best Seven Years by blu taiger): it's Calvin and Hobbes at Hogwarts, whimsical in tone, and was my son's favorite story when he was your child's age. The grammar is a bit sloppy but largely tolerable.

The site fanficauthors.net has a section for "NSNS" authors ("no slash, no smut"). Stories in that section are generally pretty kid-friendly and the writers on that site (with a few exceptions) are better than average for the fandom.
