Quite hard to explain but are there any fan fictions out there that are written in a school book type of way such as Quidditch through the ages, a history of magic etc? Biographies of famous old wizards and witches are welcome too. Would be pleasant if they are cannon too.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

*** Read it all out in one day. Liked the writing style, not sure about the plot had some flaws here and there but that is okay considering it was written in 2011.

#+begin_quote
  A Journal found in the year 3054 has left the people agog. It explains the survival of wizard-kind from the mass genocide attempted in 1998 by the world from the point-of-view of the wisest woman. They have to translate it though. Rated T for the curse words.
