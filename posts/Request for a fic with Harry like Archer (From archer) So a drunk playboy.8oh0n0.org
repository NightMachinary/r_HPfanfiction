** THIS IS NOT A FINISHED WORK.

Now that we've got that out of the way, Whiskey Time Travel is an unspeakable-fic by Sapper One. The premise is that Harry got really drunk one day, and woke up during Tom's first rise. It starts with death-eaters entering a bar that Harry's drinking in. (drunken) Secret-agent Harry Potter has some objections.

Enjoy!
