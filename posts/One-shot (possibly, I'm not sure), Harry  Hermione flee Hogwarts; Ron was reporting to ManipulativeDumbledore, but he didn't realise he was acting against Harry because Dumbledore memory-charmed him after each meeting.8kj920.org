I think it was one of those ones where Harry & Hermione discover that Manipulative!Dumbledore has been editing their memories of their lives for the Greater Good; they confront Ron, but it turns out that he's been repeatedly obliviated too and had no idea that he had already told Dumbledore about Harry & Hermione's relationship several times, or that he was trying to keep them apart.

I'm pretty sure that in the same scene, Ron asks Harry to obliviate him when Harry & Hermione are planning to escape, so that Dumbledore can't read his mind to find out.

Addendum: I do know that it's on Fanfiction.net. I'm fairly sure it is, anyway...


** I think it might be one of the stories in Rorschach's Blot's odd ideas, not sure though, been a long time since I read it.

**** Happy to help, and that my vague memory was correct, there is so much in that story/file that it kind of blurs together.
