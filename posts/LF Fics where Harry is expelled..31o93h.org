I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5723954/1/Order-of-the-Phoenix-by-TIJK][Order of the Phoenix by TIJK]] (a Harry/Tonks fic where Harry is expelled at the Wizengamot trial and ends up living with and being tutored by Sirius) and loved it, but sadly it was abandoned before anything super-interesting happened.

So now I'm looking for anything else along the same concept. Also, I'm pretty easy, so it doesn't have to be an epic masterpiece.


** There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]].

It has been a while since I read it, so I can't comment on the overall quality, although you did say

** Harry isn't quite expelled in my story, but he ends up not completing his education at Hogwarts just the same.

I present [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]]. Often called the story where I steal every good idea either from another author in the fandom or from The Count Of Monte Cristo. I like to think it's my best work.

**** I haven't finished it yet, so no.

It's only been like 4 years since I updated - I still have another year or so at least until people can complain, I think.

** Here are two short stories I like, that meet your criteria:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot][A Bad Week at the Wizengamot]] What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7335938/1/Charlie-does-the-Foxtrot-or-Damn-the-Torpedoes][Charlie does the Foxtrot or Damn the Torpedoes]] Fudge believed that everything was going according to his grand plan when Harry Potter was found guilty.... Oh Boy! Was he wrong!
