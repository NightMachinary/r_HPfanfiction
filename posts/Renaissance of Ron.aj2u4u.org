I know that you noticed it as well. Both in [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] as well as here. The recent trend of people starting to care about Ron and them noticing how under-utilized he was in the canon. Especially in the past few months, where people are getting more aware of Ron-Bashing.

Was there any point of origin this trend could be traced to? Any specific tweet from Word-Of-God? Or an article from Pottermore?

I'm theorizing it started ever since she expressed that Ron-Hermione ship was pseudo wish fulfillment and wouldn't have worked. But Ron's characterization was heavily linked with Hermione from book 6. Or Maybe People empathized more with Ron, given how he's the casual one in the trio. And fans think that JK's opinion is a slight on Ron's character.

Personally, I feel it's a welcome change for our Favorite Ginger Roonil Wazlib. He deserves better in fanfiction as well as canon.

Overall, I find this trend an interesting slow spreading change in our WW community.


** People around here always hated the movies due to their depictions of Ron. There isn't a single Ron bashing thread in the top 1500 which does not point out how bad bashing is or how he should not be bashed. The closest thing is a request for "Death Eater Ron but no bashing" voted at +10 (so place several thousand), which puts it deep into this subs archives unless you actually search for Ron bashing (which I did to find out). It is not a recent development. What changed was the fact that Rowling admitted the wish fulfilment so you don't have the fierce shipping debates where he was put down because Rowling made it extended canon that they are not a good match.

Ron was never hated here, although quite a few people simply find him boring. I find myself in that camp since the elements he adds to a story (best friend from a magical family, big adoptive family, Molly as an honorary mother for Harry) do not appeal to me. But that means I don't want him to take up much narrative focus, something which bashing does.

There's no need for 50k of Ron being a complete moron. If anything, that only includes more of Ron than a clear cut or colder relations which can be summerised with a token paragraph about a match of chess or Quidditch talk ever so often.

****** I mean, I've written just that. Harry gets fed up with Ron and Hermione fighting all the time, hangs out with Katie Bell instead while still spending time with Ron. Hermione is overworking herself at that point (especially without a time turner), there is some frostiness over the summer and a reconciliation at the start of the fourth year. Then the tournament comes around, Ron gets jealous and does his canon thing (not talk to Harry). No shouting matches, no "lets gang up on that traitor of Gryffindor" BS, no insults, just no conversations. For in-story reasons, Neville is actually the one who agitates against Harry, Ron is just not talking to him.

******** It makes sense story wise because Andromeda, who is Harry's guardian at that point, is pretty open about supporting her sister because she honestly does not care about public opinion and was not hurt by her crimes (nor were any of her friends). She blackmails Fudge into getting her away from the Dementors (with Hagrid's arrest and the confession of "we need to look like we are doing something"). Harry is not very comfortable with the idea of helping a Death Eater, but he is more than willing to help Andromeda and frankly doesn't think too much about it since Bellatrix is still in prison, just with running water and solid walls instead of soul-sucking demons and cold winds.

Neville knows, figures out the connection and consequently sees Harry's acceptance of Andromeda as guardian as a betrayal. He is not walking around challenging Harry to duels or anything, but he is open about his disdain. And it is (at least somewhat) in character if you look at his reaction to the Lestrange escape in canon.

He is not the antagonist and it is not an important plot point, just something in the background. I am merely tired of all the fics which treat Neville as the second coming of Merlin once he gets a pep talk and a new wand.

**** I vehemently disagree with this. Attacking your best mate and not believing him in GoF is exactly abandonment. Real friends (ie Hermione) don't attack their friends when they are at the lowest points (the rest of the school thinks he is a liar and cheat).

If you remember, Ron doesn't even /raise his voice/ at Harry at any point in their fallout. He questions him. He's being sarcastic and unbelieving, but I wouldn't consider that attacking as you call it. I think your "attacking your best mate" statement fits more with Harry. When Ron sees Harry is out of bed and goes to check up on him, It's Harry who explodes and headshots Ron with a "Potter stinks" badge.

Based on your own criteria, Ron would be considered a real friend. He's one of the only people to stand by him in book two when everyone thought Harry was the heir of slytherin for using parseltounge.

Harry had screamed at him to leave. I don't really fault anyone here. They're under the influence of the Horcrux. In the same vain of the one that /completely possessed/ Ginny in book two.

Look, Ron is wrong to not believe Harry. He was wrong to leave the Hunt, even though wearing the Horcrux. But one of Harry's big flaws is that he's self absorbed. So, in the end Ron is only one that has to grovel back and apologize. That never sat well with me.

** Could it be that the fandom is ageing and maturing? Someone who was starting primary school when PS came out is now almost 30.

Ron is an easy character to hate if one thinks in black-and-white: if a friend is expected to be perfectly loyal at all times, and if he isn't, then he is a craven traitor, then Ron must be the latter. He is easy to resent for "getting the girl" if one overidentifies with the lead protagonist. If one overidentifies with "the girl", it is similarly easy to resent him for preventing her from getting the hero. He is an easy scapegoat for why Harry wasn't as studious or as suave or as eager to flaunt his wealth as the fanfic author wishes he were.

These are all things one grows out of in time.

** I don't think it's a recent change in public opinion. I think it's been that way for a few years now. If I had to pinpoint when exactly Ron bashing was at its trendiest, it would be from around 2008 - 2012. It's still popular in fanfiction and is always going to be, because writers love to do whatever they can to elevate Harry and have him shag at least one attractive woman. But outside of fanfiction, I see more backlash to the backlash against Ron in comparison the original backlash.

Though a big part of it stems from what counts as Ron bashing. Does simply disliking him count as bashing? Alternatively, there's plenty of Ron love here, but not a lot of people believe that Hermione should have ended up with him. Does that count as bashing?

That would only be bashing if you think they shouldn't have ended up together because Ron doesn't /deserve/ Hermione or that she's too good for him, which, fair enough a lot of people seem to think that for some reason. However, I think it's totally possible to believe that Ron and Hermione shouldn't have ended up together while also recognizing that Hermione would have been just as much of a problem to their relationship as Ron. Hermione is often just as dismissive and rude to Ron as he is to her, the only difference being that Jo doesn't call quite as much attention to it when she does it, and I suspect a lot of people's sky-high opinion of Hermione being too good for Ron is coloured both by fanon and Hermione-Sue from the movies.

***** I think Hermione gets way too much of a pass on that one. It really doesn't matter whether Ron was shoving his relationship with Lavender in her face or not, physically attacking another person for it is /unbelievably/ shitty. The worst part is how people (and even canon to an extent) bend over backwards to make Hermione out to be the wronged party there.

And tbh Lavender really gets the short end of the stick from Jo, cos she basically gets maligned as a dumb, gossipy slag throughout the entire series and then gets killed (or at the very least mauled, maimed, and possibly infected with lycanthropy) by Greyback. Now that I think about it, are there any postwar Ron/Lavender fics where she's a werewolf? Because that immediately sounds about a thousand times more interesting than Ron/Hermione.

The way I see it, they have sex all weekend long to get rid of the UST and then awkwardly look at each other Monday morning because they have very little in common other than being Gryffindors, friends with Harry and fighting magical fascists. And that sounds more like the base for a threesome than a meaningful relationship. Few shared values, no shared interests, no wish to see the other's PoV.

The only way I see them actually last in a relationship would be bowing to social expectations, but Hermione doesn't really care about those.

No reason, it's just the typical ebb and flow around controversial topics. You can see this in politics as well... if the left gets too strong there's a counter movement shifting it to the right.

If this new pro-Ron trend that you observe manifests a bunch of OOC Won-Won fanfics, there will be a push back.
