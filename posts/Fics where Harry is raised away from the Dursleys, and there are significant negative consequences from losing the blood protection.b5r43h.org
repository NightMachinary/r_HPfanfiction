** There is a story where when Weasley boys pick Harry from the Privet Drive, they are discovered and kicked out by the uncle Vernon (“And never return back!”). The blood wards fall and the next morning Harry's breakfast at Weasleys is interrupted by professor Dumbledore, white as a wall, announcing to Harry that all Dursleys were killed by Death Eaters. I think the story was unfinished and stopped not long after this.

This is also mentioned in linkffn(5435295), which is just a bit random soul binding story. Because soul bound is from the magical point of view equivalent of the marriage, Harry is from the magical point view emancipated and thus the blood wards fall down. They are attacked by two werevolves, and ... NO SPOILERS!

Which leads to another question: are there any stories, where the wards are actually tested? In the cannon there is no attack on Privet Drive (except for dementors but that's outside of the bounds of 4 Privet Drive) and we don't even know what would happen if somebody tried.

*** The first one that comes to mind with testing the wards is linkffn(Testing Defenses by canoncansodoff). I recall one or two stories that have a line on the order of, "Aha! The wards are down! Now we can get him!" but I don't recall any stories that actually include inimical forces testing the wards.

*** I thought Dumbledore admitted in HBP or maaaaybe OotP that there were a bunch of attacks on Number 4, but Harry didn't notice because the blood wards were so effective and there was an unspoken assumption that the bad guys didn't want to mount an open assault.

Harry could probably have been grabbed off that playground he sometimes hid at if the wards were narrow enough to let a dementor attack him right in his neighbourhood.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** It's not exactly what you asked for, but Linkffn(Replay) has the blood wards failing when Harry says that Privet Drive isn't his home to some dudebros in a pub. Fair warning, though, it also has him in a romantic and very nearly sexual relationship with a woman in her thirties. To their credit, the author /does/ realise how creepy this is, but it was enough for me to drop the fic.

** There is the dogfather by hollimichele linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]). Instead of taking him in they call the police, rip his name out of the letter and hide the name in the blanket, then tell the police they found this baby on their doorstep, they've never seen or heard of him before. He's quickly adopted by an older muggle couple who've been wanting a child for years.

This leaves both Harry and them without the blood protection, and it's strongly hinted that they are killed by Death Eaters looking for Harry. There is no bashing of anybody as far as I can see, the story treats many characters quite kindly, even the Dursleys. Except for voldemort of course. Fuck him though.
