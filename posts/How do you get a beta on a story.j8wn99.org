** To my knowledge someone usually just likes the premise to your story enough to reach out to you about being a beta. I think around 5 years ago I was looking through some forums and people would post adverts about wanting to beta, but that was a while ago

** You can post on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/][r/FanFiction]]. They have a Beta Bartering post every Thursday where you can advertise your work or reach out to those who are willing to beta.

That's where I found my two lovely HP betas.

*** I have quite a few. My WattPad and Ao3 name is RosettaRoseburn. There's also some things I just haven't posted yet because I don't like the way they started.
