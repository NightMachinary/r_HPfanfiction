:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Please help! I'm looking for a fic I read a while back. I can't remember it's name nor can I find it anywhere. It was a one shot where baby Harry somehow time travelled and landed in the Great hall when James and Lilly were at Hogwarts. I think it had something to do with Sirius asking for a sign or proof that James shouldn't stop pursuing Lilly or something of the sort. Everyone's confused I think but not long after that, a worried adult James and adult Sirius show up as well, looking for him. They leave immediately after getting him.\\
I'd be really thankful if someone could help me find it!


** The one I'm thinking about is a little different, where Harry's magic takes him back in time to marauders 7th year after his parents are murdered, but it is a baby!Harry time travel fanfic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9011622/1/A-Baby-Changes-Everything]]
