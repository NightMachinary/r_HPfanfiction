Their host is quite adept at fighting off possession, so remains completely in control. Thus, Harry returns from Limbo to find he's begun to hear the voices of long dead wizards in his head, urging him to do various insane things. Like Antioch urging him to kill random people who are even passingly discourteous, Cadmus trying to get him into Necromancy for Fun and Profit^{tm}, and Ignotus suggesting he steal anything not nailed down. Harry is understandably annoyed with the latest development in his insane life.

Inspired by re-reading "The Lesser Sadness" linkffn(10959046) for the umpteenth time.


** I'm a sucker for things involving the deathly hallows. You've got my upvote.

** I read a scifi book a while back that I loved but can't remember the author or title (don't you hate it when that happens?) with a similar premise. The MC had the ability to take a particular skill or power from people he killed (I think he had to kill them anyway) but they effectively possessed him and were constantly giving commentary on his actions. It was a hilarious concept and really well executed. I'd love to something like that with HP.

**** There's quite a few Worm fanfics that have the premise of killing a parahuman and absorbing them for powers which also brings in their personality/memories that talk.

** That particular fic always stirs a similar concept with me whenever I read it although I always imagined doing it the way Newcomb does his - eldritch being granting the power. It's an interesting take ahaha I'd love to give that a read though!

** I actually wrote something a long time ago along the very same lines. Something I wished to elaborate upon. It is not exactly what you prompted but the beginning definitely have parallels. PFB:

A thaum sentinel in Salvabard performing a yearly ritual to pay respect to the gods for bestowing their race with magic was blown to simthereens by the sudden surge of power through the ancient rune stone.

Deep in an underground library below the Temple of Artemis an ancient wizard was translating an old text to discover catalyst for potions . His concentration broken by the vibrant blue glow of the rune stone which was as old as time. He ran out of there to raise the alarm.

An old nondescript Temple near Mount Kailash a Rishi was meditating. Deep in the universe of his mind where legilimens and occulumens played against each other to test the limits of magic his concentration was broken. The shikhar of temple beaming and redirecting extreme amounts of magical energy which it was once designed to do but was never destined to.

All the magical semaphores were activated for a brief moment of time simultaneously. They had done their job. But they were never supposed to be activated. These safety measure were never supposed to be tested. All the sentinels had to confirm weather it was really happening.

The feeling of power and and dominance thrumming so loudly, the call of dead so wild, the cloak of independence so near. Antonich jerked and lusted for destruction , Cadmus rooting for the addiction of madness and Ignotus' call to run amok was all too united and distinct for Harry to ignore. For an insignificant moment in the grand scheme of things far to majestic for mortals to comprehend , the arrow of time pierced through this instance and slowed down to witness something special between infinites.
