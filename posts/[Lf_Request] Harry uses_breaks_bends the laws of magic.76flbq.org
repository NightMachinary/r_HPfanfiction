** linkffn(12026631)

The Very Best is a fairly short (but not one-shot), silly fic where Harry blatantly disregards the laws of magic.

It's technically a Pokemon crossover, in the sense that Harry uses his newfound power to make pokemon, but no characters or plots from that universe appear.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

Not a main plot-point, but it happens in the fic. It's a good read in general, also enjoyable without having watched Firefly.
