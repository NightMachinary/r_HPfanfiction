OK, I've seen (and indeed started) a good few Britpicking conversations on here but I've never seen this discussed before, so hopefully this is something new.

I've recently been reading a lot of your very typical "Harry is Lord Potter, Heir Black, Lord Wonderful Wizard" fics. It's a genre I've generally not gone into in any depth before, but here we are. And, oh my god, do people get the stuff about addressing peers wrong! If we assume that titles in Wizarding Britain have the same origin as titles in Muggle Britain, that is. If you want to write a fic where it's totally separate and it goes by the standard fic trope rules, great, carry on. It's only fiction after all and I'm not here to stifle anyone's creativity! But I've seen fics where wizarding aristocracy is known to Muggle aristocracy, including Hermione having a Muggle title in one or two instances, and one particularly memorable fic where they meet the Queen of England and she addresses Harry as "Heir Potter," which is what led me to making this post, after I stopped twitching.

First point. There is no such substantive title as "Lord [Surname]." In fact, outside of one person, there is no such title in the UK as "Lord." It's a generic noun and term of address that collectively refers to peers of the realm - ie someone who is a Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount or Baron. The peerages invented in fic seem to conflate most with Earldom, so I'll stick with that. (Dukes and Marquesses tend to be related to royalty, Viscounts are mainly secondary and courtesy titles (which I'll get to) and Barons these days are mainly life peers - a type of political appointment).

Second point. These titles are, when hereditary (which wizarding aristocracy definitely is in fanon) often linked to /land./ So, to go with our most common example in fic - Lucius Malfoy would not be "Lord Malfoy." He would be "Lucius Malfoy, 17th Earl of Wiltshire." (The 17th is made up, you can use any number you like, but that's how it's styled.) In a formal setting, he would be referred to as "The Earl of Wiltshire" when other characters are speaking about him, and (and ok this is going to get confusing) "my Lord" when being directly addressed. Obviously in an informal setting with family and close friends, he'd just be called by his name.

Earldoms can also be linked to name - Princess Diana's brother is "Earl Spencer," as was his father before him. So you could make Lucius "Lucius Malfoy, 17th Earl Malfoy." He would again be referred to as "Earl Malfoy" when spoken about, and "my Lord" when directly addressed. This is probably the easiest style to use, as it's less confusing for non-British readers and also it would make sense that wizarding peers aren't linked to land because the muggles would know who they were in that case!

Third point. Heirs. This is my main bugbear, so strap in!

No one, and I mean absolutely no one, would refer to the son or daughter of a peer as "Heir [Surname]" or even "Heir [Title]." That's purely fanon. The word "Heir" is not a title. It refers to the line of succession for a title. You can have a heir apparent, and sometimes a heir presumptive. Prince Charles, for example, is the Queen's heir apparent. He will inherit her titles and roles. But he's not "Heir Windsor," he's the Prince of Wales, which is the title traditionally given to the heir to the throne. (He also has about ten million other titles, but let's keep it simple!) So when he becomes King, his son, Prince William, who is his heir apparent, becomes Prince of Wales because he's now first in line to the throne.

So. If Lucius is the Earl of Wiltshire, or Earl Malfoy, Draco is his heir apparent. But he wouldn't be called "Heir Malfoy" or "Heir Wiltshire." He would be given a /courtesy title,/ probably one that is one of his father's secondary titles (titled people in the UK do tend to have more than one, because, yknow, privilege breeds privilege. But that's another rant!) The most common secondary title used as an heirs courtesy is Viscount, which can link to a name, a place, or a combination thereof. Now, it's about to get more complicated because a Viscount tends to refer to a smaller place, whereas an Earldom to a county or large city. So Draco could be, for example, "Viscount Salisbury," (Salisbury is a town in Wiltshire), "Viscount Malfoy", or "Viscount Malfoy of Salisbury," but the latter is rare. Again, use any place name you want. I'm just using examples to illustrate the correct style of address. But the place the Viscount gets is different to the place the Earl gets.

If Lucius is Earl of Wiltshire, Draco could be "Viscount Malfoy," or "Viscount Salisbury" (or any town in England tbh). If you make Lucius "Earl Malfoy," don't make Draco "Viscount Malfoy." They shouldn't match! Back to the example of Princess Diana's brother, he is Earl Spencer and his son is Viscount Althorp (Althorp being their family seat). So if Lucius is Earl Malfoy, it makes sense to make Draco Viscount Salisbury, as we know that their home is in Wiltshire so let's pick a town in that county.

NOW. This is where it gets complicated. You can also refer to a courtesy Viscount or Baron as "Lord [however they are styled]." So in the above example, if Lucius is Earl Malfoy, Draco would be, for example, Viscount Salisbury by courtesy but could be referred to semi-formally as "Lord Salisbury," because as I said initially, "Lord" is a generic styling to indicate that someone is aristocracy, not a title in and of itself and the son of the title holder, although allowed to use the title by courtesy, does not hold an official title.

So, contrary to accepted fanon - the actual peer is never "Lord" but the heir /could/ be styled "Lord." Yes, British aristocracy is flipping ridiculous.

NEARLY DONE (if you've stuck with me this long, omg you're so patient. Thank you!). Courtesy titles only become official once the heir is of age. When they are under eighteen (sometimes 21 depending how traditional and old the titles and family are), they are simply styled as "The Honourable [First Name, Surname]," in daily life or if they are accompanying their parents to a formal function they may be introduced as "Lord [First Name, Surname]," "Lord" used purely to mean "male aristocrat with no title." So, in our example, Draco, the son of Earl Malfoy, will become Viscount Salisbury at the age of seventeen (of age in the magical world), and until then he's "The Honourable Draco Malfoy." BUT. In school, underage aristocrats would be referred to as their name. Draco would still be called "Mr Malfoy," "Malfoy" or "Draco" by his teachers. When he becomes Viscount Salisbury at seventeen, he would be entitled to ask that they refer to him as "Salisbury" in place of "Malfoy," but it is absolutely not the done thing that teachers or other authority figures refer to children by their titles - for one thing, it breeds a heirarchy within the school and it undermines the teachers authority.

FINAL POINT. For women it's much simpler. They can (contrary to popular opinion) hold titles in their own right and would be addressed by the female version of the title. This is also the case if they marry into the title. So, they would be a Duchess, Marchioness, Countess, Viscountess or Baroness BUT you address them as "Lady [Surname]" in most situations. So, if Lucius is Earl of Wiltshire or Earl Malfoy, Narcissa is Countess Wiltshire or Countess Malfoy by marriage but it's absolutely acceptable to call her Lady Malfoy in pretty much any situation - other than being formally announced alongside her husband where they would be introduced as "The Earl and Countess of Wiltshire" or "The Earl and Countess Malfoy."

Daughters, including female heir apparents, are always "Lady [First Name, Surname]" if their father is a Duke, Marquess, or Earl. If their father is a Viscount or Baron, they are officially "the Honourable [First Name, Surname]" but can informally be referred to as "Lady."

So. To sum up.

Don't call your adult posh wizards "Lord [Surname]". They can be "Earl [Surname]" or "Earl of [Place Name]." Collectively, they can be lords - it's ok to refer to "the lords of the wizengamot" as a collective, but not an individual title. They are, however, addressed as "my Lord." Female title holders, or wives of title holders, are always "Lady Surname" unless being formally announced, and addressed as "my Lady"

Heir isn't a title, heir is a word that indicates order of succession. Most heirs are Viscounts by courtesy, but you can call them "Lord." Female heirs are always Lady. You would never ever ever refer to the son of a peer as "Heir [Name or Place]."

Don't have Harry suddenly learn he's got all these titles and then /demand Hogwarts staff refer to him as such./ Nope. He's still "Potter," or "Harry" to his teachers UNLESS you make the Potter Lordship link to a place - so say we decide the Potter family seat is in Kent and James was "James Potter, 15th Earl of Kent," Harry upon discovering he is the 16th Earl of Kent could reasonably ask to be addressed as "Kent" in place of "Potter." But the teachers absolutely don't have to refer to him as "my Lord" or adjust the class register to say "The Earl of Kent" instead of "Harry Potter."

The best thing about this? If you do hereditary rankings properly, it shows Tom Riddle up as a right twat for styling himself "Lord Voldemort," when, as discussed, NOT A REAL TITLE!!


** If you wanted Harry to be a dick, or to develop a friendship between him and Draco, you could have Harry find out he has all these titles, immediately start demanding everyone call him Lord/Viscount/Earl, and then have Draco step in and be like, “That's not how it works, Potter. You're making a twat of yourself.”

****** And it was /never/ part of the British system officially. Sometimes it's practised, sometimes it's not, but was never practised in /full/ because the Lord Chancellor was, until the Supreme Court Act (I haven't looked it up since becuase this happened /after/ I quit being a litigator) a cabinet minister and part of the executive, speaker of the house of lords and therefore part of the legislature, and led and appointed the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council /and/ the Lords of Appeal In Ordinary and as such was the country's most senior judge.

Most of those functions got handed off to other officials after the Supreme Court took over the House of Lords' appellate functions and the Lord Chancellor is basically just the minister for the Justice Department these days and as such only violates separation of powers two ways like all the other ministers.

Just to really rub it in, Lord Chancellor was a political appointment on the advice of the Prime Minister (and in matters of formal precedence, outranks the Prime Minister and every other minister except the Great Steward - an office that is only ever filled for coronations)

Remember: it's not a British Institution if it makes sense outside the context of a thousand years of civil wars and narrowly-avoided civil wars.

**** I can't explain the first two, but the last two are simple.\\
Wizards don't have any specific qualifications related to teaching and it seems likely that all you need to teach a subject is a NEWT in that subject, for most subjects there's plenty of candidates to choose from and its the headmaster's job to pick the best one, but the DADA job has been cursed for half a century so there's really not many people willing to take it.\\
The job of inspecting Hogwarts was created specifically for Umbridge, as in it likely wasn't even thought necessary until then, for all we know the only requirement or limitation.

She got both jobs due to the significant amount of fiat power than the Minister seems to wield, Fudge simply made a few decrees which say she's now teaching DADA regardless of qualifications because Dumbledore can't seem to hire anyone and she's now inspecting Hogwarts because he says so.

Oh yeah, that's a point this sort of aristocracy fic seems to miss, the Minister might be elected but he seems to be more of a dictator than anything, able to simply declare new laws as he sees fit. Not something you'd expect in a nation that still gave power to the aristocracy.

** Interestingly the Death Eaters always refer to Tom as either Master, My Lord or The Dark Lord. Only Quirrell bucks this trend, but that occurs in Book 1 when the larger HP world is still rather nebulous. But I now read this as Quirrell claiming favour. No one is allowed to speak the name Voldemort, lord or otherwise in front of Tom without consequence. But Quirrell can get away with it because Tom has no other options at the time. I imagine is must have thrilled Quirrell each time he said it, knowing that not even the Dark Lord's inner circle would dare to do the same.

Quirrell is also a Half-blood who used to teach Muggle Studies which further confuses things.

Dobby is the first character to use the title "Dark Lord" something he no doubt picked up from his family, just as Kreacher did in book 7.

Amusingly the person who uses "Lord Voldemort" the most often is Dumbledore. No doubt Albus thought it funny to use Toms' silly teenage nickname constantly. Being the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, he's no doubt familiar with the proper forms of address and Tom's infantile use of Lord would certainly tickle him.

That being said, I think the term "Dark Lord" has providence outside of muggle peerage conventions. It shows up in the Prophecy for instance, so Tom's use of Lord Voldemort might be a contraction of "The Dark Lord, Voldemort."

Yes, I have always seen it that way. Tbh even in the most wanky Lordship fics if Tom wants to claim any political or social power he ends up styling himself as "Lord Marvolo Slytherin," which is an upgrade from Lord Voldemort! I'd still like to see him calling himself something proper though - "Marvolo Slytherin, Earl of Hangleton" would work if we say that where the Gaunt shack now stands has been Slytherin land since way back when.

Or the Sorting Hat sings of Slytherin being "from Fen," which could mean Ireland but it could also mean, if we assume he was English, "the Fenlands" which is Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk mainly. So Tom could be the Earl of Lincoln, or he could be just Earl Slytherin and his heir gets to be Viscount Hangleton (Little Hangleton is now in Lincolnshire and no one can change my head canon about this soz).

If it's from way back when he'd almost certainly be Baron Hangleton (and far more likely be a small-b baron, the now largely defunct lord of the manor that mostly survives only in Scotland nowadays).

However, what we're told about where Hangleton /is/ tells us it has to be up north somewhere (two hundred miles from Little Whinging, per Goblet of Fire chapter 1) nearly all of the land in that radius across Lancashire and North Yorkshire (with a bit of old Westmorland included if you make it a fuzzy 'two hundred miles') was crown land from the conquest - the Harrying of the North made most of it unattractive to be given out to feudal henchmen, land ain't that valuable if your genocide killed off three quarters of the productive peasants - and very little of it was parcelled out as manors before /quia emptores/ was passed and more-or-less froze the growth of the manorial system. The Gaunts were as such /really/ unlikely to have had a manorial dignity.

(Gaunt is an anglicisation of 'Ghent'. There's a hill that's within the band where Hangleton lies called Pen-y-Ghent...)

  However, what we're told about where Hangleton is tells us it has to be up north somewhere (two hundred miles from Little Whinging, per Goblet of Fire chapter 1)
#+end_quote

200 miles from Little Whinging doesn't have to be up north! It could be somewhere in Devon or Cornwall. It could be North Lincolnshire. 200 miles from Surrey is actually a bit lower down the country than Lancashire or North Yorkshire. 200 miles west of Surrey would put you onto Dartmoor, which has it's fair share of old houses and remote little villages. It could even be somewhere in the west of Wales.

#+begin_quote
  the Harrying of the North made most of it unattractive to be given out to feudal henchmen, land ain't that valuable if your genocide killed off three quarters of the productive peasants - and very little of it was parcelled out as manors before quia emptores was passed and more-or-less froze the growth of the manorial system.
#+end_quote

Right, but there's plenty of Dukedoms and Earldoms in the North that date from before the Statute of Secrecy, and replaced the old baronetcies. It doesn't have to have been given to Salazar himself, but potentially a descendant. And the Gaunts specifically don't have to have had a manorial dignity - say the Slytherin's were some form of nobility, maybe Earls, made in like the 1350s. Then the name died out as we know it did and the title went with it and no one in the Muggle world remembers because of the Statute. But the Gaunt family is, as we see from Marvolo, obsessed with their heritage. So it's likely the Gaunt family, at some point before Marvolo was born, acquired a small home on what used to be Slytherin Lands because they're so proud of the heritage. When Tom discovers all of this, he decides to bring back the title.

  That being said, I think the term "Dark Lord" has providence outside of muggle peerage conventions. It shows up in the Prophecy for instance, so Tom's use of Lord Voldemort might be a contraction of "The Dark Lord, Voldemort."

No. It's part of an anagram of his name. There is no nobility, no peerage, no Dark Lordship involved at all. He just chose a pretentious name and then scammed a bunch of nitwits with it.

I think you've slightly missed my point. I'm not saying /Voldemort/ isn't an anagram, just that the term "Dark Lord" has a use in prophecy which suggests a use for the Lord moniker that isn't connected to the muggle world.

The Prophecy could have chosen another title for Tom. Something that referenced his Riddle name or his heritage/ kin killing or simply called him a Dark Wizard (Which is how Grindlewald is refered to on Albus' card btw). So magic/fate is choosing to use *Lord* which, again, suggests that there might be a non muggle providence to the term.

** My take on the Lord/Heir/Scion/Patriarch concept is that it's purely internal Wizarding World. It would have sort of developed, probably after the Statute of Secrecy came into effect, especially for those without Muggle titles but old families. If that is implicit and consistent in its use in a fic, I've got no problem with it. For the most part, I prefer to leave mundane titles out of it altogether (although, just to make a liar of myself, I'm working one where Harry inherits a minor Baronetcy in Wales. Not a big deal, although he will meet the Queen). The Queen, who is usually not depicted as a Witch, would not be using Wizarding forms of address to her own subjects, so Harry would still be Mr Potter (or whatever Mundane title he should happen to have), so I share the eyeroll there.

Consistency is key. And when dipping into Mundane politics and etiquette and so on, do your research!

I have seen a couple that call Voldemort out on the Lord thing and I always find it amusing.

Could you please give me your sources for this? I've had a dreadful time finding these details and I've got that one fic...and my husband wants to write one where there are multiple titles at play. And we both /need/ to be correct.

I will be renaming Potter Manor, in light of the comments here. And the Malfoys don't live in Malfoy Manor, but a pretentious French equivalent because even after 900 years, they still don't have the class they think they have.

*** The best source is Debretts information on the peerage: [[https://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the-peerage/]]

So there's sections in there about each of the five types of peerages, and how these things work in terms of what you'd call them and so on.

There's also an etiquette section on Debretts, which is useful if you want to ensure your characters are behaving like aristocracy for extra realism. Also Google "u and non u behaviour" and there's a list of words which are "u" (ie upper class) and their middle/lower class counterparts - so for example, "spectacles" is U, "glasses" is non-U. "Napkin" is U, "Serviette" is not. If you want the Malfoys to "not have have the class they think they have," have them have major airs and graces but drop in some "non U" words to prove they're actually not that posh.

*** We tend to say social climber or class jumper. Nouveau Riche is also used, but generally by the old families who resent new money. They consider /everyone/ new money though, not just Kardashian style people but even those with less old titles. So if your great great great grandfather was made a Baron in the 18th century, you'd still be considered new money by the poshest of the British aristocracy. It's utterly ridiculous.

Yes, Malfoy Manor would absolutely not be called as such if the Malfoys were true aristocracy. Houses have their own names, and they are nearly always "house" (as in Highgrove House, where Prince Charles lives) unless they're actually a castle or palace. Never "manor," a manor was originally a term that meant a feudal estate, and the place the owner of that estate lived was generically a "manor house," but that house would have a name that had the suffix "house," or perhaps "place" or "court." Using the suffix "manor" wasn't done until late Victorian times and is absolutely a sign of the nouveau.

Want to make your Malfoy family posh AF? Rename Malfoy Manor as, idk, Oakgrove House or something. Call Draco Viscount Oakgrove. And for heaven's sake, never ever have any of them say "toilet" or "serviette"!

**** Sometimes though, surnames do become the name of seats and places. As I'm Scottish, i know more about Scottish Aristocracy, which has its own quirks occasionally especially because of the remnants of the Clan System. I should also stress how legally distinct Scotland is, especially in these matters.

However, back to my original point,

Castle Douglas, seat of Clan Douglas Skene Castle, seat of Clan Skene The entire county of Moray, spawns the name Murray, sometimes ancient aristocrats take names associated with their lands as surnames eg Earl/ Countess Sutherland, Chief of Clan Sutherland Wemyss Castle, Seat of Clan Wemyss and the Earl of Wemyss and March Castle Kennedy, Ancient Seat of Clan Kennedy, though not the current seat

This trend happens a lot in Scotland.

Brings me to another point want to make; For the love of christ please come up with better names for family seats than Potter Manor, or Potter Castle. Castle Potter flows better if you really want to follow that convention, but I urge authors to come up with more interesting names,

We already have The Burrow of the Weasleys Ive seen The Ossuary as the fanon seat of the Bones family.

Why not ‘The Kiln' of the Potters, where generations of Potters have sought to test their mettle and magic against the creatures that inhabit their land. It could even have an older name from when the Peverells inhabited the land, but has since been lost, or rechristened. That is if you want to ignore the Pottermore etymology where ‘Potter' is not related to muggle occupational Surname ‘Potter' but is in fact a corruption of ‘Potterer' from ‘Linfred the Potterer of Stinchcombe'. I personally really like the Pottermore version, but to each their own.

Edit: One of my personal headcanons is that the Potters do have a family magic, that was originally just stuff from the Peverells, but The Potterers added some random stuff they thought up. As the name mutated to Potter, some ancestor, call him Smart Alec Potter, thought it would be a really funny joke to make all the puns like ‘The Kiln' and started the tradition of Earth based family magic, some of which is useful, the rest of which is just stuff about magical pottery.

Ok one of these is my surname :) And now I want my castle back! Although apparently my particular branch of that family is the product of a second sons affair with a servant and said "issue" was packed off to Glasgow and allowed to keep the name in exchange for no money or house. Isn't aristocracy wonderful 🙄

Absolutely agree on the interesting names, especially if the point of the house having a name is that it's connected to Harry inheriting a peerage - older aristocracy especially in England have names for their house often connected to the lands around them or similar.

****** Thats an interesting lineage, better than mine anyhow. Mine are all farming and crofting folk, some spoke Gàidhlig a few generations ago, i.e. Grandad's Grandmother etc. Though the branch that gives me the patronymic surname ‘Arthur' comes from Wales/Cornwall in the Napoleonic Era, an we can't tell if they were evicted as part of the Clearances and moved there because they moved back to Scotland or they were there in Cornwall originally, so im choosing to be fun and say I'm actually descended from King Arthur, facts be damned.

I love a good wizarding aristocracy fic, but i really wish people would be so much more creative with the titles and how it feeds family magics etc.

For instance i have two more head canons for you;

1) Despite ‘Peveril' being a traceably Norman name to a ‘Sir William Peveril'; The Wizarding Peverells were descended from Sir Peverell, one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table and a wizard who was taught by Merlin, his descendants either created the Deathly Hallows or were actually gifted them by Death, him/her self.

2) The Weasleys actually lost most of their wealth and assets to the Malfoys, a couple (2-3)of generations ago, hence the Nouveau Riche Malfoys who rechristen the original Burrow to ‘Malfoy Manor'.

********* My city has so many private schools. A lot of children are privately educated. It's insane.

I went to a private school but it wasn't the poshest school in the city by a decent margin and a lot less posh than schools like Eton. It felt like all the actual pretentious rich parents sent their children to The Posh School and the children of mid to upper middle class parents or the crazy smart lucky children on scholarships and bursaries went to mine or one of the numerous other private schools. I have no idea if that's accurate though.

To me, The Posh School was how I pictured Hogwarts to look like bc the grounds and building are so impressive.

There were no obvious divides in the school over wealth (school uniform was skirt/trousers, tie and blazer so everyone looked the same) (excluding privately judging the parents who parked really expensive cars in a car park with minimal cctv bc come on), until students turned 17 and started driving brand new cars they got for their birthday. That was a lovely reminder about how much money some parents had.

So a great way for class/pretentious to poke into the children is the richer ones having the best (and most expensive) extra curricular equipment and going on holidays abroad or too their second home for the holidays. Eg nimbus 2001s instead of 2000s or cleansweeps; expensive chess sets; brand new top of the line equipment for classes; expensive clothes; talking about their experiences in [insert city here] or their wizarding skiing trip equivalent; etc.

How people talk is partially influenced by wealth, class and social situation they are in - A Good And Proper young wizard would probably speak in received pronunciation to their parents instead of informal language whereas a normal young wizard would be a lot more informal with their parents and probably use the regional accent and slang (Draco v Ron v Seamus).

** Very comprehensive.

I actually have a fic on my hard drive (half written) with titles done properly.

Lots of people in fic kept wrongly calling Sirius "Lord Black" (I made him "the Earl of Grimmuald" I dont think wizarding titles would be linked to land in the same way muggle ones due to the statue of secrecy so I linked them to the houses for example Lucius was Earl Malfoy but Draco was viscount Devizes which is another town in Wiltshire I just liked the name better than Salisbury or Swindon or any of the larger towns) and Sirius didn't care he was addressed wrongly because he was as anti his family as he is in canon but it was commented on that the people who kept doing it were "common".

I also made the Potters minor gentry. It annoys me that Harry gets stupid titles in fic when canonically the Potters were wealthy but not mega rich. Also most of their cash seems to have come from Fleamont's potions ,which is trade and therefore common). That was a point in the fic too. Harry was sort of lower upper class which fits the Potters better in my mind.

I might pick it up again actually now you've reminded me.

Only petty point, courtesy titles can be used before a child is of age. James, Viscount Severn the son of the Earl of Wessex isn't an adult (he's 12 I looked it up for this comment) and he is known as Viscount Severn.

But noone would be going around a school calling each other "my lord" or "your grace" because it undermines teacher's authority though in an insular world like wizarding Britain chances are that most students (except muggleborns) would know who in their year had a title anyway

I think this is specific to the monarchy - Prince Charles was Duke of Cornwall from the age of four and Prince of Wales from the age of ten, although not formally investiture-d and able to act as such until the age of 21. Harry's son Archie is technically entitled to call himself Earl of Dunbarton even though he's a baby, but Harry and Megan have decided not to use it and the kid himself is too young to make the decision. Whereas, on the non-Royal side of the family, Charles Spencer wasn't allowed to call himself Viscount Althorp until he was 21

What I find weird is the Wessex's kids have courtesy titles, yet Wills and Harry never did, and I don't think the Duke of Yorks children did either - although that may be because they're girls. Maybe Wills and Harry didn't because they got to call themselves Prince, and the Wessex's kids don't get to style as such? Which would also explain why Harry's son is entitled to a courtesy even though he doesn't use it, and George, Charlotte and Louis are just Prince/Princess.

**** It was a political fic. Harry's parents were still dead and he was the ward of the scandalous Earl of Grimmauld (Sirius) and he was raised by Sirius and his "secretary" Remus (his secret lover because I like wolfstar).

I messed with the timeline so Tom Riddle was Harry's age and he was still raised in an orphange but he had at some pointed killed Morfin, Earl of Hangelton and had put the Duke of Slytherin (Marvolo Gaunt) under the imperius so he (as Merope's son) was next in line to be Duke of Slytherin. He was waiting until he was a few years olds to kill The Duke of Slytherin so he could take the title without suspicion in the meantime he was controllong Marvolo via imperius. Tom and Harry had a kind of weird friends slash enemies relationship where the was mutual respect but they kept trying to outmanoeveur each other (my Harry was a Slytherin but not a blood purist).

I had a whole plan for a wizarding house if lords but never got that far. I wanted to write more with Tom in the lords and Harry elected to the commons and them trying to thwart each other.

I really must pick this back up.

I coudnt find any info on age barriers for courtesy titles though it wasnt that important for when they were children (aside from a scene in year one in which Draco tries to use his title to flex and Snape shuts him down for behaving in a common fashion).

I think this actually makes a compelling argument /for/ the use of "Lord." After all, they may style themselves as aristocrats, but they don't actually have titles, do they? (Or at least not any that The Crown would recognize.) So, since they can't call themselves Earls or Viscounts, they just stuck with "Lord" as a generic title. And after a few generations, they might not even remember the origin of the title. I am certain that almost no one who writes fics about lordships and the like intends it that way, but I think it makes a lot of sense.

Lord of Parliament is specifically Scottish. Theres about 30 of them, and probably half that number are styled as Barons, although about 10-15 are indeed Lord. I'd forgotten about them when I made the post, but yes. These blokes are the exception to the rule.

The House of Lords is indeed so called, and is also known as the House of Peers. It is the Upper House of British government. In this context, "Lords" is used as a collective to mean "the people who sit in this Chamber are titled," it doesn't mean the people therein are specifically called Lords. There are two classes of "Lords" within the House.

The first and smallest is the "Lords Spiritual," which is currently a group of 26 Archbishops and Bishops representing the Church of England. These people mainly are not peers in their own right but are entitled to sit in the Lords due to their high status in the Church - the current Archbishop of Canterbury, for example, is not a peer in his own right but is the "Lord Archbishop" by virtue of being the head of the C of E.

Some spiritual figures have been made life peers - Baron Sacks was Chief Rabbi, Baron Williams is a former Archbishop of Canterbury - and they are entitled to take a seat in the Lords and sit with the Lords Spiritual. They are also often, like other life peers, informally called "Lord" in the media - Sacks was regularly referred to as Lord Sacks when in the news - but the correct style, as for all life peers, is Baron.

The other, and larger part of the Lords is the Lords Temporal. Again, none of these people are officially Lords, apart from a small number of Scottish Lords of Parliament (and I'm not sure if any of those currently have a seat in the HoL). 92 of these are hereditary peers - which is the form of peerage I discussed in my OP. They will be a Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, or Baron.

The rest of the Temporal, about 650 seats, is for life peers. All of these are Barons or Baronesses, and most Barons are officially styled thus: [Full name], Baron [name] of [place the baronetcy is linked to]. Men will be referred to as "Lord Surname" or "The Right Honourable Lord Surname" but their rank is specifically Baron and Lord is an honorific term of address. Women can choose to be "Lady Surname," "Lady Place of Baronetcy" or "Baroness Surname," but again their rank is specifically Baroness. These are political appointments and the Barons and Baronesses sit with their chosen political party, much as the MPs sit in the Commons.

No member of the HoL would be addressed as Sir. A Sir is a knight, and the peerage ranks are higher than a knight so supercede it. Being a knight does not confer the right to sit in the HoL. An example of this is Lord Sugar (him of The Apprentice UK fame). He was Knighted in about 2000, and was addressed as "Sir Alan" thereafter but definitely wasn't allowed in the HoL! He was then made a life peer about ten years later, and became Baron Sugar of Clapton, and was thereafter known in public as Lord Sugar. At that point, he was allowed in the HoL. But his /rank/ is Baron, which superceded his former rank of knight.

Basically, you can get away with calling a life peer (which is a political appointment) "Lord Surname," but you absolutely wouldn't get away with calling a hereditary peer that.

***** So the "Lords Temporal" is both the hereditary peers that are still allowed to sit in the Lords, and then the life peers.

The life peers, yes basically you're right. The government chooses people that they want to give a peerage to - but that title only lasts as long as the individual survives. They can't pass it to their children. That title is always Baron. So those titles are given to people who have done a lot of public service or achieved something. So quite often senior judges, businesspeople and so on. Some of the more interesting ones are Floella Benjamin, who used to present kids TV, A lady called Doreen Lawrence who's son was killed by the police so she's campaigned for police reform for years, Ian Botham who was England Cricket captain when I was a kid. But most of them aren't interesting celebrities, they're law types and politicians, and businessmen who aren't famous but successful.

Where it gets a bit complicated is that the Temporal - so the peers both hereditary and life - have party affiliation. So a hereditary peer can choose to sit with the party of their choice, or to not have any party affiliation which is known as being a "crossbench" peer. Life peers get to do the same, but it's usually announced when they're made a Baron/ess which party they're going to represent or if they've chosen to sit as a crossbench lord.

If you've been made a Baron to be a life peer, yes you're automatically allowed to sit in the HoL and vote on stuff. There are still some hereditary Baronetcies, but most of them don't sit in the Lords as they're secondary titles that get used as courtesies by the eldest son or if the person has no children, they will still likely have another title that superceded Baron. And obviously you go by the highest one. But yes, really you're right - if someone is Baron/ess whoever, it's fair to assume they're a life peer and sit in the Lords.

******* Yes, I believe they can switch party, which is called "crossing the floor," but it's very rarely done. A lot of the political appointments have existing affiliation anyway, so they'd been an MP for one of the parties, or if they're a business person maybe they'd assisted the government on a project and helped them understand the issues or something.

The government tends to pick a majority of their own people, but there are some conventions. For example, if the outgoing Prime Minister has said someone should be made a lord, it's not the done thing for the new PM to block that. So, when John Prescott, who was Deputy Prime Minister for the Labour Party, left the House of Commons in 2010, the outgoing Labour PM, Gordon Brown, named him as someone who should be made a lord. The new PM, David Cameron, was a Conservative, but he still made Prescott a life peer. Because there's convention. Sometimes the government will take recommendations from the opposition as well. For example, the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, and in 2018 they agreed to make Iain McNicol, who was the former General Secretary of the Labour Party (which is the parties most senior non elected position) a life peer after Labour MPs recommended it. The opposition parties get a certain allocation of how many people they can recommend each year. So it's not as cutthroat and partisan as the US, although the ruling party does get a majority.

It's generally not controversial, obviously when they're well known politicians some people have an opinion. John Prescott for example, some people weren't keen on his appointment because when he was Deputy PM he smacked a bloke who threw an egg at him. Half the country think he did the right thing and anyone else would have smacked that bloke too, and the other half think he's some sort of thug! But ultimately no one made a fuss because he was Deputy PM for a decade and it's the done thing. The press covers it when someone famous gets it, when Ian Botham got it recently there was footage on the news of him being sworn in. But that's because people like him and were interested to see it, not because it was controversial really.

** This was very interesting to read and very informative. I think some of the differences between Fanon noble titles and real world titles could be explained away in-universe though I will totally agree that most authors haven't really put on that much thought or effort.

For instance in the 300+ years since the Statute of Secrecy the style of address went from Duke of [Whatever] or Earl [Something] to simply Lord [Whatever/Something] because the families that cared the most about having a noble title were of lower rank ("Dark" families care about lineage and bloodlines, but are less likely to have served muggle royalty to get higher titles, while "Light" families are more meritocratic and care about individual accomplishment, but have acquired more titles by serving and intermarrying with muggles). As a result the important point is that you /have/ a noble title rather than what the title actually /is/, so the snobbiest families start referring to each other as Lord [Whatever] to emphasize that they are better than everyone else without having to admit that they only have the title of Baron.

Also it could be that Wizards didn't care about collecting multiple titles to show how great and powerful they are the way muggle nobles did, after all a wizard noble can just knock over your castle with a few spells to show how powerful he is. because of this there aren't many courtesy titles available to let your heir use to show that he is better than everybody else (or will be when you kick the bucket) and the nobles themselves are already being referred to as Lord [Something]. Given the longer lifespan of witches and wizards that is a potentially a long time to go without a tangible excuse to sneer at your "inferiors" so the practice of referring to the heir apparent to a title as Heir [Something].

** Awesome post, cleared up a lot of things, (in my fics I either don't apply nobility or just have the Wizards have different titles 'Warlock, Grand Warlock, Sorcerer, Grand Sorcerer and maybe Magister') but I have a theory on where this trope comes from.

1- GOT I think most of the Lord part is due to this, there, in Westeros, unless you are royalty you get called, Ser(for knights and landed knights), Lord(most of nobility) or Lord Paramount(for the Lord of a whole Kingdom), though even the latter goes by Lord.

It's simple and gives a feeling of authority.

2-For the "Heir" part and even the over use of Lord [Surname] it could be Naruto fanfiction, because in some Shinobi noble clans they had a title for heirs that when used is translated as Heir, so the addressing would be as Heir [Family Name], it was a pretty big trope back then.

And the Lord [Surname] part is because in some translations (even official ones) Lord is used when the person has the -sama honorific, which is more of a sign of deference and/or respect, than nobility (AFAIK Japanese had many different actual noble titles) so Jiraiya-sama was translated as Lord Jiraiya and Hokage-sama (whereas Hokage /is/ a title and/or rank) was translated as Lord Hokage.

I find that both these fandoms exchanged and still exchange many tropes.

But, if one of his sons does something remarkable enough to also be made a life peer, how would that be handled? Would he not be able to be made Baron Lloyd Webber until his father passed?

*** Now, Lloyd Webber is an interesting one for two reasons. Firstly, he recently resigned from the House of Lords, so although he is entitled to keep his title or Baron (or Lord, colloquially) he is no longer entitled to be styled Right Honourable. And secondly, although his surname isn't hyphenated on his birth certificate, it is on his title. So his son could be made "Baron Lloyd Webber" whereas Andrew is "Baron Lloyd-Webber". A subtle difference, but its there!

The main difference would be /where/ he was baron of. So Andrew Lloyd Webber is Baron Lloyd-Webber of Sydmonton, and his son could be made Baron Lloyd-Webber (or Lloyd Webber) of [another place] and that's how you'd differentiate. Or you could refer to one as Lord Lloyd Webber and one as Baron Lloyd Webber, or for example the son gets to be called Lord or Baron Lloyd-Webber and Andrew gets called Lord or Baron Sydmonton.

His father's title after being given a life peerage was Baron Hurd, of Newbury in the Royal County of Berkshire. As a life peer, his father's title didn't pass on to him, so when he was elevated to the Lord's he had his own title: Baron Hurd of Westwell, of Westwell in the county of Oxfordshire.

Other examples:

Vaizey (father/son)

Baron Vaizey, of Greenwich in Greater London Baron Vaizey of Didcot, of Wantage in the County of Oxfordshire

Gummer (brothers)

Cheshires (married)

Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk Baron Cheshire, of Woodhall in the County of Lincolnshire.

So a few things to point out: - Titles don't have to be the same when related, it's easier if they're not. - Sometimes someone else with the same name has used their name in the title, if you're new you add a location to your title, or choose something else -You can have a location not in the UK, if you were born there - You can have a location that isn't a village/town/city but rather an area (e.g. Lord Hammond of Runnymede)

After being a patient person and reading your entire speech (lol), I have to say that I am almost glad most fanfic authors use the wrong style because that is way complicated! I do understand that it is not correct, but to use the correct style the author would have to do an entire note to explain the difference/hierarchy to most readers. By now Lord and Heir is kind of a trope in fanfiction, and it would probably confuse many to switch to correct forms. Thanks for the lesson though 😘

*** Oh I know most people will still do Lord and Heir because that's basically now "how it works in the wizard world" and it's fine to do, because it's clearly separate to the muggles.

But I'd just like to see one or two fics that show the author has done some basic research on how it works, because you could get really creative with the names of the Earldoms and stuff. Tbh it's "heir" that pisses me off most, "Lord" is often used colloquially by the media anyway - for example, there's quite a famous former minister called Jeffrey Archer in the UK, and he was given a peerage after leaving politics. He's officially "Baron Archer of Weston-Super-Mare" but the papers always call him "Lord Archer." But I don't think there's a system in the world where the eldest child of a titled aristocrat would be called "Heir [Surname]."

Thank you for sticking all the way through it 😂

**** There was also another story that I can't recall the name of, in which harry and his faction plot to get Justin Finch-Fetchley into the magical nobility to increase their numbers due to already being muggle nobility and that being an established way of creating a new, magical noble house. Reveals that he's a Viscount, son of an Earl, and grandson of a Duke.

** Great summary! My only real response to it all is just 'tru that'.

Though I would add two things for anyone else reading.

First, the most important thing from all that to remember is that titles (basically, the thing Aristocrats would put on their business cards) and styles (the way people address said Aristocrats) are different. If you're unsure of what style corresponds to what title, there's a lot of surprisingly accurate resources online.

Second, for anyone considering other types of European Nobility, remember that the systems do vary, even accounting for the simple variation in terms due to speaking different languages. Don't just assume the English system applies everywhere because there are variations and twists all over the bloody place. Especially since Royalty and Heraldric Types just made shit up as they went along in places.

*** Yep, if you're talking to a Duke you call him "Your Grace," if you're talking about him you refer to him as "The Duke of [wherever he is Duke of]". Same thing for the lower peerages, except it's "My Lord" instead of "Your Grace." Baronets and Knights are "Sir" unless you know them well (my boss is a knight and I just call him by his name, sometimes "Sir [first name]" when speaking about him to people who he doesn't know).

European is absolutely different, I think Viscount is very high up the ranks in some European systems, whereas in Britain it's second to bottom.

Also important to note that someone like Sirius won't take it seriously, but he would absolutely know the rules. Can't break them until you know them!

** Actually, they can be referred to as Lords. Most are called "Lord XXXX". Earl Mountbatten of Burma as Lord Mountbatten etc. So he could easily be 'Lord Malfoy' where his title is derived from a family name rather than a place.

This also occurs constantly in the UK nobility - Earl Mountbatten, as I mentioned above, is one title, The Marquess Curzon as Lord Curzon another, even Earl Spencer whom you mention is also known in conversation as Lord Spencer. The only exception to this is Dukes, who would not be referred to as Lord_Lastname (see what I did there?) But simply as their title. For example the Duke of Norfolk would simply sign a letter as Norfolk and be referred to as Your Grace, My Lord Duke or Norfolk by his superiors.

Heirs usually use a subsidiary title but the sons of Marquesses and Dukes have the title of Lord_firstmame_lastname as well, which may have added to the confusion.

I agree that in most fanfics, very little research has been done which does annoy me greatly.

The only way I can see the 'Heir' title working is if they introduce it expressly as a magical title which the Queen would know as she is aware of the Magical community.

** Aren't Muggle titles tied to the land because (traditionally) power and wealth grew from the land?

*Every wizard must grasp the truth: "Political power grows out of the tip of a wand."*

I suspect wizarding nobility would name their titles after fields of magic: there might be an Baron of Legilimency, an Earl of Broomsticks or a Duke of Transfiguration, who would have some authority over any use of that magic within Britain.

** Does this count as a Britpick? I too would like to see people use titles and use them right (mind you I've studied them independently as I study older civilizations) but all things considered I understand why people go the lazy route.

Side note: I'd imagine that if they (wizards) really wanted to do titles in the fullest, they'd probably stick to Roman titles. They also might not as they don't keep calling London Londinium so idk. I think a book using references from around Roman times would be interesting and could possibly fit considering Olivander's claimed age (store/family not the person).

*** The associated courtesy title would probably be Viscount something else - they tend to differ. So if your dad is Earl X, you'd be Viscount Y.

In this situation, however, Harry would be Earl Stroud because he's the eldest living male member of the family so would automatically inherit the title. He'd have an adult to act as "regent" - ie make decisions about the estate and finances until he reaches his majority.

In the UK House of Lords, that regent or proxy could not take the family seat to vote (when seats were inherited, they aren't now), so the seat would sit empty until the boy reached majority (21 in those days). Lots of fics have people acting as "proxys" for wizengamot votes for eg Harry, but this doesn't really happen in any political system I can think of. It's probably ok to do it in a magic government chamber though as you can say there's charms to make sure the proxy votes in the interest of the family and sticks to their values.

** Not to be a naysayer or anything, but I'm pretty sure there's also no such thing as Director of the DMLE or Minister for Magic in England. Or Hogwarts Transfiguration Professor, for that matter. I appreciate the point you're trying to make, but I honestly don't think that magical nobility is supposed to reflect IRL British society. Though, there are some fics that imply that “it works the same way as in the Muggle world.” In that case, I guess your Britpick would be fully applicable.

*** Ok but Director of the DMLE and Minister for Magic are counterparts to the Home Secretary and Prime Minister. Transfiguration professor is the wizard equivalent of a physics teacher - both deal with states of matter. The things JKR invented in general have recognisable counterparts in the real world.

There is no wizarding aristocracy in canon, but many other things work the way they do in the Muggle world but with a magical twist. So I don't think it's too big an ask to say "make this at least vaugely recognisable, because the style of the HP world is a magical twist on how things actually are in the UK."

The first scene with the mention of Lords (in the "canon universe") made all the typical mistakes of HP fanfic doing nobility - they were all just Lord Surname. But then the AU they end up in did it so close to correct, which was awesome. It wasn't exactly as it would be irl, but the difference was subtle enough that it could be put down to minor differences between Muggle and Magical worlds. So yeah, fantastic.
