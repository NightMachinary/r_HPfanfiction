I've read most stories, or at least tried to, Just suggest any preferably harry-centric stories, although that part is flexible. Definitely must be completed, I just abhor the feeling when coming to the end of a fic and having no closure, and Absolutely no slash. Bashing is fine, but should be kept to a reasonable, and preferably realistic, level, other than that i am relatively flexible. I've simply run out of stories to read. Most good length stories i have read and rereading is not doing it for me anymore.

Thanks for the help

** You have to check out linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and the sequels. It's not Harry-centric but you said that could be flexible. Harry is in it, but he has a minimal role as it's a next gen fic. They're great action/adventure stories that the author has planned out since the first book so everything is interconnected. They're really very good, though the first book is a bit slow. However, they get SO GOOD after that. There are also great original characters in it.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

******* Well, if they don't want to call the bot, they don't have to, right? But part of the reason I made it in the first place /was/ for mobile users. If someone else thinks the information is important, than they can call the bot using the !parent tag - which is what I did.

Going through 30 stories on mobile just to see tags would take /forever/. I think that automating the process wasn't a bad idea.

If people don't want the bot to work even if someone else does, they can just use the !ignore tag.

******** and that's what I told him.

If you don't want others to enforce the bot on you, add this little tag and it won't bother you.

I mean the bot just put out like 5 comments. That is a lot. That's why. Obviously we have different purposes of the bot in mind. For me the bot is a good way to get the /summary/ and that's what I primarily using when deciding to read a fic or not.

But let's say we agree to disagree.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
