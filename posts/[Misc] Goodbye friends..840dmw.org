Hello all friends like yargleblargle and taure and mergirl and also TE7 and skeletickles and MACY. I have yes unsubscribed from this forum, because it's very anti-LGBTQ, with LGBTQ posts and comments getting downvotes, and people in requests qualifying things with "Give me this story (EXCEPT NO GAY PEOPLE IN IT, I WON'T READ THAT!)". It also has problems with pedophilia and trying to trivialize abuse, and also has a lot of mean people in it who call names and are hateful, like everyone who keeps downvoting every single one of my posts no matter what it's even about. It is all very upsetting and disturbing, and I cannot keep coming here and seeing it all the time anymore.

So yes if you are my friend already we can PM and be friends still, but I will not be posting here or looking at anything this forum has to offer anymore.


** As a gay male -- yikes, I do hate calling myself that -- I most certainly did not take offense to anything that's been said on this sub. Even then, I'm certain they don't aim to offend when they put 'NO SLASH' in the title. They are most likely straight and don't wish to read male on male action. I sympathise. I get pissed when I read a nice Harry/Draco and Harry is all of a sudden a woman and has a pair of double D's and opening showing her /bobs and vagene/ to every boy, ghost, squid, house-elf in the school.

Can you understand now why they don't desire to read stuff they have no interest in? It's not to offend or discriminate, it's to save people's time. Some people can be, err, dick-ish about it, but that's humans in general.

Also, that's not the only issue. The real issue is that, well, slash fics are quite often shit. Like, sewer grade shit. It's so bad and cringey and everything is wrong. I haven't even got into explicit fics yet, either. Most slash is written by middle-aged (no offense, please) females who are living out their Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton fantasy. I have read quite a few fics where Harry just starts crying when someone sasses him. Like, what? It's like every gay trope is added into the fic, which makes it awful.

The third issue is that most slash fics make half the school gay. That's not how it is. If anyone who writes slash and does this is reading this, take this advice: one or two gay pairings and do not force them into the spotlight alongside the main pairing. Also, coming out is a gay person's moment. It's a massive thing that shouldn't be dismissed with, and I quote, “LOL you're scared that we hate gays? No, that's J/K VOLDEMORT was gay, you know. Mudbloods are the worst! Disgusting mudbloods... wanna make-out? But yeah, being gay is okay.”

Mini-rant over.

As for the other stuff, it's all fiction. No one is encouraging abuse or paedophilia. Please don't do that, it's a weak argument that does not belong here.

Edit: it's like 1 am, ignore mistakes. I was having a mental breakdown because I deleted half my fics and couldn't get them back.

*** As a 22 year old lesbian, I understand most of your points, thank you. But that doesn't mean that everyone should be downvoting any positive post that has to do with LGBTQ content! WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS. I understand that there should probably be either GOOD representation or NO representation at all, but how can I even get my good representation stories out there if everyone downvotes the posts to crap? They haven't even read my stories, so why are they letting crappy bad stuff from OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE make them downvote my good posts?

Why is that a weak argument? It's written into Reddit rules, and I am pretty sure it's even a law too. It's entirely possible to write things that are so horrible and offensive in a way that they're not allowed. Because they DO have that goal, of encouraging those things.

**** Welcome to Reddit, where people misuse the downvote function daily. Downvoting is meant to be done to posts that don't contribute to the discussion. No one does this correctly, I learned this ages ago and stopped caring whether a post of mine was -80 or +80. It hardly matters.

Just because people write about paedophilia or abuse, doesn't mean they encourage it. That's why it's a weak argument. I grew up in an abusive household, I know these authors are not trying to tell people to beat their kids, starve their kids, or neglect their kids. It's the same with paedophilia. It's a work of fiction. It's an expression.

It's like when you read about people with depression or who have committed suicide. The author isn't encouraging that, they're trying to teach people.

Even then, let's look at it in the worst way possible. A least the people are getting it out of their system with a fantasy and not to real life children or humans.

Try out [[/r/HPSlashFic/]] for your slash fics. The community there is pretty nice.

Lastly, don't leave because of a few bad eggs. It's the internet and we're all unknown to each other. Don't allow people you'll never meet make your time here bad.

***** Thank you for explaining things and helping me understand this forum. But there IS a line between just writing about something and encouraging something, and that is when you go into detail and you fetishize it and you're explicit, and I've seen that from people here before. So yes, SOME PEOPLE here are encouraging pedophilia. As for the abuse, people at least do keep trying to minimize it, and how bad it is. I've seen that too, people who go "It wasn't that bad" and stuff. And as a girl who grew up in an abusive household, that upsets me a lot to see.

Because the term/requirements for pedophilia differ in each state/country. Things that would seem pedophilic in New York might not be pedophilic in Tokyo or Frankfurt. Drawing pedophilic porn or even writing it is not strictly illegal as long as they are not real people. Again this differs from state to state, from country to country.

** D'ya know why I always request 'no slash pls' on my requests? Look at the tag proportions on Ao3 - the biggest category by far is "Harry Potter / Draco Malfoy". I am not gay. I do not /care/ if you are LGBTQ ect - it shouldn't /matter/ if you are. I just have my personal preference, and sifting through a pile of 'sexy dominant draco malfoy' fics while my established headcanon for the kid is 'wimpy wanna-be politician' is just not good for my brain.

** Well, people put "No slash" into their requests because that's not what interests them. Maybe they're straight and don't want to read about two men having sex, or maybe they just want to read Het fics at that moment, but I'm certain that 99% of these posts aren't anti-LGBTQ.

And I don't think I've really seen any promotion of pedophilia or trivializing of abuse. Most fics that feature abuse usually have Harry be pretty affected by the abuse, and I don't think I've ever seen a fic promotion on this sub that directly promotes sexual abuse towards children.

But anyway, I'm sorry that you feel that this sub has been toxic. It hasn't really been my experience, but if you felt that way, then I apologize for the people on this sub who made you feel hated.

*** The pedophilia crap was happening a few weeks ago, that's why the mods made a new rule to wipe them out! I can go back and find all those story posts, explicit, detailed, SEXUALIZING, of eleven year olds screwing, or ADULTS raping them and torturing them, and it's fucked up and I've seen those requests! Why do people here keep wanting to deny that it existed here?! Is it shame? Embarrassment? Outrage? What is it? Those existed here, those requests those stories existed! They still do, they just can't be posted about here anymore, BECAUSE IT WAS HERE BEFORE.

** I will not say I am not guilty of making requests like that, but I will say that I am in no way anti-LGBTQ. The main reason most people I assume (myself even) they say ‘no slashes' is to look for fics that are different from the usual or something specific.

I actually read many fics involving LGBTQ themes before: Harry/Draco, Sirius/Remus, Percy/Oliver, etc. Heck, there's even a Harry/Regulus fic that I am quite fond of. Overall, I enjoyed every single one of them. However, there's a point that it becomes almost cliche and I simply want to read something else, only to see a list of slashes with similar concepts. I find that there's more to life then just a couple finding love with one another. In fact, there should be love. But why not through other means? Why does it have to be romantic? I don't mind slashes, but there are stories that I would like to find that are not entirely focus on that subject.

Anyways, I am sorry that what you experience came to that point. People shouldn't downvote you that way. With the internet being the way it is, we have to deal with it and pick our battles. I only recently followed the forum as well, so I don't know the scope you have been through. My opinion might not mean much, but know that not everyone is entirely against you. I don't what else to say so I'll just say, I hope you find what your looking for and whatever you find makes you happy.

** Can't say I've seen the issues you are seeing in the subreddit. By and large people seem to put a bit of thought into their posts and are not kneejerk about too many things.

Although I suspect I might interpret some of the comments very different from how you did. I don't think I've seen anyone ask for their recs to be void of gay people. I have seen the request for het pairings (usually denoted as "no slash") or for cannon characters to not change their cannon sexuality. Those are both much more understandable requests than "No Gay people", as you put it.

The vote system here is a bit of groupthink, but that is kinda standard on reddit. Except for the subreddits that put explicit rules on voting (such as the debate subs where voting is explicitly about how well people have made their arguments), it is a bit of a popularity contest. Just got to take it for what it is: Feedback on how the community felt about your post. I've had a few I thought were really well articulated/written that got downvoted unfairly. Either people disagreed with me, or I didn't articulate my point as well as I could have. /shrug/

I'm assuming you intended this for public comment since you posted it publicly (instead of, you know, pming people directly) ;)
