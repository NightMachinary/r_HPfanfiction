I can see a muggleborn like Hermione trying to come up with a logical explanation for why Harry survived the killing Curse and discovering a shortcut to surviving the Killing Curse. Cue an electric shock curse like a defibrillator.


** As a side note, magic works conceptually in Harry Potter. If you're hit with the killing curse, you're dead. There's no magic that can bring you back. This isn't the actual world, where a stopped heart can lead to revival and the state of brain determines death.

To change this would be to change the fundamental nature of magic in Harry Potter, and I don't think it's a change for the better.

****** It's made a big deal of for a few reasons.

Firstly, to create a Horcrux, the death you use has to be a murder. There's a moral difference between killing and premeditated murder. As Slughorn says, when Riddle speaks of splitting his soul six times to make seven pieces, what he's actually talking about is six acts of premeditated murder. No wonder Sluggy didn't want anyone to know he may have accidentally encouraged this.

Secondly, the ritual you have to do. JKR has vaugely confirmed that this involves cannibalism which is probably the most taboo thing on the planet if you think about it.

Thirdly, it makes someone immortal to an extent. It's cheating death, against the laws of nature. Magic is tied into nature, the use of natural resources only in their potions and so on. The wizarding world is built on wood, stone and glass. They dont have plastic. They don't have processed food. They live much closer to the natural world than muggles, and death is an accepted part of wizarding life - they're all happy for ghosts to hang around Hogwarts, you don't hear anyone making an objection to using dead ingredients in potions (even Hermione who you think would be big on animal cruelty is happy to just smash up those beetles, pull off those rats tails and get on with her brewing...) They understand the circle of life, if you will, and they believe in an afterlife - it's clear from what Nick says to Harry after Sirius dies that in the wizarding world there /is/ somewhere for your soul to move onto after death. Cheating death in this way goes against the Wizard culture in a big way - it's the next great adventure.

They 100% do not. If your heart is completely stopped and you attach a defib it will instruct you to do compressions.

It will only shock if you have a handful of specific, irregular beats. If it is completely still a defib will not work.

**** Resuscitating from asystole involves rigorous CPR and vasopressors, usually epinephrine. Defibrillators and atropine were previously recommended but, I think around 2012, were removed for being ineffective. If your area still recommends defibrillators for resuscitation, I recommend you bring this issue up with oversight to comply with newer guidelines.

Edit: I found a source:

#+begin_quote
  *PEA/Asystole*

  *When a rhythm check by an AED reveals a nonshockable rhythm,* CPR should be resumed immediately, beginning with chest compressions, and should continue for 2 minutes before the rhythm check is repeated. When a rhythm check using a manual defibrillator or cardiac monitor reveals */an organized rhythm/*, a pulse check is performed. If a pulse is detected, post--cardiac arrest care should be initiated immediately (see Part 9). If the rhythm is asystole or the pulse is absent (eg, PEA), CPR should be resumed immediately, beginning with chest compressions, and should continue for 2 minutes before the rhythm check is repeated. The provider performing chest compressions should switch every 2 minutes. CPR quality should be monitored on the basis of mechanical or physiologic parameters (see “Monitoring During CPR” below).

  Drug Therapy for PEA/Asystole

  A vasopressor can be given as soon as feasible with the primary goal of increasing myocardial and cerebral blood flow during CPR and achieving ROSC (see “Vasopressors” below for dosing) (Class IIb, LOE A). Available evidence suggests that the routine use of atropine during PEA or asystole is unlikely to have a therapeutic benefit (Class IIb, LOE B). For this reason atropine has been removed from the cardiac arrest algorithm.

  Treating Potentially Reversible Causes of PEA/Asystole

  PEA is often caused by reversible conditions and can be treated successfully if those conditions are identified and corrected. During each 2-minute period of CPR the provider should recall the H's and T's to identify factors that may have caused the arrest or may be complicating the resuscitative effort (see [[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988#T1][Table 1]] and Part 12: “Special Resuscitation Situations”). Given the potential association of PEA with hypoxemia, placement of an advanced airway is theoretically more important than during VF/pulseless VT and might be necessary to achieve adequate oxygenation or ventilation. PEA caused by severe volume loss or sepsis will potentially benefit from administration of empirical IV/IO crystalloid. A patient with PEA caused by severe blood loss will potentially benefit from a blood transfusion. When pulmonary embolism is presumed or known to be the cause of cardiac arrest, empirical fibrinolytic therapy can be considered (Class IIa, LOE B; see Part 12). Finally, if tension pneumothorax is clinically suspected as the cause of PEA, initial management includes needle decompression. If available, echocardiography can be used to guide management of PEA because it provides useful information about intravascular volume status (assessing ventricular volume), cardiac tamponade, mass lesions (tumor, clot), left ventricular contractility, and regional wall motion.[[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988#B189][*189*]] See Part 12 for management of toxicological causes of cardiac arrest.

  Asystole is commonly the end-stage rhythm that follows prolonged VF or PEA, and for this reason the prognosis is generally much worse.

  ROSC After PEA/Asystole

  If the patient has ROSC, post--cardiac arrest care should be initiated (see Part 9). Of particular importance is treatment of hypoxemia and hypotension and early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of cardiac arrest. Therapeutic hypothermia may be considered when the patient is comatose (Class IIb, LOE C).

****** CPR is a more complicated issue predicated upon training. Mechanical ventilation is recommended for healthcare professionals capable of doing so. It is no longer recommended for the general public as it was found to have been done so improperly that it was more beneficial to have the chest compressions only. In addition, most hospitals have options for ventilation beyond mouth-to-mouth, which was another psychological and physiological consideration when changing the guidelines for the general public.

The takeaway is that it is still recommended, but only for the capable.

[[https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/what-is-cpr]]

(My previous source has a more detailed set of guidelines if you'd like to review some details. I would find a more up-to-date version though as the source I provided was to detail the changes to recommendations which were apparently in 2010, not 2012)

The imperious was used for brain dead people and the Killing curse for cases where it was clear they couldn't be helped but would have to suffer for a long time before they eventually died. It was originally thought of as mercy killing.
