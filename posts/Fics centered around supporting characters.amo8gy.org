  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948481/1/Blackpool][Blackpool]] is my favorite telling of Regulus Black's story (though it is an AU). I never would've thought that Regulus would be a more interesting character to follow than Sirius, but in this story, I wouldn't have it any other way.

I also really love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]] . I first got into it because I wanted to read more stories about Snape's year as headmaster, but then I became far more interested in Theophany Knapp. She's such a compelling character with a really in-depth backstory. She's one of my favorite OCs.

Same goes for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] and Theia Higglesworth, who is also one of my favorite OCs. Her dynamic working as a trainee Auror with an exasperated Harry is really fun, and I like how that dynamic evolves over the course of the story.
