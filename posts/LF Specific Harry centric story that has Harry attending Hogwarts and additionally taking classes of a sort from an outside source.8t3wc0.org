I believe the story was posted on AO3 since that is the site I normally use, but the only other option based on when I read the story is ffn. I read the story at some point between November 2017 and February 2018. I can't remember if it was incomplete or completed, but I'm pretty sure it was a relatively longer story. I'm pretty sure it was not a crossover.

It took place during Hogwarts and I want to say it was 4th year or later, but I'm not sure about that. Harry bought study or class materials from the ICW (or maybe just from the ministry but I really thought they were for international tests) and they were linked to his magic (or blood linked? I'm not really sure how they were linked). The materials included a way for him to regularly submit homework throughout the year without leaving Hogwarts. Only Harry could use the materials, or at least the grading portion of them, and Hermione kept getting jealous that she couldn't use the materials he paid for, or couldn't use the grading portion because of the cost.

I want to say that Harry got the idea from Neville, or he told Neville about it, and they both were taking additional classes. But I'm really not sure about this part.

Another possible facet was that Harry has a separate room within Gryffindor Tower, so the story may have had a wizarding politics or traditions aspect to it.

Unfortunately, I think what I can remember is a minor portion of story and I'm having trouble linking it to any specific story that I remember reading during the stated time period. None of my Google searches based on what I remember have turned anything up, so any help would be appreciated!
