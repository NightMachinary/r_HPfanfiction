:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am absolutely unable to remember the name of this fic for some reason but I cannot get it out of my head. Been searching for the past 2 days. Here's what all I remember:

1) The first chapter started off with a scene where Harry is experimenting with his magic in the Hogwarts express i think. He is shooting sparks out of the wand and tries to change the color of the sparks by focusing on his intent to do so, but it doesn't work.

2) Harry is an artist in this fic I think? He bumps into Tonks, she sees his drawings and they become friends over time.

3) Story starts in 4th year I think.

4) Harry isn't good at regular charms. But he is prodigious when it comes to old magic, finding it easier to utilize elemental magic. The descriptions of elemental magic were quite vivid and one of the best parts of that fic. Him learning and exploring that magic during the Triwizard Tournament.

5) He has a good relationship with Dumbledore.

6) I /think/ it was a story with Neville being the BWL but I could be wrong.

7) He gets this sort of magical deer familiar, that he healed utilizing water magic?

If anyone knows what I'm talking about please let me know the name of the fic. It had some really good character development and dialogues and I'd love to read it again. Hopefully the author hasn't deleted it from the site.
