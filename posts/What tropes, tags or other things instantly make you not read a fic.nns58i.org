What thing in fics are an instant turn off for you that you take one look at it and decide you won't read it? Just want to get an idea of what the average reader on reddit thinks.

Edit: Things that make me avoid a fic are snarry, Harems, unnecessary bashing, Harry being lord of a billion different houses and especially him being called Hadrian.


** I'm usually not really deterred by tags and ratings as I already filter for what I'm looking for but personally I don't read fem!Harry. Pairings are something subjective. Some ppl avoid certain pairings others only read het so I won't go into that.

Overall I really dislike it when they pitch up the abuse from the Dursleys a lot, especially sexual abuse from Vernon (only to make a point or to justify Harry hating Muggles and turning to Voldemort)

Misspelling names aka Kreacher as Creature or nicknames like Dumbles, Moldyshorts or Voldy. Usually equals a skip out from me.

People in fics having fights for plot reasons but there being no real motivations behind it --> bad characterizations in general. And with that I don't mean OC leaning characters but characters whose motivations just don't make sense. Write me a believable arch and I'll read it but don't just write Harry joining Voldemort because he wants to get away from the Dursleys. Give me a reason why this is his only option, why does he think it's the best solution etc. as an example

Same goes for bashing. Give me a reason behind their bad deeds. Overall I avoid bashing but I like fics with flawed characters.

Edgelord Harry. Goodbye.

Any pairing with Dobby basically. Tis a no-no.

Edit: in addition multiple Animagus forms. I just find that overkill

The lily bashing one was a time travel fanfiction, where they kept bashing Lily and having Hermione vs Lily stupid comparaisons and fights that just didn't make sense to me. I agree on the we don't know a lot about Lily point, and wouldn't mind reading something bashing IF they build a convincing story about it. The lily abandoning her child ones or where they make her "a spoiled b*tch" just because she refused to accept Snape's appology are the ones I avoid.

***** Yeah, turning someone who we are told is kind by basically everyone into a selfish, spoilt bitch just because she doesn't accept the apology of a friend who called her what amounts to a racial slur for defending him and then proceeded to hang out with people who were all for those views and would have been happy to see her die. Also eventually becoming a literal terrorist for a group all about killing people like her.

Lily is no saint bit Snape does not deserve any redemption. Even till his death he didn't show any remorse for abusing a poor kid because of his jealousy. Snape deserves to rot in hell, with absolutely no forgiveness whatsoever.

** There are several things that will make me ignore a fic without even giving it a chance, mostly because I have read too many bad fics with them:

- Harmony pairing. I know I'm probably missing some amazing fic, but I have seen too many "/Perfect Harry and Perfect Hermione are the perfect couple that can easily deal with anything because they are soooo smart and made for each other/" to bother finding the good fics in the middle of that.
- Bashing (especially Ron bashing). I'm not a fan of bashing in general so I don't read them. And since Ron is one of my favourite, any fics that bash him in particular is a big no no.
- Giant author's note. It's been a while since I have any of them, but if a fic has AN longer that the actual chapter, or worse AN in the middle of the text, I just drop it.
- The usual respect of English's rules. English is not my first language so I rather lenient when reading, but if a fic has 10 spelling mistake by sentence, constantly switch between tenses, or doesn't even have basic formating (good old 2000 words chapter that is just one giant paragraph), I'll drop it.
- Harem. I just hate it

​

Outside of that, there are also some tropes that, while they don't instantly make me drop a fic, annoys me so I'll less "patient" with the fic (I'm an annoying reader) such as Lordship, Pureblood culture, magical core . . .

*** I don't read Harmony stuff either, tried it in the early days if reading fics and got sick of it real quick.

Bashing tends to get way out of hand and make literally no sense in a lot of fics so I tend to avoid it too.

The lordships, pureblood culture and magical cores are annoying as well, I don't mind the magical cores as much as it never really gets in the way of much.

**** It may be a bit reductive, but bashing is just bad writing. It is also too often used to justify what I consider "bad relations". If your Draco only seems nice when compared to a bashed Ron, who is a pale copie of himself without any redeeming quality, then Hermione didn't find a "nice boyfriend", she just went from a toxic relation to a slightly toxic one.

As for Magical Cores, I can get past the fact that they are not Canon (and in my opinion, don't even fit the HP magic system), but I dislike how they are used in fics. Most of the time, it's just some story about how "/Harry as a bigger magical core than the others so he is better in anything he does/", which is boring (please make the MC deserve his power).

Mpreg, why is that even a thing?

MPreg. Get the fuck out of here with that nonsense.

FemHarry stories.

Stories where the female lead gets raped, especially in fics where the romance is a big part of it.

I have a few others that are close but not quite redlines, like the annoyance of how pretentious 'Hadrian' Potter is or how it takes a miracle for a 1st person POV to be good enough that I'll actually enjoy it.

Harry being called Hadrian is incredibly annoying, it's the most pretentious, arrogant and downright terrible name I have ever seen, it just gets on my nerves to the point where I will drop the story.

**** I generally do not like bashing, but I must admit that Ron bashing is something I don't mind too much, because I don'tlike him. However, I am very particular about /how/ people bash him.

The only way I can tolerate it, is if people take his already existing flaws, and ramp them up a bit. Evil, abusive, and scheming Ron are an insta drop for me.

Ron has deep flaws, there's no denying that. He's often inconsiderate, lazy, jealous and immature. Perhaps worst of all; he's insecure, which leads to him lashing out against the world, kind of.

I want to stress, that these flaws are very human, and we all have them to a degree. And mind you, I'm not saying Harry and Hermione are perfect, far from it.

I broke Ron and Hermione apart in my fic, but I took things a bit far. However, I do understand that Ron often is a fantastic friend, and that he always comes through in the end, so I fully intend to bring him to a place where he can fulfill his potential.
