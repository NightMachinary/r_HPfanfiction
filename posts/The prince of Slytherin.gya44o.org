** “Saving Connor” by Lightning on the Wave is the first in a series of seven fics(“The Sacrifices Arc”) that strikes me as sharing a number of tropes with Prince of Slytherin. It's WBWL, Slytherin!Harry with some fairly complex characters. It does get rather dark later on... - I haven't finished the series but I enjoyed the earlier entries linkffn(2580283)

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
