After seeing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j0shr9/fred_and_george_actually_act_like_two_separate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][this]] post by [[/u/bleepbloopbotz2][u/bleepbloopbotz2]], I just have to say that all this does is make it hard to read and give me a headache. I can understand it if it's an occasional thing, where they finish each other's sentences just as coincidentally as anyone else. Making it something that they always do, however, is unnecessary. Just make them talk like normal people! They /are/ normal people for wizards, at least!

And no, the fact that they make a good team does not prove that they can read each other's minds and therefore that twin talk is fine. All that says is that they're bloody twins and so they are close. Alicia, Angelina and Katie make a good team too, but I've never seen anyone triplet-talkify them.


** This is one of my pet peeves in fanfiction. Once or twice is ok if the situation asks for it, otherwise please stop, it's annoying as fuck and does not add humor to the story.

** Twin speak is usually done wrong in fanfiction. It doesn't mean they switch every word or so.... If it is done over other sentence or so it's fine, if it is every few words it is annoying.

*** And they only ever did it a handful of times in the series as well, not every fucking sentence as fanfictiom would have us believe.

*** Right, and about the only time I would have them alternating every other word is if they were trying to one-up the other to give praise to whomever they were speaking to.

*** Yeah, this would be fine. I know a set of triplets and when I'm talking to more than one of them at a time, I often have to keep turning back and forth between them because the one who started the conversation is not always the one to continue it the next sentence. I've seen that with people who are just friends too, actually, but I've never seen anyone switch every word.

**** yeah totally. I only ever do it when they're being obnoxious. Otherwise it's even annoying to write. It just isn't as funny as people seem to think

** "What"

"Do you"

"Mean ? This"

"Is"

"Peak comedy !" They said together.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ctw66v/twinspeak_done_right/][One of the all time top posts in this subreddit is someone explaining how to do twinspeak right.]] So plenty of people agree with you, but most authors haven't caught on, unfortunately.

** Also them pretending to be the wrong ones. That's actually annoying even in the original series. The whole seven Potters ordeal was supposed to be a serious thing and they had to dick around.

Don't even get me started on "Gred and Forge".
