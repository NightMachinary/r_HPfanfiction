I've been looking for some fics where Harry is evil and the fic doesn't try to justify his actions but I haven't been able to find any in the potter fandom. And please don't rec Nightmare Man or Too Young to Die. Those fics are definitely evil Harry but the former has a lot of [[http://rationalwiki.org/w/images/e/e3/Respectful_Hitler.png][this]] going on on the good side and the consequences of murderizing people are laughed off most of the time while the latter is a Harry with a noblish goal driving his actions. If evil Harry's gonna have a goal, I'd rather it be something cool, like immortality, the subjugation of the magical world, or the annihilation of every magical with brown eyes. Something that isn't altruistic in any way, you know?

The closest I've coming in fanfiction in general is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864168/1/Amenaza][Amenaza]] where the protagonist is rather horrifyingly evil and self-serving, the good guys aren't lol greater good Bumbledores and the reasons the MC is evil barely matter once you're even a quarter of the way into the fic.

[I edited your reply to fit my understanding of your intent. If you meant something different, please let me know]

It wasn't an argument, it was innuendo. The joy of innuendo is that interpretation is up to the listener. If you choose to read my post as a suggestion that 'all magical children are invulnerable to psychological trauma', I can't stop you.

That wasn't my intent, though.

All I said is 'Harry may be well-adjusted despite all he went through as a child due to some reality-bending influence.'

For instance, perhaps the soul of his mother was imbued within his blood, such that he never felt neglected or abused. Any other magical child would have gone full-bore black-cloud-of-angst, but Lily's protection was keeping Harry sane and stable.

******* On the contrary- I hate that, too. I'm a big supporter of the idea that magic has rules and that we can technobabble (or I guess meta-babble) our way to something that explains why unusual events in the books happened as they did.

****** His strong sense of morality is more difficult to explain though. Generally, when you have a strong morality, it means that your family transmitted it to you, and then, you will begin to take the context into account when confronted with reality, it's when you figure out that just following some rules you learnt isn't enough and that you actually have to think about it.

Someone older could have picked up some morality on the way and learn those things by himself, but I have trouble seeing a teenager do that work all by himself.

Harry put the others before himself and has a strong sense of duty from day 1. His strong family values can be explained by circumstances, but the rest?

******* It's possible to get a strong sense of morality from one's relatives giving an opposite example, though. It takes having something else to compare it to and deciding that it's better to do what others are doing rather than what one's relatives are doing, what with how what one's relatives are doing feels to them, but it is possible even if not the most likely thing in the world.

Now, one could use the counter-argument that since the Dursleys' behaviour never got exposed everyone in the vicinity was on it and as such there were no decent people for Harry to observe, I admit. It's a very unlikely possibility, however, as having not a single person with strong morals in a whole neighbourhood is rather improbable and with only one person of that ilk the difference would have been that much more visible to a kid so they would be that much more likely to pay attention to it.

Though, yes, obviously in the original story Harry is a person with strong morals only because it is fitting for a protagonist of a fairy tale.

******** Fair enough, I can see your point. The thing though, is that in this case, you won't have a model (that should've been transmitted to you usually by your family) when confronting yourself to the world so your moral sense can develop. I think it has to make it more difficult, although certainly not impossible.

Then again, a lot of people are born in such an environment and turn out alright, as mentioned somewhere else, but again, they're older. It will take them longer to achieve it than if they had been raised in a sane environment.

That's what I think though.

  Horrible, horrible DLP-inspired crackfic. Easily my worst work ever. Features Evil!Harry/Cannibal!Luna/Confused!Laurasia. Don't know who Laurasia is? Neither does anyone else. You will regret reading this as much as I regret writing it.

** Evil Harry is surprisingly hard to find. Honestly, you would get better luck as a lovable antihero who is actually a terrible person.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

linkffn(Circular Reasoning)

Good enough to root for, but in hindsight, definitely bad people by most points of view.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
