:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a Hermione/Draco story that I read and now cannot find it again. The premise is that Hermione marries Draco to save him from Azkaban I believe. They need to consumate the marriage and we find out Draco is a virgin because he is cursed for intercourse to hurt. He never actually had sex with Pansy. Narcissa was the one that accidentally cursed him because Bellatrix took Draco when Narcissa was still pregnant (like Bellatrix took over the pregnancy).

Anyways if anyone knows the fic and can link it I would be grateful thanks!


** linkao3(The Sentence by Sadmuse (Aleigh75))

This is the fic that taught me not to trust tags. I found it when I was looking for Harry/Luna stories, and even though it's clearly a Hermione/Draco story, I thought there would at least be enough Harry/Luna to interest me, since it had that tag. There wasn't. As I recall, Harry and Luna barely appear in the story, and their relationship is just a thing that exists without really being seen in or having an effect on the story.
