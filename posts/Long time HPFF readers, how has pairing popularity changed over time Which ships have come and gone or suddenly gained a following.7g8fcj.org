** Well it might just be an impression, but I feel like the Harry/Tonks pairing has completely disappeared. (I guess it had its peak after OOTP was released.) I don't remember seeing any - decent - long fic featuring those two the past few years.

Edit : There's definitely a few now that I checked, but it's not as much as there used to be. A lot of them are harem stories, too, sadly...

*** Completed recently, worth reading linkffn(12188150)

However, it certainly still falls under the 'more harem than non-harem' that a lot of the less popular ships falls under :(

*** I'm writing one now. I like this pairing but only when both Harry and Tonks are adults - I just can't buy a 22-year old woman being seriously interested in a 15-year-old. There are fewer fics with the two as adults so while the fic originally started off in my mind as Harry/Ginny, I changed course when I realized that Tonks could fit well, if not better, in the story.

** I scroll through the "Just In" page on FF.net usually before work and I see a whole lot of Harry/Draco stories. Mind you, I'm not a long time HPFF reader, having only started in 2015, but I see a ton of fics with that pairing.
