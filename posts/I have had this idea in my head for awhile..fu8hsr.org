** Well, first, what kind of powers do they have? If they're muggles, you're talking about ISIS - and if they somehow went after wizards, they would be toast in short order, having no defence against magic. If they're wizards, you basically have a reskinned Voldemort or Grindelwald.

So, you need to think of something that makes them a threat to the muggle world and the magical world. Something unique that doesn't look like magic, but can stand up to magic.

But... World War 3? Sorry, but if WW3 happens, it's game over. Whatever the third party does afterwards is piddly shit compared to wiping out most of humanity and wrecking technology, which means muggles just stopped being a factor. So, the best you can do is some limited brutal conflict, and hey - we have that going on in spades right now, and no one cares enough about it to unite. (If you do want WW3, you've got Mad Max 4.0 - now with magic!)

*** A form of technology combined with magic. They have magic-suppression fields, and technology that can stop bullets in place. A third world war AGAINTST the third party, not WW3 as in the end of the world. Although nukes are used, (E.G. Diagon alley is Dirty bombed.), the world does not end. They want to claim Earth for themselves, which is why they use nukes sparingly.

**** Uh. You can't use nukes "sparingly" unless you're a terrorist group with no base to retaliate against. If, as a country, you use nukes, everyone uses them against you. Also, to use nukes you need a huge industrial base. To develop technology that combines with magic, you need a huge industrial and magical base. To have a shot at conquering the world through warfare, you need both and a huge population base.

So, where does this army grow? Where does it spring up? And why didn't anyone realise what was happening before the magitech tanks rolled?

Also, dirty bombing Diagon Alley? That's dirty bombing London. As in the capital of the UK, who has a nuclear deterrent. Any country who does that just started a nuclear war.

***** I haven't really thought all of this through, although your quesions are helping me to think creativeley, so thank you.

It's magitech, so they would be both invisible and intangible. This third party has existed for quite sometime. I haven't really thought of an origin story yet, but they have existed invisibly in Africa. I really don't know what a good origin story/motivation would be.

****** So, if they've been around for some time, they would have had to escape notice from muggles and wizards. That's a little difficult. But most importantly, once they start fighting a war, they tend to get noticed.

Are they wizards or muggles? A mixture? Did they breed the muggles out in their hidden realm?

******* Not a mixture, that would be a half-blood. What they are, I am not sure.

******** I'm speaking of their society - are they made up of wizards, or of muggles and wizards?

********* Both, technically. But don't tell them that, or you might end up lobotomized into a robot. I still haven't figured out exactly why they hate muggles and wizards.
