In the epilogue, Luna predicted that Sal will give birth to Arthur sometime in the future, who will then be sent back to the past.

I'm curious how y'all think that will pan out. If so, who do you think Uther Pendragon (Arthur's dad, as he mentioned in the epilogue) was? And how would Sal react, knowing that his son had been sent back to the past to his death?
