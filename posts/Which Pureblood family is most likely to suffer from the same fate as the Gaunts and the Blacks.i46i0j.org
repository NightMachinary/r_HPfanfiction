IMO, the Crabbe's and the Goyle's. Crabbe and Goyle seem to be as cruel and sadistic as the Gaunts were before they died off. Their fathers (who are marked Death Eaters) are even worse.


** Well, the Crouches, if Barty&Barty didn't have cousins with the surname.

*** I think Dumbledore said that Fudge just ended the last of a pure-blooded family when he allowed the Dementor to Kiss Crouch Jr, so you're right.

**** Somehow, I doubt that Crouch Jr. would procreate after the shitshow that had just happened. So either way, they were over. Odd choice of words on Dumbledore's part, considering.

** Unless Susan's husband takes her name, the Bones family ends with her.

Same with Daphne with the Greengrasses.

The Dumbledores end with Aberforth as well, since he's a grumpy old bastard unlikley to have kids.

I think Mad-eye was the last Moody as well, for another pure-blood family line ended.

** If you mean they ended up so evil that they literally killed themselves off, then I can see the Malfoys going down this road. Maybe not in Draco's time, but at least several generations later.

In fact, I think the Malfoys are the most likely to end up exactly like the Gaunts. i.e., inbred & poor. Yeah, they have money now, but judging from the way Lucius just casually spends money like there's no tomorrow, I can see their galleons just slowly draining away over several generations.

That said, I haven't read/seen the Cursed Child. So I don't know what Scorpius gets up to.
