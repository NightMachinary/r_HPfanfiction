Are there any fanfiction that focus on the rebuilding of magical Britain after the wars? Growing the population, healing the rifts in society, rebuilding Hogwarts and Diagon Alley, rooting out corruption in the Ministry, that sort of thing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends are healing the society by violently removing Voldemort remnants.

*** I mean, not a whole lot of rebuilding goes on in this story. It's fantastic and sets the stage for fixing a lot of systemic problems with magical Britain, but most of what happens on camera is destructive. It fits the rooting out corruption bit, but not much else.

That said, OP should totally read if they haven't. Just managing expectation.

(Also, an actual rebuilding story that takes place between the end and the epilogue would go straight to the top of my reading list. How the Ministry works given the political situation would be fascinating.)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** My story "Divided and Entwined" deals with rebuilding after the war in its last 27 chapters (of 67). Reforming the political system, dealing with splinter groups on both sides that don't want to stop fighting, trials for the criminals, fending off foreign interference, and so on.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, the castle is in ruins. Why rebuild a castle? Why not just create another school? It can't be that hard - right?

** linkffn(Strange Reflections) Harry rebuilds Hogwarts almost single-handedly, Hermione writes up a number of laws to fix the corruption, and Harry is reluctantly made Chief Warlock (Only reluctant on his part, his appointment was unanimous.)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
