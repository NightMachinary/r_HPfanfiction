Hey guys, im lookin for Slytherin Harry fics, but i have some prefferences.First of all NO SLASH.If the fic have pairings, i would like Harry with someone different than Ginny or Hermione.No Dumbledore bashing. ( I really have bad experiences with it in fics, most of the ones i've read were very bad written and Dumbles were just and evil old man, so no bashing with him, for other characters im okay.Nothing of the sort WBWL.Must be somewhat long so i can distract myself for quite some time.Most of the fics that i've readed just show Slytherins as a bunch of politicals or prejuriced junior death eaters, so i would like something that can show this bad side of the house but also have just normal children so Harry can make friends and not just political connections.I would like an genious(Does't have to be a god of magic, just a student that exceeds very much in some parts of the magic) or at least above average wizard for Harry.

I've already read They shook hands ( All the years that are avaliable) and A chance encounter and it's sequel, and are two fics that i love.

I've also read, Magcal relations and Lionsnake chronicles.

BONUS: I love how Theodore Nott is described in most fics, as the slytherin quiet child that is reading most of the time, so i would like very much if he becomes friends with Harry during the fic.

That's it !

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I know it's really not what your looking for, probably the opposite, but I'd really recommend Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. It's ongoing with the occasional update, generally well-written (Better than most) and although it's WBWL, they do attempt to get along at times, even if it doesn't last. It may seem like the same old bashing fic, but it's structured so well that there's genuine reasoning behind it all. Definitely a favourite of mine.
