I just read a story by Pheonix Dawn on ff.net called Effects and Side Effects. It was really good. are there any other good ones similar?

not neccessarily the female harry part, but the op harry, manipulative dumbledore, independant harry part.

(also i've already read Vance McGill's stuff on there so don't suggest his stories please)


** Great story hoping the author comes.back and finishes it.
