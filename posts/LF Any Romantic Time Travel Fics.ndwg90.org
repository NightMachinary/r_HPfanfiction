  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  After having died at the hands of Voldemort during the Battle at the Ministry, Harry is sent back fifty years in a different universe. He doesn't know why, but he gives himself a reason. This is my first attempt at a story. This includes a female Tom Riddle. Harry will be different than his canon self. You've been warned.Tags will be updated as the story develops.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.

#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

*** Seconded! Don't let the odd pairing drive you away, this is a well-written fic that gives a proper redemption to some of canon's more grey-ish characters. There's a good balance of fluff and plot, and the romance is veeeeeery slow-burn, as advertised, and when it develops it does so in a very grounded, emotionally believable way. Give it a try!
