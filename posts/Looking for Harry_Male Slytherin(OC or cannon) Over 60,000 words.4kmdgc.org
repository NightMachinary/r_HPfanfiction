Does anyone know a well written Harry/Slytherin guy story. I've read alot on fanfiction.net about harry and malfoy or harry and Blaze. What I dont like reading (Or would prefer not in this stoy): Creature fics,Twin Harry,fem Harry, next gen or post Hogwarts. Thank you for your help


** Uh... to clarify, OP, since SeekerOfTruth apparently decided you meant 'genfic with Harry/Slytherin friendshipping', do you mean that, or Harry/'Slytherin guy' romantic slashfic? Because I would have assumed the latter from your post, though it's not super clear which you meant.

I mean, it's a fair request either way, but we're practically drowning in slashfic as it is, and I'd be amazed if you couldn't find one with Slytherins in it. HBP was almost blatant with the Draco/Harry subtext, considering the sheer amount of time Harry spends brooding over the man and wondering what he's doing. It's not /healthy/, but it was the closest thing to a realistic shipping we got out of canon, to be honest. The actual canon ships just sort of... happened, with no real buildup or interesting conflict, and probably could have been cut with no real impact on the story. Romance writer, JKR ain't.

*** Yes I meant romance. I'm very picky about what I read and I've read MANY stories for it. I've scrolled through over a hundred-fifty pages of Harry Potter Fanfiction over 60k words and read the ones that I found interesting. What i'm looking for right now is stories that are probably from other side sites that I dont look at or stories that did not have the paring or talked about the pairing in the summary. I'd prefer an OC story because I've actually never found one of those. Also I'm not sure if SeerOfTruth misread my post (sorry I dont mean to affend you in ay way) but the things I listed were things I didnt want in the story, such as fem harry and twin stories. Maybe I should have worded it difrently

**** For a great Harry/SlytherinOC you should read Tempus. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756/chapters/4040178#bookmark-form]]).

I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OCDraco romance. Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The Draco in this is Canon Draco's great grandfather, and is very much an OC.

Also I'd recommend searching Ao3 for fics because it has a lot more and a lot better stuff than ffn for slash pairings. Also, just my opinion, the site is so much easier to use!

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

** Linkffn(choices by random-fruitcake04) is a seer ron story where he's a Slytherin. Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) is a fem!harry fix where she pretends to be a guy; I don't know whether that's what you want or not. Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) is my favorite "normal" slytherin harry fic.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
