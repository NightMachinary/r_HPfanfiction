EDIT: The thing is, he's still normal Harry.

Horcruxes (horcruxs? Horcruxi?) Give off a really evil, bad, dark feeling, and Harry grew up with one in his head! The reason everyone at Privet Drive avoided him was because he literally made them feel like they were living in a horror movie lol, and at Hogwarts it wasn't as obvious because he was the hyphen-boy.

Like I love Harry, but thinking about it he was probably /really/ creepy. Like, bright emerald eyes (aVaDa KeDaVeRa OrBs-), pale af (at least in his earlier years), skinny/gaunt, messy black hair, a permanently raw scar, and was always in ratty clothes. Ron is oblivious af with this stuff so he ignored the weird vibes, and Hermione did for a bit, but after Harry saved her she stopped caring (because he's actually cool).

Like I'm sorry but literally NO ONE but these two regularly wanted to hang out with him, like at the beginning there should have been way more kids that wanted to be his friend.

Lmao this kinda silly but hey, Halloween ðŸŽƒ ðŸ¤ª.


** 1)Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

It litterally fits your prompt perfectly! Basically Harry is this weird eldritch creature as a kid were even Voldemort is like wtf dude stappp

2) The Eyes by Shadenight123

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..." A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

The Dursley's send Harry to the asylum as a kid because he's weird as shit

3) Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails by Oceanbreeze7

We must not look at goblin men,

We must not buy their fruits:

Who knows upon what soil they fed

Their hungry thirsty roots?

Lily and James basically want to throw him out the window because he's creepy like Damien

** linkffn(12692794) - This gave me full body chills the first time I read it, very savage primal feel to what comes later with 'muggle' or 'pagan' magic employed to hold back something awful.

linkffn(2452681) - Hellraiser crossover, you don't need to know the fandom. Great horror one-shot but not directly linked to the horcrux

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
