I donno if a fic like this exits or not. If it doesn't feel free to try to write it out. The wizarding world is the reverse of muggle world in sense of responsibilities of sex. In essence it is female dominated. I've read a fic in which they just changed the gender of everyone nin another dimension but not exactly what I'm hoping for. Basically females have all the positions of power. Do comment if there is such a fic.


** The firefly trilogy i think it's name was? I'm sleepy af but when i wake up I'll link it if you didn't find it.

Basically it was a witch ruled magical world where men were forced to marry more than one woman to control them, and the witches held more power than wizards
