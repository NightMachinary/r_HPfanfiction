Angsty, fluffy, or both. “Lay low at Lupin's” plot is my fave. ❤️


** Are you new to the ship? A few pretty well-known authors have some good lay low fics but I tend to assume anyone that's been into the ship for a while has already read them... some that I think pop up often on rec lists: linkao3(3895552; 6151897; 910671; 659189; 632209; 949735; 5745934; 602096)

It might also be worth posting this to [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] as well. Most of the time this sub tends to at best sort of ignore posts about slash pairings and at worst, well.

**** Oh man, I'm more than a little jealous! If you're interested in fics set when they're younger/haven't read it yet, I definitely, definitely recommend [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]]. It's a fantastic fic in its own right and I personally thought it was really cool to see the influence it had on other, later fics.

Also, if you haven't stumbled upon it yet, I've found [[http://wolfstarwarehouse.tumblr.com/reclists][Wolfstar Warehouse]] to be a really nice resource. It has got a decent amount of links to older fics that aren't on ff.net or ao3 and has a big masterlist of fic recommendations. It also has a bunch of more specific, smaller lists and a list of some other people's/wolfstar authors' own rec lists.

**** You should also check old posts in the subreddit by searching for 'wolfstar' or 'remus/sirius' =). There's a lot of really good past recs.

I would definitely start reading those that [[/u/vitorcine]] mentioned first, though.

  Bravery, sometimes, is the ending just as much as the beginning. Remus, Sirius, and a series of choices. Or, a love story---backwards and forwards.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11088406/1/Tea-and-Empathy][Tea and Empathy]] is a friendship fic, but it fits the "lay low at Lupin's" part of your request.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivor's Guilt]] series and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/388096][Sorry about the blood in your mouth]] series also have the "lay low" plot.
