** I only discovered fanfiction about three years ago and I haven't noticed any particular changes except that Tom Riddle seems to be a more popular character now. People are still complaining about the same things. I'm told that people used to review more and that may be true - the stories with vast numbers of reviews seem to be very old and often not very good. Plus a lot of people read on their phones and I think it's more troublesome to review that way. I doubt there's a guarantee of popularity but using popular characters and pairings with plenty of sex and setting it in Hogwarts would be a good start.

But if you are serious about writing and not just about popularity (and let's face it, 'popularity' on the internet is a fickle and abstract thing), then you should write the stories /you/ want to tell and the fics /you/ want to read.

** Based on tallies, people want to read things involving Harry, Hermione, Draco, Snape.

As far as tags go, be brief and precise. Describe your story without spoiling it. If your material is good, readers will come regardless of tags.

** As far as I can tell, it's still more of the same. Are you trying to write a story for the specific purpose of being popular?
