Some good stories where Harry is like someone's apprentice. Like I mean he's in Hogwarts learning from Dumbledore or something. I would prefer if it's complete or at least being updated regularly and please let the grammar and shot like that be good. I don't really care about pairings or anything but if it's slash no explicit sex scenes. Bonus points if he's Olivanders apprentice that would be awesome.


** Linkffn(blood crest) is probably darker than you had in mind, but I've really enjoyed it.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Um well you said no explicit but my suggestion has it. But honestly it's an awesome fic especially considering how long it is. And it's not every chapter when it starts or anything.

  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP! SLASH

**** Thank you so much for the suggestion but I honestly don't know if I can stomach the thought of Harry and Snape no offense if you like it just not something I can get behind. But seriously thanks for the suggestion

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
