** !linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) is a good one. After being kicked out of Hogwarts in 1995, Dumbledore refuses to idly sit by while Voldemort is gaining power and Fudge is sticking his head in the sand, and he gets Grindelwald to help him.

  Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.

** One of my favorite portrayals of Grindelwald is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]]. The fic has some interesting (and grim) worldbuilding about his methods and motives, though of course it's different from /Fantastic Beasts/ canon due to the fic being written long before the movies were imagined. Personally I love the chapters in "Twist of Fate" that focus on him and his allies.

If you want to quickly see what Grindelwald is like in the fic, the first scene focused on him is at the end of chapter 4 and continues into chapter 5.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.

** I like linkao3(18009311), unfortunately it feels like incomplete work, it somehow ends in the middle of the story (yes, it has been formally finished, but it feels kind of hasty job).

  Gilderoy Lockhart landed himself in St Mungo's after his 'Cornish Pixies' class. Where can a headmaster now find another Defence teacher, one who's knowledgeable beyond doubt, willing to face the curse on the position, and available to start in a few days? In Nurmengard, that's where.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
