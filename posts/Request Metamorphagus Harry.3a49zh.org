*** While true, simply searching for a Metamorph!Harry story will just lead you to crap.

The good stories with Metamorph!Harry are the ones that aren't written just to write a metamorph!harry and where said gimmick certainly isn't a focus. Therefore, if anyone were to suggest fics with a metamorph Harry, that would be bloody fantastic.

And while we are at it, if there's anyone out there that know of any fics where the OoTP scene with Ron being made prefect is changed to Harry being made prefect and the effects (particularly on his friendship with Hermione/Ron, I would think), then post that too.
