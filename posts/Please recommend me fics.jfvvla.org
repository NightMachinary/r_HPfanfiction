Hey guys, I'm in a bit of a slump when it comes to my writing so trying to motivate myself by reading fics. I don't want a huge commitment (read: not full seven years like epics) but still long enough to get invested in the characters. I've been enjoying time travel fics recently but I like it when they have a strong plot element as most of them have a lot of fluff (some fluff is okay!) and/or strong sexual themes which isn't really my thing. Open to try something else though! Thanks :) (I don't mind self promotion either!)

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** 1)The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont:

Summary: Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else seems to remember her. Not only is Sally-Anne no longer at Hogwarts; there is no trace of her in the school records, and the professors claim she never existed. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

It's 11 chapters well written and unique (gen)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

2) The Serpent and the Mirror » Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort?

10 chapters well written character and plot driven story with an amazing twist at the end. (Gen)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror]]

3) Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash complete and novel length fic.

It deals with themes of ptsd growing as a person and vampire + Druid Friendship it's 50 chapters so It might be a bit long for you but I highly recommend this story of friendship integrity and survival it's very well written and a great way to invest in two characters who went through a lot. (Gen) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]

4) The Eyes » Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see.

Excerpt from story: "They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

If you are interested in supernatural/mystery stories I highly recommend this story for you. I guarantee you that it's probably unlike any story you would've ever read. It's only 14 chapters but you really get invested for the characters. (Gen)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/]]

5) The Unforgiving Minute » Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours Action packed 10 chapter Time travel story...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]]

6) Never Gone, Never Forgotten, and Never Letting Go by Eladriewen

After Sirius' death, Harry begins to have awkward dreams at night, and during the day his mind plays tricks on him. Trying to solve the mystery, Harry returns to the Death Chamber that holds the dais, and discovers something he never expected. (Gen)

A 14 chapter good suspense and mystery story

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2009628/1/Never-Gone-Never-Forgotten-and-Never-Letting-Go]]

7) The Sum of Their Parts » For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone (Gen)

A well written tight packed adventure friendship story 11 chapters.

8) I must be your favourite, right? By FlyingLizards Summary: Tom Riddle meets a strange boy who roams lost in Hogwarts. The legend of Slytherin's lost boy; someone who appears and disappears in the blink of an eye, all throught history, had never really caught his attention Until said boy appeared to him.

A story were Harry accidentally becomes part of the Hogwarts lore were he time travels without his own volition going back in time to the founders and other eras gaining the reputation of the “lost boy” it was really nice seeing him interact with the founders. Its a slow-burn slash so if that bothers you this might not be for you but for now it's more plot based and a unique time travel story. (Slash)

Hope you enjoy these stories all of them are complete and different except the last one which is a work in progress.
