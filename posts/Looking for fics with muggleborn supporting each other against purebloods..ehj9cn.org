** Can it be tragic, like as in The Sinister Man's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) )?

**** Cool. The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) has two, the aforementioned tragic example and a pro-muggleborn movement inspired by its contemporary, the irl Civil Rights Movement, that Voldemort's first rise served as reactionism against.

***** Thank you. It's been a long time since I've read it and I appreciate non manipulative Dumbledore stories.
