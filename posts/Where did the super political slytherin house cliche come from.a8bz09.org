** A few things I think.

Our first real interaction with them is Draco being kinda bratty. Then our second interaction with Slytherin is Draco being kinda bratty. And that interaction is there we get the whole "some families" and "wrong sort" and practically the offer of an alliance.

We also know that death eaters were working in various levels of the ministry and even the Hogwarts board of governors.

This isn't to say that Slytherin=death eater, but many of those highly political Slytherins we see in this fanon trope /are/ family of death eaters. And the one Slytherin child we see most in canon /is/ Draco, so their behaviors are likely modeled off what we saw from Draco.

**** Draco acts nothing like the fanon political genius eleven year olds that speak in layers of subtext and obey super strict formal etiquette rules cliche though. I'm not sure how you could go from Draco acting like a spoiled brat to that.

** They represent the "British Establishment" and most Americans don't know what that means, they assume it's like our Establishment (rich people and people who are into politics). Instead it has almost entirely to do with birth. Imagine your class (in the UK) were like your race (in the US): you can't leave the one you're born into. For an example of this, I just finished Laura Thompson's /A Different Class of Murder/. It's true crime. It's entertaining. Nobody involved has any money, in fact half of them are on welfare. But they're all earls and shit.

This is symbolized in the stories by Tom Riddle's mother's family being so poor Tom Riddle's father (who is looking at their subculture from outside) calls them tramps, but still being important as far as pureblood wizards are concerned,. Also things like the Black/Lestrange/Gaunt family tree tapestry thing; if you "marry wrong" you're disowned.

** They're supposed to be the "cunning and ambitious" house. When people think of "cunning and ambitious" they think of politicians, so they assume all Slytherins must act like politicians do.

** I've always wondered about Slytherin, basically "cunning and ambitious" are not exactly positive traits. They can be, of course, if your main trait is say, being kind or intelligent and hard working, then you can put cunning and ambitious to good use. But what does it mean if a person's defining trait is being cunning and ambitious? It's like they have a whole house of ppl with questionable morales.

Same goes for Hufflepuff, tbh, true and loyal? Does that mean that Huffelpuffs cannot be of value on their own? Because their value only shines in combination with the ppl they choose to align themselves with. It's a bit of a weird concept.

*** I've always looked at the cunning and ambitious to be focused on having high goals and being intelligent enough to work to realize those goals. Like someone understanding how to use different angles and means to get things done, not necessarily shady.

Hufflepuffs I might be wrong but I thought it was loyal and hardworking like they value working hard at whatever they do and being loyal to their friends/whoever they think deserve it.

**** Yeah but what are those goals? Griffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are intelligent, kids of these house can also have high goals and achieve them, they can be successful, but the reach for success is not what defines them. Then there are those who are defined by the desire to be successful more than anything else. It does sound shady to me to be honest.

Ah I think I forgot the hard working part with Hufflepuff. Sounds like they are not especially talented but make up with being hard working and down to earth, doesn't it? While that does sound positive, it's also a little bit condescending, isn't it? Those who aren't that bright but are willing to work for it are sorted into Hufflepuff. What does that do with the self-esteem of the Hufflepuff kids, I wonder?

***** I never thought about hufflepuff that way before but damn that's kinda depressing for them. As to the slytherins I definitely see your point and think it might also be personality traits as well as how they'd go about achieving their goals like griffendors are probably more out going and probably the I'm doing this and I don't care what others think, ravenclaws more focused on a pursuit of knowledge/learning and slitherin being reserved and the type to really look before they leap. Hufflepuff...... I really don't know what to say about them except I think there was a part in canon where hufflepuff takes all the rest
