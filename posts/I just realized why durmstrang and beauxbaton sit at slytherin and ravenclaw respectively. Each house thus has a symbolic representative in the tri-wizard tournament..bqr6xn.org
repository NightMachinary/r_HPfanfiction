** Well, yeah, that's the meta reason probably, though honestly screw assigned seating for meals- not only did it likely help divide the houses further but it didn't do the tournament much good when the supposed goal was better international relations, then they go on to limit those interactions.

*** You mean free seating besides feasts is fanon? It's extremely common among interhouse friendships+ in fics and well-defined to the point where I assumed it was canon.

**** Actually since Harry only has friends from Gryffindor (other than Luna), it's less likely that he noticed when someone sat on the other house table. It can be canon for all we know.

**** It happens more than once in canon, so I don't think it's an unreasonable assumption to make.

** Eh, probably.

Most likely Karkaroff told his students to sit with the Slytherins because they were the "right sort" i.e. purebloods. Even in hiding I highly doubt Karkaroff ever stopped believing the pureblood supremacy crap.

As for Maxime? She most likely told her students to sit with the Ravenclaws because they were the smart house, politically neutral for the most part and the ones most likely to give her students respect and some of them might even know French.

*** I am a little surprised by their sitting though. Considering how fast some of them were to complain about the cold, you would think they would have preferred to sit at the table nearest to the fire (Gryffindor if I remember well) rather than a middle one.

And as far as I'm concerned, the decision of their teacher could be something really well thought like "neutral, studious house", but also something completely random like "they are the blue house, we are blue, sit there".

**** Gryffindor is between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, as I recall. With Hufflepuff and Slytherin being at the ends. I can't remember where it's mentioned though, so I can't check.

***** Ah, I had the movie placement in mind so Gryffindor and Slytherin at both ends and Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff in the middle. Since the book placement is different, I would guess the best bet to find it would be in the chapter where Harry enter the Great Hall for the first time, So PS (chapter "The Sorting"), I will check it at the first occasion.

****** In the first book (from the point of the professors) Hufflepuff is on the right, Ravenclaw second on the left, Grifyffindor far left and Slytherin between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.
