Hey redditors. Please suggest some good complete medium length fanfics (40k to 100k, a bit less or more is also welcome) which has the story till voldemort's death. Preferably not a character development fic, just some mindless quick action. (but anyways is fine).


** Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is as quick as it gets. A time travelling Harry has to defeat Voldemort in 12 hours. Very action packed.

Linkffn(Intersecting Realities) Similar premise but done over a longer time frame.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.
