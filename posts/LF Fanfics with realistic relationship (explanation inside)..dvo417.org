Hey there! I am basically looking for Fanfics that depicts relationships (Not Slash) in a realistic way. What I mean by that is that the relationship isn't "perfect" and "dreamlike".

Fanfics that show the pairing having huge fights, have hardships and challenges, and even temporary / permenant seperation. Basically,.a realistic depiction of relationship that takes into account things like the war, and Harry's status and such.


** A recent one I read was Angelica by delivermefromeve. Very realistic and in character.

I haven't read it yet but it seems to be SS/OC, so if you were avoiding this due to a fear of Snarry or Snamione (like I was) you can read it.

#+begin_quote
  A young wizard returns from the dead, not knowing who he his or what happened to him. He grudgingly accepts help from old colleagues and new acquaintances to reclaim his past, but finds out more than he bargained for. Will he vanquish his demons in time to help a new friend in need - or will he prove himself irredeemable once and for all?

** I am just going to throw out some that I remember for different reasons, but bear in mind the relationships are realistically portrayed, but that does not mean the relationship started realistically (it is a magical world and fanfiction after all):

- linkffn(Contractual Invalidation): a fine example of this idea in Harry/Daphne pairing. They have all sorts of disagreements and fights, but they have enough in common and admire each other that they make it work despite the clear differences of opinion.
- linkffn(The Changeling): like most of canon, there is a bit of unrealism (for lack of a better term), but the differences between Harry and Ginny are so much starker despite there similarities. And despite this, they both make it work or at least try and the whole thing is often a complete mess.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): while the circumstances for the Harry/Bellatrix pairing are a bit convoluted, both they and others are /very/ aware of how different the two are on practically every front. Harry literally has her dead father tell him that she is a bit mad and needs someone like him to stabilize her (could see something similar happen in real life pretty easily actually, minus the ghost part).
- linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): won't spoil a lot, but relationships are definitely shown to be not perfect and more often than not are very much a product of circumstance and random chance. Actually, that sort of goes for a lot TheEndless7 fics, though he has the tendency of over-describing everything reminiscent of Stephen King's style.

There are plenty more, but those came off the top of my head. Again, why the relationship started is not the same as being a realistic relationship.
