I read this one fic in which Harry storms Hogwarts and defeats everyone but Dumbledore. Dumbledore managed to protect Tom Riddle. Only reason I dropped it was because it was a Tom centered fic which I don't enjoy...

So is there another fic where Harry travels back and actually becomes badass? I don't want an emotional fic where Harry adopts Tom and stuff, just a badass Harry recking everyone.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
