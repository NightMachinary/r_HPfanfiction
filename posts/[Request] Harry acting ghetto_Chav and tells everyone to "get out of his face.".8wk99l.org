I want someone to write a funny fic where Harry acts super ghetto as hell and use Draco as his biiiitch. And he saves the wizard world by recruiting the biggest band of Chavs and shooting all the death eaters with magically augmented pistols.

EDIT: Ok, apparently chavs uses knives more often. Harry can go "I will cut you" while swinging Gryffindor sword in the most ghetto way possible.


** Isn't knife crime exponentially more chavvy than gun crime?

  AU fic. Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard... ( A/N: I started writing this story over 15 years ago now when I was in high school. Yes, it has errors & plot holes. No, I am not fixing them in this version. )
