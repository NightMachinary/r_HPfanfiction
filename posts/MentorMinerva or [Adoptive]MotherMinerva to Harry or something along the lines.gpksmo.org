I think my previous post was badly titled and people thought I was asking for Mcgonagall/Harry pairing(YUCK!). So I'm making a second one. Hope I get better response.

No Harmony and no bashing. Please.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  The Weasley twins have gone to far. They have left the Gryffindor common room in shambles, and the students are with out any place to stay. It falls to professor McGonagall to watch our favorite trio during their first year, and take care of them.

** You should still give Harry McGonagall a try. The pairing is such a minor thing... Silly really to avoid great fics like that because of a pairing you dislike, which only comes into play for 0.5% of the story.

*** More often than not, Harmony turns into Ron!bashing(either explicit or subtle), which I really cannot take anymore.

It also gives Hermione too much importance by default, which I also don't like(I've seen the movies, thank you very much).

And I just don't like the ship.

  I DO NOT OWN THIS STORY. This story was removed due to some reasons and its one of my favourite stories. So i thought i should share with everyone. One chapter a day Reposted. Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

**** Hey, no need to get defensive and downvote lol. I didn't question your aversion to the pairing. I just said in this case it doesn't make sense since the usual negative things don't apply and it is such a minor part. And it is probably the only good fic that actually fits your request.
