** That's a pretty broad question. HP fanfic is so vast that there's really nothing that hasn't been done in broad strokes. Once you start getting into specifics, sure. I'll throw out a few that really don't have any comparisons, tone and feel-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] doesn't really feel like anything else in the fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] is another story that doesn't really have an analogue that I'm aware of.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] is a seemingly simple concept - Ginny wrote in the diary all throughout CoS; what were those conversations like? - and executed it in a chilling, amazing way that I've never seen repeated.

** Without wishing to toot my own horn, my fic In Essence Divided involved Harry controlling two bodies simultaneously. Don't think I've ever seen that done elsewhere.

*** I've always thought that was a fascinating concept. The only other place I've come across it is in Terry Pratchett's Wee Free Men series, but I've thought it would be fun to write a story where Fred and George were actually one person with two bodies.

*** Haha, I googled "In Essence Divided" and clicked the link to FF.net. I read all 32 chapters but was confused because although it's a good story, there's nothing in it about Harry controlling two bodies. Then I saw that your username and realized that I had read a story with the same title that was written by a different author. Oops!
