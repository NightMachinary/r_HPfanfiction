Not particularly looking for slash, but I don't mind it, either.

It seems like if Harry is to be friends with Malfoy, Ron always either: 1. betrays Harry, intentionally or not; 2. is a self absorbed character whose only interest is food and they just drift apart; or 3. never becomes friends with Harry in the first place.

So I wanted to read something where he gets to be friends with both of them in spite of all the trouble that causes.

Draco and Ron don't have to accept each other, in fact it's more in character if they're still antagonistic. Also, of course, it doesn't have to be the center of the story.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** /Oh God, Not Again!/ has a subplot where Harry develops a friendly rivalry with Malfoy, after "accidentally" starting a rumor that Malfoy was Snape's illegitimate son. Ron and Hermione think Harry's nuts for this dynamic, along with a dozen other reasons.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
