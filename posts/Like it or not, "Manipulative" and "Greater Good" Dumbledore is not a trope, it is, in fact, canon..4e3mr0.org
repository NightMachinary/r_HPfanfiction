  `Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, *as I had planned and intended.* Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. *I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years*.'

  My answer is that *my priority was to keep you alive.* You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And *I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead.* Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  =Five years ago, then,' continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story,=you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. *Thus far, my plan was working well.*

Order of the Phoenix

The above is just a few examples of a Manipulative Albus Dumbledore. "My plan was working well". /My plan/. That is Manipulative Dumbledore in the common "Dumbledore bashing" stories. It is not a trope, or a cliche, it is not a fanon. It is canon, written by JK Rowling.

Everything I have written or read in fanfiction concerning Manipulative Dumbledore is based off of this.

This is not "Evil" Dumbledore. This is "Manipulative" Dumbledore, and therefore canon.

"Greater Good" Dumbledore is canon too, as we learn in Deathly Hallows. However, I will agree it is greatly exaggerated in fan-fiction. But in stories like that, it is just a Dumbledore, who /never/ stopped fighting for the Greater Good he had dreamed of with Grindelwald.

I *HATE* when people say they don't like "manipulative Dumbledore" stories. That just translates to me they don't like the Harry Potter CANON saga.

--------------

Then there is the fact that he kept the Prophecy from Harry until it was too late. He didn't tell Harry he was a Horcrux -- necessary information -- until AFTER he was dead. Occlumency was IMPORTANT for Harry to learn, and yet he gave that duty to an immature git who had an unnecessary grudge on Harry. He could have hired an experienced tutor.

Stretching the Voldemort lessons throughout the year, instead of a month -- when, after the month was done, so much more could have happened. Seems like something a "Manipulative Old Bastard" with his own agenda would do.

Let's not forget that Alastor Moody was one of Dumbledore's greatest friends and allies, and there was NO WAY he could have not known Alastor wasn't acting like himself. Or Dumbledore -- the great Legilimens -- didn't know Quirrel was hiding Voldemort under his turban.

What about Sirius Black? Dumbledore could have done so much more when it came to helping Sirius, instead he did not, because Sirius would be Harry's guardian if free, instead of having to go to the Dursleys.


** When people talk about the trope of Manipulative!Dumbledore, they talk about fics focusing entirely on his manipulation and exaggerating it completely (such as him hiring the Weasleys to "befriend" him and control him, him giving Love Potion to Harry, preventing Harry from having relationships, etc).

There is a difference between the fanon trope and his manipulative character in canon, so a difference between acknowledging that "Dumbledore is manipulative" and "Manipulative!Dumbledore".

**** Yet again it boils down to trying to let Harry have his childhood, because a prophecy such as the one he had is a heavy thing to be a subject of. Most of the people who now shout “oh, he didn't tell Harry the prophecy, he's manipulative (or whatever) because Harry should have learned it way earlier” would have gotten emotionally crushed, and in some cases never would get out of it, had they learned about the prophecy at 13 or 14, never mind earlier than that.

#+end_quote

It does, but I'm not sure how serious it is. There are tons of plot holes and inconsistencies, but they rarely distract from the story. The story is still captivating, and very few people check to see if a particular date in the distant past was a Friday or a Saturday.

Some plot devices are wildly overpowered, like portkeys and time turners. Rowling destroyed the time turners, but ignored the portkeys.

The biggest problem in fanfics is that the authors take one little hint of something and then peppers their stories with it. And that rarely works well.

Like a manipulative Dumbledore incessantly cackling evilly about the "Greater Good", a near-fatally clumsy Tonks, /years/-long time-turner training, Gred and Forge, and a Snape that's so hateful that he's literally foaming at the mouth.

Rowling wrote wonderfully complex characterizations. Nobody was completely good or evil. Everyone had both good and bad in them, just like real life. Not even Hitler was a complete monster.

But the fanfic authors write 2-dimensional characters with just a very few characteristics. The stories become flat and predictable.

Yes, Dumbledore was manipulative. But that wasn't his only characteristic. He genuinely wanted what was best for Harry, and when he realized his mistake with the Dursleys, it was too late to do anything about it. Though I personally think that the "mother's protection" was yet another plot hole.

***** Speaking of Dumbledore, he was either incompetent (he knew Voldemort was up to no good since at least 1957, didn't do **** until late 70s when people started dying like flies) or a plot device to make the kids more heroic.

Either JKR significantly downgrades Dumbledore's overall importance and influence in the British Wizarding World, or we have to assume he was incompetent in dealing with Voldemort. If JKR writes that although Dumbledore was superbly intelligent and wise, he was feared and shunned by those in power, and his warnings about Voldemort went largely ignored for decades, then his ineffectiveness (or rather difficulties) against Voldemort would be largely explained away. That would imho make the entire plot far more believable and credible. It would also explain why so little was done against Death Eaters after Voldemort's first fall, and why Lucius Malfoy could corrupt the government with impunity.

I actually don't like Dumbledore bashing stories. I would rather see a competent and wise Dumbledore doing his best. At same time, I would also like to see a more competent Voldemort, as opposed to that monolithically evil, compulsive-obsessive, cartoon villiain in the series.

When I talk about how I don't like that trope, I'm talking about the sort of fic where Dumbledore is working with the Weasley family, making it so exaggerated and over the top that it becomes clichéd. This is usually used in combination with Harry realising he doesn't have to take no shit from nobody, conveniently inheriting loads of money, and becoming overpowered. It's that style I don't like, and it's usually easily summarised by "I don't like over the top angst stories with manipulative Dumbledore."

It's OK if you disagree, even if you think that Dumbledore is super manipulative in canon, although I personally think you've exaggerated his manipulative nature here. Clearly you have very strong feelings on it that are just different to mine.

** I'm sorry, I really don't see eye to eye with most of your points. First off, you cite your passage as "proof" of manipulation, when in fact, there's no manipulation whatsoever in it. You know what manipulation is, right? Dumbledore had a plan, yes. The plan was to make sure a child didn't grew up to be a pampered little prince and that it didn't die. Boy, how manipulative of him.

What else do you say... Ah, "Greater good". Yea, you convenietely leave out the fact that young Dumbledore learnt the hard way that that is NOT the way one should act after Arianna's death.

Prophecy. I'm starting to think you are one of those people who only read the parts that are convenient for them. Dumbledore makes perfectly clear that he /should/ have told Harry about the prophecy on his first year. It was a mistake, a mistake born from his love and desire for Harry to have as normal as possible of a childhood (or teenage years I guess). He admits himslef that his plan was to tell Harry, maybe not in his first year, but certainly not wait 5 years to do it.

Snape. Yeah, h«this is another of Dumbledore's mistakes, and I really don't see how any of this in any way adds to your "Manipulative" theory. Snape was an excellent Occlumens, perhaps not better than Dumbledore, but Dumbeldore Theorized (correctly, I might add), that direct contact with Harry would further the connection between him and VOldemort. Something that was to be avoided in order to avoid precisely a situation like the end of OotP.

Alastor Moody. IDK. You kinda have a point there. But may I ask, what was "Manipulative DUmbledore's" motive to let someone pretend to be Alastor Moody? I can't think of anyhting, but maybe you do, since you dont' explain it.

Quirrel. We know for a fact Dumbledore knew something was up with Quirrel. Who had most likely received a crash course in Occlumency by his master. Furthermore, I'd like to point out, Legilimancy is not "Mind reading" as most people seem to think. You don't look at a person and see what's up in their heads, it's a spell. A spell that Harry deflects using a simple Protego, so we know it's not some ancient arcane powerful bullshit.

Sirius Black. What exactly could he have done? Now, I'm not exactly disagreeing with you on this point, but what do you think, DUmbledore would ahve done were he a "good guy"?

Oh, and the lessons being spread throuut the year.. I kind pf agree that that was mostly done for plot (it makes for a much better story if you receive that informatio througout the book rather than all in one chapter) but one can simply say that DUmbledore had Hpgwarts matters, order matters AND horcruz hunting. He's described as never ebing at the school during that year. Maybe he was just short on time. Honestely, like I said, that was done for storytelling purposes, but again like I did with the Alastor thing, what exactly would be his "Endgame" in spreading the lessons out?

Dumbledore has been dealing with Fudge for years. Perhaps he simply knows that when Fudge gets something in his head, he's not going to even try to look at contrary evidence. And if he believes that the kids are confunded, he could also believe that their memories have been altered (or he'll just switch to that belief when it becomes useful to maintain his belief system).

#+begin_quote

He actually states in GoF that it was "Moody" dragging Harry away after he portkeyed back that tipped him off that something was wrong. So it's possible that Crounch Jr. was simply really good at pretending to be Moody and the first real clue that he wasn't Moody didn't occur until after Voldemort returned.

Some people say Dumbledore and Moody were friends so Dumbledore should have known it wasn't Moody. What they conveniently forget is that the real Moody is /messed up/. He's always acting weird so it's no surprise when fake Moody does something weird. Or it makes sense that a paranoid person would change their patterns of behavior because predictability lets your enemies get you.

I'm not saying Dumbledore /wasn't/ manipulative, only that there's ambiguity enough to go many different ways with it.

**** Hmm. That darn pensieve is just too overpowered, it ruins a lot of plot points. You're right on that point, of course: It would be easy to just have Harry's memories in the thing and see that Peter was alive. I will however point out, more to be a Devil's advocate than because I actually believe in it, that Fudge was simply likely to dismiss the memory as a trick that Sirius Black and Lupin had made. Which would serve no purpose other than causing trouble for Lupin, since he'd become at that point an acclompice.

You... Didn't actually answered my question concerning Moody. FIrst of all, >Why didn't he do something about it until Crouch, Junior had dragged off Harry AFTER Voldemort was back?

Well, I mean, you're just proving my point. he didn't do anything, because /he didn't knew/. That's the only explanation, unless you can, as I asked, provide me with another plausible one.

I'm reading that part now. Harry was in the 3 Broomsticks under his invisibility cloak and Moody came in with Hagrid. Harry waved at them, forgetting he was invisible, but Moody saw and told Hagrid, who came over to say hi and then whispered to Harry to meet him.

Hardly suspicious.

** Manipulative!Dumbledore is a fanfiction trope where Dumbledore uses Harry for his own personal gain. Needless to say canon!Dumbledore isn't anything like this.

#+begin_quote
  Let's not forget that Alastor Moody was one of Dumbledore's greatest friends and allies, and there was NO WAY he could have not known Alastor wasn't acting like himself. Or Dumbledore -- the great Legilimens -- didn't know Quirrel was hiding Voldemort under his turban.
#+end_quote

I personally have no issue with Dumbledore not figuring out that Moody is a fake or that Voldemort is under Quirrel's turban. It makes Dumbledore fallible and human (one of the biggest reason why I love his background story in DH) although I'm well aware fallible and human are the two dirtiest words in fanfiction because we all like our characters to be perfect don't we? :)

#+begin_quote
  Stretching the Voldemort lessons throughout the year, instead of a month.
#+end_quote

HBP would be a terribly plotted book if all the Voldemort flashbacks happened in quick succession. The in-universe explanation could be that he simply doesn't have the time, he has other things to do finding the location of the cave for one, war stuff is another.

#+begin_quote
  He could have hired an experienced tutor.
#+end_quote

No he could not, remedial Potions provides a perfectly valid excuse on why Snape is spending so much time with Harry. Having Tutor McOcclumens show up at Hogwarts twice a week to see Harry doesn't, it would raise too much suspicion.

** This passage isn't exactly /proof/ of manipulative Dumbledore. The only "plan" he admits to is prioritizing keeping harry alive and getting him to Hogwarts "safe and whole". Most people would agree with that priority for a child. An abusive home is better than a grave, because it still has the potential for a happy life later (though obviously most people would look for a third alternative, but Dumbledore didn't believe there was one here). He doesn't admit or even suggest /here/ that his plan was to use Harry as a weapon against Voldemort, only that he believed Voldemort wasn't gone and his followers were still out there and they all would want Harry dead (which is easily a reason to take unhappy measures to keep Harry safe -- as demonstrated by the Longbottoms being attacked later).

We really /don't know/ just how effective the blood protection was, so there's no way to judge whether Dumbledore made the right call there. For all we know (as some fanfic authors have written) multiple attempts were made on Harry's life in Little Whinging over the years and he remained protected (even in school, or around the neighborhood). We /don't know/.

There are very few "good" characters in canon HP whose actions can't be interpreted poorly at some point. Maybe Dumbledore's manipulative, or maybe he's just not onmipotent and does the best he can with bad situations and limited knowledge. Maybe McGonagall protects Harry sometimes and other times she has a headache from dealing with the twins and snaps at him. Maybe Sirius would have been a great godfather, or maybe he would have been irresponsible and gotten Harry injured or killed. Flitwick, Sprout, Hagrid -- I can think of at least one bad thing about each of them. Etc.

But maybe they're all good people who sometimes mess up. That leaves a lot of room for fanfic authors to choose who they want to bash and who to help Harry (sometimes no one!), which is a good deal for us the readers. : )

if you dial back muggle culture 100 years to account for the social mores of the 1990 wizarding world closely resembling Victorian Britain, then another 110 to reach Dumbledore's childhood, that's societal behaviour in 1780.. an orphan treated like Harry in 1780 would think themselves all sorts of lucky.

Dumbles might wish Harry was treated better but the fact that Harry wasn't wouldn't be surprising to someone raised in 1780. after all, look what muggles did to Dumbles sister.

** Can I take an oddly weird stance on one of these points? I have heard a lot of people say that Dumbledore was a dick for not telling Harry about the prophecy when he came to Hogwarts, or for not taking him in and training him to kill Voldemort.

It might just be me, but Harry is eleven. Eleven. This means that he is a child. He shouldn't have to have this hanging over him so young. I'm not saying it should be kept from him, but I /am/ saying it would be bad to tel a young child that you one day, a number of years from now, expect him to kill this guy who cheated death. That kind of information might seriously mess with young Harry. Also, and this is more of a personal opinion, Harry has absolutely no reason to do just that. I've never quite understood why he thinks that it's his job to become some form of savior/hero.

Most of you will recognize the following quote; "With great power, comes great responsibility", This is a quote which I generally disagree with. I prefer to think that; "With great power, comes greater /personal/ responsibility". A small difference, yes, but the overall effect changes to mean that if you have greater power yourself, whether it me magical or political etc..., then you need to be aware of your own personal responsibilities.

For example as Headmaster of a school, Dumbledore is responsible for the overall standard of education, payment of staff, upkeep of facilities, and delegation's of minor responsibilities (groundskeeper). Harry is, at the beginning of the books, a child. His responsibilities should include: Learning at school to become a more functional adult later in life. That is it. As he grows up he finds that he has greater power as a wizard, at least in defense based magic, and should have the responsibility to have greater control over that power. When told of the prophecy he should have realized that other people are charged with the responsibility to defend magical society and said "Nope, I'm good. You can deal with it yourselves".

Again this is mostly my opinion, but training a child to believe that he /has/ to save a bunch of people he doesn't even know just because those same people expect him to is morally wrong.

Otherwise I guess what I'm trying to say is that people are complicated and Dumbledore is really, really old. I'm not excusing his actions, not all of them, but really he can't handle his own responsibility and should be removed from some of his power. He is not necessarily evil and he's not good, he is a person and we, people in general, are fucked up.

#+begin_quote
  Manipulate 1 to treat or operate with or as if with the hands or by mechanical means especially in a skillful manner

  2 a : to manage or utilize skillfully

  b : to *control or play upon by artful, unfair, or insidious means especially to one's own advantage*

  3 : to *change by artful or unfair means so as to serve one's purpose*
#+end_quote

You can definitely argue that Dumbledore manipulated for the greater good instead of his own advantage, but he did "artfully" and "unfairly" control and change the situation in order to satisfy a goal he had set. This passage, and the one in DH where he and Snape talk about "raising Harry for slaughter" show that he actively planned and pulled strings in the shadows to accomplish his goal.

Fan Fiction that focuses on this characteristic in Dumbledore is based on canon, even if it is exaggerated. Fan Fiction that adds evilness or disdain for the protagonist as motivation to do something unsavory is made up, but that's okay. That's why fan fiction is fun. You get to twist characters and situations in new ways, and you got to experience a new version of the Harry Potter story. If you don't like evil!Dumbledore, read something else.

If you don't like manipulative!Dumbledore, I think you probably are uncomfortable for the same reason that so many people are uncomfortable with Dumbledore in the books-- he goes from being a sweet, mystical, whimsical, intelligent protector to someone with a muddy past who has made mistakes and serious decisions about the fate of the world. He's in a war, which necessitates some casualties along the way, a fact that understandably makes some people feel queasy. Most of what he did is justified, even if it is awful, which is what makes us so uncomfortable. I think that this discomfort is what motivates some people to reject the idea that manipulative Dumbledore is cannon.

** I was with you up until the bit about Snape. He wasn't immature, it was a carefully crafted mask to ensure his role as spy was ironclad. The grudge against Harry wasn't entirely unwarranted either, Snape's whole life turned to shit because of that prophecy. Harry not knowing about it doesn't make the grudge unreasonable, it makes it inexplicable.

About the Occlumency itself, for all we know its an incredibly rare magical art. Who do we know that can do it? Dumbledore, Snape, and Voldemort. Not exactly a long list, only marginally longer than Parseltongue speakers, which is basically a dead language.

Dumbledore is never proclaimed to be a great Legilimens. Voldemort possessing Quirrel likely passed on Occulemency skills, much like Parseltongue was passed to Ginny.

Mad Eye Moody might have known Occlumency himself so Dumbledore never checked, or Crouch Jr. learned from Voldemort himself.

Lessons on Tom Riddle could have been shorter, Dumbledore was trying to soften the blow and mix it with regular school life. Ultimately a mistake in my opinion.

Now, Sirius Black. We have absolutely no canon proof that Dumbledore had the authority to directly help Sirius in any way! He might not have even been Harry's legal guardian, just a concerned godfather offering his home. Dumbledore has the ear of the Minister for Magic, who is increasingly paranoid and bought by Lucius Malfoy.

The best reasonable conclusion is that Dumbledore was manipulative. He truly served the greater good in the best fashion he knew how and some eggshells were broken in the process. Some of the fanon theories people come up with are the result of drinking the kool-aid a bit too often.

The way I see it, your interpretation of canon postulates that a bunch of characters who are otherwise some of the most dangerous and competent wizards in the setting, and several of whom are, in fact, quite comfortable fitting in among Muggles, didn't think to track Harry down during the Summer, when a House-Elf did. My interpretation of canon postulates that you can't circumvent the epic protection granted by once-in-a-century confluence of love, selfless sacrifice, and luck --- the same protection that can stop an unstoppable curse and slay the mightiest wizard --- by ordering or hiring someone else do the dirty work for you. Tellingly, none of those who were actually able to threaten Harry at 4 Privet --- the Dursleys, Dobby, and Umbridge's Dementors --- were acting on behalf of Voldemort. I think that my interpretation makes more sense. What do you think?

They had other reasons to keep an eye on him. For example, a hostile Ministry official might have set him up to be hurt or to break the law, so that she could throw the book at him.

And, just because he could touch him didn't mean that he could hurt Harry at 4 Privet Drive. Sacrificial protection at 4 Privet Drive when Harry was living there was always stronger than what Harry had at Hogwarts.

Again, two interpretations. Yours postulates that the Order, including Dumbledore, stupidly sent Harry to stay with the Dursleys /three times/ after GoF, somehow missing that Voldemort could have walked in there any time, but, fortunately, Voldemort, despite knowing that he could touch Harry now, stupidly refrained from attacking him there, instead waiting until Harry left 4 Privet Drive for the last time. Mine postulates that living under the same roof as his aunt --- hosted voluntarily, if reluctantly --- provided him with inviolable protection that Voldemort's taking in his blood could not overcome, even though it was effective in countering the protection's weaker effects; that this protection would last until he turned 17, which is the age at which he would be considered an adult and therefore not under the protection of his mother and her sacrifice; and that Voldemort simply could not attack him at 4 Privet Drive until he left it for the last time. I think that mine makes more sense. What do you think?

There you go! What did Dumbledore have to gain that summer, aside from manipulation, from keeping Harry from knowing what was going on, before he went to Grimmauld Place? He didn't know Harry was having visions then, or Voldemort's connection, so it wasn't to keep Voldemort from knowing things, or he would not have been welcomed so close to the Order.

Voluntarily, if reluctantly? Harry was DROPPED OFF AT THE DOORSTEP! There was no discussions, no agreement. Only a LETTER! Petunia was SHOCKED to find him. How was that voluntary?!

As for Voldemort assassinating her, the sanctuary probably applies to the whole family, or if not perhaps this is, once again, epic sacrificial protection protecting itself: if Voldemort and his agents couldn't even think of attacking Harry at 4 Privet, they couldn't think of attacking Petunia, either. The point is that it can't be circumvented. And, your notion of home is a very Muggle one. Harry was living under the same roof as Petunia even when he was away at (Muggle) school or Petunia was out for groceries.

#+begin_quote
  Then why was Harry even ALLOWED outside his house... to go so far away from his house where he was attacked by Dementors? Why weren't more than just ONE Order member watching him at once? Why did he have no contact from the Order members telling him to STAY INSIDE because there were dangers!
#+end_quote

Why would staying inside help? And, anyway, the Order had less than a dozen adult members at the time, most of them had day jobs, and a few were away trying to recruit allies. Why do you think they'd resort to having Mundungus on guard?

#+begin_quote
  There you go! What did Dumbledore have to gain that summer, aside from manipulation, from keeping Harry from knowing what was going on, before he went to Grimmauld Place?
#+end_quote

And, once again, I ask: to what end? What was he trying to manipulate Harry into doing? You never did answer that question upthread. Until you can answer that, the rest of this discussion is moot.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't know Harry was having visions then, or Voldemort's connection, so it wasn't to keep Voldemort from knowing things, or he would not have been welcomed so close to the Order.
#+end_quote

First of all, he had ample circumstantial evidence that some sort of a link existed, and may have even been able to deduce it from first principles. Secondly, while Harry was at 4 Privet, there was a possibility of Voldemort and Ministry intercepting communications, even if there was no link, while at 12 Grimmauld, there was only the link, so the balance of risks is different.

#+begin_quote
  Voluntarily, if reluctantly? Harry was DROPPED OFF AT THE DOORSTEP! There was no discussions, no agreement. Only a LETTER! Petunia was SHOCKED to find him. How was that voluntary?! It was FORCED onto her. Also it was likely that if she sent Harry to an orphanage, he'd wind up back at her house the next day because of Dumbledore. She was no volunteer. She didn't have any foreknowledge of it coming. Absolutely nothing. She didn't have a choice until he was already there! That is NOT VOLUNTARY!
#+end_quote

Using all caps doesn't make this any more persuasive. Yes, she could have dropped him off at the orphanage. She was confronted with a choice: she could take Harry in and give him the protection of her hated sister's sacrifice, or she could have rejected him and left him to his fate. Grudgingly, she chose mercy.

I did answer. Defeating Voldemort. "This discussion is moot" is an excuse. You just don't have an answer for it.

He made Hermione and Ron keep things from Harry. That is manipulation, taking CHOICE away from them. "Dumbledore made us swear..." That is manipulation. He made them swear. He didn't give them a choice. He knew they'd agree with him, because he's an authoritative presence, and that is manipulation in itself. Using his power to make them agree.

Dementors couldn't attack him. Was he suddenly invisible to Voldemort and Death Eaters if he walked a mile away from home to go to a park? Mundungus was useless. Remus didn't have a job, and couldn't recruit anyone. IF Remus was there instead of Mundungus, those things wouldn't have happened.

I did answer it, and you elected not to follow up. To reiterate, if the allegation were that Dumbledore was manipulating Voldemort, your answer would have been a good answer. However, as I pointed out upthread, the allegation was about Dumbledore manipulating /Harry/. What did he manipulate (or try to manipulate) /Harry/ into doing (or not doing)? Judging by the fact that you dropped that point (and many others) in your replies, I think that you might be the one lacking answers.

So, directly asking others to do something to maintain what little operational security they could (and unless you are going to claim that he made them make an Unbreakable Vow, I'm going to say that it was Hermione being excited and using hyperbole) is "manipulation" now? Voldemort was back, and the Ministry was digging up dirt on Harry and Dumbledore alike. Owls and Muggle post can be intercepted, and phone lines can be tapped.

And, once again, I ask: to what nefarious end was this alleged "manipulation" committed?

#+begin_quote
  Dementors couldn't attack him.
#+end_quote

They couldn't? I am not sure a door would stop them, even if it could, and even if they couldn't wait until someone opened a door or a window, or go after the Dursleys to lure Harry out, Dementors were pretty much the only such threat, and it was a highly unexpected one. Against others, staying indoors wouldn't have made a difference.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

As long as he was living under the same roof as his aunt, he could have taken a weeklong vacation in Australia, and it would have held. Also, I am not claiming that he was invisible as such. That's too specific. By whatever mechanism epic magic uses, they could not find him and hurt him while he lived there, and they could attack him as soon as he left 4 Privet Drive for the last time. This is something that everyone, good and bad, agree on, in deed if not in word.

#+end_quote

Wasn't he an ambassador as well? Hagrid to the giants, Remus to the werewolves. Or, am I misremembering? Even so, if the Ministry is watching 4 Privet, even a little, having a werewolf hanging around might not be a great idea from the PR point of view, Remus still needs to sleep, and he does have his Furry Little Problem. The Order is /very/ short-staffed.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Probably not. But, unless you are going to allege that Dumbledore arranged it this way, as opposed to it being an unfortunate coincidence, I don't see how it adds anything to the Manipulative!Dumbledore case.
