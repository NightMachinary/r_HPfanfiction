Does it trigger whenever there's a full moon over the horizon wherever the werewolf is? Or only when the moonlight reaches the werewolf? Or maybe is it triggered by a biological clock regardless of where the moon is?

I'm wondering how time travel would affect werewolves. Could a werewolf skip a full moon by jumping forwards? How would time zones react? What would happen if the werewolf was at the north pole with a 6 month day?

I'm trying to write a one-shot about various attempts at curing/avoiding werewolf transformations and need information on what could and couldn't work.


** The headcanon I've used in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/ (which has its own "solving Lycanthropy" sequence) is that it's triggered by the full moon, but only after the sun has set --- whether moonlight is touching you or not (if that were so you could just lock yourself in an opaque room for the night and be done with it). Time travel would work, except it doesn't, because Time-Turners only take you to the past, not the future. Switching timezones /might/ work, but it'd be a pretty hectic life, if I've got my numbers right.

*** With the timezones, if you could start traveling in the evening just before sunset, travel west so that you'll end up back where you started 12 hours later after circumnavigating the earth once, you would be skipping the night.

This strategy would require the Werewolves to travel at mach 2.6 for 12 hours every full moon night. This is possible with muggle technology (just barely in the capabilities of the SR-71 blackbird spy plane) so it should be possible with magic too. Just enchant a bus to fly like Arthur Weasleys car, but faster.

Or you could portkey to America, then Asia and back. Would work too.

Personally I really like the idea of a magic hypersonic flying bus that takes all the Werewolves around the world each full moon. Imagine meeting someone in a bar, asking them about their job, and they answer "oh, it's pretty simple, I just fly a bunch of werewolves around the world in a hypersonic flying bus once every month during the full moon".

Or you could save yourself the trouble and simply travel west after sunrise with commercial airlines. You would lose more time, but you also wouldn't cause a bunch of diplomatic incidents and require a state-of-the-art military aircraft (And at least the Swedes were actually capable of locking onto the Blackbird with their Viggens, so you might end up dying).

***** Yeah, right, circumnavigating the world slower would work too, it'd just take a lot of time each month. I'm just too fascinated with the possibilities of magic to not think about the awesomeness of hypersonic werewolves. As for the diplomatic incident, Arthur Weasleys flying car can turn invisible.

It also breaks a bunch of magical laws. Some of which he drafted himself.

they might be able to teleport you to the future an hour at a time and it's just not something people ever do or nobody has thought of.

**** I would think DOM has thought of it, but time travel is a strange business. And would imagine that if it did exist, that using it for second class citizens so they don't have to deal with their monthly ‘furry problem' (unfortunately not their waxing appointment) seems highly unlikely.

***** it could be something that already exists but nobody recognizes as time travel.

if someone cast a Slow spell on you that lasts five minutes but to you it only lasts a minute, you've traveled forward in time four minutes with a transition time of 1 minute. To everyone else, you were moving at 1/5th speed for 5 minutes.

Just take the Concorde to New York and then a bunch of connecting flights until you get around the globe and back to London. Sounds way easier than transforming into a monster (even though it is implied that wolfsbane makes it bearable)

**** But what if the plane is late, and you end up turning into a werewolf in an airport full of people? I think this risk is what may deter Remus. That and the fact that plane tickets are expensive, and werewolves poor.

***** Start with enough time to spare and you should be fine. Like, almost a day early. Follow the sunrise instead of escaping nightfall.

Given how apparation works, you should be able to get around the globe with ~20 apparations at 50° north. So you take the plane once and apparate afterwards (although that might be tricky during the winter when the sun doesn't rise above the polar circle).

** According to Rowling in PoA (and who knows wether she has thought about it or not), the moon has to be visible. When the gang comes out of the Whomping Willow on their way to the castle Remus only starts to transform when the moon becomes visible behind the clouds.

Now I bet that's a mistake on Rowling's part, because a logical conclusion would then be that anyone infected with lycantrophy can just stay indoors with the curtains shut and that would be the end of it.

*** There was a similar scene in Teen Wolf. Werewolfs were confined to a closed space for several months, so they couldn't see the moon. It resulted in them going feral.

Of course werewolfs over there are different to HP, but I think a similar idea could apply here. They would, for example, get sick if they haven't shifted in more than a month.

** As per the movies it's moonlight. Per the books? Hard to say, but I would say it leans towards time the moon reaches dominance in the sky.

Interesting principle though, keen to hear some other points of view.

** Rowling did it both ways because, children's books with more symbolism than semantics. Lycanthropy was supposed to symbolize HIV.

​

Remus transforms after the moon comes out from the clouds. "A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight."

​

But, they also say that he used to be taken to the Shack to transform back when he was a student, why would he transform in there? I'm assuming Dumbledore didn't lead an already transformed puppy wolf Lupin to the shack at night on a leash.

​

So, room for interpretation on whether you need to see the moon or not. It was also said that Lupin always looked sick in the days leading up to the full moon, assuming he didn't gaze on the partial moon on those days either, it meant that the waxing of the moon had an effect on him through stone walls.

​

Timezone change might work, but for it to be meaningful, rather than racing the moon, gotta jump to the other side of the planet and back twice a day, I'd assume.

​

Not sure about the pole thing. Don't they have a moon there? I don't have time to read up on this atm, but here's something I found that might help?
