Change my mind


** Ignoring the "they canonically show no attraction to their own gender" thing, since most slashing will either blatantly ignore that fact or make them bi to compensate for it. This is less a "convince you they're not that bad" than an explanation as to "why they are that popular."

Reasons why they are popular:

- Enemies to lovers trope
- opposites attract trope
- their general obsession/fixation on one another

The first two are the most common, I think, but I think they also strongly build off the third point. I mean, in HBP, Harry pretty much /stalks/ Draco. Granted, he does it because he thinks Draco is up to something (and he's right), but still, that kind of fixation is demonstrated by both at different points in the story, and it makes a decent-to-strong basis for "there's a reason beyond the obvious that they're fixated on one another."

You also have the general things that make slashing appealing to people who tend to lean that way (myself included). I never felt like Harry had a satisfactory love interest. Not that I dislike Ginny, but I was downright disappointed that was the way that JKR decided to go with Harry. I liked Ginny, I just didn't like her /with Harry/. It felt wrong that someone who had idolized him as a child ends up marrying him. Maybe having Harry marry into the Weasleys just felt like it was tied up too perfectly. I don't know, I just know that although I never had an issue with Ginny per se, I really did not like her with Harry.

Now--if you don't like Ginny, what are your options? Hermione, but you have to break up her and Ron to do it. An argument can be made in that direction, but I personally liked Hermione and Ron, and I loved the platonic nature of Harry and Hermione's relationship (I'm open to the Golden OT3 but there's a depressing lack of it out there). So who does that leave to ship Harry with?

The only other characters we see Harry /really/ spend a lot of time interacting with or thinking about are Draco and Snape. Draco has his own appeal for a lot of tropey reasons (not the least of which is just being a pretty boy). As someone who writes and has professionally edited, I was horribly disappointed by how Draco's character arc ended. It was such a letdown. He was such a pervasive and consistent part of Harry's life that it felt like his arc was leading to more than just realizing he and his family made a really bad decision and getting married to some character who was never mentioned before, and he and Harry have basically no relationship, good or otherwise, at all when it's all said and done. I feel like he was built to have a genuine redemption arc, and he really does not get it. That's a choice that JKR made, not to make Draco someone to be admired, and I think I remember an interview of her saying that she was very bothered by how much fanlove Draco got because he's really a horrible little snot who shouldn't be admired. So she stuck to her guns and didn't give him a redemption arc. If you liked his character, or more specifically, the potential his character had, that's still massively unsatisfying. And if you're going to ship him with anyone, the one person he shows any fixation on, romantic or otherwise, is Harry. And obsession or fixation is a /gold mine/ for slashers. It just is.

Harry and Draco also offer a great chance for worldbuilding. For such a staple fantasy world, we actually have /very/ little idea of what wizarding culture looks like in traditional wizarding families, particularly pureblood families, since its made clear that the Weasleys are about as far from traditional purebloods as they can get. I've seen a number of fics do /amazing/ worldbuilding of pureblood society and wizarding culture as a whole, and Draco is your doorway to that.

For all those reasons, if you can get past the "not canonically gay/bi," you can do a lot worse than Harry/Draco.

**** Haha--agreed on the Draco front. You see a lot of fandom where he's some ladykiller or has girls falling over him, but you don't /actually/ see that in canon. To me, he can easily pivot either direction.

Harry paying a little too much attention to how handsome Riddle and Cedric are definitely opens the door, but I think that's more of a case of a female writer with a male POV character oops. Still, I'm a slasher who, if given an inch, will run with it, so I'm not mad. :)

*** Canon supporter here.

I get you on the Harry marrying into the Weasleys just trying up everything too nicely. And let's be honest, the change from regular Ginny to HBP Ginny was too sudden. That being said, I do believe HBP personality was perfect for Harry, though it was kind of odd he found that in a former fangirl. Maybe having a new character introduced in book 5 with HBP Ginny personality would have worked better, keeping Ginny as a shy character. Anyways I'm still on board with Ginny being the best of the available options.

**** I think you hit the nail on the head with a lot of the drivers of my internal dissatisfaction with how it plays out. HPB Ginny is pretty awesome, but she does kind of show up out of nowhere. You're right, Harry does need someone who isn't impressed by "the boy who lives" (which she suddenly isn't anymore), and who is a person outside of her relationship with him, which I think she always is. Just, to your point, maybe it shouldn't have been Ginny.

Idk where it's said, but I have no trouble believing she wrote the ending before the middle. It's very Disney fairytale like the start of the series. It's annoying how she gave us a proper fairytale only to keep the HEA, cookie cutter perfect ending.

Luna for het and Neville for slash. To an extent, you have Fleur, Parvati, and one of the twins. Maybe Dean. One thing I enjoyed about Luna, and Ginny, was their lack of hesitation in the face of an angry Harry and, despite seeing the writing on the wall, I would've preferred HP/LL after OotP's ending.

I wouldn't call it non con with Fleur as she's not enticing them. We see with Harry that's it's possible to acknowledge that she's ethereally beautiful while not turning into a drooling numbskull.

The best reaction I saw to the epilogue after DH came out was "nice to know JKR can write fanfic" from one of the fanfic authors I was following at the time. I 100% agreed. I had read fic epilogues that read /frighteningly similar/ to it, which means, if nothing else, it was painfully unoriginal in a series that had so much originality.

I always forget about Luna. I don't know why. I like her, but I think I kind of like her in that amorphous, untouchable way. It's not a ship I'm on, but I would have been much more satisfied with that ending, with Harry ending up with a Luna who kind of embodies the eccentricity of the wizarding world that he loves so much. I could buy that (and at least it would be interesting instead of painfully predictable).

** Look, I will be perfectly honest here. I am a Slasher, and you would think that I would like Harry/Draco (I refuse to use cutesy pairing names lol). It's sort of the starter pack pair for most, but... surprise, I don't.

I think Draco, as a character is an entitled little pansy who relies mostly on his name rather than talent, but do I think as a pair that's the "worst"? No, I have favorite pairs people don't get too.

And as a pair I get it. As one response said it's AU. That's all you really need to justify, nevermind that *all* fanfic, even Canon compliant is AU by definition. You are adding content and telling a story with events that are not in the source material.

But even from a "Non Au" POV it still makes sense. It's the old "Enemies to Lovers" trope which is a thing in most novels. Even in the books the level of animosity between Harry and Draco bordered unrealistic. It was Draco trying to get and keep Harry's attention; basically the equivalent of a little boy pulling a little girls pigtails because he likes her and doesn't know how or have the emotional maturity to express it

**** Oh I've read a bit of everything, but as far as the pairs I like I tend to stick to secondary characters paired with Harry; rare or less popular pairs. I find using lesser characters gives you room to be more creative and gives haters less ammo to bash.

Some examples are....

Marcus Flint/Harry - This one freaks people out, but I see Marcus as sort of a Gruff, Brash Aggressive type, but it works because you can make him Very protective of Harry. Sort of the Look at him cross-eyed and I'll bash your skull in. But Harry is sort of his Tamer and he's super gentle

I love Harry/Cedric. This is 1) he's super hot, but his death sort of gave you the secret tragic lovers angle to play with. Grief can be a powerful plot device.

Harry with Either or both of the Weasley Twins or Harry/Oliver Wood. These are sort of the Teenage Jock locker room fantasy ideas

Harry/Seamus - This one is flimsy but I like Seamus, plus He was raised in the Muggle world so you've got that "Normal Comradery that people usually seem to attribute to Hermione

Harry/Neville - this one is rare but there needs to be more. Given their similarity and the fact that they both could have been the BWL the bonding and potential for romance is fun to play with

There's Harry/Colin Creevey - This one nobody really touches but that's a shame. He is such a Fanboy you can't Not slash him.

As I said I have and will read just about it all (Though I Stay away from the likes of Snape and Remus and Lucius. I have read them but... eww) the Listed are my favorite

** I'm not here to change your opinion, i'm off this train for years now :) BUT I think that Draco as we see him in the books is just a shitty bully of a teenager, who repeats stuff after his parents and rides steadily on the privilege of a rich and pureblood family. This Draco can never be a love interest for Harry, in my opinion.

Nevertheless, I can see how canonically he starts questioning things in books 6&7, and I think there is a quite decent possibility of him changing after the war. Draco can be an asshole, but he is not stupid, so it's not impossible. And if this happens, the obsession the two have with each other can come into play. Harry is capable of forgiving, sooo...

Honestly, the reason I love this pairing is exactly the possibility of a redemption arc. I like reading& writing about character growth, and drarry is perfect for this.

Plus it's a beautiful ship, lol. Look up the fanart.

** It's kind of funny, I wasn't shipping Drarry at all before, but now I am rereading canon and... I can see it. Draco always seeks Harry, his obsession with him throughout the years is somewhat ridiculous and can definitely be interpreted as attraction on many levels. Draco's inability to channel his own emotions actually resembles Harry's ptsd afrer GoF when he has a hard time expressing himself as well. So they are actually quite similar and don't get me started on how they are both being manipulated by the adults in canon. It's quite sad. So if they would look past their hate towards one another, they could potentially find comfort and understanding of each other's situation.

And don't even get me started on the amount of amazing art and fanfiction out there.

*** I don't think that Harry and Draco ever had an argument so significant as to develop sexual tension. The only times they come to blows is when Draco insults Harry's mom and Harry beats him up (but you'd have to be a special kind of fetishist to be attracted to someone who makes fun of your dead mother who sacrificed her life so you could live) and when they duel in Myrtle's bathroom, but then, at least on Harry's side, he was acting in self defense. Also then Harry was obsessed with Ginny.

If you were to go from the canonical character description, Harry and Draco could not stand each other, and, at least, Harry was written as a heterosexual character because JKR started writing the stories in the 90s in UK, when the LGBT community was still not seen in the best of lights. Sure, now you may make the argument that the wizarding world was more progressive on such matters, but don't forget that we're talking about a society still mostly stuck in the seventeenth-eighteenth century.

I can imagine that being gay didn't even seem like it was a thing for either Harry or Draco, who each in their own way were raised by people who would think that being gay was as much of an abomination as being magic/muggle. Which is to say that there are many valid reasons for a teenager to not be perfectly in touch with their sexuality.

**** On the flip. most characters are so shallowly drawn we also get no indication that /any/ of them are straight. The only character we have word of God on in terms of sexuality is Dumbledore who was confirmed explicitly to be gay by JKR. If you start from the premise that characters are assumed to be straight if they are in relationships with or are shown pursuing opposite sex partners, fine, but that is really only one perspective - plenty bi people assumed they were heterosexual at first, as did plenty gay people, because society traditionally pushes that model.

Also going by JKR's model of revealing things after the fact like Bellatrix being pregnant all of DH, there's no saying that loads of same-sex dating wasn't going on and either Harry never noticed it or it never made it into the books.

E: Sure is funny how everything except characters' sexuality can be teased out into a discussion where we respect each others' opinions and critique JKR's storycraft. But no, sexuality is the one exception that must be set in stone where /exactly/ what we've seen in the text from Harry's perspective must be the sum total of everything that's going on, even in innumerable AUs.

********* I'll give you a counter hot take--Harry's relationship with Cho can be read as someone gay trying really hard not to be. Reading them together was /painful/. It was awkward and uncomfortable and, to me, felt like Harry was trying really hard to have the kind of relationship he thinks he's supposed to have. Now, that could have been just because Cho wasn't the right girl for him, but it can also read as struggling with orientation. That is open to the reader's interpretation.

I also have several friends who dated women in high school before they came out (one of my best friends was such a magnet for closeted gays, it became a running joke) so the "we only see him dating girls" just doesn't work for me. A couple of those friends /only/ dated girls in high school, and yes, progressed the relationships to sex, and they still came out as gay later.

So aggressively rejecting the possibility tends to read as homophobic (especially with flimsy arguments like "he only dated 2 people and both were girls"), so that's why you get a lot of pushback. We really struggle in fandom to agree to disagree. If slash doesn't float your boat and your interpretation of Harry is entirely straight, /that's an entirely valid interpretation./ It's probably even the one JKR meant to write. That doesn't mean that there isn't room for other readings, and yes, slash fans will pick up on any little spec of dirt you give us as fodder. If our interpretations are different than canon, that's simply how we engage with and enjoy the fandom. It doesn't (or shouldn't) infringe in your own enjoyment.

That's it, I've had it with this shit. With you people, EVERYTHING seems to ALWAYS be about how someone secretly was gay all along.

You know what, you won. Cho was also gay because she tried to hard to get with Harry just to "be seen with a man". Draco was gay because he married a woman he never saw, just because it's what SoCiEtY wanted of him. Same for Astoria Greengrass, then. Ron was fucking gay because he went with Hermione despite them being OnE oF ThE wOrSt CoUpLe EvEr and Hermione was also gay for the same reasons.

Dumbledore was gay, McGonagall was gay too because they were close so they each were the best gay friend of each others. Hell, James Fucking Potter and Severus Effing Snape were gay for each others because sexual tension for several years, and James's attraction to Lily Evans was because SoCiEtY wAnTeD hIm To Be WiTh A wOmAn !1!111!1!!

Shall I continue ? Krum's gay because he tried to hard to look like a man, because he let himself grow a mustache or a beard I don't remember. Fleur was gay because she latched on the first coworker she could at Gringotts because again SoCiEtY.

Umbridge was fucking gay because she clearly hated herself and everyone else and it was a deep metaphor or gays hating everything because of how they grew up.

Personally if I had to choose out of Harry/Hermione/Draco which pairing I don't like the most it would easily be Harmony (sorry to me they just seem more like siblings). I like the passion fanon Draco brings, and his protectiveness. He is a great character who is easily molded to suit a lot of different pairings because we truly don't know much about him other than he was raised by racists. Making him gay or bi could easily suit him because we really don't see him romantically in Canon due to his whole "have a project to do or everyone dies" thing while Harry simultaneously, bless his heart, is oblivious to almost everything around him. Harry is canonically passionate, protective, caring, and devoted to the people he cares about. He is willing to forgive and teenage Draco certainly needs forgiveness for being a wretched monster of a teenager (and really who is the same as an adult as a teen?).

** I mean I suppose it depends on what you mean by worst.

What makes a bad ship depends on why you ship in the first place.

In my experience there can be multiple reasons but I can generally put it into at least 1 of 3 categories.

Canon This relationship has clear hints at at romance at least 1 one has a crush on another. They may not end up endgame but there is a good chance and you like the idea of them together.

Relation dynamic This relationship had alot of canon lots of moments together working on their bond which is likely very close and they care about each other its never clearly indicated to be but people would like it if that were the case and think they'd be a compelling good relationship.

Entertainment/fanon These two may have no canon backing at all. They were indifferent to each other or hated each other. Or maybe even never talked to each other at all. But people start thinking if circumstances were different maybe they would. They enjoy seeing the versions of these characters in what if situations bounce off each other. They think the dynamic they have with each other in fanon is fun. Or there are specific types of stories or dynamics they like to explore that work best with these two characters. Its all based in fandom and story and character potential and not what they ended up being.

All 3 in my opinion are perfectly valid reasons to like ships But not everyone ships for the same reasons. It can change from fandom to fandom too.

In hp fandom for example I think that 3rd category more common than in many other fandoms.

Partly because the fandom has lasted for so long that people want new things to explore. In many other fandoms the fandom might have died before that became a more common desire.

Partly because there was alot of potential things about the world and the characters that didnt get a chance to be explored and now people want to and HP happens to have a world where that is possible.

In terms of ships many may still closer to canon. They look to ship people who had good relations even if they werent explicitly romantic. While others are fine having their favorite ships be based on what of situations and not canon.

Drarry for me falls into the 3rd category and should be judged by that standard.

But people judge it based on standards 1 and 2. And by the standards of 1 and 2 ya it is pretty bad.

Harry and Draco disliked each other in canon they had a pretty toxic relationship. How are people seeing this from what we got in canon?

But many fans are looking at Harry potter as a set of potential aus and canon divergences that make for entertaining stories and it is in that realm Drarry shippers ususlly find Drarry compelling. That sort of story is common in hp fic and many now are way more into fic of Harry Potter than canon.

What makes it entertaining to shippers I think is the enemies or rivals to lovers dynamic. The bickering playfulness that could be possible if they got along better. Examination of wizarding culture and society you dont get to see as much of in the books. Bad boy reformed tropes. Rebellion against parents tropes/questioning parental figures you once trusted.

Your Drarry story wont have all these but they will have at least some. You can theoretically do this with a different character or ship but it might be more difficult or maybe the chemistry of this kind of story happening with this character or ship is appealing.

Its a personal preference thing. If these tropes are appealing and that sort of realtionship dynamic is appealing then it will be enjoyable. If not or the canon dynamic casts a shadow for you and spoils it then it wont. It will be bad.

If you are talking about like quality then well fiction is to be fair kinda crappy. This is true and maybe more true for fanfic that doesnt need to go through any formal publications process.

But the more popular the ship the easier it is to find better content. If say only 10% of fic of every ship is good that doesnt seem like alot of good fic. If its a rare ship its not alot.

But if its a popular ship 10% of that amount could still be far more than you could hope to finish in a decade. And hp is a fandom that still getting new content. Drarry is still a decently popular ship so thats alot of good fic to get through. And good fics can definetly make people become fans of ships they werent big on before.

So basically "good ship" as a concept is kinda arbitrary.

** Urf, I'm gonna have to defend a pairing I hate at least a little bit, just to make myself the Devil's advocate.

So, at least Draco and Harry are in the same age range. They also have some common interests, like Quidditch, and Draco is, unlike many, a developped character, with a known past, and personnality traits.

​

That's it, that's all the good points I can find. They have an horrible chemistry, one is a selfless moron and the other an entitled ponce, Draco wished death upon 30% of the population because of their ancestry ... Yeah, if you just look at the good points it may looks like it could work but then you take everything else and suddenly Drarry is a mess that just can't work.
