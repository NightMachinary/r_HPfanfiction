*The Prompt:*\\
Lots of creature fics have some excuse for how Harry Potter becomes something other than human...well, this one uses all of them. There's a dozen magical creatures in his ancestry, triggering transformations at puberty and every other time, he's in a terrible accident and his Blood Replenishing Potion is tainted with non-human blood, basilisk venom and phoenix tears together trigger an amazing mutation, a stray dark curse turns him into a lowly house-elf or snake, he achieved a spontaneous animagus transformation but hasn't figured out how to change back, werewolf bite, vampire bite, Hungarian Horntail bite, he found the Sword of Greyskull but it's been corrupted, his new self-repairing dragonhide cloak has an unfortunate quirk...you get the idea.

Write a scene where somehow or someway, Harry is transformed from his human state...and the gist of his reaction (and that of his friends and surrounding witnesses) is an exasperated "again?".

*Bonus Points:*\\
* Madam Pomfrey wants overtime pay for all the weeks she's spending researching rituals and pouring over old grimoires to fix Harry every time something happens to him.\\
* It's revealed that James Potter had the same problem and part of his motivation to become an animagus was to try and have a controllable transformation for once.\\
* Draco Malfoy wants no part of these shenanigans. No male veela or leather pants or other slash-fic material for him, no sirree, he's staying out of it.\\
* Hagrid, with his encyclopedic knowledge of magical creatures, is appointed an Expository Professor (salary and everything), with the duty of showing up right on time to explain what Harry's turned into /this/ time.\\
* Umbridge gets busy campaigning full-time-and-a-half (with magical coffee and time turners, natch), trying her best to legislate against every new 'filthy half-breed' form that Harry turns into.


** "Thanks for the breakfast, Hagrid. You don't know how I needed a nice omelette," Harry said as the two walked from Hagrid's hut towards the first Care of Magical Creatures class of the term. His stomach hadn't forgiven him for partying so hard last night... In fact, he might still be drunk. "Well, what's up for today?" He hoped he didn't sound too eager or disinterested or like he was trying to cover up.

"Well, yeh 'member the skrewts from las' year? Figure yer aught to put some together yerself." That didn't sound good. That sounded like now Harry had two reasons to be nauseous. He grimaced as he imagined his stomach turning violently over.

"Gather 'round, gather round!" Hagrid announced when they reached the class grounds. "Here we go! Fer this lesson, yer gonna start learnin' about magical cross breeding! Trick is, if yeh feed a fertilized manticore egg what's been mixed with Firewhiskey to a young lobster..." Harry lost the trail of the explanation as his insides did a DEFINITELY NOT imaginary violent turnover. He sat violently away from the class.

"Excuse me, Hagrid? My identification charm says these are chicken eggs... are we just practicing?" Harmione asked, after reviewing the class materials.

"Naw, they're manticore eggs; just picked em up myself yesterday. Kept em in the--hmm, were they in the trunk or on the shelf? No matter, we'll jes--"

"Hagrid!" Harry abruptly rose to his feet, pain temporarily overruled by panic. "Hagrid, did we eat--"

"Calm down, its alrigh'. Magic won't get to yeh without a little bite o' alcohol and Ashwinder essence. Let's everyone take a minute ter practice while I see if'n I have any manticore eggs lef'," Hagrid said as he changed the subject back to classwork.

Harry just stared, stunned. He tried to make himself blink, but his eyelids weren't budging. The pain was gone, but it was replaced by the too-warm discomfort he knew too well. He wanted to sit again, but his knees weren't right. Fine. He'd just fall over and let the rest of the day play out however. But as he fell, he was caught by a pair of strong arms. No, not a pair--three pairs. His three pairs. That's just great. Actually, that's great! Harry began to feel like 8 legs had really been missing from his life.

He had to wiggle them. He was feeling very antsy. He shook his head in mild panic as the world slipped from view. But when he moved his head, it was better. He could see again. He took a speedy leap forward, and for a brief moment, he knew exhilaration like riding a broom. When he landed, he scrunched up his... whatever that part is... and the Care of Magical Creatures class watched him rocket forward on an expelled jet of golden-red flames into the Forbidden Forest. The very first ever Blast-Ended Potter.

** Fun concept! This would be hilarious. But instead I'm thinking "Why have Pomphrey try and cure him, this sounds awesome! Do transformations stack? Can he become the most hideous, hilarious chimaeric badass in history? His friends get tired of him constantly TRYING new concoctions, poisons and funny little curses to add to his collection. Voldemort dies because Harry's farts are now toxic"

*** I dunno about toxic farts, that'd be dangerous to his classmates as well, unless they got used to sleeping under bubblehead charms.

...Hey, here's a puzzler for you; what happens if phoenix-animagus Harry is hit with a Mandragora Curse that turns him into said plant? What happens to his phoenix song, or to his mandragora cry?

**** V good point, harry would need a magical buttplug to prevent any farts escaping. (Sorry for the imagery but I'm laughing my head off right now)

Hmmm. Phoenix cries according to fandom wiki increase courage of the good and strike fear into hearts of evil. Harry as an adolescent mandrake phoenix-hybrid could cause catatonic fear in those who are evil, leaving them an unconscious blubbering mess that instantly wet themselves. For those who are good the mandrake cry makes the phoenix song so potent that they no longer fear anything, even death. This causes some very bold and darkly humourous events that cross the line between daring and fatally stupid.
