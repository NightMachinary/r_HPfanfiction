Snape's motivation for opposing Voldemort is (among other things) atonement for his past affiliations and actions. He seeks to achieve this by risking his life for the lives of other people, and working to bring down Voldemort and the DEs. He opposes anti-muggleborn slurs when they're used in his presence. Nor is he particularly shy about this- he openly states he thinks Harry should be grateful to him, or when he thinks Dumbledore is taking him for granted, or when he thinks he's more useful than Sirius. Snape does the job, and enjoys when that's acknowledged

#+begin_quote
  if Snape cares about saving lives, why does he bully children?
#+end_quote

Saving lives and bullying children are, obviously, two different things

#+begin_quote
  Snape does what he does for revenge
#+end_quote

Revenge is never stated or implied to be a primary or secondary motivation of his

I've asked this several times with no evidence given, nor do I expect any because 1. there isn't any lol, 2. this sub's weirdo anti-snape bias, but

Snape never expresses a desire for revenge, or anger or hatred towards Voldemort, *once*

In his own words, Snape wants so:

Save lives, protect Harry for Lily

Also, I can't recall a single scene where Draco displays overt bigotry or uses slurs in front of Snape that he then ignores. I asked for evidence of this in the books, and again, didn't get any

Snape is Voldemort's right hand. I think we can all agree on this. The Carrows are quite far down the pecking tree compared to Snape - Voldemort has been known to acquiesce to Snape's requests in the past as well.

Snape is also the Headmaster of Hogwarts when the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable/preferred form of punishment.

Make of that what you will.

Only one that I can think of is when he yells out, "You'll be next, Mudbloods!" in front of a large crowd of students, but Snape hasn't arrived there at that time. But then, Albus and Minerva also don't do anything about it then (or later) so it's basically everyone giving their go-ahead to Draco.

snape is also directly taking orders from dumbledore then, as well as conversing with the other headmasters. none of the other staff do anything either- they can overpower snape, or use their combined magical ability to come up with some solution to prevent the torture of students, but don't.

we see snape agreeing to protect the students, and we know he directly gave light 'punishments' e.g. sending them with hagrid

tbh, i think jkr used DH as an opportunity to let neville shine, as she does several times throughout the series where having effective adults would take away from teenagers

we /see/ snape stopping harry from being cruciated in hbp. i don't see any coherent, IC reason snape would allow students to be cruciated unless the plot made it a necessity

And bring Voldemort's wrath on themselves and the school full of students, of course. They should definitely be doing that.

Let's be real here, Snape can tell the Carrows to back down and they would do it thanks to Snape's elevated stature with Voldemort. Snape might not be the one who's using the curse himself, but he definitely has the power to stop it from happening, and he doesn't. The other teachers have no such power.

snape demonstrates the ability to implant an idea and make it seem like it was your own, and then forget who cast the confundus. you're telling me the combined magical powers of mcg, flitwick, slug etc. can't implant a 'don't torture the students' idea onto the carrows? or snape?

**** Snape begs Voldemort to spare Lily, and Voldemort does give her two chances to step aside. Considering the fact that Lily's son is prophesised to kill him, that she's a muggleborn, and that this is Voldemort we're talking about, him giving her a couple of chances is sort of the equivalent of Voldemort being merciful.

He also doesn't kill Snape on the spot for attempting to thwart his attempt on the Stone and for being late to the reunion of the Death Eaters in book 5 when Snape does show up. Karkaroff does not get any such favour from Voldemort - as soon as he reaches Karkaroff's spot in the circle, he announces that Igor must die.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

After all this time?

Always.

That is: Snape's motivation is entirely unchanged since 1981, when he would happily see the husband and child of the woman he supposedly loves die so that he could have her for himself.

He still does not care one iota for Harry. Nor does he care about what is right. He does good things not because they are good, but because he has a twisted obsession with a dead woman. JKR calls it love because she has some weird ideas about love, but the reader can make up their own mind as to the moral worth of Snape's actions. You cannot love a woman and simultaneously want her child to die. That isn't love, it's a dangerous, stalker-ish obsession. The books even foreshadow this, with Slughorn in HBP warning the class about the dangers of obsessive love.

So Snape's actions are entirely motivated by his obsession with Lily. We should be clear that he doesn't really represent what her interests would have been, had she been alive. His motivation is not "What would Lily want?" If he was genuinely carrying out Lily's wishes he wouldn't treat Harry like shit. Even though he considers himself to be acting out of love, in fact his actions continue to reflect his self-interest. That is consistent with a stalker-like obsession.

So he's acting on behalf of someone who was killed /against their killer/, yet not in the dead person's interests, nor in the interests of justice itself. "Revenge" seems to be the only suitable classification.

This was how things were left at the end of DH. JKR has tried to rehabilitate Snape in Cursed Child, but that was in an alternate universe where he lived for 20 more years. At best it shows that Snape had the capacity to start doing good things out of a desire to do good, but as of the end of DH he wasn't there yet.

nothing in canon suggests this. he was committed to saving her life, and indifferent to the deaths of harry and james. that's different to actively wishing them dead, and nothing suggests it was done so he could 'have' her. he turned himself in to dumbledore and said he'd do 'anything' to keep her safe. can't have her if he's in azkaban, or dead

you can care about and act on behalf of someone's wishes without caring about or acting on /all/ of them. it isn't all or nothing. had she been alive, she'd have wanted voldemort gone. that's what's he's working towards

#+begin_quote
  So he's taking actions on behalf of a dead person, but not in that dead person's interests, but rather to satisfy his own obsession.

**** You're hanging onto that "only those whom I could not save" quote closely, but it doesn't chime with his actions. In HBP Snape arranges for the death of Emmeline Vance, an Order member, to cement his position as a spy. He could have saved her easily - he simply had to choose not to be the cause of her death. But he actively causes to her death in order to advance the war against Voldemort. It's simply untrue that he considers saving lives more important than defeating Voldemort.

As for the rest, it more or less all hinges on this point:

#+begin_quote
  no, snape's love for lily remains unchanged since 1981, but how he expresses that love and the dynamics of the love itself have
#+end_quote

There is no basis for saying this. Snape's statement "always" was in direct response to Dumbledore questioning his motivation ("Surely you have not come to care for the boy?"). He is saying that his motivation remains his loyalty to Lily. If his actions are for Lily, then that means he is *not* doing things because he considers them right, nor out of genuine concern for the people he is protecting. Indeed, the context of the statement is to rebut the idea that he is protecting Harry because he thinks Harry merits protection in his own right.

Once you have established that his sole motivation is Lily, this leads to the above analysis of his relationship with a dead woman being completely unaltruistic in nature. This leads to the classification of revenge not out of "elimination" but by meeting the definition of revenge: following a person's death, he is seeking the downfall of that person's killer for reasons other than justice. That is pretty much the definition of revenge.

Requiring the books to explicitly state that Snape's motivation is revenge is not how literature works.

Noooo, his "Always" was a response to Dumbledore questioning his continuing love of */LILY/*. Allow me to remind you how that conversation went:

Dumbledore asks, in his Dumbledore way, if Snape perhaps might have come to care for "the boy" - being Harry.

Snape's response: *"For /HIM/? EXPECTO PATRONUM!"*

And out comes the dove, following which is the oft-quoted "Always" exchange.

Snape's line is pertinent here, because if you take the entire exchange into account rather than just the end of it, it makes it perfectly clear that the reason Snape turned spy, the reason he did everything he did is */for LILY'S sake/*. Harry is tangential at best to Snape's motivations, and that only because he is Lily's son.

** I hope this isn't considered off-topic, but considering how there's like 2.5 anti-Snape threads in the top 4 posts of this subreddit at the time of my typing, and I assume this is a pro-Snape one in response to those; I'm going to post a thought or two about him.

I'm going to start off by saying if people dislike him because of his actions, then of course that's fine. People hate assholes and Snape is a massive one, though for me personally I find him amusing because of his antics. The thing I don't get is why people try and throw modern buzzwords at him when pretty much none of them apply.

Incel - This seems to be a favorite one these days. Snape shows zero signs of hating women or attractive men in general. He hates a lot of people, but not because of those traits.

Stalker - I've seen him called this a few times, but once again don't think it applies. After Lily severed all ties at the end of 5th year there's zero mention of Snape ever following her or harassing her after his first attempt at reconciling. Snape wasn't following her around the corridors, or looking through her window after she married James. They went their separate paths, with Lily going one way and Snape going his darker way.

Friendzoned - This one has been used a couple of times. This term is usually used when a woman rejects a man's romantic advances. Nobody ever owes anyone else anything. I don't like this term because it puts undeserved blame on women. I'm including it here because Snape never blames Lily for their falling out. Though it's never stated I believe that the bulk of the reason that he hates himself is because he knows he's the one responsible for the end of their friendship and her death. He blames himself and not Lily.

Creepy - Snape is very, very mean, but I don't think he's that creepy. The creepiest thing he's done is rip a picture and keep the part that had Lily with him. The other part where he rips the part of the letter with Lily's love is something that people do when they lose a loved one. I have family members who keep personal items like that of deceased ones. I also don't buy into the belief that he tried to spare Lily so he could try and get with her after her husband and son died. Snape's biggest priority was to get her to live. Voldemort doesn't really understand the concept of love, so his rationale for Snape asking to spare her is because of desire (lust). That doesn't make it true.

The point of this post isn't to try and convince people not to dislike Snape, but to just stop using these words to describe him. I don't mean to be rude, but when people use these words for Snape it seems cheap and as if they can't form an actual argument. There are plenty of valid arguments to dislike him out there.

** "I did a quick scan for "Mud" in All except for DH, and I found no instance of it happening in front of a teacher except for Draco when he was in the Astronomy tower at the end of HBP. So, no. There's no time where we know it happened. But as we've seen other times it doesn't make it impossible for it to have happened off-screen, it isn't like we see everything that happens at all times. Only what's relevant for the larger story.

#+begin_quote
  Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face. It wasn't a pretty sight. Hermione's front teeth --- already larger than average --- were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin --- panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.

  “And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice. Snape had arrived.\\
  The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”

  “Potter attacked me, sir ---”

  “We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.

  “--- and he hit Goyle --- look ---” Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.

  Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.

  “Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!” He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth --- she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back.

  Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight. It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however. “Let's see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions.”

** Returning to lay out some of my feelings about Snape:

Snape was childish, a bully, petty, all these awful things.. but he wasn't an entirely bad person. Snape also spent a large part of his life lying to everyone around him in an attempt to atone for his past sins, and tried to save everyone he could, but that doesn't make him an entirely good person either. Too many times, I see people talking about how they never agreed with Snape's supposed "redemption" and still dislike him as a character, and I'm like, what?? He's not /redeemed/. He's fleshed out. He has a story +which actually might be what redeemed means but whatever+. My point is that it's not supposed to make you like him, it's supposed to show you that there are incredibly complex characters out there and not everything is black and white, a reminder HP sorely needed at the time. You can have a character that remorselessly bullies young children, and that doesn't make them rotten to the core, and it doesn't mean they aren't capable of being a Good Person^{TM} sometimes.

I agree with your thoughts on revenge too. What could Snape possibly want revenge /for/? I definitely don't see it being a source of motivation for him.

Also, that scene with Hermione's teeth is waaay overcited and I'm sick of people using that as the end all, be all of any discussions regarding Snape, ugh.

***** Nah, use it. Pretty solid evidence about Snape being a bully. I'm just tired of it being used as a "so, there!" arguement -- as if you're automatically an equally awful person if you don't think Snape is 100% awful after that scene. Yeah, he is awful, but he's other things too.

This entire thread has people angrily saying that OP is ignoring all his bad faults and "cherry-picking" what's good about it. Not denying that either, but those same people are doing the same exact thing with what's bad about it. Hate him all you want, but don't act like it's unreasonable for people to see good in him, too. Snape ain't all good or all evil.

If you're using it to prove Snape is a bully, Snape is petty, Snape is abusing his position of power to psychologically damage those weaker than him, then by all means, go ahead. But please stop using it in unrelated arguements, like his stance on blood purity and its associated slurs, for example.

***** Yup. The main issue people have with his redemption Imo is that it was selfish reasoning. Snape is a vindictive asshole but he did have a redemption. What I think people also forget is that he joined the death eaters when he would have been under 20 and that's not something I'd imagine you can leave easily. I'd probably be a moody angry person too if I was forced to do something I didn't want for over a decade. Doubly so since it seems to me that snape is a potions prodigy/perfectionist who can't understand why other people aren't as good as him. The bullying, yeah it's dickish and wrong.

** A firm belief of mine is that there is no such thing as a good person, or a bad/evil person. There are bad choices, and evil actions, but then again there may also be a good reason behind the evil action. The point is, the world is not black and white.

In the case of Severus Snape, we cannot look at his actions as if he is a normal person who had a normal childhood and went through normal experiences. His father was abusive, and he had to watch as Eileen Prince was beaten and abused and still would not leave his father. I do believe he loved his mother, and this would have been a horrifically traumatic experience.

Then, he meets Lily Evans and befriends her - his very first friend. His only friend. When there is one person in the entire world who will stand up for you, you latch onto them, and fall in love (or at least become infatuated).

The next big plot point is Lily and Snape's argument, where Snape calls Lily a Mudblood. Let's remind ourselves - Snape had an abusive father, and children growing up in abusive households will often have anger issues. He had just been humiliated by James Potter and his gang, and Lily Evans, a woman in a rather backwards, old fashioned society, had swooped in to save him. Embarrassment from the ordeal itself and the need for help prompted a rather rash outburst. Calling Lily a Mudblood was a bad choice by Snape, however, in the heat of the moment, with his sort of background, what happened was the logical sequence of events.

Lily cuts herself off from him, and the one thing stopping Snape from embracing the Dark Side was gone. However, he still cared deeply for her, so he asked the Dark Lord to spare her. He didn't ask him to spare her husband or child because he cared about neither. James bullied him for years, and for no valid reason at all. He had never met Harry, and the child of his only friend and his childhood enemy... It would be logical for him to harbor some resentment, and for that resentment to grow when Lily dies because of him. James eventually grew up, and Snape didn't, but James had loving parents and money and he was the most popular guy at school. Snape was abused and probably not very well off and the teachers ignored the bullying. James would eventually mature like a normal person. Snape never was /normal/. But I digress. The Dark Lord promises to spare Lily... but then does not. Lily was the only person he cared about in the entire world now his mother was dead. The Dark Lord broke his word and now was gone. He had been spying for Dumbledore, but I doubt he would trust him after he stood by for seven years of bullying. He took his best option: Staying out of Azkaban and working for Dumbledore, the only person who would give him a second chance. But there wasn't anyone in the world that he genuinely cared about, not anymore.

After this analysis, my final thoughts are: that Snape doesn't need haters, he needs a therapist.

He made some bad decisions and did some bad things, but he was probably mentally unstable from a childhood of abuse and seven school years of bullying. I don't think we can say he was a good person, but we can't really say he was a bad one either, because I don't think either exists. Good people can do bad things, and bad people can do good things, but does this make them the opposite? A better question: Is this something we can really judge? And I believe the answer is no. Humans are immensely complicated. Actions and intentions are interwoven and tangled and just a complete mess, and Snape is no exception.

And he only left them after Voldemort targetted the one person he cared about. Not before. Not when innocents were murdered.

And even after he left them, he showed that he was scum. He bullied and abused children who never did anything to him. He arranged the death of Vance. He let children be tortured by Death Eaters.

**** We were never told Voldemort's goals were in canon. All we know is he fought for the Pure blood agenda, despite being a half-blood. A popular fan theory is that the horcruxes he created caused him to go insane, which isn't that unbelievable. Perhaps he joined when he believed in the Dark Lord's ideals, and like many others, could not leave when these changed for fear of death. Or perhaps not, the books are notorious for not fleshing out characters.

He bullied children --- it's been shown abused kids are more likely to grow up and be abusive. Frankly, it's Dumbledore's fault for letting James Potters bullying have no consequences, and then hiring a traumatised person who had bad experiences as a child to work with children. Again. Snape needs a therapist.

He arranged someone's death --- somebody else has said: we don't know if he actually did it or not, he was telling Bellatrix and he may have been lying. I'm actually not too knowledgeable on this subject, but I do believe Dubledore would have known what he was doing, yes?

Letting children be tortured --- the entire last book, he was taking orders from the portrait of Dumbledore, AND he hates children.

Look, Snape is mentally not okay. He can't be okay after all he went through. Some things he did cannot be justified rationally, but that is because his mind is /irrational/. I still stand by my point. Snape needs a therapist, not haters.
