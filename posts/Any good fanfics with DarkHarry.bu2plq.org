I've always craved Harry to be much powerful than he was portrayed as in canon, And me hating on dumbledore for being a manipulative bastard. I don't really mind any pairing but my favorite one would have to be Harry/Tom Riddle/Voldemort


** Harry is quite powerful and Dumbledore gets shit on in all these fics:

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

Then you are totally wrong about her character.

Hermione is the most ruthless and vicious of the Trio, as long as she thinks she has the right cause.

Someone who sets a teacher on fire at age 12 is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who steals rare ingredients from a teacher, brews an illegal potion, knocks out two classmates, abducts and impersonates them, and interrogates another is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who traps a slandering journalist in a jar for days and later still has the nerve to blackmail her is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who starts an underground student armed gang is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who curses a contract, cons fellow students to sign it, and will scar violators for life is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who cheats by using memory charms on a broomstick flyer high up in the air so her friend can get on the team is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who goes out with the most disgusting jock in the school just to make her potential boyfriend jealous is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who makes her parents to think they are totally different persons is goody-two-shoes?

Gimme a break!

Out of the Trio, she's the most at risk of going dark. Considering what they went through, maybe she's one already by the end of DH, or she might never make it to the position of the Minister in that cesspool known as British Ministry of Magic.

I disagree, none of these don't make her a goody-two-shoes. I can explain why, despite your exaggerations of many of these events, but it's honestly a waste.

I'll just say these fit perfectly with her boring, overly moralistic personality.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I highly recommend Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7. It definitely has a very dark Harry that really struggles with the whole good vs. evil thing. I recommended this to someone yesterday and I'm way too lazy to rewrite my opinion lmao so I'm gonna copy and paste what I wrote.

Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 was absolutely incredible, although it's definitely a hard read. I've only done 1 read-through, and I've been trying to get around to reading it once more. It's a WBWL fic where James and Lily are still alive, but Harry still gets sent to the Dursley's (around age 8 I think). James and Lily never abuse Harry, but he grows up in the shadow of his twin Skyler. As he gets older he becomes more resentful of them, and feels the need to prove that he's a better wizard than Skylar. It's a much darker Harry because due to certain events he ends up living with Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers, and Voldemort. You can imagine what kind of childhood that leads to.

The reason I loved it so much was because of how the author writes Harry's character. Harry is not a great guy in this, but you can understand why he does the things he does, and you can sympathize with him. He‘s childish and naive in his resentment towards his family, but that's because a 13/14 year old is still a child. So many Dark!Harry fics have him characterized as an “adult-child”, where he acts like a fully grown man at the age of 13. This is a dark, angry, bitter Harry who has the understanding and outlook on life as a growing child. He's always a bit more mature, but that's because he goes through some horrible shit that forces him to grow up fast. But even through this, you can see through his “adult” act, and that underneath he's just a scared kid who wants to prove himself.
