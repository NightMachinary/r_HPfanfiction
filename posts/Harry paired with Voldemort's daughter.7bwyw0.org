** Google "Harry/Delphini", with the quotes. Most of the stories are pointless smut (and bad smut at that) but some actually have something that resembles a plot. A few are even actually readable.

*** To be Honest, since i had the idea about Delphi pairing with anyone, the picture of her seducing Harry, Ron or their Children (sexually) to either corrupt them or destroy their family was tempting and i could only see her for this "Purpose". Sure, there is a way, that Harry adopting her to care for her, but such a Story would be Boring (didnt read cursed child, dont see it as Canon), maybe my "Older Man/Younger Woman" Mind is going crazy again.

**** Nah such a storyline would be pretty interesting. Viable, even - I could see Harry falling to such a temptation after 20 years of marriage. Bonus points if Delphi has second thoughts about going through with her plan, because Harry is just so /nice/ to her.

If you find something like that let me know!

***** your post is confusing me. Do you want (like me) to read a Fic, where Delphi seduce Harry or Ron to corrupt or destroy them or that Harry adopts her to give her a Chance? My "such a story would be boring" was for the adopting part (without any intent of her manipulating them). So either the smut or the no-smut way.

  Voldemort has taken another route...one he had not considered. With the murder of Lily and James, Harry was taken away by Voldemort and raised as his own son, only his masterful pulling of the strings has kept his continued survival hidden so long, but what will happen when a different Harry Potter comes to light? What will happen when the son and daughter of the Dark Lord enter the world together...

** I'm blanking on the name but there is one with Tracy Davis I believe. Snape gives him liquid luck to help him get over someone's death and he goes out and gets lucky (I couldn't resist) with Tracy and she ends up being Voldy's daughter.

-- It was Felix Felicis Fortuna but it's abandoned after 45k words so not sure if you want to start

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
