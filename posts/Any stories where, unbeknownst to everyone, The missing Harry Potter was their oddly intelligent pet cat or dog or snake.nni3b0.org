Just finished reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11222279/1/Flower-Power]] and it reminded me of stories where Harry was a witches pet dog or a random cat that hung around the castle or a slytherin's pet snake and I'd like to find other stories where Harry has gone missing and just spends time near the people looking for him as an animal or plant or whatever.


** Growing up kneazel. Harry uses accidental magic to turn into a kneazel to get away from the dursleys and is adopted by Mrs. Fig's cats.

Results in some hilarious situations when he casually launches himself out of open windows. The entire time before becomes a human he hung around Ginny a lot, she thought he was just a weird cat.
