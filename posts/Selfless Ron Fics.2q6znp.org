Looking for fics where Ron is a decent selfless caring individual. Any good ones out there?


** Ronald Billius Weasley? Scourge of the world? Death Eater in the making? Love Potioneer, rapist, pig, and completely out to use Harry for his personal gain? You want a fic where he is... A good person??????

???????

I think you might be in the wrong fandom, friend.

(In seriousness I've almost never seen a fic like this where it doesn't come off as ham-handed and awful, I may look into it though and report back if I find anything)

**** I don't think canon Ron really fits the description of selfless. He's insecure, jealous, kinda thoughtless and.. human, basically. He definitely gets judged too harshly, though.

***** He sacrifices himself in Book 1, goes to the chamber to rescue his sister in Book 2, "if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill us too" in book 3, book 4 Harry is the only one relevant to the plot, book 5 he follows Harry to the DoM and duels Death Eaters for his friend, book 6 same again, book 7 he goes on a hour roux hunt to kill the most evil wizard of all time when he had no obligation to and in fact put his family in danger because he was standing up for what is right, he comes back when free of the Horcrux and is the only person to consider the House Elves in the BoH and he himself fights to the end and stares down Voldemort "he beat you".

I'd say selfless is pretty accurate.

****** I'll concede that he has his moments, but there's also: being a little shit towards Hermione all the time, refusing to believe and abandoning his supposed best friend due to jealousy during GoF, and abandoning them again during the horcrux hunt. And, yeah, he was affected by the horcrux, but so were Harry and Hermione.

He does selfless things sometimes, but I wouldn't describe him as a selfless person.

******* Eh Hermione is as much of a bitch to him as he is to her, ultimately they are good to each other. Goblet you have to look at from his point of view. He wanted in the tournament, probably thought it was his big chance to finally step out of the shadows, likely he spent weeks dreaming about his name being pulled even though he's too young...then it's his super famous BFF. So what he gets jealous at 14, Harry ditched Hermione the year before over a broom and no one holds it up as an example of how awful he is. Then DH, he is affected by it more because he actually has something to loose and is an insecure person. That doesn't mean he isn't selfless, he tries to come back as soon as he can. I think there's more of an argument to be had for him being selfless than not.

******** RE: your example of Harry ditching Hermione over the Firebolt.

In the lead-up to that event, Ron accused Hermione of being upset that no one "spent that much on her." Has Hermione -at any point- come across as materialistic? Ron was definitely projecting his own values system onto her. Harry, in fact, is the one to end Hermione's 'exile' from their group by suggesting they make up with her.

In regards to your previous examples, you left out that Ron also called Hermione a nightmare leading to her situation with the troll in PS. Harry -not Ron- was the one who took off for the bathroom (although to his credit, Ron did follow). CoS Ron is one of my favorite characters of the series despite his other shortcomings in the other books. His loyalty to Harry at a time when the BWL was decidedly unpopular is great on every reread. That loyalty is absent, however, after Dumbles' admonition to keep Harry in the dark regarding Order activities at the beginning of OOtP. Harry is extremely quick to forgive Ron and Hermione for this betrayal, as well as the betrayals in GoF and DH.

All of these specific instances become immaterial, however, whenever I think about Ron's values system in comparison to Harry's. Our earliest glimpse of Harry shows him lacking the Dursley's materialism and unwarranted self-importance. Ron -the second youngest of seven- in his first interaction with Harry apologizes for having a home cooked lunch prepared by a loving mother. That speaks volumes.

Because it's irrelevant, he made a comment to his friend about someone who frankly was being a nightmare, she overheard and ran off crying. Then Voldemort let a troll in that happened to find her. In the normal progression of things he'd likely have apologised the next day and life gone on.

Yes. How awful of a poor /thirteen year old/. Hermione betrays her friends by reporting them to a teacher without even consulting them first. Imagine how you'd react if that had been Ron?

Hermione does this too. Again no one cares. Also, totally the right thing to do, there was a war going on any intercepted letters could have been a disaster.

#+begin_quote
  as well as the betrayals in GoF and DH.
#+end_quote

Because GoF isn't a big deal and DH he was being controlled by Voldemort in essence and saved Harry's life the instant he came back, essentially killing his insecurities in doing so.

Yes how dare the poor eleven year old not grasp the value of a loving family having grown up embarrassed and mocked by being poor right when the most famous boy in the wizarding world is spending more money than he's ever seen on /sweets/ while he holds his hand me down rat and hand me down wand.

Your main issue with Ron seems to be that he's realistic.

Only if you're pushing the narrative that he contributed more than he hindered. Which is very subjective.

How on /earth/ could you know that?

This thread is about Ron. I understand that you think he's being held to a higher standard than other main characters, but I'm unable to maintain objectivity about that scene in OOtP where Hermione is concerned. Her previous actions point to a distinct lack of respect for authority. After McGonagall's flippant dismissal in PS, she joined Harry in an effort to stop a teacher from accomplishing his goals. /She/ raised the possibility of brewing polyjuice, stole the ingredients from Snape, and was on her way to tell Harry (not the faculty) the basilisk was traveling via pipes in CS, she attacked Snape in the Shrieking Shack in PoA, and helped Harry with tournament preparation in GoF - which may or may not have been against the spirit or rules of the competition. For her to keep information from Harry purely upon Dumbledore's insistence goes against the previous glimpses we've seen of her character.

#+begin_quote
  Again no one cares.
#+end_quote

I cared a /lot/. I didn't finish OOtP for years because of that scene. The sweeping character retconning made absolutely no sense and (strictly my own opinion) was the bellwether for a disappointing second half of the series. Until that scene she was by far my favorite character and afterwards I didn't recognize her.

#+begin_quote
  GoF isn't a big deal
#+end_quote

Agree to disagree. Despite being told people have died in previous TWTs, Ron's materialistic nature wins out over loyalty to a friend. Hermione grapsed the gravity of the situation. Why couldn't he? Frankly I'm baffled as to why JKR did this, unless it was simply a cheap trick to add an additional source of conflict. Ron had already been previously loyal when Harry was the presumed Heir of Slytherin. I would have much rather seen Ron telling off Harry's detractors as he did in CoS.

#+begin_quote
  he was being controlled by Voldemort in essence
#+end_quote

This didn't happen in a vacuum as both Harry and Hermione experienced the same stimulus and did not produce the same selfish histrionic result.

#+begin_quote
  Yes how dare the poor eleven year old not grasp the value of a loving family
#+end_quote

You're vacillating between two extremes: insisting that Ron is the most human character because of his faults and dismissing criticisms of those faults as being unempathetic; nearly turning those same vices into virtues.

#+begin_quote
  Your main issue with Ron seems to be that he's realistic.
#+end_quote

No, but I think we've reached an impasse over subjective interpretations.

******* As for the tent scene, here's what I think of it. Ron was wearing the Horcrux and was affected by it. You know how Horcruxes work- they feed off the insecurities of their hosts so Ron, an already insecure person under its influence, overreacted and acted rashly on his emotions- but so did Harry. If you'll recall, Harry, who was currently unaffected by the Horcrux, raged back at Ron telling him to leave. They both acted Impulsively and rashly and both almost immediately regretted their actions afterwards.

I saw it simply as two teenagers cooped up too long together(A situation not helped by the horcrux, lack of news, and lack of food) And needing space to cool off. Due to their concealment charms and the snatchers he couldnt go back until he finally did.

** Umm... The closest I can come up with is Hope by Jeconais on fanficauthors.net

It's a Post Hogwarts HP/GD story, and Ron pays a small part in it. But there is absolutely no bashing.

Pretty sad that 'no bashing' is the closest I can come up to meeting your request, I don't think the fandom likes Ron at all.

** The only one I can think of where Ron is a decent, ordinary guy is [[http://trickster.org/res/transfig.html][Transfigurations by Resonant]], however, he isn't in the story all that much. It's mostly about magical theory, post-war (as if books 4 or 5 onward never happened, I think?), and is eventually HP/DM slash. That said, it's a fantastic magical theory, post-war fic, and quite hilarious at times. I think the characterization of Ron is really great, and he even becomes the [[/s][Spoiler for ending]]!

** It's an older fic, but I remember liking Marietsy's Flame of Betrayal which is a Harry-in-Azkaban fic where Ron sticks by Harry. But, it's unfinished and likely abandoned. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2745164/1/Flames-of-Betrayal]]

Also, Hope by Jeconis if you're okay with it not being Ron-focused. He's a secondary character, but this is probably my favorite 'grown-up' Ron. (This one is finished.) [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]]

** Recently read Words Fail Me by Solstice Muse on FFN.net. Its good one, only a bit AU (Ron is mute because of injuries occuring during the final battle) and Ron is great in it-- funny, caring, kind, etc. Well-written in general, thought the summary if you read it is weirdly formatted--don't let that put you off.

I would link but I'm on my phone, sorry! I was considering posting asking for similar fics earlier this week-- its really frustrating that I can never find fics featuring Ron being awesome, funny, and kind like he is in canon-- he's one of my favorite characters and always seems to get shafted in fics.
