I've seen a lot of recommended fics that feature romance that is... unfulfilling. The characters are both very, very blatant about their mutual interest (like, even more so than the normal lovestruck teenager), but somehow only get together after a ridiculous series of events. I'm not saying that doesn't/can't happen, of course, and maybe the problem is exacerbated by the frequent use of omniscient third person perspective instead of limited, but can you guys recommend me some fics that do /not/ feature characters acting ridiculously [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schmoop][schmoopy]], at least until they start dating?


** Perhaps you could specify a little more. What are you looking for? Canon pairings? Harmonie? Dramonie? Drarry? Ron/luna? Snape/lily wolfstar? Because perhaps someone has a sirius/hermione very well written but you might despise the ship.

*** I guess I didn't clarify because I don't personally care. I'm fine with any ship so long as it is well written and believable. I generally prefer more... reasonable... pairings like Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, etc., but I'll take whatever you've got that's really well done and avoids the aforementioned schmoopiness.

EDIT: I guess I'd prefer to avoid slash? But again, I'll read it if the characters are realistic.

**** Some of my favorites. Not all of them are romantic completely but, I think they match your request. And Yes, I like lily/snape hahaha, but the snily stories IMO tend to avoid or subvert most cliches and are very well written.

******** Because he's a miserable wreck, and even though the was a death eater, stood with the light to the moment of his death. He could have gone full villain again anytime, specially after dumbledore's death But he didn't.

At the end even if it was because he was full of guilt and sorrow, he did his part to defeat a genocidal dark lord. It doesn't fully reedem him, it never will, after all he was a Petty asshole and a lousy teacher who hold a grunge with his bully after his longtime death and lash out in innocent kids. But in the end he did the right thing, and that deserves recognition.

He's still probably going to hell, though

It is slash, Harry/Draco, but I feel it's a great introduction or option for someone who's never been into slash or that pairing before. It's epilogue-compliant, the characterizations are super on point, and the plot is gradual and realistic (as much as a story about British wizards can be, anyway). Give it a shot!
