** I don't think Tom Riddle ever "became" Voldemort. Voldemort was always his true self, and Tom Riddle was just a mask he wore before he was strong enough to let the world see his true self.

** Here's my Cliffs Notes about how Tom became Voldemort (literally writing this on the spot, hopefully won't miss anything).

Tom Riddle is a psychopath. He has difficulty empathizing with others. He harms animals. He harms other humans and revels in the mysterious power he has. He knows he is different, that he is better.

He finds out he is a wizard. That there is a society of mages. That there is a school to learn magic. He's told by Dumbledore that his stealing is wrong, Tom isn't forgiving about this. Tom also lets on that he is a parselmouth, therefore a descendant of Slytherin. Dumbledore doesn't tell him about his ancestry. Tom is given money to buy his things, I imagine it was disgusting for him to be the recipient of charity.

Tom goes to Hogwarts. To anyone else he is a Mudblood, they look down upon him. He doesn't yet know whether he is better than others. After all, they are as magic as he is, maybe some are even better. He is very ignorant.

Tom is Sorted into Slytherin. His peers are exceptionally discriminatory and bullying towards him. Maybe he bullies them back, I think not -- not yet. He works hard. He studies. He wants to learn how he came to be magical himself. But more importantly he needs to get better than his peers, and better than the older kids who look down on him.

A few years pass. He becomes an exceptional wizard. His genius is recognized by his peers and tutors, but it's not enough. He must become something more, and the Slytherin ancestry he recently uncovered helps him towards that. He cannot claim the Slytherin name, but he'll create a name all will fear to utter, these basic wizards who shunned him earlier in his life. They would learn to fear him.

He shared his ancestry with a few peers. They recognize his superiority due to his skill and the threat he posed. He was the "top dog" in Slytherin, and to prove is Greatness he uncovered Slytherin's hidden chamber in Hogwarts, he unleashed the beast within, killing Myrtle Warren, and manipulated the faculty into expelling the oaf half-giant Hagrid. He proved what he was to them, that night. He was something more. And they could be with him or be left behind.

He found his Gaunt relatives and destroyed them, killing his weak Muggle relatives too. At age sixteen he uses the death of his father to create his first Horcrux and attain a version of immortality. It is an absurd, unparalleled achievement. To those who know of Lord Voldemort when he was still at school, they know he is easily the most talented student to have ever walked its halls.

Tom speaks to his followers about Saint Walpurga battling pests and disease, and they, the the Knights of Walpurgis, will extermination Muggles and subjugate the Mudbloods. They are not merely inferior, but are vermin. His peers respect him. Revere him. Are in awe of him. But he didn't care for their respect or reverence, it is to be expected, he thought he was special because he was magical when a boy, it turned out to be he was exceptional among wizards. Horace Slughorn speaks to him of working for the Ministry, working his way up and becoming the Minister for Magic. Possessing real influence and control.

Upon leaving Hogwarts he didn't go to the Ministry. Instead he dropped the name Tom Riddle entirely, adopting Lord Voldemort exclusively. He uses his skills at Borgin and Burkes to accumulate treasure. No doubt raising funds from the clueless customers and leaving them none the wiser for it. Then he happens upon two truly priceless treasures. The Locket of Salazar Slytherin, and the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff. These are irresistible to Voldemort and he cannot pass up the opportunity.

In short order the Cup and Locket are his. He leaves his job immediately. Despite his work he has delved deeply into the Dark Arts, acquiring Dark tomes and scrolls, learning the most esoteric of magic. Magics so Dark they haven't been seen in Britain for centuries, millennia. Now with his wealth he goes abroad with his followers, learns from other practitioners of the Dark Arts. He locates the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw. By now, he has four Horcruxes and a deep well of followers at home and abroad. His Death Eaters. They have sown terror throughout Europe with their bone white masks, his followers certainly had their fill of blood, meanwhile Voldemort is destroying any skilled witches or wizards who might cause problems when he truly reveals himself.

He returns to Hogwarts. A guise, of course, to hide the Diadem of Ravenclaw in the Room of Hidden Things. There is an elegance and irony to it. Dumbledore calls him "Tom", and Voldemort sees no need any longer to hide his new name. There is some surprise when Dumbledore rattles off a list of his followers, but nothing more is done. The old man won't be the first to lift his wand. But Voldemort knows it is only a matter of time ...

Years pass. The Ministry is his in all but name. Wealth, control, and influence do not concern him. But he has proven that Magic is Might. Dumbledore and his Order are beaten back. Every occasion he and Dumbledore fight it leads to a stalemate, but time is something Voldemort has more than anyone else alive. Again, it is only a matter of time. He has eyes and ears everywhere. His follower, Severus, brings him news of a prophecy overheard while spying on Dumbledore, he has the fates in his pocket and the child of prophecy will fall ...

... and that's pretty much how I view Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort. He is perhaps the greatest Dark Wizard to have ever lived. After the rebirth I don't really know what to think. He has to re-establish his base. His Horcruxes are destroyed one by one. Perhaps he does go mad, but he still holds influence, and still has his magical prowess. There are none equal to him. Shame about that Potter boy mucking it up. It is Voldemort's arrogance that killed him, in all other 14,000,604 timelines, Potter gets blown to smithereens in Year 4 and perhaps Voldemort recovers a measure of his previous influence. But then again, canon is weird and Deus ex Machina is the one true god.

*** I think we overlook the time period he grew up in. He was a boy in an orphanage during the Great Depression. That can't have been easy as orphanages would have been grossly underfunded.

Then when he discovers magic he is sent back to an orphanage during WW2, powerless against the bombs falling around him.

He knows that he could easily be defended from the muggle weapons either by magic or by being allowed to stay at Hogwarts, but yet he is alone and in danger at an orphanage. He can't cast a single spell to protect himself.

WW2 in my mind was the biggest part in defining who Voldemort would be.

This would require some alternate history to work. The blitz lasted September 1940 to May 1941. Tom Riddle would have missed it entirely, being at Hogwarts the whole time.

**** Excellent point. That could easily form his desire to get rid of Muggles. Much stronger motivation than simply viewing them as inferior (though that plays a part), warmongering nature of Muggles at the time would definitely feel like an attack on him by Muggles at large.
