“When I was a girl, I had a fear of spiders. I was told they felt no emotions, that their hearts never beat.”

The man squirmed in his lashings, bound to a rickety wooden chair by conjured ropes, his eyes wide and fearful. Muffled whimpers came from behind the gag as a wand trailed leisurely over his cheek. His captor stalked around him, examining her catch, judging its worth, contemplating the kill.

Like a spider in its web.

A small cutting charm, barely noticeable, sliced through the man's gag along with a shade of his five o'clock shadow.

“Speak.”

The man did: rattling off the names of his accomplices, where they lived, what their talents were and what their most recent missions were that he could recall. He kept speaking, barely pausing to take hurried gulps of air, almost as if he knew that as soon as his stream of information ended, so too would his life. Yet the faint glimmer of hope of release kept him going, kept him spouting information that endangered comrade after comrade.

Soon, the man's information simply ran out, and he abruptly stopped speaking. He gasped heavily, his shoulders rising and falling as much as they could despite his restraints, as if his body had not yet realised that he had stopped talking.

The silence was deafening, anticipation heavy in the air. Two hands came to rest on his shoulders, rising slowly in what might be called a caress across his neck, then his chin, then his head.

“Please, you don't need to do this, please just let me go, please, /please-/”

“I was told spiders felt no emotion, that their hearts never beat. But I know the truth. At the moment of the kill, they are never more /alive./”

A sickening snap punctuated the witching hour silence. A leg spasmed, then stilled, the figure slumping in his chair. Staccato clicks followed the woman's stride out of the abandoned warehouse, with a squeal as a shuttered door slid briefly open.

“Do you have the names?” her compatriot asked.

“All those from his local cell, along with a number of home and safehouse addresses, while the missions were out of date or outright false. The late Mr. Podmore was most forthcoming, if poorly informed.”

The man frowned, his gloved hands tightening on his snake-headed cane.

“Disappointing, but not a major setback. Clean up here and let us consolidate information.”

“As you wish, my Lord.”

A grunt of acknowledgement, and the man vanished amidst a twist of robes, silver-threaded hair whipping about him as he twisted away. The woman glanced at the warehouse and flicked her wand, casting a spark towards a small trail of iridescent fluid leading back through the shutter. Not a moment later, the woman followed her liege, frizzy, curly hair kept in a ruthless ponytail just whipping up enough to reveal a black spider insignia on the back of her robes as she vanished into the aether, the roaring of the rapidly-igniting warehouse masking the crack of her apparition, the flames stealing away any trace of their presence. The Order would never link the charred skeleton in a torched muggle warehouse to their missing member.

The Widowmaker had struck again.

** Widowmaker would be heavily nerfed in the HP verse. You need emotions to cast the Unforgiveables.
