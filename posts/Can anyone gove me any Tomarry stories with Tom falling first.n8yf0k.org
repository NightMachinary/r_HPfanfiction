Preferably those with an adult Harry that is either immortal(MOD) or is a Vampire.

I've read Vampiric Return(one of my personal favorites, do try to read this sometime) and Stand Against the Moon's sequel, Nose to the Wind(though this barely qualifies as Tom falling first), and have unfortunately not been able to find any fics that has made me want to reread them as much as these two.

Perhaps it's because of how the Toms in these fics are completely smitten and weak around Harry.

But anyways, I'm looking for fics that are similar to these two, where Tom falls first/Tom is soft for Harry. Got any recommendations?

((/give/ forgive me, I'm on phone))


** These have Tom soft for Harry or have him fall for Harry first:

Linkao3(Sand In My Shoes by purplewitch156)

Linkao3(Entwined by purplewitch156)

Linkao3(Precious by wynnebat)

Linkao3(Voldemort's Assassin Hotline by duplicity)

Linkffn(Green Eyes, Guns, and Dangerous Things by VanillaGhost)

Linkffn(The Burning Taste of Fire Whiskey by The Carnivorous Muffin)

Linkffn(Powerful Men by Lomonaaeren)

Linkffn(Kept Man by Lomonaaeren)

Linkffn(Love: On Air by Watermelonsmellinfellon)

I'm also writing a fic where Tom will fall for Harry first (because Tom is alive sooner and gets primed to fall for Harry), but it's still several chapters away before Harry even shows up. Both Tom and Harry are immortal in mine - Tom via a horcrux and Harry as the Master of Death. The primary focus of my fic is in changing Tom Riddle's backstory and reframing the context of the canon though.

  “Two weeks of sex. That's what you're after?”

  “Nagini would say two weeks of companionship, but ... yes.” Tom fully expected to loath everything about his forced holiday to the island known as Paradise, but that was before he met Harry.

  Voldemort has won. Hogwarts and England are his, but satisfaction is fleeting when Harry Potter, who vanished during the battle, begins to appear in his dreams, fighting for survival in a frigid waste land. As Voldemort grows close to Harry, murderous intent gives way to lustful desire and when he succeeds in bringing Harry back from the Drift, their lives are irrevocably changed forever.

  Harry is a Guide with a secret. But when revealed, the whole world seems like it's out to get him. First The Ministry, then an 'Order', and now a hit man from a covert organization bent on eradicating his kind. The hired gun seems to have an agenda of his own though. But what could Tom, an Alpha Sentinel, want from Harry? (A Tom/Harry Assassin, Omegaverse, and Sentinel/Guide AU).

  AU, HPTMR. Harry Evans is a lowly Dark Patrol wizard who's working hard to advance. He doesn't think much of Senior Undersecretary to the Minister Tom Riddle, but on the other hand, a one-night stand that lets them both get rid of tension seems like a good idea. Except that the one night-stand never seems to end. Fourshot. COMPLETE.

  After the wizarding world learns of a prophecy that appears to indicate Tom Riddle will vanquish the Dark Lord, everyone expects him to defeat Grindelwald. Once it becomes apparent the prophecy doesn't involve Grindelwald, however, the question arises as to who exactly is the Dark Lord referenced. A slow-build tale told in 3 parts. No smut.
