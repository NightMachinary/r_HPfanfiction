A muggleborn student, when after being called a mudblood by certain pureblood, decides to check. A friendly stabbing among dignitaries later comes to the conclusion that her blood does not have mud, and/or A purebloods blood isn't exactly pure.

If something like this already exsists, or something similar (Proving the lack of mud via means of knife) then please let me know.

Inspired by linkffn (Under the veil)

Have a knife day!
