Inspired by [[https://funkyfaerie.tumblr.com/post/616466979714433024/look-i-know-weve-discussed-every-which-way-the][this Tumblr post]]. Are there fics in which all students are re-sorted each year? Seems like an interesting idea.

PS: wasn't sure of the right flair, whether Prompt or Request, but I had to choose one.


** That sounds like a very interesting idea.

I'm wondering whether Hufflepuff, the house of "duffers", would end up being the house people who need change or comfort go to?

If the Sorting happens at the beginning of every year for everyone, and a student is going through a bad phase, would they be put in Hufflepuff, where everyone tries hard to cultivate an environment of love and acceptance because they are the students who need it? Professor Sprout helping that along, checking in with her students to make sure everything is good at home. Maybe some older students who go to/ stay in Hufflepuff because they are finally in the mindframe that let's THEM be the carers now, and help all these younger students find themselves?

Houses wouldn't have the same connotations as they do if they change from being "personality type" to being "current mindset".

Would Gryffindor be the party house? If you're in Gryffindor this year you're either in a pretty confident place or you harbour a deep seated urge to go buck wild and fight the system. Fifth year Hermione Granger, seventh year Neville Longbottom?

Slytherin is often full of older students who are thinking about their goals in life. Maybe they do a lot of networking, employers coming to give job talks to Slytherin house (any other houses are welcome too! It's just mostly Slytherins attending). If you got in Slytherin then that likely means this is the year you take furthering yourself seriously. Younger Slytherins are the kids who feel like the have to prove themselves. Percy Weasley probably spent most of his latter years in Slytherin.

Ravenclaw is for the students with strange interests or the staunch academics, people who want to take it slow for a year and maybe try magic weed, and the emo kid who takes the year to write a full length teen drama novel. The miscellaneous big brain types. Try something new at Ravenclaw! Luna Lovegood still probably spent every year in Ravenclaw, who are we kidding.

Fred and George seem the types to have fluctuated between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw for most of their years. Maybe that final year was Slytherin?

If it's still the Sorting Hat doing it, this process would probably take a very bloody long time, so what if it's more of an instantaneous thing when the students spend their first night in the castle? Hogwarts is probably sentient enough to figure out what House each student needs to be in. Everyone sits wherever they want during Welcoming Feast and as they eat and talk, their house colours flash into existence on their uniforms, several at a time. The equivalent of a Hatstall student is one whose tie keeps changing colours. By the end of the Feast, everyone's colours have settled and they go to their respective houses to meet like minded individuals and hopefully be provided with what they need to flourish that year.

*** Sweet Merlin, you have put some really good thought into this! It's even more appealing than the original post made it seem! Take this poor man's goldðŸ¥‡

*** Interesting discussion points for this AU are: is the school using Divination magic to see what house their student needs most that year, or is it more like the Sorting hat going through your mind as it is on the first day of school and placing you where you need to be in the moment?

If yes to the former option, a confident kid might get confused as to why they're in Hufflepuff this year, they thought they'd be in Gryffindor? But then something happens to shake that confidence like a bad experience or some terrible news and suddenly its very lucky the student is already settled into Hufflepuff. If yes to the latter, would there be a social stigma about that kid going from Gryffindor to Hufflepuff? As much as we know there's nothing wrong with getting the help you need, some people still find it shameful to need a therapist or to 'admit weakness'. And this is a school of children. What would the culture be around Hufflepuff and how would that affect Hufflepuffs?

In the same vein, would parents of children who had never been in Slytherin start worrying over their kid's future? "What are you going to do with your life? Have you thought about your career path??"

No one really understands Ravenclaw students. They all talk like Philosophy undergraduates and the common room is filled with strange projects and there's a discreet brewery corner for entrepreneurial mixologists, Professor Flitwick absolutely knows about this. Someone crocheted a full dress for the Ravenclaw statue. Ask anyone about their special interest and you will have conversation for HOURS. This place is my heaven.

My cat lay across my neck as I wrote this, by the way. I feel this is important news.
