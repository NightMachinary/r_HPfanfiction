******** Yes. Although JKR never was much for logic and consistency when it came to world building.

For "Patron" I assumed that most wizards rely on professionals even if they could do a half-assed spell themselves. Like do it yourself - good for small repairs, but most will let professionals build a house. Or clothes - you can sew very nice things, if you learn how to, but most don't keep their skills up even if they made a jacket in school.

  It is interesting to think that those graduating from Hogwarts would not be able to cast the needed spells to survive. One would think that would be a high priority in the syllabus, but then we are talking about magicals.
#+end_quote

Remember that the canon trio and those around them --- yes, including Ron --- are actually significantly above average. For that matter, I am not sure whether Harry and Ron had the magical arsenal to live off the land: they aren't really shown helping Hermione out in that respect, at least that I can recall.

That said, what fraction of Muggles are genuinely self sufficient? Just because a Wizard can learn to be self-sufficient more easily than a Muggle, doesn't mean it's any more useful or respected. (Consider how society looks at "preppers".)

  Snape, James, Sirius and Peter are not geniuses. And yet, compared to them, Harry falls short.
#+end_quote

Still, the point is that above average refers to a lower bound, not an upper bound, so they are not useful points of comparison.

#+begin_quote
  There is a lot of space between "average" and "extraordinary", and as I said, B's were "Not bad, but not great either." If the class marking follows a standard curve, about 14% of the class would get Bs, as opposed to the 3% or so which get higher. This, however, is rarely the case in secondary/high school education (half the class doesn't fail with <50%). Much more students get B and As then would be expected. Its hard to say how many in HP, because there appears to be no real consequence to failing either.
#+end_quote

I am not sure what this has to do with the likely class ranking of Harry and Ron in the Hogwarts entering class of 1991. We don't know the level of grade inflation in Hogwarts, but given that, say, Hermione wasn't able to pull off an O on her DADA OWL, and given that we know that some fairly formidable students fail them occasionally, I suspect that they are pretty darned rigorous, actually.

#+begin_quote
  If we assume that no one knew that the standards for potions had changed in 6th year, all the students attending must have gotten Os.
#+end_quote

We probably shouldn't assume that, since it's provably false: Harry learns that Slughorn accepts EEs from McGonagall, not from Slughorn himself (HBP, Chapter 9), so at least McGonagall also knows. A more plausible assumption might be that other House heads had similar conversations with their students and informed those that qualify of this fact. Even if /four/ students who could have taken NEWT Potions didn't, that would still mean that Os and EEs together comprise the top four deciles in Potions --- i.e., "significantly above average". [1]

#+begin_quote
  Just because they are called Exceeds Expectations doesn't mean they do. Getting a Distinction doesn't mean the teacher remember you beyond reading your essay either.
#+end_quote

Why would distinction imply that the teacher would remember you? I would think that it just means that you would be distinguished from the rest of the cohort, and then the whole cohort would be forgotten.

Anyway, my sense is that the wizards would be kind of literal about that.

--------------

[1] And yes, I know the difference between "average" and "median". If it were up to me, people would use "median" rather than "average" when they want to say "typical", but they don't, so saying "above median" just makes people look at you funny half the time.

This means there must be a separate culture for those raised to magic, but what is it?

- Similarly, the ISoS is signed 1689, so /why is magical English modern English/? It is heavily implied that magicals were separated before this, and the signing of the ISoS was a formality. If that is the case, magicals should be speaking Middle English, or at the latest, Early Modern English.

This one is actually answered in canon, in at least two separate places. At least, the "can it support life" part is answered with a definitive yes. The Weasley tent at the Quidditch World Cup is bigger on the inside, while Newt's Briefcase in the trailer for the new /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ movie contains said beasts (and Newt himself, for a time).

******** We know that things like the bubble head charm exists, though we don't know how that works. However, it contained enough air for Diggory to complete the second task, so we can make some assumptions. I believe the spell either extremely compresses air and feeds it to the user at a slow rate (unlikely), filters the existing air and extracts air from water (possibly), or summons fresh oxygen from some pure reserve (like the sky) and banishes the spent co2. Logically, whatever process is responsible for this could be applied to an expanded space.

** So, sure, wizarding culture is (in general) ignorant of muggles. But how far does this stretch and where are the overlaps? For example, maths isn't taught at Hogwarts (except the advance arithmancy, and this isn't mandatory). Are there wizarding home schools pre-Hogwarts that cover basic maths? If so, it surely stops well before algebra and the like. This can be expanded for much more: literature, music, etc. Science in particular is interesting. Sure, many of the laws of physics are tossed out the window with magic, but what about anatomy/biology? Astrophysics? Do wizards know that muggles have been to the moon and have weapons capable of destroying the Earth? This goes beyond a simple 'wizards are ignorant'. They can't simply be oblivious to the entire rest of the world. The question is, how far does this extend?
