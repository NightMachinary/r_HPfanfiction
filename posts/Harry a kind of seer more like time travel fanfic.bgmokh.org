So i don't remember much of the story but i know a few things.

1 Harry is a Sytherin

2 he 'guess' the sorting in his first year

3 he is more ingrained with pure bloods

4 i"m like 50% time travel was involved

​

please send help. thank you

​

If you know any story like this please send them


** Um well Harry isn't a first year in this one, but it has people thinking he's a seer when he's really a time traveler, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349/chapters/16316573]] My laptop is unfortunately broken, and I'm unsure how to link this in a less ugly way using my phone, so there ya go. Idk if this is the fic you're looking for, but hope you like it!
