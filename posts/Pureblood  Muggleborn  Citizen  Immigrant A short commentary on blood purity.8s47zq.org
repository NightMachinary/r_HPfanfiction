We see the book through Harry's eyes -- so we're bound to miss out on a lot of how the wizarding world works. He doesn't have to worry about blood purity (as Hermione said in book 6 -- “It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up” -- HBP Ch. 12), and for most of the books he's too young anyway to see the effects of blood purity on wizarding society.

Now, the comparison I often make in my mind is "pureblood vs muggleborn" to "citizen vs immigrant". Imagine wizarding society as its own country with very strict citizenship rules -- you're either grandfathered in, or your family has to spend several generations as productive members in wizarding society and/or marry purebloods to become a proper citizen. Much of the blood purity stuff has explanations then:

High level Ministry posts are restricted to 'citizens', much like the law requires in the UK and most countries in the world. There has never been a muggleborn minister of magic for the same reason there has never been a non-British PM. The Wizengamot, comparable to the House of Lords, is either hereditary or appointed, so naturally its members are mostly purebloods. There may even be laws favoring purebloods for employment, like most countries in the world, that prioritises employing ‘citizens' over ‘immigrants'. All of these parallels in the real world are commonly accepted, so why not in the Wizarding World?

One could cite the bigotry shown by purebloods towards muggleborns in the books as well as violence as entertainment. That is unequivocally wrong. But do we condemn the fundamental idea of nationalism because of its more extreme sides? Similarly, those who hate based on blood purity are unjustified, but is the idea of blood purity as a measurement itself flawed? Is the idea of nationality flawed?

Voldemort and the Death Eaters are akin to a violent fascist movement that seeks to restore power to the citizens of the wizarding world (which may exclude House Elves and other sentient magical creatures) and enact far harsher immigration laws. They may also fear losing their traditional values to a new wave of immigrant culture due to, perhaps, a surge of muggleborns following WWII?

There is no canonical evidence for difference in magical ability due to blood purity, but neither is there empirical evidence for the contrary (i.e. that blood purity doesn't affect magical power at all). So the question of blood purity is reduced to an arbitrary definition of ‘citizenship' defined by the citizens, which would naturally be exclusive, as the wizarding equivalent of the Enlightenment hasn't seemed to have happened.

So why hasn't it? Why haven't the muggleborns risen up demanding more rights? It is possible that they have and were repressed, but it is also possible that there was never an opportunity. After all, it is far easier to leave Wizarding Britain than any physical country. Perhaps a wave of disillusioned muggleborns returning to their old lives led to purebloods condemning all muggleborns as ‘unable to fit in with wizarding culture' and so began a vicious cycle, where Muggleborns are unable to find opportunities in the Wizarding World because the generation before them mostly chose to return to the Muggle world, furthering the idea that muggleborns ‘steal' magic for their own use and do not contribute to wizarding society.

JKR said herself that she modeled Voldemort after Hitler and Death Eaters after Nazis.

JKR's world building was very lacking. Everything was seen through Harry's very limited 3rd person POV, who could be as thick as a kitchen table sometimes. She knew that and that's why she's trying to plug in some holes via Pottermore.

Because of that, fanfic writers have significant freedom in their world building.

** The thing is, in canon, there's not much of a "pureblood culture". We see robes, Quidditch, and not much else. Harry has no idea about the magical world, yet we rarely if ever see him make blunders out of ignorance - none that are related to culture.

Also, it's canon that the law favoured the purebloods; Pottermore states that years after the war, Hermione helped Shacklebolt remove such bigoted laws.

Hermione was off. Bellatrix freaked out at the mere assertion that Voldemort was a half-blood.

Poor comparison. Both pure-bloods and muggle-borns are equally magical (unlike citizenship, which must be given). That's a nonstarter as a comparison.

#+end_quote

No it doesn't. JKR made clear blood purity was ludicrous and based on prejudice, because wizards who are "impure" outperform purebloods all the time. It's completely ridiculous as an idea, as Dumbledore pointed out to Lucius, because old pure-blood families simply burn the "impurities off their family trees and hide them away (sometimes killing them). They're not pure, they just pretend they are.

Well that's just false:

  Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest.

Who accepts these as completely unproblematic? Many see hereditary positions of power as extremely ripe for abuse, which never fails to occur.

[I'm putting these together to save time]

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes it's flawed. The 3 most brilliant wizards of the 20th century are not pure-bloods: Riddle and Dumbledore half-bloods and Hermione a muggleborn. Can't add Grindlewald since his blood status is unknown, although it wasn't an issue he likely cared for. The only two shown wizards who could consciously control their magic were Lily and Voldemort, a muggleborn and a half-blood. Dumbledore comments that the ability is ominous and very unheard of. Pure-Bloods are constantly outdone in canon (Lily defeated Voldemort, James was killed in all of a second, etc.), JKR intentionally set out to show that it's just a stupid idea.

Also, the comparison to nationalism is not good either, and besides which, the point of nationalism is just instilling propaganda so you don't question that awful things your country does and support whatever military nonsense they do. It's to dull the mind, not a good thing in most books.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This makes no sense, why would WWII cause an influx a Muggle-borns, who are descendants of Squibs??? This "traditional values" nonsense is ridiculous, and nearly always a cover for "I don't like their kind", which is exactly how the blood purity movement is portrayed as believing. Immigrants, illegal or otherwise, usually commit much less crimes proportionally than naturalized citizens. If they had wildly different values, we'd see them committing huge numbers of crimes by comparison, but they don't, no matter how badly reactionaries wish they did.

#+begin_quote
  So why hasn't it? Why haven't the muggleborns risen up demanding more rights?
#+end_quote

Because as JKR said and wrote, the Ministry is largely in the hands of the old guard who aren't interested in helping them. "Rising up" only changes things if you're willing to fight a war for it. The civil rights movement didn't succeed because people chanted hymns. People fought, bled and died for it, with Malcolm X's promise of violence looming in the background if they were refused.

** Honestly there's a few parallels between the issues in the world of the books and how things are in the UK in real life currently. I can honestly see Reese Mogg (however the fuck you spell his name, I don't care) being a secret Death Eater and May is Umbridge all over.

*** Rees-Mogg. And he's not really the Death Eater type. Publicly deplore their violence while de-funding the law enforcement that would stop them, sure. (Purely on grounds of lowering taxes on hardworking shareholders, you understand...) And you'd never even prove he was a fellow-traveller either. The investments designed to take advantage of the chaos that coincidentally make it easier for the Death Eaters? Purely sensible decisions, hedging against the uncertainty in our society caused by the influx of destabilising elements...

** I don't think Muggleborns were that oppressed during Harry's time. If anything the Death Eater movement was a reaction against muggleborns being more involved in magical society.

There doesn't really seem to be any genuine limitations on their job opportunities, there has even been depending on what you consider canon a muggleborn minister of magic.

But otherwise I concor with the immigrant parallels.

*** Except we know that Arthur, despite what Ron said, was passed over for promotions precisely because of his love for muggles and such. Fudge, as stated by Dumbledore in GoF and by JKR, was very big on blood purity.

Also, the Muggleborn Minister is canon. It comes from a Pottermore article written by JKR. Anyone who doesn't accept it seems very silly (I know you didn't say that, just a general comment).

**** A love for muggles is different than being a Muggleborn, one can dislike the former but be perfectly happy with the latter.

Fudge's regime is perhaps a little reactionary in nature, a minor attempt from the purebloods to 'take back' society. Although Fudge has a bias he does seem to be mostly a moderate and no friend of Voldemort's.

I would say that by Harry's time there does seem to have been reform, and it is not the apartheid type society that some of fanfictions do depict is as. There is clearly still room for improvement nevertheless.

***** If one's love for muggles causes their boss to pass them over for promotions, that means that boss is does not have favorable views of Muggles, which is where muggleborns come from. Dumbledore said Fudge was keen on blood purity.

I didn't say Fudge was a friend of Voldemort's, but that's missing the point. As in real life, the most obstinate obstacles to change are not the upright bigots. MLK made this point in his Letter from Birmingham Jail. Fudge is more passively against Muggles (and likely muggleborns), but he's not unique or more reactionary than most of his predecessors until his own job was on the line.

It definitely wasn't apartheid, that's rather an extreme cases of directly enforcing separation.

****** I have always seen the blood purity aspects coming from certain, very old families, with some others (such as Umbridge) desperately wanting to feel superior, whom are in the minority though influential.

But I see your point. Although I should probably clarify that I have always seen it as: Fudge shows bias but he's not going to stop hiring Muggleborns/or Half Bloods, just hire under qualified Purebloods in preference. I also saw it as he has a particular dislike against those that love muggles which is another kind of heinous sin in his eyes.
