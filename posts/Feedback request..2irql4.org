Eluded

--------------

Style thing, but I'd use spelled-out numbers only, unless it is a time or address. Under 10 numbers as numerals is correct in business writing, but not creative writing.

--------------

I skimmed over the chapter for content, so I might very well have missed stuff. Not doing line edits at the moment, but I do want to make a suggestion.

Try breaking this up. Start at the end. His "losing" his memory there makes a great point. Start the entire story with Snape saying the word. That hits hard.

Then Snape takes a potion, keels over, and Albus has some 'splaining to do.

Then have him later flash back to the potion making itself. And, /separately/, flash back to the unlocked memories and compare those to what he previously remembered. If he is explaining this to someone, not just internalizing it, that would really help and would avoid extra flashbacks.

Maybe Snape is explaining this to Holly?

Good luck with the story, and good writing.

*** Thanks for the reply.

Good feedback, though I tried to make him out of character because I want to revamp the character, or rather have him be a very different person in private than what we see publicly. But true, it's what I "want" rather than what "is".

Also, this is not a fem!harry/Snape romance, Snape is her father in this story. So yes, this is Snape is different because I intended him to be different, but I'll take the rest under advisement for sure, but I disagree that Snapes canon portrayal disqualifies him from showing these kinds of emotions and behaviors in situations that are never shown in Canon.

As for the fem!harry "twist" itself, I don't consider it a twist and it's the main point of the story, really, but I want to create something that isn't just "what if Harry was a chick".

But I see what you mean, I went a bit heavy on the exposition here... :/
