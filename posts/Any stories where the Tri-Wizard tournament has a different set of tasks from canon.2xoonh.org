As in really different. No dragon, great lake or maze please.


** So far as I know, there haven't been any really good ones since [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=tri&restrict_sr=on][this thread]] which you can find by searching the side bar.

Without even looking I can tell you: Firebird Trilogy, Princess of the Blacks, Lie I've Lived, Temporal Beacon, Sorting Hats Stand, and the two by Pers that I can't remember. There are probably others in that thread though.

*** Of those, Temporal Beacon should probably get a double rec since there are multiple variations on the tasks. Too bad it doesn't look like it will ever be finished.

** I'm on my phone, so sorry no link. But the lie I've lived by jbern has extra tasks if I remember right. Although I think there are still some of the original 3.
