Sorry, I know there are past posts like this but I was wondering if anyone has any new/different recs for Fred/Hermione?? (Preferably complete!)

I've read many but Falling Through Time remains the best one I've read concept-wise, and I'd LOVE for something that's really planned out and done well!

My preference is fics set in the magical world---I don't really care for Muggle AUs. But I also want to know your favourite ones so I'll take any recommendation you give! Thanks :)

** Ooooh, I love a good fremione series!

don't you know you've got the best of me by raquins is a series rewrite if Hermione met Fred and George first, it is so well done and doesn't feel overly re-hashed, realistic too imo

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17975480/chapters/42458669]]

Even in the Darkest of Times by MischiefProlonged is a take on Fred surviving the battle of hogwarts but the wizarding world is still fraught with troubles. I haven't read much of it yet but I've liked it so far, just an fyi I think it may have more adult content in it, just a heads up

I /loathe/ that story and stories like it, because it does something worse than just rehashing canon: it tempts us with brief visions of how things might have been different, how the story and the characters might have moved in interesting directions, only to invariably pull back and shove everything back onto the canon rails.

It tempts one to keep reading, hoping against hope that perhaps /next/ chapter, the writer might display just a little bit of courage and imagination and actually think about how two characters in question might actually influence each other in ways that matter.

Really, I should've dropped it when the author chose to rehash the Troll Incident even though nearly all of its prerequisites were either missing or outright contradicted by their own changes. I really should have learned by now.
