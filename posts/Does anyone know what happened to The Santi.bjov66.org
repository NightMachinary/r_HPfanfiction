You know, the guy that wrote what is essentially the only good wrong!BWL story?

HPatBWL says it's been last updated in 2015, and I'm pretty sure I read newer chapters on DLP that were never posted on FF.net.

But does anyone know what actually happened to the dude, or if he's ever going to come back?

*** Yep, it's one of the only fics I'm genuinely a bit upset was abandoned.

Most are barely even worth the initial read, but this was great.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
