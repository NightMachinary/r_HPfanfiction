** Not as I imagined her, but in the end I'm rather indifferent about it.

I experienced in some fics that described her as black that my own imagination of her character almost immediately overwrites these descriptions in my mind. There is a picture in my mind that I have of her that is almost impossible to compete with.

** I would not have had a problem with a black Hermione in the books at all. But she wasn't. I prefer the Hermione as she was in the books.

*** Yeah, because she was not written black, she will never be black in my mind. No amount of Tumblr fan art or even a movie reboot will change that.

**** I haven't checked for sure in the books themselves, but I read in an interview with J.K. that she never described hermione as anything other than being brown eyes and brown curly haired, buck toothed, and intelligent. None of which obviously count out black hermione. So barring any instances of 'her face turning white as a sheet' 'she went pale with shock' or any other such description of pale or otherwise white skin hermione could have absolutely been 'written black.' But J.K. ain't perfect so take it with a grain of salt.

***** All other characters with dark skin (Lee, Angelina, Dean, Kingsley) have that trait mentioned. Black people make around 2% of the population, so having dark skin is something that has to be mentioned because it is not the default state for someone in Britain.

****** If you define 'written as,' aka canon, as the author not explicitly going out of their way to mention a specific character's established physical traits, then yes, I suppose Hermione would not canonically have been black. But for the purposes of whether a character or setting decision in a piece of fanfiction or fanart is 'not canon,' in my experience it has usually been determined by if the decision was explicitly stated to be untrue in the original books series. So if, for instance, JK included a character in the books, but failed to mention what color their eyes were, a person drawing a fanart could choose to give said character green eyes. And if an argument came up over the artist's choice of eye color, it would be a matter of personal interpretation, not a disagreement on if the eye color was canonical or not, even though green eyes are less common than blue or brown.

Or in another example, if JK had never described Hermione's hair texture, only its color, then whatever disagreements that pop up would be fans debating their personal opinion about Hermione's hair, not arguing whether it being curly or straight was canon. Even though surely one kind of hair texture is more common than another in britain, nobody would be claiming that one type was canon on the basis of it being the more common hair texture type.

** You are just mad that I and others have exposed you for the pathetic troll that you are. If you were actually interested in having genuine discussions, instead of deliberately trying to start flame wars and controversies, you would not be sending PMs like [[https://imgur.com/WK0tlOK][this]] and [[https://imgur.com/a/XDqf0vY][this]] to me (and others?).

By the way, did you send [[https://imgur.com/a/Lkh1vXA][this one]] too a few months ago? Something tells me you did.

EDIT: [[https://imgur.com/a/laFwYXY][Well done for confirming my point]]. The irony of you, a pathetic troll with nothing else to do on your hands, telling me to get a life, is bullshit. Also, if anything, you are the stalker, as this is the fourth "confrontational" PM you have sent me.

** I personally don't picture Hermione black, because as I grew up reading the books I always thought Hermione would look like me (white, light brown hair, light brown eyes, curly hair), but I love black Hermione. I wish authors specified at the beginning of their fic what she looks like to them so I could picture their fic better in my mind.
