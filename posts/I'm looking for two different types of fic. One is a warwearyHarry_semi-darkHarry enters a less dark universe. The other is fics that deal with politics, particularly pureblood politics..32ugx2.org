What I am looking for in the first one is a character that has clearly been though some very hard times, such as war, but is now in a place that is much nicer and they are required to fight (not necessarily literally) to keep it that way. For example, Harry from Nightmares of Futures Past. It doesn't have to be Harry, pretty much anyone will do, but I would prefer if they had clearly been affected by the hardships they have through. I don't mind if it is a time travel fic or crossover, or anything else you feel could fit the bill.

For the second one I would prefer if it wasn't set in Hogwarts, was about adults, involved purebloods but wasn't about an explicitly dark family, grey is good, light is fine as well. I would mind of prefer if this one had some romance (perhaps Harphne?) but again I don't mind. I would also like if this one was about purebloods either trying to stay neutral or preparing to fight in either wizarding war, or the war with Grindelwald for that matter.

I am pretty easy when it comes to specifics so please feel free to recommend anything that you feel could be close. If in doubt, recommend, even if it directly contradicts something I've said.

Also, no bashing. That is one thing that I am not very flexible on, I might accept some small bit of bashing but it would have to be kept to a minimum.


** For the first request: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]] is a short one-shot, and I don't really buy the premise as to how universe travelling works, but at the same time I really, really like it. It definitely fits the 'war-weary' criterion.

Edit: um, oops. I think I accidentally upvoted this. So now I'm going to downvote, to balance it out. (Can you tell I'm new?)

** For war-weary Harry running amok in another universe there's both

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm still here]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est la Vie]]

Sadly both are still WIP and Cest's author has one of the worst cases of author ADD... but what is there is fantastic. In each case Harry ends up in a universe that's still in his fourth year. His interactions with his alternate self in Cest are quite amusing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8082923/1/Give-It-Your-Best-Shot][This]] fits the war-weary dimension travel pretty damn well, I'm quite sure. For the purebloods, I have nothing :(

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma]] had politics, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5324704/1/Tyrant]] is probably what you're looking for. There was a request about politics-heavy fics a while ago, so use the search for more.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985741/1/The-Descent-of-Magic][The Decent of Magic]] has some pureblood politics. It's Harry/Draco but pre-slash. It's very well written and has a unique and intriguing plot and nicely fleshed-out characters.

** (spoilers, obv) One of the AUs presented in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] fits your first request in the sense that Harry enters a world that looks rather idyllic and naive, defenceless. Unfortunately this happens way deep into the story, which often takes its time to progress.

If you want I can try finding the specific place where the relevant part starts.
