I hope this is a discussion, and there isn't an actual answer:

How does wandless magic work? Is it limited to only certain spells? Dumbledore lighting candles, apparition, things that do not “shoot” a spell.

Let's say you're a powerful wizard capable of wandless magic, with out your wand you say “stupefy”. Where does the stunning spell shot from?


** My personal thoughts are that a wand focuses magic into a small channel and creates spells. When using wandless magic, the magic seeps out of your entire body and you take control of it to minipulate your surroundings like it is a physical substance. It is limited to what you can do in miving objects heating things and starring a fire by compressing it or making friction with it. You could use it to pull away magic from weak spells like a concealment charm. Its almost like having conttol over the air around you butvit is magic snd not air that you control. You could not wandlessly cast a stunner.

** I've always had the headcanon that wizards' arms can actually produce magic on their own (a bone falls loosely into the category of magical core surrounded by magical 'wood'), but a wand is typically required to focus this magic into an actual spell. More skilled wizards can then do the same without needing a wand.

** I believe it shoots from wherever you choose to channel the magic from, it would be hard to learn to do it from anywhere though, I'd say it would be easiest to do with one of your hands and then do something with magic

But you see there's a problem because I don't recall there ever being an instance where someone actually shot a spell, yes Dumbledore lit some candles with wandless magic, yes that random dude in PoA was mixing his drink wandlessly, but there weren't many instances where even that actually happened

** I've always imagined it just shoots from their fingers. Mages in The Witcher series just make different signs and gestures with their hands to cast magic. So something like that. Though not as OP as the force from Star Wars.

What's more interesting is how does one get this ability? And can you cast the more powerful stuff like the patronus or unforgivables wandlessly. I like to think it's incredibly difficult to master and even the most powerful wizards can only cast the basic spells- say up to year 5 of Hogwarts.

I think any wizard could develop it with enough training. You're just casting spells without focus, it will be harder, less controlled, and less powerful.

I'd say, in theory, yes. In practice it's just far too complicated.

I think most wizards wouldn't bother with this. It is difficult to learn, and not really useful for most wizards since you have your wand anyway.

Most people would probably rather spend time learning things they deem more useful.

** The problem with Rowling's magic system is that the answer could be Midichlorians as a weird gut-bacteria for magic just as easily as 'because they're powerful enough to not need a wand, obvs'.

Are there any comments on it in the books or movies beyond just noting that Dumbledore can/does do it?

I quite liked the interpretation that comes from Arithmancy being about spell-design. Like, it uses equations to 'predict' the outcome of using this motion and that phrase with the other emphasis and so on in order to 'calculate' what you'd need to get a spell effect. If it's algebraic and theoretical-physics-esque, you could substitute bits of the equation for other bits, which would be why sufficiently powerful people could switch the wand motions for more power or more focused people can do that point casting thing.

Like (A+B) + (C+D) + (E+F) = G; if G is 120 (arbitrary number) and that corresponds to shooting a jet of fire out of your hands, you could use smaller results for the intent and focus parts by increasing the amount of power used because 120 is still fire whether its 20+30+70 or 10+50+60.

I always liked the idea that the utterly disorganised-seeming magic system is only because Harry is an oblivious idiot who missed the point of all the theory like that kid at GCSEs who thinks circuits have lightning running through the wires to power things. I think this interpretation of Arithmancy fits with that nicely. It would also fit with why it's not really used in canon, as Harry has had... some disruptive moments in his education and is thus stuck yelling expelliarmus at everything because he doesn't know anything more advanced until situations become desperate enough that he just kind of improvises and overpowers the spell enough that the specifics become irrelevant.

** Well, I'm always up for a good lorepost.

For starters, we'd have to establish how magic behaves in its raw form, especially when its released by a magical person with no clear goal. Two examples spring to mind, and these are of course Accidental Magic and the first thing a wand does once it finds its wizard.

Accidental Magic is the segway here. A wizard has, or channels magic through their body into the waking world. There, it is shaped according to their somantic and vocal (and sometimes intent-based) instructions using a wand, and transforms into a coherent spell that does one thing, like make a feather float, teleport the wizard to London or kill someone else. Accidental Magic has one of these components: the channeling of magic.

No wand, no spell, just raw magic forced into being. I suspect that it manifests according to the mage's will, but in an extremely random manner. So an attacker may find themselves floating off, or with their head exploded, or thrown into a wall, or without arms, while the victim may teleport home, or jump onto a bridge from below, or become bulletproof. It manifests, yes, but just like a waveform collapsing it cascades down into a helpful, but random effect from its ideal state.

The wand, then. It acts as a channel, a focus and a compiler all at the same time. The first time a witch or wizard touches theirs, the magical core material and wood resonates with the wizard's personality and magic, which makes drawing on it much easier. It can focus magical energy through itself and itself alone, so a /stupefy/ will always fly from its tip in a straight line, not discharge along the wizard's hair or toenails or nose. It also interprets significant hand motions and vocal components, and shapes the magic according to them. Spellcrafting is most likely finding the right combination of the two for the desired effect, or discovering the effect of new modules. (What effect would this random persian word have? What about a segment of a Mozart piece's director's stick motions as the wand movement?)

Wandless magic, then, would require all that wand magic requires, but /without/ the wand. You'd need to draw out the energy by yourself. You'd need to force the magic to manifest in the specific way you want it to. You need to force it along the path you want it to take. This is most likely why it's considered a "parlor trick" - and why I see "wandless spells" as idiotic. There's only one kind of Wandless Magic, and it's Wandless Magic. Raw Magic manipulation, not some specific charm. Making a feather float with a wand vs. nothing but your mind is a very different process, not a "wandless hover charm".

** If it came from anywhere I'd assume out of your wand hand, since that's presumably where magic comes out (and usually into a wand).

Though I've always thought it was closer to intentional accidental magic, there's no proper spells with jets of light, magic words and special motions, just tapping into the more instictive parts of magic. It's not exactly weak, it can do many impressive things like apparition, but simply vastly harder to use, an average levitating things wandlessly is like a first year trying to conjure a patronus.
