It could be a one-shot or multichapter. And it could be at any time in Teddy's life. I just want to read something about their close relationship. Thanks!


** From what I remember, the relationship between Harry & Teddy features at least somewhat prominently in Coming Back Late.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

  We know that Harry is Teddy's godfather. But what about the godmother? Does Harry raising a child with someone change things? And just what does this do to the Holy Grail known as OBHWF? And who knew the Bloody Baron's name? H/Hr

** "Breakfast in New York" is the only story I know that has a few scenes with those two. Not many though.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
