** A lot of people also just tack on an "eighth" year for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, since they didn't technically finish their schooling and graduate.

** I always thought an 8th year setting simply allowed the author to write the students still in school, but after the war. A matter of practicality and familiarity. There's few other plot devices that would allow that, probably none so simply, and also it's become such a common device that it's one of those fandom staples they can trust the audience is already familiar with.

** The eighth year is a frequently-used device. Authors who write M-rated fics use it so the students are 18 and are of legal age to shag professors, at least by American standards. I agree, authors really should make it clear early on that this is the device they're employing - whether in the first few paragraphs or in the A/N.

*** Yeah you are on to something, but I don't think it is always about Teacher/Student. It is also a really easy place to have your main character interact with other main characters (generally romantically) without forcing any strange/odd/unbelievable circumstances onto the reader. So if you wanted to pair Harry and Draco or Draco and Ginny or even to write a Harry/Ginny where Harry was around Ginny for that year instead of at Auror Training, then it is a good setting for that.

And as to the point about canon, I believe JK did say that Hermione went back for an eighth year. But I do agree that more Authors might want to let the readers know where everything is going, especially if it has the potential to squick the reader.

**** No, Teacher/Student isn't always a factor. I've read K through T-rated fics where the key to the device was developing relationships between the students in a Hogwarts setting. It's sometimes coupled with the Head Boy-woos-Head Girl device.

*** Ohhh, I didn't even think about the consensual age limit being a factor! I've rarely read fics were that was taken into account (probably because the authors/readers were also under 18/American).

** Also, a lot of times people do a Post-Hogwarts story, but really mean a post-DH story and thus insert an 8th year after the war is over. I've read a lot of stories that use that but everything up to their story is cannon, so they don't have to say it's AU/non-canon. This may explain why people aren't including a non-canonical tag of some sorts.
