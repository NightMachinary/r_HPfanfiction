Need me some crack to distract from life. OP OC or primary characters, well written without focus on pairings or slash. Not a great fan on bwl/brother fics but also means I haven't picked up any story that pulls it off.

Much appreciated!


** Can this just be a thread?

OMG I don't remember that omake and am wondering if I missed it.

But anyway...thinking of a random character. Um.

What about Clarke from The 100 - what would her boggart be?
