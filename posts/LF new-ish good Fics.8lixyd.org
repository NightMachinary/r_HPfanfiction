** I recently read an interesting fic called Spitfire which explores what would happen if Ron never came back when he left in Deathly Hallows, and how Harry and Hermione cope. It starts when Harry starts hearing Ron's voice in his head, and goes from there. The author is asexual, so there's very little romance. The author states it's a fic about how to appreciate others we take for granted, and while it's AU most character personalities seem to be cannon like

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is hearing voices, well, one voice; Ron Weasley. His 'maybe' dead ex-best friend who might have betrayed him to his greatest enemy. With such uncertainty in the case file of Ron Weasley, the wizarding world see fit to condemn and move on, but when Ron reappears after two years of absence events are set in motion that will reveal the depths of human endurance and love.
