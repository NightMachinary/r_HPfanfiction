Looking for a fic where Tom Riddle lives with two (or more) personalities. I've always read him as someone two faced (his mask and his psychopathic personality), but never literally 'two faced' where there was actually a normal boy inside of him and another the psychopathic one.

Snippet for what I'm looking for:

Tom Riddle has always been a little bit weak, a little bit pathetic. Bullied from the start he wished with all his might how he could be 'more'. One day, he slept and suddenly woke up to the many faces of fear. He was unsettled, but he wasn't bothered as much, so he let it be... Until he, once again, slept and woke up standing in front of Billy Stubb's dead rabbit.


** Interesting prompt!
