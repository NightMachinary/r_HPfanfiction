I'm being only half-facetious, here. We've all seen Vincent Clortho, HP and the Ghetto Street War, etc., and I'm sure the reception towards the two varied widely from fan to fan.

But I honestly think that applying HP to a multicultural urban setting with an ethnically diverse cast can be done well, whether it's inner-city London or the outskirts of Atlanta. The possibilities are endless!

It might be a straight comedy set in a Portkey rental shop Ã  la /Phoneshop/, or even a dirty-Auror thriller in the vein of /Training Day/. Maybe they include magical traditions like obeah, or even Romani magic? Given the territory, I know any fics like this would probably be OC-heavy. Much appreciated if anyone can help! :D


** I'm debating whether or not to get into the fanfiction writing world. It's either doing something like this or doing a sports-themed fanfic... i.e. Ginny's time with the Harpies, or detailing a season of Quodpot.

*** Why not both? :)

But in all seriousness, I'd leap at the chance to read either.

**** Allow me to brainstorm, then. Have you done any writing yourself? I could use an experienced beta.

***** Just a couple fics, though I've never worked with or as a beta. I wouldn't even know who to recommend in this instance. Ordinarily I'd say post something in the Work by Author section over at DLP, but I don't think the user base is ready, lol.

Here's a related music video that's pretty funny [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UuBm0dvIzcc]]

I mean it's pretty cheesy, but it's tongue-in-cheek, right?

** Have you ever read Imma Wiserd? Because, while it's not /exactly/ what you're looking for, I think it'll give you a laugh.

*** Just seeing the title takes me back, lol. My introduction to it was the TVTropes page a few years back. A couple of giggles were had, to be sure XD

*** Heard that :D It'd only take a couple of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts to get loose and multiply. National crisis for wizards and Muggles both.
