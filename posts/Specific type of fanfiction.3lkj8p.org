Hey guys, Im looking for more Harry Potter fanfics to read since I've been binging on them for a while now. I was looking for stories in which Peter doesn't turn out to be a traitor or Snape doesn't hear the prophecy and tells it to Voldemort or both. It can be a Marauder era fic or just looking at Harry's life if his parents survived and Voldemort was still a problem. Most of the good fanfics I've read all have great stories but end with James and Lily dying and Sirius ending up in Azkaban and I want to find one that doesn't up like that since I always get too sad when I realize all of the fun times the Marauders had end in tragedy and Harry without parents. Are there any good stories that fit into what I'm looking for? I appreciate any suggestions you guys can give me.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

This is a WBWL-twin story, with Harry sent to the Dursley's even though James and Lily are alive. I know, you've read a fic like this before, probably, and maybe they weren't the best. Yet, I have to say this one is pretty good and is trying to change up the typical tropes. In this fic, Peter is alive and is Harry's twin's godfather. However, in the most current chapter (just recently updated) there is some foreshadowing that Peter isn't as innocent as the Potters might think.

*** We see at the beginning of the story that Peter isn't innocent, he literally memory charms everyone to think Sirius is guilty. It isn't a mystery.

Good story though, would recommend.

**** Huh. I probably skimmed that part and didn't catch that it was spelled out.

***** To be honest, I'm pretty sure I skimmed it as well I think I just managed to figure that bit out while I was doing it.

  Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

*** Aside from the Santi's and stuff, this might be the best this trope has to offer right now. He's smart and ambitious as in most, but there are moments of surprising vulnerability that make this particular story so much more human than most of its type.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1746629/chapters/3731000]] is basically a canon rehash as if Peter was the one who sacrificed himself for Harry. It's a bit boring though. I never got through it.

** Not quite what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][800-Rent-A-Hero]] has Harry get sent to a universe where that sort of thing happened. It's not done but it's really great so far and doesn't seem to be dead yet.

*** Well I think you're confusing a couple fics. Rent-A-Hero is canon except fem!Harry and only diverges after OotP. I think you're talking about I'm Still Here which also features a fem!Harry except Lily and James are alive.

**** Actually I wasn't thinking of either of those acutally. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987160/1/Adrift-in-a-World][Here's the one I was thinking of]]: "Adrift in a World." The two are kinda similar so I got them confused.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter]] Features alive!Potters, mentor!Snape, fem!Slytherin!Harry, genderbender, political machinations, but no war. Peter split from the Marauder group due to differing political opinion.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1955451][Fighting The Green by FireFleshAndBlood]] Features alive!Potters, fantastic characterization, Slytherin!Harry (who's wonderfully childish), interesting magic system. Peter is fallible, but not terrible.
