  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957404/1/Subversion][Subversion]] has a great deal of AU worldbuilding about the mind arts mixed into its story. In that fic Harry uses wandless legilimency and occlumency frequently.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

** /legilimency/

Canonically, not once was this spell used without a wand nor silently. Furthermore it's rather obvious when used as the target will see and feel everything the attacker sees, there's absolutely no subtlety. Just look for Mutant!Telepath!Harry instead, far more believable than the fanon mind arts.

*** Canonically, you can use all spells silently, but it takes a whole lot of effort.

Canonically, Dumbledore took care not to make eye contact with Harry, because he suspected that Voldemort may use Legilimency through Harry to look into his mind.

Canonically, the horcrux connection didn't require a wand at all, and Voldemort was able to possess Harry through it using Legilimency while his wand was busy.

Canonically, it is stated that Wands are not what makes a wizard magical.

***** u/wordhammer:
#+begin_quote
  ‘It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly. *The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him*. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.'\\
  Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind-reading to Harry, and he didn't like the sound of it at all.\\
  ‘So he could know what we're thinking right now? Sir?'\\
  ‘The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,' said Snape. ‘Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.'\\
  ‘Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?'\\
  Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so.\\
  ‘The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. *The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord*. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable -- when you are asleep, for instance -- you are sharing the Dark Lord's thoughts and emotions.

For point 1, we also get guidance from Snape:

#+begin_quote
  '...Yes, those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some,' his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more, ‘lack.'

****** That says absolutely nothing. No once is there mentioned how he uses the spell, and Voldemort isn't shy at all, so him pointing and verbally casting legilimens to check the truthfulness of a report isn't strange, at all.

The second has nothing to do with the spell, nor wands. Harry doesn't know any mind magic and can still see Voldemort's mind, and later on even consciously. Snape right there says normal rules don't apply here because this isn't legilimens, just a side effect of the horcrux. And that's just their (Snape's and Dumbledore's) theory, not even a fact.

The last quote again fails to prove your claim. Snape never went into details, so it's not canon.

Canon is only what's unquestionably stated in the books. And even then you need to take context into account, for characters are known to lie.

****** Doesn't seem like you've read them. I have no memory of what you've mentioned, so unless you can provide proof, that's either your headcanon or pure fanon.

It was never said you could perform all magic silently.

Dumbledore wasn't afraid of making eye contact with Harry (book five, ch 37) so that one I directly call fanon.

The third one makes no sense, Voldemort's ability to posses people is not linked to mind magic nor Harry, he's a fucking wraith.

And the fourth seems offtopic.
