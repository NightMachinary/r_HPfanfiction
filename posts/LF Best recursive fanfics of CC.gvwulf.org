Anything inspired by, uses the characters of, etc for Cursed Child. Surely it's been long enough that there's some good content out there now, yeh?

I'm most interested in proper stories with Delphini, but please do share anything else that you'd consider really good! I'm always open to trying things I didn't know I wanted.

Gen or minimal romance preferred, but if the story is good I don't mind any het/slash/fem as long as it's generally non-explicit. Thanks!

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

** Might not be exactly what you're looking for because the author goes out of their way to retcon a few plot points from the play, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18922990/chapters/44923150][Let Go]] by sebastianL is probably my favorite Cursed Child fic. It features a lot of Albus character study, and focuses heavily on his relationship with each of his family member.

  It's 1994 and Severus Snape has his hands full with the Dark Lord's return. But Delphi Riddle has something much bigger in mind...
