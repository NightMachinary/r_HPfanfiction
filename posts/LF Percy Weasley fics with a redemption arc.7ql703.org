Recently finished linkffn(Order of Mercy) which was a fic about Bill, Fleur, Percy, Oliver Wood and a (I think) OC named Audrey running a parallel operation to the Order of the Phoenix to rescue Muggleborns from the Death Eaters.

Before that I read a fic where Percy was a seer that could see when various people would die and then spent all his time trying to avert these. He's not exactly a main character but he's a prominent one in the fic. If anyone could recall the name for me, I'd appreciate it!

What I'm looking for however is a Percy Weasley that is more involved in the war effort than simply showing up at the Battle of Hogwarts. Perhaps using his position at the Ministry to undermine Voldemort's forces or pass on intel.

I'd love a fic where the primary focus is on epsionage and mystery instead of a more "wands blazing" approach. A fic where Percy struggles with his estrangement from his family and the realisation that what is happening in the Ministry is wrong. He struggles to reconcile his new worldview with his current situation.

Romance is acceptable but shouldn't be the primary focus of the fic. Anything is acceptable romance wise, including/especially slash. Percy x Grawp I can live without, though.

Heck, any Percy fic that you think is worth recommending I'd appreciate. Thanks in advance!


** Regularly updating Percy-centric fic:

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** I love Order of Mercy! It's a suspenseful and exciting read. I posted a list of links awhile ago, but here are my favorite Percy fics. (Also Audrey is actually a cannon name made be JK Rowling, but she wasn't mentioned in the books I think.)

I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. These first two are my most favorites. (I assume you've read them already though.)
