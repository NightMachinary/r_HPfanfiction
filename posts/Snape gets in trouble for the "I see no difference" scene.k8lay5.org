So, in GOF, Snape lets Draco off scot-free for hitting Hermione with a hex that enlarges her front teeth drastically, but then tells her he "sees no difference" between her newly enlarged teeth and how they look normally, causing her to run off crying, then has the nerve to take fifty points from Gryffindor and give Harry and Ron detention when they get angry over this.

But what if Harry and Ron decided to tell someone else (Dumbledore, McGonagall, etc.) about Snape's behavior to get Snape in trouble for this?


** Dumbledore dgaf. I can't believe he's unaware of Snape's behaviour - although perhaps not the extent of it and maybe being informed directly would make him do something. But in all honesty, I think he overlooks so much with Snape because he needs his spy but doesn't trust him to be out of his sight so needs him employed at Hogwarts.

McGonagall would be outraged. But she wouldn't be able to do anything because, Dumbledore. He's in charge of staffing and staff discipline surely? But McG could get revenge in other ways - take a load of points off Malfoy; transfigure the sugar into salt in the staff room whenever Snape goes to take tea... In fact, I love the idea of Minnie being so mad about this that she spends a month hitting Snape with all manner of magical microaggressions and whenever he looks confused or upset she just hisses "you know what you did, Severus."

Eventually, Dumbledore has to step in because it's getting out of hand, but McGonagall makes damn sure Hermione and the boys know that revenge has been had.

  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.

  With Professor Snape's hateful and cruel words towards her, Hermione's trust in authority figures comes crashing down for good. She begins to question the adults' response to Harry's forced entry into the Triwizard Tournament and concludes that it's up to her to keep him safe. And if they have to leave the country to escape the madness of Hogwarts and Magical Britain, so be it.

** I don't think that Dumbledore knew the extent of Snapes behavior. Dumbledore is clever, he knows a lot but he is not omnipotent - he even says that time and time again himself. And he has a lot on his plate - with having three jobs at the same time and fighting a war against Voldemort.

I do believe that Dumbledore believed that Snape favored the Slytherins - but it is obvious he isn't the only Head of House to do that. Not to the extent Snape did - but I remember a Nimbus 2000 that tells me that Minerva McGonagall isn't innocent of favoritism either. And the way Flitwick reacted to this blatant favoritism it is nothing that is uncommon and I would bet that Sprout and Flitwick do similar things (we even see how Sprout treats Harry badly after she believed he cheated to participate at the tournament leading to Cedric not getting the full recognition of being Hogwarts champion)

I don't think Dumbledore knew that Snape bullied his students. I don't see Dumbledore allow such a behavior to continue if he knew. And the "I see no difference" isn't even in the Top 3. I clearly remember he once threatend to kill Trevor, he threw things after Harry and another time threatend to poison his students.

*** I think he has to, unless one ignores all the ways he could know such as a pensieve (do you think no student ever knew about such things and/or offered?) or, y'know, finding out that Neville's boggart is Snape and having to think about why.

The only way he could 'not know' IMO with all the stuff we see in the books is if is actively avoiding hearing and listening, which honestly fits his behavior in the books. Dumbledore often comes off as willfully ignorant.

**** Seriously: I don't think you have to be awfully ignorant in the situation Dumbledore and the other teachers are. I am a teacher myself and looking to Hogwarts it has to few adults to function. Realistically all the teachers in Hogwarts (especially the Heads of Houses and Dumbledore) have to be close to a burn out. They are only around 15 adults in that castle who have not only to teach 7 years of students in 2-4 classes but also have to watch them at lunch, after school hours and at night. In my estimation each teacher has to work 80-100 hours per week for Hogwarts to work in its basics. To add to that Dumbledore isn't only Headmaster but also Chief of the wizardgamot and in the ICW.

The result of overworked teachers and headmasters is, that things that shouldn't be ignored get ignored - not willfully but you don't have the time to go after everything. Don't you think all the teachers get complaints? I mean: Flitwick is a halfbreed - there have to be rascists in the wizarding world who complained about that; McGonagall is very strict; Sprout lets them work with potantial letal plants; and that are the three teachers who don't do much wrong. I can image Dumbledore literally gets drown in complaints - and then when they are already overworked - real complaints against the likes of Snape get lost.

****** Yes, like I said. She didn't do a Snape on him. But she treated him different. For something he hadn't control about. Sprout seams to have an personal teaching style - but to him she was distant. It is not okay to treat a student different from the others because of something the student has no control over.
