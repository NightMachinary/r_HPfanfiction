** I like that you've asked for this and totally not surprised that the first reply recommended a fic which is on here all the time and has what I consider a huge number of favourites. Massive difference in interpretation of 'rare' and 'few' there!

Now my fics have between 50 - 60 favourites and I would call that 'few'. But what do those numbers mean? They mean, for good or ill, whether true or not, that my fics and others like them are perceived to have little or no value in the world in which they exist (this one: the HP fandom). That is hard to stomach.

It's never going to happen but I desperately wish that the numbers were visible only to the writer. If no one else could see them, maybe we'd have a more level playing field. Just a thought.

** For the benefit of others, what's the upper end number would you consider as few?

I'll rec you a fic that has 0 follows since ao3 doesn't use that metric. I've seen it recommended maybe 3 times on this sub (twice by me) so it's likely you haven't seen it yet.

Bad Oracle is what Cursed Child should have been. Or at least, it's a much, much better version of it.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

** I have tons of them, because apparently my tastes are rather singular (no, not that one).

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] without competition the best “Dudley's daughter is a witch” series, but it is quite different from what you expect; rather interesting take on post-War Harry as well (no bashing, no Dark Harry, but he is not cuddly and open as we would expect).
- Stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]] about Petunia in the most singular pairing ever (I truly believe, nobody did that), but the result is rather sweet.

**** It is complicated, but I really don't like much high-action adventure stories, certainly could go without smut, and don't like too much mystical stories. Which probably means I am not super fan of 90% of all fanfiction stories. I was thinking about calling my style “magician realism” (NO magical realism, which is a monstrosity): well written stories from the life of wizards and witches. For example, I like Northumbrian stories and these two (especially the latter) I mentioned.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

** You don't really want to use Follow as a popularity metric because it disadvantages fics with fewer number of chapters.

Reviews can be negative.

I personally use Favorite as my preferred popularity metric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), has only 406 Favorites, but is my favorite [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] fics. Characterizations, plot, writing are all great, and yet it remains a rather concise story. I think the primary reason that it receives so few Favorites is because "Harry P." is not listed as a main character (although he is actually).

Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
