I'm pretty sure there was a NC-17 version of Book of Morgan Le Fey and the Final Reckoning by Lavender Brown on checkmated years ago. FF.net only has the PG-13 version. If someone has the uncensored versions, please let me know. Thanks!


** Curious - what was the fic about?

*** I think it's a three part rewrite of DH or HBP/DH.

Not sure though.

** Ugh I've been looking for LavenderBrown's non-FF.net works for YEARS in fact I just emailed the author of the fic at a yahoo address that I found. That's how I found this thread-- googling the titles of her fics and whatnot. With Checkmated and Geocities disappearing, it's a long shot ):
