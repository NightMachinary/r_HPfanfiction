****** i mean, i just wanted to see if there was any cool zelda fanfiction (there is) but im looking through ao3 and it's legit a pile of weird shit between link and sidon, to the point where you have to just exclude that character if you dont want any weird fucking porn to show up, and that doesnt even get rid of all of it

******* A major reason why there is a lot of wierd stuff on AO3 is the fact thst they allow content that FFN blocks.

What I like about AO3 is that you can easily exclude certain ratings like Explicit, pairings or whatever its tagged with. So its very easy to remove all that junk. But then again Im not in many fandoms. It was quite alright for Stranger Things.

**** Full name Archive of our Own, it's a lovely fanfic platform! Easy to read and use, plus the organization that runs it, the Organization for Transformative Works, does a lot of important advocacy. I'd recommend giving it a look!

e: I like it as a reader for the really robust bookmarking and tagging architecture, and I think it makes it really easy to find fics, in a way FFN doesn't. Sure, there's porn, but as other commenters have mentioned that's because FFN banned it a while back. Plus there's a lot of really, really good HP and other FF on there now. I basically only use FFN for fics people directly link me, I'd never go browsing there.

** I hate the conflation of Emma Watson the actor with Hermione the character. It's not specific to you, it's common in general, and from interviews it seems like the actress herself identifies with the character in a way that encourages it, but it squicks me out.

  Daniel Radcliffe loved remembering his time on the set of Harry Potter. One day, while walking through the park, he picked up a fallen branch nearby and swung it with an "Expelliarmus!" A streak of light streamed from the branch and knocked a walker's phone out of their hand.

** What a unique and fabulous story! I love it.

I strongly recommend that you request membership to Archive of Our Own (AO3), and post your fic there. Fanfiction.net does not allow “ Real People Fiction” or RPF, on it's site. Your story could be reported or seen by their Admin, and taken down. AO3 has no such restrictions.

The AO3 requires a $10 donation in order to become a member and post, last I knew about the process. I believe that AO3 is a far superior fanfic archive than ffn. The organization recently won a Hugo award! The author who accepted it on behalf of the Archive is herself a fanfic writer on AO3. I have read a lot of top-notch fanfic on the Archive, and have been a member since 2009. It's a much cleaner website than ffn.net, too, without all the annoying adverts.

**** I'm so glad to have been helpful! I didn't want you to lose your work, as ffn.net has taken down fics without informing authors.

Glad you joined the AO3 community! I'm sure you will find both support, and a fan base for your fic! You can tag it as both Harry Potter (JK Rowling or ‘fandom') and as RPF. I'm not certain that anyone has written anything like your story, ever! Fans will adore it!

Best of luck; I will be sure and ‘subscribe' to you, as an author!
