Vague memories only. I think it started with adult harry waking up, and finding himself near a 14 year old, girl version of him, before the first challenge. They chat, something something, and it's revealed girl Harry has a crush on Ron, but he's being jealous about the thing. Can't remember what happens next, but it end's with fem!Harry beating the first challenge, considering kissing Ron, but abstaining for now so as to not screw over Hermione.

I'm fairly certain it was a one-shot, but not completely. Anyone know what im talking about.


** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3992226/1/Dancing-With-Myself][Dancing with Myself]]. It's sorta close? But it has Harry/fem!Harry eventually so I dunno if that's what's you're looking for.

  Harry Potter has Issues. That goes without saying, of course, but when he finds himself in another world facing someone he has a lot in common with... maybe he will find a way to make peace with himself. HarryGirl!Harry with a few twists.
