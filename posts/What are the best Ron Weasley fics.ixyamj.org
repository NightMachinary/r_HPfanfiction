Ron is one of my favorite characters and it makes me sad there's so much Ron bashing in FanFiction. What are the best Ron fics out there? Also open to Romione.


** I really like the Ron in Nightmares of Future Past. He starts of as the abrasive, defensive boy we know in the books, but with a little intervention grows up quickly. The whole Weasley family get treated well in this fic.

** Ron is well placed to be whatever a writer needs him to be, comic relief, secret evil, betrayer, the best of best friends.

I agree that of all the cast of the Potter books, Ron is the most real. Not every teenage boy is an unstoppable eating machine, a brave friend who would try to stand on a broken leg to save his friend, a thoughtless lout, or the guy who got the girl, but a whole lot of us were at one time or another.

My dad had 4 teenage boys at one time, and he routinely took us out for Pizza at a time in our lives where each of us could and would vacuum up an extra-large pie with everything on it, each, and finish off the meal by wondering loudly about what might be for dessert.

In my fanfiction, I have covered all of the Ron memes, though I specialize in the Comedy Relief role for him.

Then one day I decided I wanted to do another Super Hero crossover one centering on DC's Speed Force. I spent most of a week trying to come up with a reasonable way for Harry to get access to the Speed Force and came up with nothing. So I started rereading the series.

My answer was in the first book. Just not for Harry. Molly had a cousin who was an accountant, but the family never talked about him.

So, why not, I'd abused the crap out of Ron a lot. What if HE was the one who got the powerup and turned out to be the big damned hero.

So I wrote Ron as Wally West's cousin, who through a highly contrived accident ended up with the speed force.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** Fate by thetruespartan

One huge, and epic Ron fic. And can someone link it on ffn, cuz I have no idea how to do it.

Fati Mortem by thegooddeatheater.

new WIP on ao3, I really liked it.

You can climb a ladder up to the sun

forgot the author, but it's a wonderful oneshot on ao3, studying Ron's character and giving him the love he deserves.

Anything by Solstice Muse or Windschild8178...though the latter will make you cry.
