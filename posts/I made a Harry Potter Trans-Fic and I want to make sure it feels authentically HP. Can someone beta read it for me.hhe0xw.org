By "Trans-Fic" I mean I explore what it might be like to discover you are trans at Hogwarts. The story explores Hufflepuff House, so I'd like a fellow Hufflepuff if possible. I tried to stay true to what's out there but also build on it and flesh it out more. I'd like to post it officially soon!

Thank you! Comment or DM if you are interested :)
