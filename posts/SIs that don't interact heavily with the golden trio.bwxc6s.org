If you're into HP SIs then you've probably read quite a few stories where the SI almost immediately starts getting super friendly with the Golden Trio. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]] Hermione even notices and points out how weird it is that they became so chummy so quickly, then ignores it and moves on. But this is not always the case.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]] - the SI is a voice in young Tom Riddles head, trying to make sure he doesn't fall prey to any of the pitfalls listed on [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html][the Evil Overlord List]] to ensure his reign is a long and untroubled one. Maybe Dead.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4414361/chapters/10027064][She Who Should not Exist]] - SI is Voldemort's twin sister, and sort of suicidal. Not very long.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807/chapters/23374032][Faith and the Devil]] - SI is Draco's sister and still getting used to the abrupt change in worlds. Interesting perspectives on children drama, but centered on a different part of canon. Dead.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026429/1/Chris-Pettigrew-and-the-No-Refund-Policy][Chris Pettigrew and the No-Refund Policy]] - SI is Peter Pettigrew and gets involved with Lily and James to some extent.

​

If the story is set during the events of the books it can be hard for the author to separate their SI out from those events, but doing so gives us some very interesting options. So does anyone know any other examples of SI fics where the SI is either in a different time period from the books, or simply doesn't interact very heavily with the main cast? Maybe even setting out to try and distance themselves from the suicidal Gryfindors, or even join the Death Eaters? Bonus points if they screw up canon heavily.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

*** This fic is so good. I used to think I disliked self inserts, but I really love this fic. It's fun, has great worldbuilding and the main character is just very entertaining. I like how the she ends up becoming friends with a bunch of side characters and how a lot of her plans do not turn out the way she expects. It's a nice change from the usual OC stories that instantly have the main character become best friends with the trio and that rehash canon events over and over again.

**** Yes even if the stakes are arguably much lower given how disconnected Kasey is from the canon Plot, it's still heartbreaking to learn that her actions lead to all the photos of Harry's parents Hagrid collected being burned up. And given how much we've connected with them over the year Dumbledore's fuck you to all of Hufflepuff at the end of year feast still makes my blood boil.

Also, I don't think I've ever read a fic that tried to prevent the graveyard resurrectionby straight up talking to Frank Bryce

** Well... perhaps this! Haha. She does interact with Harry a fair amount, but not in the way you'd expect, and mostly with Snape. It's quite lemony. lol. [This story is bloody hilarious, by the way.]

An American muggle from the year 2022 ends up in a pub in England in 1992, and meets Severus Snape. Somehow she knows everything about him, and he is determined to find out why.

​

Also this, the finest way to SI there is, and of course the trio is not around. This story is wonderful.

Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob.

With some magic and the help of loving friends, everything is possible.
