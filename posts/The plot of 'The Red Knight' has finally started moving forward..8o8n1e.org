** 46 chapters and the plot is just now moving forward? Someone needs to learn pacing.

** I just checked out the latest chapter and it's still the same old confusing mess. I hate Violet (aka Harry) and Hermione in this story and I don't care to see the author try to redeem them. That's actually an accomplishment by the author, but not a good one. It's 20 chapters too late for an explanation for me.

** Yup, I was glad there was finally an update and it was a good, meaningful one too.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** Other than the fact that a god was involved in the whole Violet/Hermione reincarnation cycle and Ron reincarnation thing the basics of everything of it was at least guessable by the previous chapter.

*** Ah, I stopped reading like 20 chapters ago :) I skimmed the latest chapter, which prompted me to read everything I'd missed.

**** 46 told us why Ron would be willing to do the thing. Everything else is just small, scattered clues.

** Did Ron finally fix his relationships with Harry and Hermione and the trio is getting busy doing stuff, or is he still interacting mainly with a bunch of eleven year old kids from Slytherin?

**** Ah. No point in continuing then. I'm not interested in a dysfunctional trio, and the hint of "rape as plot element" was almost as disgusting as the palling around with preteens.

** I've never really seen the appeal of this fic. I get it, Ron as the MC is rare but the quality is just mehhh. Each to their own.

*** I started reading it because Ron is the MC and the Violet and Hermione plot was good enough for the start. Then it just never did anything outrageous to stop me from reading. I am completely aware that the story isn't particularly great.
