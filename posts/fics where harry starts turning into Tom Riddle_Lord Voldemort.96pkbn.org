read a fic awhile ago with this premise. essentially harry starts emulating behaviors and mannerisms and becoming tom riddle (thanks to the influence of the horcrux etc.) not just him gaining voldie's memories and skills but actually subconsciously turning into tom riddle himself. things like harry having conversations with the professors, word for word, the same as tom riddle did and thereby spooking said professor. anyone?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] is a good example. Told from Snape's perspective, the story starts in fifth year. No one realizes what has happened to Harry until it is too late. This fic is a slow burn of psychological horror as Harry subtly twists the people around him into mockeries of what they could have been. linkffn(11687216)

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all? (OotP AU. Go inside the mind of Severus Snape as he tackles several beguiling mysteries, and risks everything he holds dear.) COMPLETE.

** Here we go:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): probably the most amiable version of the Scarcrux I've ever encountered, definitely changes Harry

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Harry Potter and the Chrysalis): I'm guessing this one was what prompted the request, a long form Harry influenced by Voldemort story.

linkffn(What Lies Beneath): this one is slightly different (spoiler), but the horcrux(es) are definitely influential on him.

linkffn(Abraxas): Tom and Harry talk after hearing the prophecy, and while the Horcrux doesn't like him, he is still Voldemort and wants to survive this battle. So the two fuse souls, and Harry begins to think very differently (or at all, depending on your perspective).

linkffn(The Merging): I'm not sure I would really recommend this fic, but that happens literally at the very beginning of this story.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
