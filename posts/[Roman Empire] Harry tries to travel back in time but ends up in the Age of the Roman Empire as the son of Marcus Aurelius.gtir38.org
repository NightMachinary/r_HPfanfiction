So, i just though this would be a interesting fic but since i already have several fics i started to plan / write i don't want to start yet another one. This is what i thought could happen:

â€‹

- Voldemord successfully takes over Britain but in doing so reveals the wizarding world to the muggels
- A devastating war follows which destroys almost all civilisation on earth
- In all of that mess extraterrestrial beings start invading earth who waited for a good opportunity to strike
- The world gets a hold of themself and unite to fight them (yes Voldemord and Harry fight alongside but still hate each other. The only reason why they don't try to kill each other is because both recognise the need of each other)
- The humans make some progress against the aliens and start a massive attack on the main control stations across the world.
- It is a trick by the invaders and with their superior technology and magic they almost wipe out all remaining human forces
- Voldemord tries to go back in time with a ritual he prepared in the last years but harry discovers it and stops him
- Accidentally he goes back himself and wakes up in 170 AC
- He decides to prepare the world for the invaders, which basically means:

  - taking over the world
  - industrialising the empire
  - colonising the new world
  - integrating the wizarding world into the muggle world
  - and of course, becoming a immortal emperor

- And while doing all of that harry has to deal with his anxiety and paranoia and himself starting to miss voldemord who is no longer there to try and sneak a few killing curses at him


** To quote myself from another thread:

  industrialising the empire

I actually outlined a "Harry and Hermione inserted into GoT at the end of Robert's rebellion" fic with uplift as the goal. An uplift would not really be feasible, even with magic and Hermione's bag as Wikipedia substitute. And I was assuming that transfiguration could be exploited to hell and back. It is simply not doable. The pair can whip up a WWI destroyer or the like in a few days, or enough weapons to arm a regiment, but they do not have the ability to create a sustainable industry.

Let's say that you want to magic trains into existence. You need trains, which means that you need steel. So steelworks/ironworks, which require smaller steelworks for the machinery, which need raw iron. Raw iron means mines, mines need steam engines to pump water out and move stuff. To build steam engines, well, the circle begins anew. Then you need places which build machine tools and so on. Coal and coke, which means special bricks for the furnaces...

During the industrial revolution, that process was supplied by a mixture of small companies which specialised in making one of these, often by craftsmen who were already making things by hand and automated their work. Only slowly, the giants of industry came to be. Coke and its supply chain came to be ~200 years before trains were a thing, and almost a century before proper metal factories IIRC.

You can uplift a country in a lifetime, Japan being the prime example. There were people born during the Samurai age who witnessed nuclear weapons. However, Japan could buy stuff from the West. And while magic can substitute a lot of things, it cannot mirror every industrial and military mission, every large company like Yarrow or Krupp. Places where you can simply order machines to make big machines, or entire ships.

I concluded that it would be infeasible to do that properly with a late medieval/renaissance tech base. Rome was pretty advanced in some areas like medicine, but they were a far cry from things like proper plate armour.

*** The very first trains ran on WOODEN rails. Later they ran on IRON covered wooden rails, which over decades transitioned to iron rails and then steel. The first trains themselves only had IRON boilers, the rest of the cars were wooden. (c.1594 -- The first overground railway line in England may have been a wooden-railed, horse-drawn tramroad which was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, around 1600 and possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away)

DEEP mines need steam pumps, but even the ROMANS had mines, and they did so without steam pumps.

**** And how many tons of iron did the Romans produce? 82500 according to Wikipedia. And that was with significant if primitive mechanisation such as the use of water power.

As for wooden rails and later iron, those aren't particularly durable. Proper steel rails can last over 100 years on a main line still operating modern (heavy) trains. Wooden rail lasts a few years when you use horse carts.

You might be able to connect Rome and Ostia that way. And that would be useful. But a railway across the alps won't work with wooden rails, and iron boilers would probably be too weak to pull much of a load there, if any. And the Roman Empire had a lot of mountains. Especially in Asia and Iberia, but also Illyria.

**** But even if Harry recreates an entire factory, he would have no idea how to operate any machine in there. And just pushing random buttons isn't a smart idea if you have 100 tons of molten steel in the general vicinity. And you need to figure out the entire supply chain that way, and logistics.

***** That's true but he doesn't need to know that or even invent it himself. He only needs to educate a few people and tell them what it is that he wants exactly. With his knowledge of modern technology and magic he will be able to speed up that whole process. Divide and conquer.

Even if he tried to invent all that stuff, it wouldn't be possibly for him because the average person has no knowledge about how all that stuff works.

****** I think you underestimate canon transfiguration. Hermione guesses in GoF that the limit you can transfigure in one go is roughly a dragon, less than that for most people. So if you do a bit of math, that gives you roughly 15m3, or 100 tons of steel. We also know that 3rd year has basic animals, each of which is still 100 times more complex than anything short of microchips. Harry can do a lot, even without understanding why things work.

However, I think you underestimate the size of a proper industry. For example, the steel throughput. The German Empire, whose population is roughly comparable to the Roman Empire, peaked at more than 15 million tons of raw steel per year. 40% of the workforce were employed in the secondary sector. And due to its size, Rome will need a lot more infrastructure, with heavy machinery required due to all the mountain ranges in the Empire. All of which needs massive amounts of steel. If your time frame is 250 years, maybe it would be doable. But I don't think that it would be doable.

** Make sure you make the speed of development make sense. Unless Harry knows how to make everything, he will have to train people to reinvent stuff. The training and the reinvention process will consume a lot of time. Even if Harry knows how to do everything, he cannot get from 170 AD technology to something like Google in a few years. Development was a continuous process made of small steps that made giant leaps.

Anyways, your idea sounds amazing. Make sure to promote it once you start!

*** You could maybe reach a "1600" level within Harry's lifetime. Steam Engines and beyond require too many supplying industries to set up by one person, even with magic because you need people who know what to do there to train more people. Some areas like philosophy could be advanced almost to modern levels simply by handing over a few books, early medicine such as basic vaccinations or germ theory should not be that difficult if you know what you are looking for and can get a few dozen men on the case.

But heavy industry or military matters, well Harry could transfigure the weapons and I am sure that the Romans could figure out decent tactics, but that would not be sustainable without transfiguration.

** I mean, the stakes seem pretty low... Aliens invade in ~2000 AD, only after most of civilisation was already destroyed, and now Harry gets ~1800 years to prepare? That's a lot of time. I get you want to have Romans, but a start date of like 1945 would probably work a lot better

*** As someone already wrote above, it would take ages to advance the civilisation. Also I imagine that Harry is not the most knowledgeable person on muggle history. It would be a lot of hard work for him and you have to remember that the alien technology was far beyond what existed on earth when they attacked. So he would not only have to get on the level the muggels were at the time of the attack but also beyond that.

**** Ages, yes, but it would also be easily done within the timeframe, assuming Harry achieves his political goals and becomes immortal. He's going to give it a huge headstart, and also ensure that people are constantly working towards the goal. No dark ages, no constant unproductive warfare. The only stakes in the fic are at the beginning. If he succeeds then, he's virtually guaranteed to win. Do you just time-skip through all the remaining centuries, as his plans unfold?

Or alternatively, does he have continuous challenges along the way, making it an 1800 year slog? Bearing in mind someone has to write that in an interesting way.

1800 years is a /really/ long time. It's just so long.
