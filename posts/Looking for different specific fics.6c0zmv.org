** If Dumbledore had seriously mentored Harry, the story would have diverged from the canon SIGNIFICANTLY. For example, when Harry got the Diary in Year 2, he would go to Dumbledore immediately if he trusted Dumbledore just a little bit more. Then neither he nor Ginny would be in any danger.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is extreme AU, featuring a cunning Lucius Malfoy and a brilliant Dumbledore. He taught Harry and his friends well, and did lots of heavy lifting himself. This fic is also Ron/Hermione centric, as their actions significantly contributed to their final victory.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I just caught up to The Space Between by YelloWitchGrl, linkffn(10890018), which is an excellent next gen fic. The villain is far more effective than Voldemort ever was.

More next gen works I recommend include anything by Northumbrian - my favorites being "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" linkffn(6331126) and "James and Me" linkffn(8465313), but the Muggle Interface Team (MIT) series is great as well - little0bird - "The First Day" linkffn(4367121) and "Questions and Answers" linkffn(3954448), though both are bit too dramatic for me - and frombluetored's "Put Your Gun Away, It's Tea Time" linkffn(12096051) and its sequel "Put Your Curse in Reverse" linkffn(12121323)

"The Red Knight" by Demon Eyes Laharl, linkffn(12141684) seems to be the goto Ron-centric fanfiction. Ron is very much ooc here; charismatic, charming and witty instead of endearingly blustering and honest with humor black as coal, but it's still a fun read, featuring a rather unique twist on an old trope (several tropes, actually). "Coming Into Winter" by Fire the Canon, linkffn(8121263) is fluffy anthology of Ron/Hermione moments, some in-universe, others disconnected, mixed with some angst and tragedy, that I enjoyed. "Australia" by MsBinns, linkffn(7562379), is a bit on the angsty side, but another great Ron/Hermione centric story.

My favorite Ron of all time has to be from "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived," a vastly AU story set in the Alex Mack universe (but is entirely focused on the trio), where magic is replaced by advanced pseudo-technology, and the trio are essentially spies-in-training. It's a long read, but worth the effort. You won't find it on ffn, but a quick google will turn up the link.

In "The One He Feared" by Taure, linkffn(9778984) Dumbledore mentors Harry, in a certain manner. It has one of the best written back story for Dumbledore, and is a perfect balance of logical, believable moments and moments of pure awesome. Sadly it's not complete, and will most likely remain that way, since the author has somewhat written himself into a corner.

Sorry for the long post.
