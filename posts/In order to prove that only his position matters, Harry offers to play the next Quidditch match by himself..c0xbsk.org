** I mean... let's say it takes 10 seconds to fly the length of a Quidditch pitch. Maximum time it would take for an unopposed team to score 150 points with the Quaffle is going to be around two and a half minutes.

So unless Harry catches the snitch within a couple of minutes, he's going to lose that game. He's not caught the snitch that quickly before, and this time he wouldn't have two beaters protecting him.

My money is on Harry being shown up as hilariously wrong.

*** So unless he pulls off the year one Snape game, he loses.

*** Snitch is OP though and I know there are fics that reduce the point gain because of how ridiculous it is. I mean in the World Cup Bulgaria almost tied it because of Krum maybe even won when Bulgaria scored 1 goal. It feels like that games results were like that just to show that the snitch isn't always the automatic winner regardless of how hard it is to believe that one of the best teams in the world couldn't score more than one goal compared to the 17 the other team scored.
