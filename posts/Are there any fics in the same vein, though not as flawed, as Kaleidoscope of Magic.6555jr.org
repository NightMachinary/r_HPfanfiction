It is an intense fic and I really like how Harry's betrayal was both profoundly disturbing and yet potentially justifiable depending upon one's philosophy and the info one had. The best part about the story were the characters, with both the betrayer and betrayed being more or less multidimensional in a way they rarely are in fanfics with a prominent "betrayed" trope. I loved how prominently Harry's [[/spoiler][Spoilers]]

While not the best written, the drama was plausible, the angst delicious, the betrayals deep, the reconciliation awkward and halting. It is very much a guilty pleasure and I'm wondering if there are more like it?


** Your spoiler tag just reads "Spoiler" I think you might have coded it wrong. (Easy enough to do)

***** The way you did it is much better. This other spoiler tag requires the custom CSS to work.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.
