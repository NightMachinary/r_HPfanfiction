Minerva Mcgonagall knew something was up the when she noticed that Mr. Potter was not sitting next to Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley like he usually is during meals, but instead he was sitting next to Mr. Thomas with a seat on his right left empty. Then Mr. Malfoy comes down and she would never admit it but she stares. Mr. Malfoy had used magic to grow out his hair just a few inches above his shoulders. Not to mention it was brown now. There was also something very un-Draco Malfoy like about him. She couldn't put her finger on it but his posture was different and and there was an unsure smile instead of customary sneer or scowl or even smirk. Now everyone was watching.

And instead of sitting at the Slytherin table like he does literally everyday, he goes over to the Gryffindor table, sits now next to Mr. Potter and his unsure smile turns into an a very unlike Draco Malfoy grin and throws his arm around Mr. Potters shoulder and says “Hey Buddy”. He throws a smile at Mr. Thomas too and Minerva gapes.

It's not often the stern witch is caught off guard but bloody hell! She looks around the great hall and looks at the others reactions. Severus looks like he just swallowed a lemon, the other Professors have looks of various degrees of shock on their faces. Even Albus has no idea what's going on. She looks at Mr. Finnegan, Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger only to find them also gaping at the unlikely trio indicating that they didn't know what was going on either. The other Gryffindors also seemed shocked. She looks over to the Slytherin Table and see Mr. Malfoy's too goons looking dumbstruck and Miss Parkinson is just stuck in with her mouth agape. Although to be fair, most people were also just there agape.

Minerva purses her lips and wonders what happened to the three boys and their change in attitudes.

**** I will. I am plotting out how this will work out for them to get the memories back. So far I plan to do it at the end of the Third year because they will bring about changes to the WW and also I need to build up them getting their gear and skills back for the Goblet of Fire events. Voldy is going to have a much different duel in the graveyard this time around. I'm already plotting jokes on hitting him in the face with the shield multiple times. Maybe decapitate Nagini with it near the end. I will probably get five chapters written overall then link.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but there's a Post-Endgame fic where Tony ends up in the Wizarding World as a Hogwarts Professor. Brand new from the start of this year. Seven chapters currently, but it hasn't been updated since February. Writer seems to have gone radio-silent. And I'm worried. Because it was really good... and hilarious.
