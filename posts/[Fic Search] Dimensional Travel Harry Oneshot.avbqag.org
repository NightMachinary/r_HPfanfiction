Harry travels to a different dimension (pretty sure on accident) where he's dead? And helps them deal with their voldemort, but he doesn't want to tell James and Lily the truth, or maybe Lily realizes. He connects with his siblings in the new dimension, in the end he finally manages to connect with James. I've read this one fic like 4 times because it's really good and nice and short and it makes me cry everytime, pls hlp

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

** The only oneshot that I know if which in any way fits this is /Across the Universe/, though I don't think it matches up completely. It is, however, a great fic. linkffn(4180686).
