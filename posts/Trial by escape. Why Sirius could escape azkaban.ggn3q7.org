Pettigrew is caught and Sirius set free but now the Wizengamot wants to know how he escaped. Lucius Malfoy spins a great tail about Sirius' escape being a gift from magic, magic knew his innocence and gave him the strength to escape. Malfpy proposed the trial be escape law, of you escape azkaban then you must have been judged innocent or redeemed by magic itself. This ends up helping both sides as whenever Fudge puts an order member in azkaban for being in the wrong place, Dumbles breaks them out and Voldemort releases his followers from proson too.

** But little did they know about his secret ability... abilities. Lock picking, wall climbing, ridiculous strength, the ability to dislocate all his joints, Sherlock level planing, surviving harsh climates, and tunnel digging. Yes. He can do all these things.
