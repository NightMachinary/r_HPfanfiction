Time travel re-do's usually have the whole "this is a huge secret and if they find out, we will upset the timeline / get dissected by the ministry / Albus will mind wipe us." Yet I can't recall a fic where the time traveler just keeps their mouths shut. Any reccs?

*** I'm lukewarm on most harem fic, but I already follow this one. The descriptions of each witches combat techniques are some of my fav action sequences (and its mostly just training) in all of fandom. I'm kinda psyched to read more about the Black daughter as she goes to Hogwarts.

**** Yeah, it's a 'harem' fic without any sex (yet). That in itself is interesting. I like the innovative uses of magic, how Harry is (mostly) keeping up with his adversaries, and the fact that things don't always go as planned.

** I've recently read the 'Travel Secrets' series. The first chapter drops a huge bomb that's completely ridiculous and over the top manipulative Dumbledore and Potters and everyone screws Harry over BUT despite that the fic is surprisingly good.

It has a very interesting take on the magic system, how Dark and Light magic differ and how Dark and Lord Lords actually work (the last part is still a bit of a mystery but there were some very interesting hints so far)

linkffn(9622538)

As I said the first chapter is not a good sample for the rest of the fic but you can't just ignore it either since it is a pretty important secret. The fic is currently half way through year 3 and gety somewhat regular updates.
