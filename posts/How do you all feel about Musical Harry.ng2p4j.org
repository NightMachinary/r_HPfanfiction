Since December I've been writing an AU Harry Potter Fanfiction called "Harry Potter and The Way of Things". It's picking up followers at a steady pace, and I'm actually quite proud of how it's doing.

Harry won't be and edge lord, but let's be honest, every teenager gets a little angsty. There lies the problem. I want to take a more literal approach to the quote, "Ah, /music/, a magic far beyond all we do here!", It wouldn't be Harry's main thing, but I want Music to carry actual magical power.

I know it's a concept that has been explored more thoroughly than I plan to do it. But It's some thing I really want to include in my fanfiction.

The questions are: Does Musical Harry kill a good story? Is it some thing that can be done RIGHT? Would you read a musical Harry fanfiction?

Thanx for your time


** My take is that pretty much anything can work if it is done well.

However, with something like this it runs the risk of Harry coming off as pretentious and unlikeable if he's expressing his teenage feelings through music. As you say, pretty much all teenagers get angsty, but it doesn't make it any less irritating when it happens - the obvious example is Capslock Harry in OotP.

Also, you have to think about what sort of power music would provide. Would it be used offensively, for example? If it's played straight, it runs the risk of looking a bit ridiculous if Death Eaters are attacking and Harry fights them off by singing/guitar solo-ing at them.

*** The story is still in the work, so this hasn't been applied yet. However, I was think more along the lines of a buff. Obviously music is no match for a spell to your face. More like how the right song can put you in a certain mindset. It varies in effect depending on the song and the emotions + magical power of the caster. If a little girl sung a beautiful song, it might lift your spirits, but a powerful magic user channeling their magic into the music would be stronger.

**** Interesting. I think it could work if it was along the lines of Harry using the memory of a particularly emotional/stirring/inspiring music piece to fuel his fighting.

If it's literally a case of a person singing in the middle of a firefight, not only is it a bit strange, you'd have to explain why the singer can't simply be Silencio'd/Stunned/killed to remove the benefit.

***** I was think along the lines of the music has a lasting effect after the song is played and during. Obviously you couldn't use it once the fighting had started. There simple is no way to sing and fight at once (I've seen someone try).

****** How about using magic not during the fight, but as a ritual sort of thing before it? It could be an esoteric/buried magic that has mostly died out but traces of it live on through superstition like nursery rhymes. And the art is discounted because it's associated with women and brushed off as an old wives tale sort of thing, but superstitious mothers still insist on singing a Song of Safety above their newborn's cradle and if a falling pot only just misses the child the next day then that's put down to accidental magic or pure coincidence.

I imagine you could use music not to achieve a specific effect but as an enhancer during a ritual or a more general bad luck curse or something.

******* I figure that could be pretty useful by the time the Battle of Hogwarts comes around. If they can see it coming, and have time to prepare, they might choose some sort of empowering song the give the students confidence, or nerve before the fight. Use multiple musicians, pooling their magic together to essentially, as you said, be an enhancer.

** I think a story about Harry playing the trombone or something could be interesting.

But I really dislike whenever a fic starts using specific songs, and especially when they start dumping lyrics into the fic. That sort of thing always makes me feel like the author is a teenager who just discovered music they like and now thinks that it is objectively the only good music.

And I get that. I was once a teenager with opinions about music that I now think are very cringey, and I'm glad that they are not preserved in a fanfic somewhere. But since I am not a teenager with the exact same musical tastes as the author, I really don't enjoy fics that are full of music.

*** I understand that. Music tastes differ. I was thinking violin and he starts adding lyrics later on, perhaps. I also get how the lyrical dumps can be frustrating. I'm not planning on having Harry break out in song or sing all the time, or even much at all. But a few songs here and there? I think it can be done tastefully, do you?

And I think lyrics should be spaced out by descriptions of the melody, the emotion, the movement of the singer etc.

**** It's honestly not even about music tastes differing. I don't enjoy it any more when the author is praising songs that I like.

What you're describing sounds like it could probably work well though.

** I once read one where Harry begins to rhyme to destress but endgame was he was moving towards being an actual musician.

The fanfic that made me happiest for him was one where he had left the WW and was a muggles musician called Harry Evans. Don't remember anything else about the fic.

** I love the idea of music in magic and especially the battle bard. I tend to picture it as playing/singing songs functions as the incantation for a single complex piece of magic which require constant input. A bit like a more tuneful version of ritual chanting. An example could be animating a large number of minions or conjuring a powerful shield to protect allies. This becomes very much a group tactic, as whoever is performing is powerful, but not particularly flexible and needs to be kept safe so they can concentrate. If done well, it could do a better job than canon in showing how some magic can be difficult and taxing for the caster, rather than just have them spout out a couple of words and wave their wand about.

There is also the possibility of using music to combine the magic of multiple people. If you are just trying to do something simple, like lift something heavy, then everyone casting the same spell at it could work. However, if you are trying to cooperate for complex magic, maybe raising some powerful wards over a building, then everyone preforming the same piece together is a way of syncing up so that their magic acts as one, especially if you are using a more 'intent' magic system. Maybe certain bits of magic require a minimum number of people to do, where everyone has their own part which could play towards their specialisations and everything comes together in a whole.

You can also consider that if magical music is useful, then are their instruments designed as casting foci like wands to make this easier. If so, are they newly made to order, or old relics. Are they general power ups, or tied to particular pieces of magic, like a flute which causes its listeners to fall asleep or hallucinate, or an accordion which manipulates water.

Finally, remember that even without adding in magic, learning music takes time, and takes more time for every piece you learn. If he needs to learn a new piece for every 'spell', then you can work in some conflict from other characters telling him he is spending too much/not enough time on this compared to his other skills.

** I think it's a cool idea and your fic looks interesting and I'll start after this comment! Now in regards to magical music:

1. I think the most important part is that it shouldn't be overpowered or battle-oriented at all. Tom Riddle was a prodigy-if casting magic through a violin was some huge advantage, he would be first chair of every orchestra.
2. Related to that, I think you'd need to develop a more robust magic system in order to accommodate it. Just my personal opinion, but music as this added elective that's slapped into a Hogwarts curriculum as relevant as the others strikes me as weird. I think it'd fit much better if there were other forms of magic in art (and in sex, rituals, blood and all sorts of non-wand mediums).
3. Related to that, I think a good exploration on how magic and music relate would be through emotions. I saw in the comments below the idea of essentially a 'battle hymn' effect. I think minor rituals like that are fine. Other ideas include: uses in high-level enchanting, an ancient culture that did all their magic through chanting and music for archaic flashy effects, dark arts rituals like giving them an earworm that drives them insane etc.
4. I don't know how much you've explored Harry's musical interest already but I think it'd be cool if it's something Lily did too. I like to see Harry connect with Lily with shared activities like that. That one's totally just a friendly suggestion!

** In Tolkien's works, music is definitely a powerful kind of magic. You could take inspiration from that, although magic in LOTR and the Silmarillion is usually more subtle than in Harry Potter. I say usually, because Luthien, the daughter of a Maia (minor angel) and an elf, is able to cast down Sauron's fortress and send him fleeing back to his master, Morgoth. She also forced Morgoth to fall asleep, even though he's an immortal Vala (archangel) and the equivalent of Satan. According to Tolkien's creation myth, the Maiar and Valar created the universe by singing together, so it's definitely possible to use music to accomplish incredible feats of magic.

Anyhow, I'd suggest reading up on the Silmarillion.
