If anyone has any lists of their favorite fics *and why*, please hit me up with a link! I'll put them under [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index#wiki_general_recommendations][General Recommendations]] on the wiki.

An example would be [[/u/Lane_Anasazi][u/Lane_Anasazi]]'s [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/][Top 20 Fics]].

Thanks, ~/Psantium/


** Let's go with my top 7 fics and some honorable mentions. No abandoned fics, and one incomplete one.

*Best Comedy Fic:*\\
Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)\\
This fic is the first in a trilogy that focuses around the laziest Harry you've ever imagined. It's so absurd you can't help but laugh when you read this (even though I've read it like 5 times).

*Best World building:*.\\
Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)\\
This fic takes all the standard WBWL tropes and all the issues in canon and tries to cram it into a workable, internally consistent story. And man oh man does the author succeed. Everyone in this fic behaves intelligently, including Dumbledore, Ron, Lockhart and even Peter Pettigrew. Probably my favorite fic of all time.

*Best Thriller/Non-Linear Story*:\\
Linkffn(Elzium for Sleepless Souls).\\
If you love stories (cough cough shutter Island) where you start with incomplete information and everything comes together at the end, this is right up ur alley. Featuring unreliable protagonists, Umbrige being evil, and a jailbreak from Azkaban.

*Best Next-Gen Fic*.\\
Linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided).\\
A fantastic take on Teddy's first year at Hogwarts. It does a fantastic job capturing the feel of the first three Harry Potter books and delivering a great story (with cameos from our heroes too).

*Best Badass Harry*.\\
Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived).\\
(Bonus: It's the best Harry/Fleur fic too). When Godric's hallow blew up Voldemort left behind a piece of his Soul, Lily left behind her blood and protection, and James left behind his memories. At the start of his 4th year, Harry slowly "remembers" Jame's past life, making him significantly more badass and skilled, while also realistically affecting him negatively (he finds it hard to connect to his friends and figure out who he is). Great triwizard tasks (none of that stations of canon nonsense) and a fantastic romance too.

*Best Redemption/Post-Canon Fic*.\\
Linkffn(Exile):\\
After the war, Draco is exiled from the magical world, forced to live without magic for 5 years. As he starts interacting with muggle society, he find a lifetime of prejudice at odds with the reality before his eyes. A great, very realistic character development where Draco doesn't suddenly go "woohoo muggles rule" but instead takes the journey in stages (with lots of steps back).

*Best Oneshot/Short Fic*.\\
Linkffn(Things Unsaid):\\
Every character that died during canon gets one last line. I'll admit it, I cried at least three times. Cedric's line hits me the hardest (Lupin's line tho... :'( and Dobby's )

So that's my list. Honorable mentions: linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), linkffn(Potter Ever After), Island of Fire (on Ao3), Dudley's memories (on Ao3), linkffn(Accidental Animagus), linkffn(The Twine Bracelet).

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The Arithmancer linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's sequel.

Both phenomenal fanfics with a different unique take on it. Very thought provoking and I personally love all the writing from White Squirrel.

The Refiner's Fire linkffn(The Refiners Fire)

A very well written and thought out OP!Harry, very good plot line and Abraxan makes you emotionally connect with the characters in a very good way quite early on.

Harry McGonagall linkffn(Harry McGonagall)

Interesting take on one of the very first scenes which grows onto something so much more.

Those are the only ones that come straight to my head recently, I recently read The Fire Bird's Son trilogy linkffn(Fire Bird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy) and remember seriously enjoying it, but I was reading so much at the time they've all kind of merged together.

** *Best World Building*

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom)

I absolutely love the world building and the characters. At times, it feels like a continuous adventure with lots of action, snarky dialogue, humour and intriguing, intercepting plot lines. It goes deep into magic and is very rich in world building including wizarding world, werewolf society and later magical europe. Its an AU where Voldemort won the first war. He is still ruthless and is willing to do immoral things to get his way, but he can also be strangely charming, reasonable and knowledgeable and and sane. His interactions with Harry are great, they have somewhat of a mentor - reluctant student thing going on which works very well.

This fic has very good characters and likes to put a small twist to them so that you can still recognize them but see them in slightly different circumstances (Such as Luna and Sirius as werewolves, Dumbledore as an antigonist who is still good, and yet works directly against Harry sometimes, and many more).

*Best Horcrux is influencing Harry fic*

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

Tom's horcrux awakens and starts taking and interacting with Harry at a young age. I feel like it really nails the the slow and realistic influence of Tom on Harry and how it affects him and his personality. Really well written and has some great dialogue and really captures Tom's character voice.

*Best Comedy*

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Somewhat insane version of Voldemort after being defeated by Harry as a baby becomes Harry Potter. Best part is that while Harrymont is kind of crazy and interprets things in a ridiculous way, everyone else acts more or less normal. One of the most quotable fics ever, almost every sentence and paragraph is hilarious.

*Best One-Shot*

linkffn(Cauterize)

Very emotional and short fic post war.

*Best Unlikely Friendship Fic/Character Study*

linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love)

Snape and Luna friendship story that takes place during Hogwarts years, canon compliant. Really captures Snapes and Lunas characters. Funny, sweet, emotional and somewhat sad.

*Best Fem!Harry*

linkffn(The Never-Ending Road)

I love Harry's character in this one, she is really well written as a female character and the fic is interesting with new plot lines and action and not a canon rehash. Really enjoy the friendship between Hermione and Harry, very believable and sweet. Also note that while the summary does say that there is future Snape/Harriet, there is currently no romance at all at this point.

** Linkffn(Basilisk born) is an amazing Fic that may start out a little weird but gets a lot better once you get through the first chapter or two.

Linkffn(prince of Slytherin) is one of my favorite Slytherin Fics. It's a good read.

Linkffn(on the way to greatness) similar to prince of Slytherin but not quite as well written. Still a good read.

Linkffn(Accidental animagus) is a good Fic with a sequel being being written. It has very good worldbuilding.

Linkffn(the badgers champion) is a okay Fic with a good premise. It's more of a guilty pleasure fic(i.e. way overpowered Harry)

Linkffn(the champions champion) is my favorite comedy Fic. Really well done, but it's a Ron Bashing Fic.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
