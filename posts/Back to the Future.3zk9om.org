Hey, I'm looking for stories where one of the Trio goes back in time and has either Lily or James get a crush on them, which they have to fix to save Harry (or himself) from being unborn.

I realize it's a specific request, and most likely very niche, but I figured what the hey.


** LinkFfn(one hundred sixty nine) has Hermione going back and meeting the marauders. Hijinks ensue, but not exactly the hijinks you're looking for. It's my favorite fic, so I figured I'd share because it's close.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** If you come across them, please post them! I've gotten hooked after reading an actual James/Hermoine fic, though I definitely realize that a BttF! Scenario would work a little better, most likely.

***** The last fic (the one by Ayrian) is a plagiarized work. The "author" has been plagiarizing 100+ stories the last few weeks. The original work was written by Shezza88 by the same name (although it has been taken down).
