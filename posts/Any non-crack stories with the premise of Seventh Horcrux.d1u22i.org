** Okay, I have a crazy theory. I think, in seventh horcrux, it is actually Harry who lives in his own body, but because he had memories of being Voldemort more than Harry, he thought he was Voldemort. That's why we never see Harrymort commit an evil act. The worse things he does are all pale gray.

**** Hermione believes that 'theory', too. Even Ron thinks that Harry is so good at lying that he sometimes convinces himself that what he believes is true (like that he's Lord Voldemort).

*** Honestly, if Harry were to have Voldermorts memories would it not be Voldermort regardless of him being possessed? I highly doubt a 15month old infant has the intelligence and personality to override a 60 year old dark lord. Memories are what make you afterall

The Carriage Held is a great fic, but the possession happens in 5th year.
