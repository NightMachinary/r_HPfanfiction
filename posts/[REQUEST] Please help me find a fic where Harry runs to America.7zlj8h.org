I read a fanfic a while ago where Harry runs away to American magic school and Dumbledore teams up with Ministry to take him back and fail. I tried to find it for months but nope, they are not showing up.

Help this dude!


** You might be thinking of The Brave New World by Bellerophon30. It was taken down from fanfiction.net but is still available [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/bnw/a/1/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][here]].

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

#+begin_quote
  Jaune was a hunter, hunting animals from a young age. Not Grimm, and never people. Not like the so-called 'real' Hunters he wanted nothing to do with. But when an absent sister asks him to help rescue a missing student, Jaune Arc and Lie Ren will both have to put aside their differences and learn what it means to be true Huntsmen if they're to survive the Grimmlands.

  Harry is not content to hear how he is "perfectly safe" and turns to the only adult he feels he can trust. Sirius helps him gain his animagus form, its down hill for the bad guys after that. Then one shock after another leads to a new life for Harry and his three 'Uncles". No pairings yet. For missgsmith51 who picked the animagus form.
