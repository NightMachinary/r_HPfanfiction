#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Just out of curiosity: did you read it any further or was it your stopping point? Because the tattoo stuff is the least memorable thing about this fic.

** I think you are looking for linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) the author hasn't updated in a few years but they finished another story earlier this year and want to get back to that one eventually. The author has had some health problems which keeps pushing things back unfortunately. It's a fun story though.

#+begin_quote
  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)
