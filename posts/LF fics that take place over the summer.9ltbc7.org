** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) is set the summer before year 5, and involves Harry living and working at Diagon Alley and befriending a muggle family. It is unfinished and probably abandoned, but the plot is mostly wrapped up by the last chapter.
