Since Discord seems to be hip nowadays, should this sub get a discord chat?

[no proper idea what to flair this as]

*** Until now I've assumed we only had an IRC, but there are over 30 members online right now, presumably far more offline, and as far as I can tell at least one mod is an admin on the discord.

So [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]], did you just forget to add this to the sidebar or what?

**** It was used pretty sporadically until recently. Some people haven't wanted to switch and the bot bridging it with IRC is not always reliable.

** We already have an IRC channel, I don't know how you use it or anything though, given I've never used it.

Nevertheless, I think it'd be a good idea. Discord is much easier to use than any other similar product.
