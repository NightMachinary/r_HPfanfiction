...Born to those who served him, born with the birth of the sixth month...


** "Lucius," Voldemort said regally, stepping into Malfoy Manor.

"My lord." Lucius bowed. "You grace us with your presence. Come, have a seat. How may I serve you?"

Voldemort looked at the blond child that played on the rug by the hearth. "You heir?"

"Yes, my lord," Lucius replied. "I'll have the elf take him from the room."

"He has your receding hairline," Voldemort commented. "What was the day of his birth?"

"Beginning of June, my lord," Lucius answered. "The fifth."

"I see," Voldemort said, pulling the yew wand from his sleeve. "/Avada Kedavra!/"

**** I can't even imagine Draco being the BWL. XD.

Dobby popped in at the last second, using house elf magic to shield Draco, making the spell rebound on its caster. The Dark Lord fell, leaving Lucius standing there in stunned silence. He owed a life debt to his house elf and there would be a lot of explaining to do at the next Death Eater meeting. And Salazar's beard, he /didn't/ have a receding hairline!

***** I didn't say he would be the BWL, but the consequences of just murdering the heir of one of his devoted followers could very well backfire.

EDIT

Why was this downvoted?

****** Very true, if his followers conspired against him he would lose every chance at his end goal of being all powerful and cheating death.

*** I think that the Malfoys wouldn't keep baby Draco in Voldemort's presence as Voldemort (according to his thoughts in DH) hates crying babies since they remind him of his days in the orphanage. And if he asked for Draco, I'm pretty sure one of the two would figure out why he wants the baby. I'm also pretty sure that at least Narcissa would make a similar sacrifice as Lily for Draco.

**** Not for nothing, but why would the Malfoys even be aware of Voldemort's distaste for crying babies? I'm pretty sure he went through great lengths to distance himself from his past.

**** Harry's first defeat of Voldemot did have some very specific conditions that had to be met for it to happen. First of all, Harry's parents knew that their son was being targeted. If Lucius didn't know of the existence of the prophecy, he would have had no cause to deny his Lord if Voldemort himself asked to be shown Lucius' newborn heir. He would have seen it as an honor.

In addition to this, Lily's sacrifice worked the way it did because she was offered the chance to save herself by giving up her baby. And that's only because Snape specifically asked for her to be spared. While I'm not entirely sure why Voldemort didn't just lie and actually made the offer to Lily, I can imagine it being along the lines of "it's not very smart to get on the wrong side of the person who brews your potions, you'll never know when his hand might slip, otherwise", Snape was a brilliant Potions Master, after all.

If Voldemort asked to visit his "most insert_flayyery follower"'s firstborn son, I don't think someone as self-absorbed and entitled as Lucius would have been too suspicious. And if then, standing over the cradle, Voldemort brandished his wand and cast Avada Kedavra, I don't think either parent would have had time enough to react and throw themselves into the very short path of the curse, even if they wanted to.

***** Yeah. My thought is that it might cause the Malfoys to rebel, to see their only son and heir murdered in cold blood, because say what you want about the family, it's clear, at least in canon, that Narcissa cares about her son..

I also rather like the idea that Dobby's loyalty to the baby outweighs his desire for freedom, and he either saves Draco, or sacrifices himself to protect him.

I remember one interesting fanfic Lucius took advantage of Dobby's cleverness rather directly, by freeing him and giving him a mission, in which Dobby realized that the freedom allowed him to disobey the orders if he could see a better outcome.

  It was foretold that a child born at the end of July would be his downfall. Lord Voldemort didn't want to take any chances as to whom the prophecy could apply to. Malfoy POV, Complete.
