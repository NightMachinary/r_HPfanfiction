** You just know Ginny has that first, pretty moving argument about letting Harry name the kids, but in reality her whole family was like ‚ÄúGinny, we think you should let Harry take care of the naming. We're still stuck with an owl named Pig and it's generally embarrassing.‚Äù

And tbh, i don't even think she chose Lily Luna. Harry was friends with Luna too. I think Ginny would have named her daughter something way strange If given free rein

** Am I the only one who thinks that Rowling was forcing it with the second generation Potter names? I don't know a single person who would name every one of their children after a parental figure, even orphans. Like, naming a child after yourself is rare enough, but naming all of your children after dead people, except Lily's middle name, is not something that anyone would actually do. Especially ‚ÄòSeverus' who was a bully and a bigot, and only made a few decision that an actual good person would have made anyways. God I cringe whenever I think of their names. Like Rose and Hugo, for example, are good, reasonable names. But for the Potters, it's like their names were made from a tiny word bank of people significant to Harry's life story. It's ridiculous.

**** Yeah, like I get that, and while it weirds me out a little that it's his closest relation rather than a slightly more distant relative that most people do, that's not my main sticking point with their names.

It's that it's all Harry's, and they are /all/ named with the same thing in mind. Even more than that, Albus Severus. Neither Dumbledore nor Snape (especially Snape) were very good to Harry, and definitely did not deserve having one is his children named after them.

The only name that I find no objection to among the Potter kids is Lily Luna, because the given is his mother and the second name is a friend. Whereas James Sirius is ‚Äúdead father figure‚Äù-‚Äúdead father figure‚Äù and Albus Severus is... well, I've already voiced my objections to that.

But the gist of it is, and sorry for the long rant, is that I don't mind the whole ‚Äúhonoring the dead with kids' names‚Äù thing, but it bothered me with how uncreative it was to name them all in that way.

************ House of Black family tree shows Dorea Black marrying into the Potter family.

NVM that could be a Aunt or Uncle of James or his grandmother or grandfather.

************* Yeah, it's suspected that it's a cousin cause there's no name for the son that Dorea and Charlus have, or that the son ever married and had children.

As far as JK has confirmed, it's Fleamont and Euphemia Potter (though there's so many fics that make Charlus the grandfather, it's easy to forget lol)

** Harry shit on his parents memories by naming his Kid after the person who got them killed. I like Harry up until the epilogue when we find out he made one of the worse mistakes of his life by naming his kid after Snape. Harry always wanted to be just Harry then he goes ahead and names his Kids after dead people who have a reputation and places a burden on them. Give the kids their own damn first names, and just have James, Lily and Sirius as middle names.

**** Before Snape bullied harry for 6 years he didn't give a damn whether James or Harry survived at all. When snape was cradling lily to show his love for her after she died most people think that its cute. I think he's a bitch who forgot there was a living child behing him. Harry should have never named his child Severus.

****** Don't call them the worst sort of people for example I know a Snape apologist who shares a lot of the same views on things with me. Don't stereotype. Besides that I agree with you, Snape attempted to play both sides by asked Dumbledore to protect ONLY lily and he asked Voldemort to spare ONLY LIly's life. He's a selfish brat who after sentencing a family to death has the gall to bully Harry as if its his fault. Snape is a selfish immature person who thinks just because he loves LIly all of his other crimes don't exist. Bruh... I don't think he even loved Lily, I think it was an obsession.

****** How did he want them to die? Because he didn't ask Voldemort to save the asshole who bullied him and the kid who was destined to kill Voldy? If he asks to save Lily then it appears to Voldy as Snape wanting the girl which he's fine with. If he asks Voldy to save James then Voldy realizes that he really loves Lily and that love is a threat to Voldemort so he kills both Lily and Snape. I feel like I shouldn't have to explain why Snape isn't gonna ask Voldemort to spare the guy who is DESTINED TO KILL HIM but I will. If Snape asks for the person destined to kill Voldemort to be spared, he's gonna get murdered on the spot. He asked Voldemort to spare Lily likely out of desperation. Then he went to Dumbledore and told him Voldemort planned to kill the Potters, knowing full well that Dumbledore wasn't gonna just hide Lily. If he really wanted Lily to be the only one who survived, he could just not tell Dumbledore, wait for Voldemort to attack the Potters' house, and kidnap Lily while Voldemort murders Harry and James. Snape has a lot of flaws but despite hating James, he did not want them to die

******* The James part may make sense but... what about Harry. Snape goes into a house looking for Lily to find her and a baby Harry in a crib with a lighning scar. You could've picked up Harry and taken him to Dumbledore, even if you didn't like Harry it made sense to take the one who survived Voldemort to Dumbledore. Before you say Emotions, Snape is an expert Occlumens, an ability he learned DURING the first way not after. Anyone could've taken Harry away in the about 1 hr gap between Snape's arrival and Hagrid's and Sirius's

**** Are you saying Snape is allowed to bully Harry because he saved his life that time?

Harry defeated Voldemort saving all the muggleborns from certain death, he is now allowed to bully them whenever he wants, which is everytime he sees one.
