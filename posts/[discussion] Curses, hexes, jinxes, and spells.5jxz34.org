How would you define the different types of spells in Harry Potter? In all of the stuff I have read the spells had one of the above words stuck on to it and I never found anything that explained the difference between them or how they are categorized.


** This is how i differentiate them in my own head and when I'm writing: I use spells as a broad terms to define all magic using a wand and saying a magical phrase. Curses, hexes, jinxes, etc are all spells.

Curses would be dark magic, and, again in my own mind so people may disagree, they tend to linger longer.

Hexes and jinxes are short term offensive dark spells such as the bat-bogey hexes or the jelly leg jinx.

I actually just looked this up on the HP Wiki and they agreed lol. Here's the link: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Spell]]

** I tend to handle them oddly. Some spells can fit into multiple categories.

Jinx: Pretty much the troll spells of the wizarding world. Temporary spells that can have mischievous effects.

Hex: A lightweight Curse. Has no real lasting damage, but can be rather annoying and harmful.

Charm: Everyday spells for everyday life.

Curse: Spells that maim, kill, or permanently disfigure.

** Jinxes are things that temporarily cause malfunctions or failures. Anti-apperition jinx, jelly legs jinx are two examples, the first stops apperation from working the other your legs. Hexes are low level malicious spells. Curses are either more violent and lasting hexes.

** Before I begin, I would like to say that Dark Spells to me, just mean that they are usually done with a malicious context in mind, that does not necessarily mean that the spells are evil. (Example: Sectumsempra is essentially a Severing/Cutting Curse, but there is also a Severing/Cutting Charm, which means that it requires the same intent, and that the only thing that differs is the power of the spell). This basically means that Dark Magic doesn't really exist when you think about it (unless you count the Unforgivables which require a great amount of hate, or a desire to hurt/control).

Jinxes are Low-Level Dark Spells that are essentially charms with Dark Effects (Changing someone's Physical Appearance, Causing a Job to give someone misfortune, etc...) Even a Punching Jinx (if one existed) could just be seen as a localized Banishing Charm.

Hexes are Mid-Level Dark Spells that consist of Charms and Transfiguration (Bat-Bogey Hex essentially nigh-transfigures and animates, and the Stinging Hex applies the Physical effect of stinging).

Curses are Powerful Martial Magic Spells, due to how powerful they are their effects can last very long times, but they aren't as permanent as Hexes (people have recovered from Curses, but Hermione had to use Madame Pomfrey's Tooth Reducing device to get rid of the effect of a Hex).

Charms are very hard to describe, as their uses are highly dependent on what the user has in mind. In my head-canon, Agumenti, and Incendio can be edited with just a little imagination (that is why we see Harry having the ability to create a localized fire, and a puddle of water, while also being able to use both spells to create a stream/beam of fire/water). This is further proven in the last book when Harry shields the entirety of the people in the Great Hall with a simple Protego. But keep in mind that the power of the spell does not change, so that is why people will use more powerful fire spells in battle (like Fiendfyre, or Harry's Golden Flames) instead of just spamming incendio.

Transfiguration is for all intents and purposes like Alteration from The Elder Scrolls. It is the manipulating of reality to create things from thin air, or change things into something completely different. But unlike how the Elder Scrolls Series has destruction (The De-creation of things basically) we have vanishment.

*** Sectumsempra was a lot more than a simple Severing charm. It also had a clause in it that stopped anyone from healing wounds caused by it if they didn't have the correct healing spell. Only Snape knew the spell and I doubt he shared it with anyone.

The fact that nobody could heal the wounds is what classified it as Dark Magic.

** Curse - long term

Hex - Short term involving transfiguration / changing an objects form

Jinx - Short term involving charms / manipulating but not changing an object. Less difficult to treat than a hex, generally.

Spell - word combination said to power/fuel/help production of magic effect, often with wand.

In my headcanon anyway.

** Charms: Usually Light based. Varies from protective shields (Patronus Charm) to household spells. Any long term effects are positive and likely long-lasting (ex. Cheering Charms).

Jinxes: Offensive spells, no long term effects. They usually fade by themselves and cause embarassment at best (Jelly-Legs Jinx). Prank spells probably fall under this.

Hexes: Offensive spells, some long term effects. These usually need to be reversed by somebody else and might leave some minor physical or mental damage. Examples: Furnunculus, Densaugeo, and the Bat Bogey Hex.

Curses: Offensive spells, causes highly detrimental long term effects or death. Usually irreversible or reversible with irreversible aftermath. Curses include the Unforgiveables, Sectumsempra, and Confringo.

  “Similarly can anyone tell me the difference between a hex and a curse?”

  Again Tamblin raised his hand when he saw no one else do so but McGonagall waited without calling on him. With a slight edge of impatience in her voice she eventually answered he own question for the class.

  “A curse is the name for harmful charms, while a hex is a harmful transfiguration. Hence 'Immobilus' is a charm that forces a person to stop moving, meanwhile 'Petrificus Totalus' is a transfiguration that causes temporary petrification. While both have the same result they work in very different ways.”

  A Hufflepuff boy in the front row raised his hand eagerly. McGonagall looked down over her glasses at him.

  “Yes?”

  “What about Jinxes, Professor?”

  Rather than see if anyone could answer, McGonagall immediately replied, “Jinxes may be either charms or transfigurations. It simply means a very minor hex or curse. The trip jinx for instance is a charm, and hence a curse, but because its effect is so minor it is generally called a jinx. I expect you shall learn much more on that subject in Defense Against the Dark Arts with Professor Quirrell. In this class, however, we will be concerned only with transfigurations, and you will find the topic worth every effort you make for it.”

***** It means that instead of answering the question like everyone else, you used a section of your own writing, not canon-supported material or speculation on canon writing. Not that there's anything outright wrong with that, but some feel like it's an underhanded tactic to get exposure.

***** It means that you right a lot of exposition; you like to give a lot of details about things that no one cares/needs to know about at the time.

You even state this yourself at the end when she says "You'll learn more about the subject in Defense" (despite being the one to ask the question about the hex and curse in the first place for some odd reason).

Your writing is very melodramatic, "shall", wtf?

******* The information may be imparted if the student asks. But it was McGonagall that asked it in your fic, Teachers don't randomly start talking about something unless it connects back with the conversation at hand. I feel that it would have been smarter if you gave the dialogue meaning, but instead, you just gave the teacher an "I digress" moment.
