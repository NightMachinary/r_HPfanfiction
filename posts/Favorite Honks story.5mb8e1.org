Looking for some good Harry/Tonks stories!


** linkffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor)

Not really a romance but they are lovers and partners in crime and blasphemy.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** There's the classic linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer Of Change), which /Definitely/ shows its age but is still enjoyable.

Chelseyb1010's Honks stories were excellent (The Rebel and the Chosen, and The Half Blood Auror, and basically everything she ever wrote on ffn), but it appears that account has been deleted :(

*** Sometimes you can find stuff on fictionhunt, like these ones you mentioned [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6740130/1][here]] and [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7746111/1][here]].

Hope they're the right ones ... and copy them while you can, if they are.

(Sometimes, it seems that stuff gets taken down from that site.)

Edit: As an aside, I haven't read these fics, but I know what it's like to see favorite stuff deleted, so ... yeah.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** My first thought reading this title was "I didn't know there are Love Love crossovers with HP" (Honks is a fan nickname for one of the characters)

I may look for Love Live x UP crossovers now.

EDIT: It's just 4 Hogwarts AU shipping fics (with my least fave popular shop to boot). I can't say I expected much, but I did think there was going to be more then one person crossposting from Tumblr.

*** What was the point of this comment? Did you really think OP would go "Oh, this random dude on the internet said that there are no good Honks fanfics. Clearly he has read every single fanfic that has ever existed and is able to say this with complete authority, not to mention that clearly this random person exactly shares his likes and dislikes with me."

Fanfics are posted here as recommendations, in the hopes that others will be able to share the enjoyment that you got from reading a particular fanfic. It makes literally no sense to make a comment like this.

**** People are just going to say rebel and the chosen, nymphadora's beau, or HP & the halfblood auror. They're okay, but not good. Then you got something like breach of contract: 12 signs, which is very good, put the pairing isn't the focus.
