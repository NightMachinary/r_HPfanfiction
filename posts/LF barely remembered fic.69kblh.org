I vaguely remember reading something where harry wound up in some sort of duel in maybe rome. Flamel used the event to kill people that were too powerful. There was some ninja-esque girl there. I feel like some powers/artifacts that harry was aquiring were obtained by force.

Not sure if it was any good... Any ideas?

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.
