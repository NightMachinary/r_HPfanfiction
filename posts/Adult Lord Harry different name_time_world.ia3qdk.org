Some of the best HP fics I have read are when adult Harry goes to a new world or time and becomes a powerful adult Wizarding lord --- be it Lord Potter or Black or Peverell or whatever. I'm looking for more! Crossovers or HP world. For example, “Last Second Savior” by Plums, “Alone in the ‘Verse” by Mountain Climber, “Wind Shear” by Chilord, “”Lord of Time” by DebtheSlytherinSnapeFan, and “Black Fortunes” by Herald Mage Anduli.

What do you recommend to add to the list?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travels to 1975 and teams up with Bellatrix. He eventually takes the Lord Black title.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): No dimensional or time travels here, but he openly calls himself the new Dark Lord and declares war on the establishment.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** Thank you! I've seen Delenda EST and read the first few pages a long time ago, but I remember closing it because I was afraid it was going to be very angsty. I'm going back to it today.

I did read “Sum of Their Parts” but it's worth a re-read.

I hope there are more recs. I'm spending more time searching than reading the stories!
