k, so we've all read the bajillion stories where when Harry inherits things (with a side dish of Helpful Goblins tm), and for some reason it comes with a non-negotiable marriage contract that he must fulfil or he'll die. I want to see a fic where someone else had that problem a long time ago, and we get to see the long reaching effects of it.

Specifically, this thought came to be when I accidentally made it 39,000 words into a Snarry fic (I did not know it was my notp until then) where the Blacks had a contract between Eileen Prince and Orion Black, and then she ran away, and it defaulted to their children (Sirius and Snape), but Snape didn't take his inheritance because he wanted to avoid marrying Sirius. This fic had Harry inherit from the Blacks and then use the thing with Snape to get out of another contract, but for the purposes of this prompt I think it would be interesting if he hadn't.

Like, what if Eileen has a contract and then runs away from it, losing most of her magic, and then it defaults to Sirius and Snape, but Snape takes the inheritance because he needs the resources to keep himself safe during the war, hoping Sirius will die (possibly trying to help that eventuality along by attempting to kill him). Then the war ends, and Sirius isn't in Azkaban largely because Snape has to rescue him (for God's sake, if the man isn't properly convicted I'll have to marry him! Give the bastard a trial now!). Like... what would that look like. Coldest marriage on the planet, but contractually forced cohabitation. Harry would probably be there. Grimmauld Place would have some interesting family dinners. Remus would live in the mistress apartment, and literally be a mistress... It would be interesting to see.

And that's not the only one, now that I'm thinking about it. What about the legendary Weasley v Malfoy feud. Maybe the cousin whose an accountant (who we don't talk about) isn't actually a squib, but lost their magic when they refused to marry Abraxas Malfoy. Maybe there's even a lot of money and stuff that the Weasleys are supposed to have, but don't because they won't marry a death eater.

And like, Andromeda, man. She definitely wasn't supposed to marry Ted Tonks, but who was she supposed to marry? How did that fall apart? What horrible things can we do to the characters using that as an excuse.

The forced marriage trope could be so much cooler, but instead it's mostly used as an excuse to give Harry a harem. And I feel like that trope would be less out there and a lot more interesting applied to other characters. IDK. I just want to see a 'forced marriage' fic where it's someone besides Harry (and all his classmates). If inheriting contracts, and familial duties you'll lose your magic/life if you don't do is a Thing in the wizarding world, then I want it to be a Cool Thing.


** I would definitely read a fic that elaborates on this! Very nice suggestion!
