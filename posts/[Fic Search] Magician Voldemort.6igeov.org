I can't seem to remember the title of that hilarious story (it was something like "The Story of the Most Terrible Voldemort", but I'm not sure about the exact wording and just typing that approximation simply finds stories, with Voldemort, who's terrible.) It has a guy tell his son about how he built the fake Voldemort persona in his youth, using magician techniques, without being even /able/ to use an Unforgivable, just so he could lead the pureblood bigots to their own downfall by sending them on intentionally dangerous errands (such as pitting them against Moody over, and over, and over). It had a sequel showing the man's son resurrecting the Voldemort persona through the events of /Philosopher's Stone/, and that one was a tad less well-executed.


** This one I guess: linkffn(Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort)

  A tale of illusion and deception - what better bedtime story could a magician tell his son than when he managed to pull one over on the entire wizarding world?
