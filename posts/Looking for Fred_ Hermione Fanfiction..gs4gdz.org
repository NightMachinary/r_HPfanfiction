:END:
In which it is after the war and Fred is dead and Hermione finds a Weasley family necklace and after she wares it she goes back in time to the 5th year battle of department of mysteries. She saves Sirius and then she and Fred fall in love.

That's all I remember about this fic, read it a few years ago.

*** It like the necklace is a Weasley family hairloom so when Hermione wears it connects her to Fred somehow and she ends up in the department of mysteries fight.
