:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, Hermione was a Slytherin and super smart. She defeated Malfoy in a duel and she gave him strategies for quidditch and this boy slowly started seeking approval from her? There was also this scene where Tom Riddle's diary starts teaching her stuff and there's this part where she turns a gold fish into a bird and another part where some prefect uses Terego to clean Hermione's clothes. Anyone know this fic? Thank you very much for your time.
