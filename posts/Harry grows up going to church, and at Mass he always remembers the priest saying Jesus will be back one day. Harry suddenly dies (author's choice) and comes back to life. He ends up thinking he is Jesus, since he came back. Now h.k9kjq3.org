#+TITLE: Harry grows up going to church, and at Mass he always remembers the priest saying Jesus will be back one day. Harry suddenly dies (author's choice) and comes back to life. He ends up thinking he is Jesus, since he came back. Now he uses his powers to just continually make water into wine.

*** Eh, if his death and resurrection were public enough and later he went around doing miracles (wandless magic) I think he could actually pull it off. Remember that when people get really convinced of something they will generally develop progressively better mind-gymnastics skills to justify their belief -Harry being unable to resurrect people left, right and center? Well obviously it is because God didn't want them to abuse his powers; instead of walking on water he starts flying? Great! An update!

Personally I am more interested in what would be his reaction to discovering he can speak with snakes and how the religious would react to this.
