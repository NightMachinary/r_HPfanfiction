Hello, friends!!! This is my first time trying my hand at this whole fanfiction thing; but I am very excited to give it a go. I am just a concerned mommy who wants her little ones to read; but does not want them to turn into witches. So I decided to rewrite Harry Potter with all the adventure and friendship; but without the witchcraft, the rebellion, and the depraved Ronald. I hope you all enjoy this. Remember-----the glory is not mine. I am working for a greater cause =)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles]]

Edit: Chapter two has been posted!!! I thought I had done it before. Turns out, it was just in my doc manager. Oops!!!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/2/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles]]

Edit: I am not sure if I will be able to post on this reddit anymore. People have been calling me names, and I don't appreciate a bullying environment. I know that I am a new user, I thought this would be a good place to share my little story, but perhaps not. I see that this is not a place where Christians are welcome.

Edit: The link to the second chapter has been fixed!!! Many thanks to BadWolf100 for pointing this out =)

Edit: Chapter three is up!!! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles]]

** Welcome to this subreddit! I'll admit, I always thought that reports of the /Harry Potter/ books encouraging witchcraft were satire; could you please elaborate a little on how these books are not "family friendly", as you put it? I understand that some "rituals" described in the books might seem "satanical", but those are clearly frowned upon by the magical community (with the exception of Durmstrang, supposedly) as Rowling describes it. The main characters of the book have all suffered due to the use of "dark magic", which is presented as an often uncontrollable, malignant force.

Personally, I feel like traditional Christian ideas can be introduced into the world of Harry Potter without completely excluding the magic of JKR's world: simply think of the character of van Helsing in /Dracula/, or more generally Christian symbolism like the cross, holy water, etc. All of these can be given a "magical" meaning that meshes with the existing lore (cf. vampire fanfiction).

As an aside, why do you feel it necessary to attack evolution in your story? I don't think it is even remotely addressed in canon, though this may be part of JKR's exclusion of science (magical or not) in her books.

I'll be honest and say your story reads like a proselytizing rant against non-Christians (or nonbelievers in general), rife with stereotypes but lacking in any convincing arguments (prove that evolution is true? The wikipedia page for evolutionary biology is enough to see there is a rich body of evidence to support evolution.) Without going too much into the religious debate, I'm afraid your fic bears all the attributes of a "bashing"-fic, and so I will not be following it, much as I would have liked to see a well-written Christian narrative set in the world of Harry Potter.

EDIT: And how is Ron depraved? He uses the Imperius curse once, but I don't recall him using any other "dark" magic. If you are simply attacking /all/ witches and wizards, why him?

EDIT^{2:} WTF? The /rebellion/? Are you seriously suggesting that the resistance against Voldemort is something you want to eliminate in your story? Or do you mean any type of disobedience (which is arguably even more troubling) ?

EDIT^{3:} lol "socialism".

*** Wow!!! Thank you for this well thought out response!!! I would say that the fact that the characters use "witchcraft" and "wizardry" in the first place is not family friendly. I understand what you are saying-----there are a lot of good things about these books-----but why not keep those good parts but take out the "witchcraft" parts? That is what I think.

And I am not attacking Evolution. I just thought it would be fun and educational to put some scientific debate in there for my little ones. My youngest one is such a little scientist, I just know he would love it!!!

I am sorry it is not well-written. I must admit: I am not the best writer. You seem like a very intelligent person; and I am sure that you read a lot of classic literature and such; and I know my little story does not measure up to that. It is just a fun little story for my little ones and other concerned mommies =)

**** I'm glad you decided to answer.

Some of the most beautiful parts in the books are deeply magical- Harry's discovery of the Mirror of Erised, the first description of Hogwarts, etc. If you remove those, you have the story of a mistreated orphan being sent to a faraway school, and then being coerced into fighting a mass murderer. I think we can agree that's not exactly as family-friendly as the original story. Much of /Harry Potter/'s charm is in its escapism, but an acknowledged escapism. Replacing magic with religion also removes the suspension of disbelief, since you bring aspects of everyday religious life into the story.

Regarding your description of a "debate" between a creationist and a proponent of evolution: I hope this is not what you consider a "debate" in real life.

I didn't say your story was badly written. I didn't really pay attention to the style because of how boggled I was at the content. That said, on the surface it seems quite clear.

I only wish to plead for your children's right to read what is undoubtedly a very good children-to-teenager's story, and not to force such grown-up concerns as religious morality, evolution etc. onto the books. Their intent is not to turn children away from the "right" path, only to entertain, and perhaps showcase the value of friendship and love; as such, please reconsider your decision to censor them. Whether or not you allow your children to read the original books, they will be confronted with unchristian-like ideas sooner or later. Why, then, compromise their childhood as well?

Atheists want to be good people just like Christians. My boyfriend and good friend are both Atheists and they are both kind caring people that want to help others and they do it believing there is no afterlife. Harry Potter teaches about tolerance and acceptance. That is the main message of the books, this looks as though it will only teach one line of thought.

Christ taught us to turn the other cheek to our oppressors, not to lash out at them passive aggressively. Please read Matthew 5:39.

He also had rather strong things to say about affecting overt religiosity in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican: "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." (Luke 19:14, NIV). You, my good person, appear to be exalting yourself and denigrating others, which is decidedly un-Christ-like.

** Please tell me this is a joke. If you do not want your children to read about witchcraft, because you're scared they'll "turn into witches", then read them the seven Narnia books. Those are nice and Christian-friendly. Your children will be bullied at school when they don't know what Harry Potter really is about, but think they do. They'll watch the movies at a party and don't know what is going on. You're going to alienate your kids if you go through with it, and murder a great story along the way. (I also would like to add that the numerous times I've read the Harry Potter books didn't turn me into a witch.)

**** The lion is an allegory for jesus. here is an excerpt from a paper that goes into detail.

#+begin_quote
  Lewis, then, has retold the story of the death and resurrection of Jesus in the context of Aslan and Narnia. He has used several devices, however, to transform this heavy content into material for a children's novel. The obvious difference in Lewis' retelling of the Biblical story is his use of Aslan the lion and the land of Narnia. There is, to an extent, use of lion imagery in the Bible: "You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son." (Gen 49:9), "A king's wrath is like the roar of a lion..." (Proverbs 20:2), "They will follow the Lord; he will roar like a lion." (Hosea 11:10). Most important is the reference of lions in the Book of Revelation, referring (we assume) to Christ: "See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed." (Rev 5:5). Evidently, Lewis' choice of a lion to represent Christ is not completely original; there are, however, other reasons for Lewis to choose this animal to represent Jesus. For instance, perhaps he assumed that children might better sympathize with the death of an animal than the death of a historical figure. Lewis uses a similar technique in using "Deep Magic" to explain the miraculous events that take place, like the resurrection: "'It is more magic.' They looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again), stood Aslan himself." (Lewis, 1986, p.147) The young audience for whom the Narnia Chronicles were mainly intended would have an easier time understanding the concept of magic, rather than the theological implications that arise in the Bible stories of the resurrection. Finally, Lewis uses children as the main characters of the Narnia Chronicles. Immediately this establishes a connection for young readers that the Bible rarely offers. Children are also more likely to relate to a Messiah figure that constantly treats children with respect and love; a figure like Aslan.

**** I would suggest you forego any literature written after the seventeenth century, meaning you keep only religious text in their reading list. You can find satanism and non-family friendly rhetoric in every novel, if you set your mind to it. Reading books with diverse ideas would not make you follow any of those things, it will broaden your mind. Instilling Christian believes and morale in your kids is your job, not literature's. You can let them read classics, as they were written by their authors and keep them obedient, nice and God fearing. You can explain the difference between fiction and reality, there is no need to bastardize classics like Narnia in order to keep your kids sheltered by what you view as evil and wrong. You are just setting yourself up for conflicts.

**** C. S. Lewis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia, was an incredibly devout Christian who wrote many books based on his faith.

Even as a young reader, it was the parallels between Narnia and the Christian faith were pretty obvious to me. I interpreted that Aslan was Jesus, but taking on the form of a lion for that particular world.

No one had to tell me this. I didn't have the internet to look it up. It was just that obvious that the lion was Jesus.

I'm sure you're enjoying writing your fanfic, but I feel very sorry for your sheltered kids that you even deny them actual Christian based fantasy, with very Christian themes.

Why don't you read The Magicians Nephew, the first book is the series, and then decide? You obviously know nothing about it.

** I am wondering, OP, about your decision your children will not be reading about witchcraft. I take it you mean in any form, not just as regards the Harry Potter books, correct? However, considering witchcraft is not real, and through reading these books no-one will ever learn how to BE a witch or wizard, what is the harm? I never understood the stance against the HP (and similar) books when it's not as if spells and charms actually work in real life. It's a bit like prayer: you might try it, and use any excuse available if what you want to happen doesn't happen, but at the end of the day prayer is simply to give people comfort. It doesn't cause things to actually occur. Dabbling in charms and spells are the same...they don't do anything.

** I have a few concerns about some of the lessons in the first chapters of your story so far.

Why do you mention sex and the city in a children's story?

Also, you imply that someone with a southern accent is someone to trust. Shouldn't your children learn to trust people based on their actions, not based on their accent?

I'm addition, defining Christians as people who want to be good implies that non Christian don't want to be good. This is incorrect and may be confusing to them. Lots of people of many beliefs want to be good. Many religions teach about being "good." Being good is not what defines a Christian, even though there are surely Christians who want to do good, there are non Christians who want to do good.

I don't understand why your story teaches that women should not have careers. Perhaps you should read about Deborah, who was a judge and military leader in Israel. There is a book in the Bible called "Judges" and you can read about her there.

** Why would you do this?!...Here link to a book you should read: [[http://atheism.about.com/od/bookreviews/fr/GodHarryPotter.htm][Finding God in Harry Potter]] Personally I'm a Deist and don't belive in all this bullshit, but it's your opinion, so JUST LET YOUR KIDS READ THE FUCKING BOOKS BECAUSE THEY ARE FICTIONAL!

** I know I'm late to this party, but I wanted to say this is /brilliant/. I thought it walked the line perfectly, had to get a few chapters in before I could tell or not. (And I'm still not completely certain. Agnosticism!)

Kudos!

** This comment is one of my nicer ones. The second link is only for the author. It is the story editing place. The first link is good. The second is not. I suggest you delete the second link.

**** You're welcome. I do actually hope you are not a troll. Other than the Christianity bull and anti-evolution stuff, you seem to actually care for your children.

Um. I don't believe in your false god. I may be a deist and believe in something starting our universes motion, but I do not believe that there is god so don't tell me I'm aiding the work of the lord, that is just fucking ridiculous.

Edit: I'm sorry if it offends you that I'm swearing. It's just something I do.
