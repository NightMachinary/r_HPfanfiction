** First off, it is victim blaming. You said you're not justifying the “mistreatment” (attempted genocide) of Purebloods to Muggleborns, but you are, even calling the Muggleborns “abusers” at one point. There is not always a reason for hate to exist- throughout history, people oppress other groups because they are /different/. The whole pureblood/Muggleborn thing is supposed to be a metaphor for the Jews, who didn't have a “reason” for their oppression beyond untrue stereotypes and propaganda. But you want opinions on the validity of the idea (I assume you mean how it fits with canon?) so here goes:

1) Only about 500 people over 3 centuries were executed for being witches in the UK . The majority of those would have been Muggles- old grannies, women who lived alone, etc.

2) “demanded as to why they don't take down the non-magical so they don't have to hide” - so Muggleborns first advocated for Muggle genocide? Those same Muggleborns who love their Muggle family so much they'd leave the wizarding world?

3) The Malfoys can't produce more than one heir because of inbreeding. The Blacks went mad because they married their cousins or siblings.

4) “I despised how they would judge their tradition and culture.” What traditions? What culture? Canonically, wizarding “culture” is very similar to Muggle culture, with the exception of robes which no muggleborns minded.

5) The slur. If their problem really was with the fact that they were /birthed/ by Muggles, then Muggle/born/ would be the slur. But it's Mudblood instead. Dirty blood. Direct parallels to racism. There isn't a logical connection between your history and the slur of Mudblood.

** There is a very fundamental problem with this, and I think the books have it too, is that witch burnings/trials were very much not a common thing before the 14th century. People weren't prosecuted for witchcraft back then, but because they were Jewish, Muslim or because the Christian order you belonged to had some beef with the king. Magic wasn't a crime, worshipping idols or non-Christian figures was (among other things). The /Malleus Maliferacum/ was only published in 1487, so about five centuries after the founding of Hogwarts.

But, then again, Rowling believed plumbing didn't exist until the 18th century, for some reason.

*** Ooooo thanks for letting me know! I'll try to go over this and make corrections.

Also a mistake I made in this post is the timeline, your comment having reminded me of it, so I will correct that as well.

For now I will specify it to you. The Black Death occurred during the 14th century, and the witch hunts would still fall within the time though still not at its peak, so while I will have to make some changes as to what happened before the burnings/witch hunts and such, this should be somewhat consistent. I will still very much revise it later. The other part is that I forgot that Hogwarts was built during the 10th century, so the part about the Chamber of Secrets will also have to be slightly tweaked. I already have an idea for this scenario though, so it is also fine.

Plumbing existed since a /long/ time ago, so I won't worry very much about it and just correct it in my fic lmao

Thank you so very much for the information and help! I will start the improvements soon enough, so I'm glad I have any to make in the first place before it was too late. ^{^}

** I actually really like this as the history for why there's such a rift. I've seen similar ideas and I think it's really plausible
