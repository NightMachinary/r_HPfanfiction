:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for the fic mentioned above. The girl is sorted into Gryffindor and the guy is sorted into Huffelpuff. The girl has absconding wizarding father but cool stepdad,muggle mom and wizard brother. And the potter child is arrogant as fck. It was nice wizarding world fic. I was waiting for the next chapter as the author left it at a nice place but I forgot the name of the fic! Anyone know the name of this fic ?

  In my quest to conquer all possible Harry/Draco cliches, I present my Rentboy!Draco fic. *evil smirk* Harry is an Auror and Draco is a Rentboy. This is not a typical rentboy story.

  Amidst a struggling Muggle economy, two children are delivered questionable letters by a woman with a pointy hat and broomstick. Could there really be an entire Magical world, just out of sight, offering a chance at another life? Or do the same mechanisms that steer the Muggle world remain, regardless of wherever you go?
