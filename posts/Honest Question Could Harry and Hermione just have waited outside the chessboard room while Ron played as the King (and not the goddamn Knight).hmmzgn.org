I get that our three Gryffindors wouldn't have thought of doing the first thing (being Gryffindors), but it seems like such an easy loophole that Slytherins would think about but don't in every story where a bunch of Slytherins go with Harry and co under the trapdoor. Also seems like a good strategy for when you're more than two people trying to cross the gauntlet.
