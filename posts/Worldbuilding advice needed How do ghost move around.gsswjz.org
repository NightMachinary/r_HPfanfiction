Do ghost have a top speed/max altitude that they can float at, or could they fly anywhere they want nearly instantly? If flight speed is limited, what'd happen to a ghost in a fast moving vehicle like a plane, would they fall through the wall out of it or would they stay inside? How would this compare to Voldemort's smoke spirit form?


** Ghosts are made of mind, not matter, so I think it would be a question of whether or not the ghost understands the concepts of airplanes. A ghost who died without an understanding of airplanes might be left behind by one, but a ghost who understood airplanes when alive would be able to fly in one after death.

** I think that max speed depends on state of mind of a particular ghost. They decide - consciously or unconsciously - how fast they go (we need to establish what is a ghost, a spirit or a impression of one? Soul or an echo? Yr choice, it may impact their ability of learning). The ghost don't move by walking on anything, rather they reorient themselves in space. As we don't know about ghost that can apparate we can assume they either didn't possess that ability in life or don't believe they can apparate without actual body (there is also the question if they are bound to a place but it seems to be more emotional tie than anything; Helen seemed to wake up in nowhere Albania and decided to travel back to Hogwarts to brood). Their preferred form of transportation seems to be leisure floating, but we've seen them raiding horses in Headless Hunt - either those horses decided to not pass on (better quality of ghost fodder here? Who knows), were stopped from passing on on purpose or (!) they are imagined by the riders themselves. Ghosts could catch a taxi or fly a plane if the concept didn't befuddle them completely. Time is also subjective to them, as compared to our livespans they don't have to rush anywhere. Hope it gave you so ideas, that question was pleasure to answer.

Edit: haha sorry as to your question about Voldemort, he is described as 'bodiless spirit' so I would assume the same rulas as with ghosts applies. Maybe he is even more restricted as parts of his soul are squirreled in various places in Britain and moving away from them may be difficult or uncomfortable. He is described as 'fleeing' not disappearing at will so it seems he had to actually move through the distance while escaping. We also know he came to Britain after meeting Quirrel so maybe having wizard as some sort of anchor helped him move around, or maybe he was just so bad at geography that coming back was hard otherwise (he later used Quirrels body as a mode of transportation, via flesh-not spirit-possession of some kind, that is one interesting idea to dig into. He depended on it for strength while ghost remain unaffected by time and don't seem to fade at all. His soul was pretty damaged by then so yeah... Horkruxes are not optimal for survival of yr eternal soul)

** I love these questions.

I'm no scientist, but if I were writing this, I'd say something along the lines of ghosts being made of photons. Photons got that wave-particle duality going on, which in my mind, sufficiently explains why you can see through ghosts, but also why they can do things like phase through walls, etc.

So if that's the case, then photons travel at the speed of light in a vacuum---and even withstanding that, visible light travels faster than any man-made means of transportation. Accordingly, I don't think there's any practical limit for ghosts in that sense.

The smoke-flight thing is totally different though, in my mind. Ghosts are mass-less, but people in smoke form are definitely not. Case and point: ghosts phase through things, but Voldemort in smoke form does damage to the castle.

Thus, I think there'd be limits on travel in smoke form. If I really wanted to take a guess about that, I'd probably consider the maximum force a human body can withstand. Knowing that force=mass x acceleration, I'd rearrange the equation to force/mass=acceleration. Then I'd do fake math to figure out the mass of a human body in smoke form, and divide maximum survivable force / mass = maximum limit of acceleration in smoke form.

(Of course, acceleration is not the same as speed, but by the time you've done that much fantasy math, I'm pretty sure the specifics become irrelevant.)

*** I don't mean the movie smoke thing, I meant the spirit form he is after Quirrel dies
