Hey guys. So I've come with a summary for a fic and I want to know, as fanfiction readers, would y'all be intrigued by a story with this summary.

"Follow Harry Potter in a magical alternate universe, detailing his pursuit for esoteric magic, his quest to become the best, and featuring a trans-continental struggle that will shape the wizarding world. Starring Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore, and Nicholas Flamel consolidating power, manipulating wizards everywhere, and showing the world that magic is might."

So, do y'all want to see this written? If so, I already have drafts of the first two chapters in the DLP WbA and am working on the third right now. Will probably post the first three chapters after they are edited before this Sunday if I see that people are interested.
