** It makes me imagine a flood of frat boy harry potters, keeping the party going dimension to dimension.

They have killing voldemort down to such a rhythm that it's just another party prep thing. #405 grab the kegs. #271 kill voldy's spirit. #100 I am feeling greek theme! Get togas!

Just as a dimension gets fully fed up with the frat boys who lived another dimension calls and their party moves on.

** I can see it like this, a crossover of different fandom archetypes, one group breaking down gringotts, while the Indy!'s take care of LV with their infinite power, the crackish archetypes buying out Weasilys Wizarding Wheezes, stocking up on alcohol, while the bureaucratic types (Ex: inspector no. 13) start setting up scams, the time traveler start betting on quidditch matches, the dark archetypes raiding nocturn, kidnapping skeeter, torturing umbridge, fudging fudge. The brainiacs raiding nocturn, Hogwarts library, flourish and botts, etc. Mod!'s raiding the MOM, stealing from the ubspeakables, etc.

They do end up killing LV, but frankly, leaving such a trail of destruction and chaos in their wake that, it really wasn't worth it in the mind of the wizarding world. But... hey, it wasn't all bad, they threw one awesome party before they left.

** The One Who Lived: Into the Chosen-Verse. You have Collin(?) who for some reason has a prophecy now(???), Neville, three Harry's (one of them is depressed, one is from pre-Grindelwald's war, and one is a lion??? Like a cartoon lion. Is that allowed???) and a Luna Lovegood from a magitech future. Nobody's quite sure what's going on.

** They are all dressed in old-fashioned american suits and have transfigured their wands to look like tommy guns. The lead Harry, who is the only one with a very twirly moustache, walks up to Dumbledore and says

"Ay, me and me boys ova there... we herd you were 'avin' a bit of a problem. We could solve that for ya. For a price, of course."

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know.\\
  Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group... WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
