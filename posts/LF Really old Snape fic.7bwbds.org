Hi all. I'm hoping someone remembers this fic I read a really long time ago (around 10 years ago) and also hoping that it still exists somewhere. It was a trilogy. In it, Snape and Malfoy turn against Voldemort. One thing they do is have Malfoy rape Narcissa while polyjuiced as James, so that she is no longer a virgin to prevent Voldemort from using her in a ritual before her and Malfoy's wedding. Also, the two of them make up the whole boy who lived thing. And, Hermione is Bellatrix's daughter, hidden away in the Muggle world. When I read it, book 3 was incomplete.


** I hope you find it, I want to read it!
