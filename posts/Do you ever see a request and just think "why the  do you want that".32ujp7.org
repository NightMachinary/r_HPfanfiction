**** I enjoy both, but the ones I read don't try to pair them up as they are in canon. They're mostly set post-Hogwarts. The characters have grown up a bit, they've been through a war and either gotten past teenage rivalries or manage to do so over the course of the story. In particular it's interesting to read about how Draco's experience in the war may have changed him for the better.

*** I do agree for the most part. I can't see canon Voldemort being at all sexual, but while he's not attractive his younger version canonically is. (Seriously, reread HBP and see how often it's mentioned during the memory scenes that Riddle is handsome.) I've seen people saying that the dude who played him in Chamber of Secrets movie is attractive as well, so I can see why they would do it. Attractive people always get sexualised, no matter the evilness of their character.

Edit: Also, its fanfiction I don't see why people need to shit on any concept as well as its decently written. Just don't read it if you don't personally like the idea. I understand not liking something cause its actual shit but if you start complaining about straying away from the character and how "it doesn't make sense" well then no fan fiction makes sense and the only one allowed to write Harry Potter is J.K Rowling. And she can't change anything.

I can certainly agree on this, but with a qualification. I don't think it's possible to dislike something without knowing a bit about it. For this and every other controversial but popular published work I like to make sure I've read at least 100 pages to form my own opinion. I try to extend the same courtesy to fanfiction.

Loads and loads and /loads/ have things have already been done /so many times/ that sometimes 'normal' gets boring. Also, sometimes you've just read everything else you'd consider reading usually and want something different.
