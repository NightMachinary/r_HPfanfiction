anything hermione, smutty, and well written

no ron or snape in the main pairing?

I've read glitterally's The Bespoke Witch, and MaryRoyales Ark Domus Nigrae fairly recently but can't seem to find much on par with either of them since

(also haven't had to properly search for good fiction in a while too I suppose_


** Have you read Fatum Stringis on AO3?
