This essay is quite long so I'm posting it in multiple parts, please bear with me. Also, these are just my interpretations of events as portrayed in the books. They are just my opinions, I respect the fact that many absolutely adore Dumbledore. Also, I only classify the seven books as canon, nothing else.

​

Part 2

I think it's unlikely that Dumbledore was ignorant of the switch in secret keepers. I think he was probably the one who performed the Fidelis charm. Because I don't think he intended to protect James and Lily at all. Why do I think this? Because in Snape's memories that he gives to Harry, it shows Snape going to Dumbledore and begging him to protect Lily. Dumbledore doesn't act surprised at hearing Voldemort is after the Potters. Nor does he act in any way concerned for them. What does he do? He starts negotiating with Snape. He asks Snape /“what will you give me in return?”/ Now think of that for just a moment, when told that an evil wizard is going to hunt down and kill two of his former students, his comrades-in-arms, members of his very own group dedicated to bringing down Voldemort, Dumbledore's reaction is to negotiate something in return for protecting the Potters. In essence, he is telling Severus he's not going to lift one damn finger to protect his own people unless Severus gives him something in return. I can't begin to describe how reprehensible this is. It shows Dumbledore to be the monster that he is. He has to be bribed to do something he should have been doing already. When Harry saw that memory he should have said screw this. To my mind, this strongly suggests that the whole thing could have been a setup and Dumbledore intended for them to die.

​

I think Dumbledore probably talked the Potters into leaving James' ancestral home, probably citing that the home was well known. I think it's likely that he hid the Potters in his own family's former home. He would have wanted to leave as little as possible to chance. The whole thing was too convenient, there were far, far too many coincidences, it was a perfect storm.

​

The Potters had been hiding for a whole year, which means that they were probably hiding somewhere that was very secure. It's likely that place was the Potter ancestral home. Somehow Dumbledore talks them into going to hide in a cottage in Godric's Hollow. He also talks them into the dubious security of the Fidelius charm. I think Dumbledore was probably the one that told them that someone other than themselves should to be the secret keeper. It makes absolutely no sense to not have been their own secret keeper. We know that the secret keeper can live in the protected property because Ron tells Harry and Hermione that his Aunt Muriel's home and Shell Cottage are under the Fidelius and that Arthur and Bill are the secret keepers. So the only reason for having someone else to be secret-keeper is if someone wanted that information leaked to Voldemort. Who would want that? Someone who wanted the prophecy to be put into play. Then barely a week after the Potters go under the Fidelius charm they are attacked.

​

So what is Dumbledore's motive? He wants to defeat Voldemort in a way that does not compromise information that Dumbledore doesn't want to be exposed. He knows Voldemort is winning and it's only a matter of time before the Ministry falls. He is desperate, he has to do something so that Voldemort will activate the prophecy. So he talks the Potters into going under the Fidelius at his old house. I think he also suggested using Pettigrew to either the Potters or Sirius or both. He needs that info to get to Voldemort, he can't use Snape so he uses Pettigrew. You can't tell me a Master Legillimens didn't know who the mole was.

​

I think Dumbledore was there that night, watching. I think it likely that he was the first person on the scene. I think as soon as Voldemort vanished Dumbledore went to immediately examine the scene. He probably did some heavy diagnostics over Voldemort's robe and wand and Harry. I think he knew from the first that Harry's scar had a piece of Voldemort's soul. I think he could have dealt with it then but chose not to because he wanted to see what use he could make of that later. I think he knew all along that Voldemort had used Horcruxes and that he also knew Tom made more than one. I think he had been collecting those memories about Tom for a very long time.

​

Further questions:

1. Why did Dumbledore go to such great lengths to hide vital information from everyone who might have been able to help bring down Voldemort?

2. Why would he place the full responsibility for finding and destroying the Horcruxes on three young people when he had a number of people he could have safely informed and who could have helped?

​

Dumbledore's actions do not make any sense unless he was hiding something. Specifically, if he was hiding evidence of his own wrongdoing, something that if known would absolutely destroy his reputation. I think he relied on naïve young people because someone with more experience might have caught an inkling of what he was doing. Especially someone like Amelia Bones or the Unspeakables.

​

What I think what Dumbledore could have been hiding is that he had been using Hogwarts as a social experiment. I think he was trying to prove to himself that a Dark Wizard could be redeemed. I think part of it might have been that he wanted to prove that he could redeem Gellert Grindlewald. Why else would he leave Grindlewald alive? But mostly I think he wanted to prove that he could redeem himself. I think in his mind he may have felt that he and Grindlewald could rule the world together. Because when you look at his actions it is clear he never changed his views that muggles were inferior beings and needed to be subjugated under wizard rule. The only difference between Grindelwald and Dumbledore is that Dumbledore felt that he could be a benevolent overlord.

​

In order to prove his theories of redemption Dumbledore had to have someone to redeem. I think he saw the perfect opportunity when he went to visit a young Tom Riddle. His actions with not only Tom but the Matron make absolutely no sense otherwise. In Half-Blood Prince it says that

​

/“Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman.”/

​

So Dumbledore hits her with an obvious confundus charm, then proceeds to get her drunk. Things change slightly when Mrs. Cole expresses her misgivings about the boy. Prior to this point, I think he was expecting that Tom was a typical wizard child who had the normal accidental magic outbursts and it had confused and frightened the muggles he lived with. But the moment Mrs. Cole tells him some of the things Tom had done his attitude changes.

​

/“..You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore./

/“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it's very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents... Nasty things...”/

​

Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. Harry, as portrayed in the books, is not a hyper-observant kid, contrary to what his upbringing would have certainly engendered in him. I think the interest shown by Dumbledore would have had to have been quite pronounced for Harry, as portrayed in the book to have picked up on. I can see Dumbledore looking like a kid at Christmas. I also think that the memory that Dumbledore showed Harry had been sanitized somewhat. Because the description of the orphanage does not match what was typical for the place and time. He could not risk the possibility that Harry might begin to empathize with Tom Riddle any more than he already did. Dumbledore had even asked Harry.

​

/...“Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?”/

​

Harry, so eager to not disappoint his mentor very quickly quashes that empathy and answers no. I think looking around at the place and seeing how miserable it was and hearing Mrs. Cole's description of the boy, Dumbledore made up his mind right then that this child would be a perfect subject for his experiment. His actions make no sense otherwise. He terrorizes a very troubled child, he gives Tom even less information than Harry got when introduced to the magical world, and THAT is saying something.

​

Tom Riddle was an experiment for Dumbledore and he created Voldemort, but ultimately it was an experiment that got out of hand and got away from him. I think that was what he was trying to hide, that he was the cause of the two Voldemort wars. I think he was genuinely trying to stop the wars but only on his terms and by using the exact same means whereby he had created Voldemort in the first place. He tried this experiment three times, he tried it with Tom, he tried it with Severus Snape and he tried it with Harry. Of those, only his experiment with Severus had marginal success, but it showed how flawed the theory actually was. He had partially redeemed a dark wizard, yes but the result was a deeply troubled individual. He tried again with Harry but ultimately that experiment was a failure because Harry did not turn “dark”, to be later redeemed by Dumbledore. I think the argument could be made that Dumbledore was either intentionally trying to turn Harry dark, or he spent sixty years in a school and learned absolutely nothing about human nature, or else he is either ridiculously naïve or a functional idiot.

​

However, his experiment succeeded in one way in that at least Harry did bring down Voldemort in a way that did not expose Dumbledore's culpability in creating the mess in the first place. Of course, by that time Dumbledore knew his experiments were unmitigated failures and everything was then focused on damage control. End the war and not only preserve but increase his legacy. It's the same thing that cult leaders do when they know the whole thing is about to implode, they want to ensure they will be remembered. Dumbledore wanted to prove that tainted means could produce a pure result, which for all his vaunted wisdom was monumentally ignorant.


** This is AWFULLY thin. It might have made a half-decent premise for a fanfic (though I doubt the fanfic would have been very good), but as an argument for canon motivations it doesn't hold up. You basicallty just jump to a whole lot of ridiculous conclusions and present no real arguments for them other than some of the most bad-faith interpretations I've seen in literary analysis.

This is taking the foregone conclusion "Dumbledore is a bad person," and then interpreting all his scenes as if it was a given he's a bad person, and THEN using your interpretations as "evidence" that he is a bad person. There's very little in any of this that's supported by any version of canon, and your arguments make very little sense.

Not convinced.

*** well, technically he created the 'trained version of voldemort', if dumbledore knew that tom was a manipulative bully, why didn't he think of him becoming evil? But then, if he would have lwft tom in the orphanage, he would have bwcome some kind of chaotic evil because he would have never learned to control the magic. Both options where a bad thing tho so Dumbledore really didn't have a choice, so he theoretically unpurposely created Voldemort...

** This . . . is one of the worst character review I have ever seen. If you wanted to imitate a joke article as if it was writen by Rita Skeeter (since she wrote "/The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore/" which is a little similar to your title), then congrulation, it's something she could have wrote. If you are serious about this analyse . . . then I have nothing good to say to you.

** This contains a lot of 'probably' and 'I think', which means it can be defeated by anyone else saying the same things.

I think that if Dumbledore actually believed in the Greater Good, he would have murdered Harry when he was 15 months old. I think he was worried someone else might do that to a 17 year old Harry, and that's why he didnt tell anyone else about his plan.
