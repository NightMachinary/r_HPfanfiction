I'm looking for dystopian futures. Maybe Voldemort won, maybe the muggles found out about wizards and tried to raze them, maybe a disease decimated the population, maybe zombies. Whatever works.

My only requirement is that the fic be either completed or recent enough that it has a good update schedule and doesn't look like it mught end up abandoned.


** Incorruptible: a Dementor's Stigma. Two words: zombie apocalypse

Reign of the Serpent: Salazar won and took over Britain

Sole Survivor by Voice of the Nephilim has Harry being the only wizard to survive the apocalypse.

The Skitterleap has Grindelwald winning the big duel, so the war never really ended as he claimed more and more territory.

** There is a sad lack of true grimdark HP fanfiction.

** The Resistance of Azkaban by Shezza is the best of these. The remnants of the Order of the Phoenix are holed up on the island of Azkaban, using it to strike at Voldemort controlled Britain.

Imprisoned Realm by LoveHP fits and is complete. The characterization of Dumbledore is spot on, I can totally see him doing whatever needs to be done. Very solid read.

Antimagic by Myricle has the SoS broken, with Hogwarts as the last place of safety as the muggles discover them. Abandoned

A Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpant-socerer might fit, I can't remember it exactly. Complete.
