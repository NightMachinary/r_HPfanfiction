** Isn't "magic muggle" a contradiction?

Regardless of that I will still give it a read later.

**** I've read through the three parts that have been posted so far. I don't think yours is a premise that I've seen before.

******* Too soon to say. I've gone plans for it, some clear and some still just vague ideas in the back of my mind. I'll probably finish the first year, and then go back through and improve it, expand some sections, etc. After that? We'll see.

**** I know you can't change it now, but I'll take this opportunity to remind people if you tag your post like this -- [promo] -- then the flair will be automatically applied.
