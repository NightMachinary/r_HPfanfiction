Here is what I mean when I say decent:

. Not Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione/Vldemorts' pet snake's second cousin. Just Fleur or Gabrielle (it does not matter if ages have been fiddled with).

. The fic does not just follow the line of 'Soul bond....blablabla....Harry, have sex with me now or else I will die/go mad.... bla bla..... Fun times 'oh Harry that was fantastic for absolutely no reason. I came over 9000 times.'

. Harry is not an overpowered, cocky little shit.

. The female is not a stupid bimbo.

. Anything else that sounds moronic and like an extract from a bad romcom.

Having said this, these things are ok: soul bonds (so long as they are done well. I can't remember what story it was but the one where Gabrielle becomes an angel does the whole 'bond' thing acceptably well.) Sex is fine too, graphic or otherwise. Marriage contracts. Etc.

Some things can be forgiven if the rest of the story is good.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.


** Authors take note, there's such demand for these fics that writing anything half-decent will get you lots of readers.

** linkffn(Euphoria) is propably the best Harry/Fleur fic that is focused on the romance. Albeit the start of the story feels a bit too close to canon, the grade of divergence increases with the time and the romance between the two is simply beliveable, something most Harry/Fleur fics are missing.

linkffn(Wastelands of time) is an extremly well written AU wich has a Harry/Fleur pairing, which however is never the focus, not even in the sequel heartlands where the pairing becomes a bit more important.

Than there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][jeconais Hope]] which is decent if one does not have a problem with overly fluffy stories.

That pretty much where the really good ones. Else I can "recommend" linkffn(The British Reformation) is not completly terrible, but the moral choice done in this fic are hilariously retarded. linkffn(What You Leave Behind) does not feature H/F yet, but has promised to to so in the future - if the fic will ever continue, that is.

*** The premise when I wrote Euphoria was that I just wanted a story that simply /worked/. No gimmicks. No changing ages, no soul bonds, no meeting each other years before hand, no parents being secretly friends from childhood, none of the crutches that authors think are required to make it work. I think it turned out ok.

***** It is an interesting thing to think about. I guess some people really, really think it's impossible for a 14 year old and 17 year old to have a relationship (it's rare, but not unheard of). Or, perhaps they've simply been conditioned to believe that the story /must/ have a gimmick, since there's a hundreds fics that all do that sort of thing. It's kind of amazing when I think about it, because I couldn't find a single other fic with the pairing that has Harry just being Harry and Fleur just being Fleur.

That is the worst thing I guess, as it makes you wonder wether truely no one (except you it seems) is content or can even imagien a normal realtionship even if the two people are special (beyond the normal "you are special") in their own.

It is actually really suprising that I can't think of another fic without something gimmicky, the closesed one is propably Letters, which of course is no testament to the quality of this fic. I can only explain for myself by saying that the truely good stories changed something not to make the pairing work but to alter the story as a whole (like wastelands of time).

** Harry/Fleur except for the last one.

linkffn(Harry Brown by mjimeyg) Crossover with Mrs. Brown's Boys. No knowledge of it was necessary for me.

linkffn(The Debt by mjimeyg) Bonding happens and sex happens, but it's not focused on that.

linkffn(Harry Potter and a Flower by potterheadcharles) My favorite characterization of Fleur to date.

linkffn(In Spite of Obstinate Men by Quatermass) Can't remember how much romance was in this, but the sequel focuses more on it.

linkffn(Allure Immune Harry by Racke) I liked the writing style of this.

linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7) I don't remember a thing about it, but everyone says it's good.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][(How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me by ffpseudu)]] Deleted from FFN for smuttyness (I assume).

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Veela Sisters by dirtyuncle) It wasn't clear if you excluded Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle, so have some smut.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Two suggestions which haven't come up so far:

linkffn(7402590) "Depraved" is a rather good H/F. In fact, I believe it is one of the archetypal "Harry as Fleur's bodyguard" stories, and the only one which I think pulls it off, because of the way Harry's character has been constructed. It's a powerful!dark!Harry who has ran away from his family and twin brother, so there's Potters-bashing, but, somewhat surprisingly, no Dumbledore-bashing. Note that this is very different from usual twins-who-lived fics, which I normally hate, so don't knock it even if you hate the sub-genre. The only downside? It's unfinished and has been for a few years---unless anyone knows of a complete version existing beyond FFN.

linkffn(9458931) "The New Dark Lord" is HP/GD and somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me, as it's rather mediocre quality-wise. In fact, it's full of cliches (betrayed-Azkaban escapee-Harry; quick training period with ridiculously powerful dark wizard; magically overpowered to the point where Harry can easily Fiendfyre the whole of Diagon Alley... need I go on?). The only reason I overlook the many flaws of this fic is that I like the relationship so much, I'll read it even if it's not written that well (yes, fellow Harry/Delacour shippers, I too suffer from the dearth of good fics). Also, it contains one of the more creative takes on how to make an unbeatable horcrux.
