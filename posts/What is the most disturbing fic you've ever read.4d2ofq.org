I was just reading some fic that was quite horrible and I haven't even able to finish it (I made to 90% or so) and I really want to read some nice fluff, so I just want to know what fics to avoid and why.

Also if you recommend me some fluffy goodness I won't complain because I honestly feel filthy.

The fic I mentioned is linkao3(whore).


** linkffn(Catechism) - starts off with a rape scene that I wasn't expecting as I started reading it on a work computer.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** Whenever I need to clean my mind after a particularly nasty fic, I go to these short stories to refresh myself:

linkffn(The Lion's Pride) - oneshot of the meeting between Scrimgeour and Harry

linkffn(Welcome to Hufflepuff!) - the initial house meeting after being sorted into Hufflepuff, very well-written.

linkffn(Chocolate Frog Cards) - although a war is happening, it's a nice aside on Dumbledore's thoughts
