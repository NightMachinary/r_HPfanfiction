** After reading the first chapter, I'd recommend getting a beta. I've noticed a lot of small errors, generally in punctuation and capitalization. Individually they aren't that bad, but all together they add up.

For example, let's take the very 1st sentence of the fic, which appears like this:

#+begin_quote
  It was the 13th of the 7th at precisely 12.15 am,

  Lily potter smiled exhausted having given birth just 15 minutes ago.
#+end_quote

I saw a few issues immediately upon reading it.

1. It was the 13th what of the 7th what? (I assume it's the 13th day of the 7th month.)
2. There's no need to separate the initial part of the sentence from the rest of the 1st paragraph, although perhaps that was a stylistic choice on your part. I would also remove the comma after 'am' and replace it with 'and' unless you meant to make that first line its own sentence/paragraph, in which case replace the comma with a period.
3. 12:15 not 12.15
4. 'potter' should be capitalized
5. There should be commas around 'exhausted'

This is what I would expect to see:

/It was the 13th day of the 7th month at precisely 12:15 am and Lily Potter smiled, exhausted, having given birth just 15 minutes ago./

Keep in mind that this was the first sentence of the fic and I immediately saw 5 errors. Most readers will see that and immediately think about spending their time reading something else. That doesn't bode well for them continuing on to rest of the fic. The chapter continues with other small errors, but again, they all add up. I assume you proofread the chapter and thought it was fine. It'd be better for you and readers if you had a second pair of eyes to make sure you don't make those kinds of errors.

Your story has potential to be good, but too many readers will see all those simple mistakes in punctuation and drop your fic. But don't get discouraged, nobody's gets it perfect on their first go around. Keep up the writing, just get somebody else to help read and correct your errors. Best of luck with your writing! :)

Don't worry about the small things, just find a beta who will worry about them for you, lol.

**** My word of advice to make an honest effort to try and notice those things. And stop thinking of them as small...they are an important part that can detract from the story you want to share.

Betas are great but the sooner you get in the habit of picking up and fixing your own typos and grammar issues the better your writing will become.

** I won't read something unless it averages around 5000 words a chapter (or more). If you feel like you have something to say it should be longer then 2000 words, is that even a short story?

*** the chapters will get longer as i go along however then i will be working around the general books and although things will not be the same as canon there are set events that will still occur also as soon as Hogwarts starts chapters will be more focused on classes then canon was if you don't want to read it its fine with me

***** That's just not true. I know that a lot of people like longer fics, but it really doesn't matter if a fic with a 100k words is split into 50 chapters or 20.
