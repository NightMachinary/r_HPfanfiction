or everyone's too scared to say the dark lord's name so none of the little muggle raised or muggleborn students actually know you know who's name so when Harrys like Voldemort and I don't get why you guys are so scared of some name their just like where not scared of some name the problem is no one will tell us the name harry just stares flabbergasted


** Yeah, even as a kid when I was reading the book, I always found it irritating that Hermione flinched when she heard Voldemort and couldn't say the name at the start. Doesn't make any sense for a muggleborn who didn't grow up around magic or during the war to be /that/ afraid.

*** Agreed and when Harry feels compelled to start DA because she says it for once. I did always chalk it up in HC to Hermione preparing so much for Hogwarts and reading so much about magical history she kinda “bought in” more to the whole culture of it

*** I don't know, if you found out dragons, giants, and dementors were real, and adults were completely blasé about them, but too scared to say a name, that would make it pretty scary for an 11yo. I don't remember when she started being scared of it though, so maybe not. It could have started as the kind of reaction a well-behaved child will have if she hears a friend cursing and is afraid a grown up might hear.

Obviously we don't have any back story to support either of those, I'm just postulating reasons an 11yo might start flinching at a word even without growing up around it.

*** Unless... the name itself is cursed to be feared. We know that spells can be placed on names (Taboo) and immaterial concepts such as knowledge (Fidelius) and jobs (DADA curse).

This is honestly one my favorite aspects of HP magic and it was devilishly clever of JKR to think of that.

** It's not just them. It's one of the inconsistencies of the series that nobody talks about: if nobody (except Dumbledore) has said his name for over 10 years, why do all the first-years know what it is, enough to freak out when somebody says it? Theoretically, they've never heard the actual name.

Not to mention that Dumbledore, who (1) knows about the taboo and (2) believes Voldie is coming back, ENCOURAGES muggle-borns to say the name. Is he TRYING to get them killed?

*** The adults don't like saying it, but they will if necessary. Hagrid explained it to Harry iirc.

It's like explaining a slur or curseword or racism or something. Distasteful, but necessary.

Also there being a taboo in the first war is fandom. And Dumbledore encouraged everyone to say it, but the fear was more entrenched in wizard culture.

I'm pretty sure that the name, "Voldemort" was only placed under the Taboo once he took over the Ministry in Deathly Hallows. It certainly didn't seem to do anything before that.

**** I thought it was canon that the Taboo existed in the first war, and that once he died he had to cast it again... but I just looked it up and it's never stated one way or the other whether it existed in the first war.

***** Correct - canonically, it is never said whether or not the name was taboo in the first war. In universe, it absolutely makes sense that that's why the fear of speaking the name is so widespread - say Voldemort and he shows up and murders everyone around? People would stop saying it /real fast/.

Unfortunately, due to JKRs tendency to introduce magic without thinking of how that magic would influence her preexisting canon, it makes things weird. If there was a Taboo, Dumbledore wouldn't go around telling /children/ to say a name that would get them killed.

** Ah... Yes, a part of me thinks this

You know when you-know-who is doing you-know-what in you-know-where with you-know-which, it resulted in 'that' happening due to you-know-how. So it all resulted in He-who-must-not-be-named going to a location-that-shouldnt-be-disclosed and ended up doing stuff-that-shouldnt-be-spoken.

Anyway, I think it'll be funny if Harry refers to Voldemort as "Redacted" since he shouldn't be named thus is Redacted.
