You've likely seen one of these stories in which everybody has to either align with VD \ Dumbledore or try to stay out of their way; and then Harry comes and offers them a third choice.

Well, the story I'm thinking of is meant as a portrayal of the currently happening clashes between ideologies, in US and worldwide. Those include conservatism, liberalism, fascism, anti-fascism, political (in-)correctness, nationalism, (in-)intolerance, racism, sexism, etc.

The idea is that both marginal groups (DEs and the Phoenix) do not want to compromise on anything, see anyone disagreeing with their stance too much as enemies, as immoral individuals, etc. No meaningful dialogue is taking place between these two large groups of population, while many more-neutral wizards and witches are just tired of both groups and their antics.

So in comes Harry, who has been pretty much living under a rock till his eleventh birthday, and who doesn't care much about any of all these ideological stances that so many wizards and witches seem to care very deeply about. When these groups try approaching him and proselytizing, he's rather confused with all the inconsistencies and faulty reasoning in their speech, points them out and asks for clarifications which are not happening; and so on.

The story could develop in several ways. Harry could eventually become the third force, the voice of reason, so to speak, that's ready to negotiate with all parties and criticise all parties and also has the capability to back it all up. This would make many of them to eventually congregate around him and develop a new and more stable status quo.

If Harry's a dimension traveller --- or just knows enough powerful magic to create a self-sufficient isolated environment for himself and his allies --- he could also just remove himself from the equation of Magical Britain, and let them stew in themselves until they either kill each other off or come to some sort of an understanding.

Caveats of such a story: it would be easy to slip up and make Harry into author's mouthpiece, portray him with a MoR-like arrogant personality or as a conceited faux-cynical teenager, make him biased towards one group or another, or mess up the story entirely if the author is not knowledgeable enough (in political science, for instance).


** Yes, this isn't going to devolve into political bickering at /all/.

Protip: One side believes Muggles are less than human and that Muggleborns are unworthy of magic. The other side does not. If you follow canon at all in your story, there are very clearly defined good guys and bad guys.

*** He secretly let a werewolf student attend Hogwarts despite the fact that werewolf stigma was so extreme that he was risking his position as Headmaster if people found out he wasn't doing anything about a 'dangerous' creature putting students at risk (a la Chamber of Secrets). Also he runs his own anti-fascism secret revolutionary group when he thinks it's necessary.

** I feel like Dumbledore is more a representative of tradition: he has a deeper appreciation than Voldemort does for what might be considered the more spiritual and esoteric side of magic.

Voldemort on the other hand seems to represent modernism. He has a much more mechanistic approach to magic, seeking to control everything and continually dismissing magic he considers too vague or sentimental.

Harry would then be the post-modernist.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** There hasn't been such thing as a "Radical liberal" since Napoleon.

Neoliberalism is a center-right ideology. Conservatives and Liberals are both just branches of neoliberalism... you have a book full of centered ideologies.

Well, if neither of the parties is trying to change the global political map into something that's not currently even /on/ it; and both “radical” groups wish to enforce their “corner” of it using extreme measures, wouldn't that make what you've described as neoliberalism as the whole political compass, and them into its radical corners? A frame-of-reference sorta thing, if you used their “current” standing of events rather than the historical development that lead to the point they were at.

Perhaps I should've avoided using loaded terms to prevent derailing the intended discussion.
