i just think it's an interesting idea


** It does sound interesting, but it also takes quiet a lot to pull this off. Harry and Colin in the same dorm is an interesting concept, but quiet soon would become annoying if Colin doesn't stop with being a fanboy. Also a good question is who would become the “golden trio”. I only know 3 named person from the 92 year, Colin, Ginny, ulna. I can see Colin blindly following Harry and then they eventually become a duo, but Ginny has a crush on the BWL, and we know she wouldn't talk to Harry. You can obviously go with the “troll route” just replace it with the basilisk... As for Luna, if you want to get together the misfits, that could work, but if Hermione was the know it all teachers pet, and only a troll could bring them together, Luna would be the weird and crazy girl. Or maybe an OC. Tbh, this could all work with proper writing, so i would be all in to read it.

  Somehow, young Harry Potter got enrolled into Hogwarts a whole year earlier than expected. And this small alteration changes the fate of the whole Wizarding world... ••• AU story and, eventually, M-rated ••• Minor bashing of various characters is possible.

*** I like the idea, so far I have read up to his sorting. I might have to drop it if they don't stop with "The green eyed wizard" every few paragraphs.

**** One instance of "green-eyed Potter" and two of "green-eyed boy" on the first chapter alone. I see what you mean, that kind of writing can really spoil a good fic.

I'll try it though, I've read worse stuff.

** Not being in the same year, we could do away with some of the "if I perform better than than Dudley, the Dursleys will beat me up" trope. Maybe Harry will even get some friends in preschool and elementary. Dudley would go to Smeltings and Harry would have one year all alone with Petunia and Vernon... No idea how this will go but interesting to explore.

The Dursleys are definitely neurotic enough to compare marks across years.
