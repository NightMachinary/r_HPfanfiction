The years immediately before Voldemort's downfall seem rife for interesting stories but the category is surprisingly barren in fanfiction. So in an effort to write what I want to read, I've spent about six months working on a *canon compliant* First War fic from the POV of each Marauder.

What of this era would you like to see explored? What's overdone? What tropes to avoid?


** There should be far more hesitance from James and Sirius towards Remus than Peter. In fact, they should trust Peter implicitly.

Sirius should probably be more concerned about Andromeda than his brother. She rarely comes up in Marauder era fics.

Molly and Arthur weren't part of the order then. Neither was McGonagall.

** Frank and Alice Longbottoms should be much older than the Marauders. They could be even out of Hogwarts when Marauders first entered.

*** I have in my mind that, among the Order, only Marlene McKinnon is their contemporary (and she is largely only involved because of older relatives). I see MWPP and Lily as anomalies and, to some degree, a little annoying to the older members who have been around the block and don't appreciate any recklesness or naivety. Least of all Frank and Alice, accomplished Aurors.

*** Definitely, I have always imagined them to be in their early 30s at the end of the war.

** The Aurors and the Order should be willing to cast Lethal spells over stunning and disarming spells. Most fics make them look incompetent by labeling any dark wizard/witch as someone willing to kill. The good guys then get stuck with the goal of arresting these people and giving them trial. But, it's a war (at the very least, a rebellion). The only crime they should be tried for is treason (which is immediately equivalent to a penalty of death in Pre-statute Era and in most countries today).

I prefer to see dark magicals as individuals or groups willing to push the boundary of magic. Dark wizards/witches should be those willing to Sacrifice/split their souls for immortality, brew potions using human hearts or whatever, create wards requiring a human sacrifice, or create wands with human heartstrings. So, one can say that a wizard/witch does not have to be dark to join Voldemort. I believe there would be more intrigue and philosophical clash in this way. And, Voldemort would be a more complex character than in Canon.

** ðŸ˜³ are you reading my mind??? /I/ am sort of writing a canon-compliant First War fic! Mine is more like trying to work out Lily, Snape and the Marauders' time at Hogwarts including all seven years and the rise of Voldemort and how it affected all of them in school.

I say "sort of" writing in that I've been plotting it for years but have very little written.

The Marauder Era is my jam, tho, so I'm very interested in seeing your take on it!
