You know, a Harry who isn't too open, he likes sudying, works for a lot of his power. Is more reasonable. He is very curious/ likes adventring/experimenting. Has some OCs.

If anything, just find something like "House of Potter rebuilt"


** ehhh... there is linkffn(2740505)

It's super interesting, complete overhaul AU, sadly abandoned for years, but still very enjoyable.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.
