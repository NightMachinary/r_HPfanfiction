So after 9 years it's save to say that Miranda Flairgold abandoned the series.

What bothers me the most is that we never got to know what Harry's "final transformation" was. Apparently, according to the A/N, there were enough information that we could guess what that form would be.

Does anyone have a good guess as to what it could be?\\
The only thing I could think of is something that is connected to death. But no idea what.


** His final transformation was, as best I have been able to figure out, a Quetzalcoatl. I saw a thread on DLP a while back saying that anyways.

** I loved this series. I keep hoping that she'll pick it up again and finish it. Or at least give us an outline. Personally I always thought Harry would be a Death Dragon. After all his transformation is supposed to be something that will enrage the elves and I just don't think a Quetzalcoatl would do it.

** The books in the series:\\
linkffn(2488754)\\
linkffn(3078469)\\
linkffn(5318075)

Well worth a read. Very OC.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** I did enjoy the series, but I don't think of it as a Harry Potter fanfiction. Harry Potter as Rahkesh feels more like an OC to me and the world depicted takes some elements from JKR's books but its mostly original.

This is not a criticism, but if you decide to read this series (which is very good), don't expect an HP fanfic because you're reading a Rahkesh fic.

*** Still felt like a HP FF to me. I'm much more liberal though in what I consider HP FF. A lot of OC but it still played in the HP world
