So, the premise parts from the assumption that Andromeda knew that Remus had tried to abandon her daughter or blames him for Tonk's death in the BoH, basically she hates him for some reason.

Andromeda becomes Teddy's primary caretaker after the war, but her hatred for Remus transfer partially to Teddy and it makes it so either she voluntarily gives custody to Harry for either her or Teddy's sake or she tries to keep custody but starts becoming neglectful/abusive (not something crazy, just, like forgetting to fed him frequently, or screaming at him or getting drunk and forgetting him at his crib for a day -maybe hitting him with a silencing charm-, something dire enough to justify taking him from her custody, but nothing of the absolutely monstrous and frankly unsurvivable things we generally see the Dursley's doing with Harry so frequently in fanfics). Harry sees it, relates with his own childhood and decides to take custody.

Preferentially it shouldn't be smooth sailing from there, this is a 17 years old war hero who just died and came back to life after finally removing the bit of soul his enemy had stuck in him and that was influencing him.

He probably wouldn't be able to conciliate taking care of a toddler with working full-time as an auror, and while the wealth his family accumulated plus any war-compensation/prize could excuse it I personally would like to see him having to figure a way of securing a regular income working from home to spend more time with Teddy (enchanting maybe? Like, making pensives and stuff and then selling).

Plus taking proper care of toddlers and small children /is/ highly time consuming and stressful, Harry can probably get around some of it with Kretcher's help, maybe also the Weasley's, but he would still need to invest a great deal of time in it, which would potentially weight in his own personal relationship (I can't see Ginny for example being willing to set aside her own goals to take care of Teddy with Harry and frankly I can't see either Harry asking it of her or her resenting Harry to take on this responsibility given the circumstances).

Plus, there is the issue of if Teddy would be able to interact at all with the muggle world, since he is a metamorph and thus liable to break the Statute of Secret. While the actual ramifications of it would depend on the author schooling for example could range from being barely an inconvenient to outright impossible.

Probably many more things I didn't even consider would also have an effect.


** I like the concept, but I would assume Andromeda wanted out because her heart is broken for her husband and daughter who died almost back to back, and Teddy morphing would remind her of â€˜Dora.

*** Plus her age, not sure what is her cannon age, but if she is old enough to not be able to take care of Teddy properly it could also lead to this path.

**** I don't thin her age would be a factor. If Dumbledore can deal with three full time jobs plus a school full of hundreds of students then Andromeda should be able to deal with one. Even a hyperactive child wouldn't be a problem, plus she's like late forties early 50s at best. I think. Don't quote me on that.

***** She should be around early forties.

â€‹

She got pregnant before marrying Ted and they got married pretty much out of Hogwarts. Depending on whether Ted is older or younger than Andromeda she would be upwards to seventeen by the time she is pregnant. Tonks is 6-7 years older than Harry so she would be around 40-43 by the time DH is done.

**** She is born between 1951 and 55, making her 42-47, and therefore perfectly capable of taking care of a child, hell, she could probably still even have one herself.

I hate the "frail grandmother Andromeda" trope with a burning passion.

** Since I am presumably responsible for this prompt [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j0fcaa/teddy_lupin/g6uoqo4/][based on this thread]], I would like to clarify that, at least in my opinion, Andromeda would not be unable to look at Teddy or unable to raise him, but would detest his last name and either outright adopt him and rename him Tonks or ask Harry for some shenanigans with the Black family name.
