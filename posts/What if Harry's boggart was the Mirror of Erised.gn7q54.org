** "May I try, Professor?" Harry asked, as Professor Lupin was about to end the class. He probably feared that Harry's boggart would take the form of Voldemort and thus, didn't allow him, but Harry wasn't so sure.

Professor Lupin seemed to be debating with himself before he sighed and beckoned Harry forward.

Harry walked towards the boggart, his heart thudding against his chest. He mentally steeled himself to be prepared to face a dementor, because that was what he assumed would be his deepest fear. Boy, was he wrong!

The boggart seemed to twist and fold into itself before taking the form of something Harry had seen only two years ago.

Before him stood the Mirror of Erised, exactly as he remembered it. Each and every detail was present, including the etching across the top. Harry was confused at first - why would something that had shown him his family be his deepest fear? Then when he noticed the images in the mirror, everything fell into place.

The image in the mirror was of Harry and his parents, but this time they were not looking at him with their eyes filled with love and adoration like they had before. Instead, the look they wore on their faces was the same as those of his relatives whenever they looked at him. Their faces were contorted in disgust, and they seemed to be staying as far away from image-Harry as possible.

"Did you, even for a second, believe that we actually loved you?" Image-James spat.

"You, who lived when we didn't get to live and enjoy our life!" Image-Lily shouted

"You are nothing but a worthless freak who should have died!" Image-James was absolutely furious now.

Harry vaguely noticed that tears were flowing down his cheeks. He wanted to get away from the room, run and hide and retreat to his cupboard, which had been his only haven during the 10 years of abuse from the Dursley's. But he couldn't move a muscle. He was frozen to the spot, and he could hear Malfoy snickering in the distance, but he didn't care. All he cared about was that hia parents had never loved him, and they blamed him for his death.

Suddenly, he was pushed aside by Professor Lupin. The boggart changed into a white orb, but Harry didn't notice. He ran out of the classroom, his tears dropping on the stone floor of the corridors of Hogwarts. He vaguely heard Daphne - his friend from since they had both been sorted into Slytherin, and had both grown up in abusive environments - call to him, but he paid her no heed. He ran, and ran, and ran until he was too tired. He found himself on top of the Astronomy tower, and he moved to the edge.

'Just one step more, Harry, and you will know no pain' he told himself.

*** I would like a fanfic where Harry took that step and everyone understood that he is broken. A broken man who cannot bring peace to this world.

Harry goes back to Muggle world and tries to cope up with depression like his great ancestor, a potter. He gives all his money to OOP and finds his inner peace in supporting them. Voldemort returns somehow (not by TWT) years later but let this pathetic Harry live as a symbol of despair.

Dumbledore leads a hunt for horcrux and destroys all of them except Harry. At last he comes back to find him and ask him this one thing to end everything. Harry learns about the prophecy and him being a horcrux, knowing the prophecy asks for him to die by Voldemort's hand.

To fulfil his destiny and end this war, he faces Voldemort at last. He fight this abomination, the dark lord, without any hope but finds out the man is pathetic at what he does. Blabbers around but is too weak to touch even his shadow. He defeats him at duels again and again in front of his followers. After few dozen fights, Harry let go of his wand to let it end for good with the killing curse hitting him and killing the horcrux. His sacrifice weakens Tom and his magic.

The death eaters lose their faith. Dumbledore arrives with the OOP and ends the last remaining soul of Tom, now considerably weaker and ends the war. Harry is buried next to his parents while everyone knows the man sacrificed himself for them. A sage/hermit, broken man sacrificed himself for greater good.

P.S: I think there are greater prospects for a complete story and this script also needs revisions. But a sage Harry detached from everyone, learning ancient arts by submerging himself in nature, finding his own soul, his magic and the power the dark lord knows not will do a better job than a teenager.
