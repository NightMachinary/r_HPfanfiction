Completely appropriate and not at all disturbing question here:

Hypothetically, if two animagi (animaguses?) of the same species--- say, two cat anamagi--- had sex while in animagus form, and one got pregnant, would the baby be born as the animagus form (a cat), a human, or a human with the innate ability of an animagus (like, they don't need training)? I suppose the most realistic option is that the moment they transform back they miscarry (or, really, the pregnancy just doesn't occur), but I'd like to hear some thoughts on the subject.

  If two werewolves mate at the full moon, in their animal forms, something very strange happens.[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf#cite_note-PM-3][[3]]] The result of their mating, which has only ever occurred twice throughout history, has been a pack of wolf cubs --- actual [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wolf][wolf]] cubs --- who grow to become very beautiful wolves and can only be distinguished from true wolves by their near-human intelligence.[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf#cite_note-PM-3][[3]]]

it works with werewolves so I would assume its possible for Animagus's to do so as well.

perhaps something similar happens, and you end up with very intelligent offspring of the same species as the Animagus

**** Just me being an palaeontology nerd, but dire wolves, /Canis dirus/ evolved in North America approximately 125 000 years ago, and modern humans reached the Americas approximately 16 500 years ago. /C. dirus/ was pretty much the size of a large grey wolf, /C. lupus/, but with the strongest jaws in genus /Canis/, presumably for hunting megafauna like ground sloths, mammoths, or mastodon.

The description of wolves born to werewolves seems to fit better with descriptions of the wolf who fed Romulus and Remus or the wolves who raised Mowgli.

*** That's a good point! Yeah, for worldbuilding it's much better just to say they're sterile... but it's so much more interesting if they're not, haha. Personally, I like to think the bird would be a bird (as in, not an animagus) but with a human mind, if the egg was fertile and not abandoned.

EDIT: I realize a bird with a human mind is NOT a good thing and would most definitely be a torturous existence, so yeah, sterility is good.

****** And now I'm imagining a horror story where it turns out that the real reason for the animagus registry is so the ministry can track down and capture anyone with a "desirable" animagus form to force them to breed familiars.

McGonagall is still free because she was either a willing participant or bartered for her freedom, but either way, she was placed at Hogwarts to encourage more students to become animagi.

And Trevor keeps trying to escape because he wants to set his parents free, or something.

Anyway, thanks for ruining my morning.

** It depends on the mother. Does her magic recognize the fertilized egg as part of her body, something to shift along with her, or as a separate entity hitching a ride?

IRL pregnancy, the actual implantation of the embryo, doesn't happen for a few days. So, we've got conception: sperm combines with ovum, resulting in a free floating zygote. The little pre-embryo saunters down to the uterus and about day 5 it connects and makes an umbilical cord. At that point, it becomes an embryo and the mother becomes pregnant. Before now, the mother's body had nothing to do with its passenger.

In an Animagus, that uterus is gonna change. So the little cat pre-embryo is gonna try to connect to a human uterus.

I suppose it's possible, with magic, to say that a shapeshifter's uterus might recognize the cat as the same species and adjust to match. The umbilical cord could be human at one end and cat at the other. Equally possible, the pre-embryo might recognize a human uterus and use magic to shift itself into human form. Or you could say that when the mother shifted form, the "magic field" shifted everything within her even if it wasn't part of her.

But my guess is, the uterus is gonna ignore it. Completely wrong species, bub, nothing to see here. The Animagus would have a period like normal, flushing the cat conceptus out along with it, and would never notice anything different.

** I don't remember the fic but I read a theory that if a female animagi gets pregnant in either form then they need to stay in that form to carry the baby to term otherwise the pregnancy is terminated so if they conceive while human the child is human and reverse is true as well For males all that results is the animal baby is the equivalent to a kneazle or a post owl; intelligent and maybe magical

** InwardTranscience tends to include wilderfolk, animals descended from animagi who got frisky or trapped themselves as an animal. They can transform into human form and have expanded lifespan and intellect, but still very much have the mentality of the animal. A cat wilderfolk, for instance, isn't a half-human, half-cat, but rather a very smart cat with opposable thumbs when they want them.
