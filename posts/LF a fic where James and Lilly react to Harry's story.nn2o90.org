  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"

** The Face Death In the Hope series by Lullaby Knell. It's quite sad and heavy and unfinished but a really lovely story. Harry talking to Lily and James is my favourite.

Imma link two here. the first is the story and the second is a few chapters just from Lilys pov. Lily's pov would spoil the main story but I don't know if you want to read the whole thing...

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
