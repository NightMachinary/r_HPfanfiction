Hi, I'm looking for more stories like this one. Just post war stories removed from the world of Hogwarts with character development. Any pairing/rating welcome. Cheers.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.

** The first thing that comes to mind is linkao3(The New Skin by Mottsnave) and its sequels. Noir-ish, with wild worldbuilding, great OCs, and unique but still in character narration of Snape dealing with his trauma very ineptly.

** On Topic: That's a weird fic? Does it only exist in audiobook form? I'm way too impatient for that.

*** No sorry I'm just a fool who used the wrong link. It's a really good fic actually, I like the whole learning to reconstruct a life aspect of it.
