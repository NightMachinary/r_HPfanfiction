This Quote:

“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.” “Only because you're too --- well --- noble to use them.”

I want to see a Dumbledore who loses the nobility at some point and takes off the kiddy Gloves and Starts Flexing his Magical Might for the Magical world.

We Are told that Dumbledore is our Main Deterrent, 'The Man Who Bitch-Slapped Grindelwald' way back when, Chief Warlock, Apprentice to and Colleague of Nicholas Flamel, internationally renowned and feared, Our Heaviest Hitter all around baddest MoFo ALBY D.

Yet the only Fight we see him in, is by all accounts, a little underwhelming.

Dumbledore is out of his prime, no real battle time in over a decade that we've heard of, and has turned into an educator and politician.

Tom Just got his Body back a year ago after a Decade of being Spirit, barely surviving, who has spent his time in hiding, Crucio'ing his followers and trying to consolidate his political power and military backing.

If such a thing Exists, I would love to see these 2 Titans battling all out. I'm talking 'the Maps need to be updated afterwards' kind of battle.

TOMMY R. Vs. ALBY D. in an all out magical brawl.


** linkffn(The One He Feared) This is almost exactly what you're asking for. However I disagree with the spirit of this post. Canon Dumbledore is incredibly bad ass.

#+begin_quote
  But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry.

  ‘What -?' cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, ‘Dumbledore!'

  Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates.

  Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.

  ‘It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,' said Dumbledore calmly. ‘The Aurors are on their way -‘

  ‘By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!' spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame.

  Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.

  ‘You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?' called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. ‘Above such brutality, are you?'

  ‘We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,' Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. ‘Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit -‘

  ‘There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!' snarled Voldemort.

  ‘You are quite wrong,' said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

This type of comment always reminds me of HBP Chapter 26:

#+begin_quote
  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.
#+end_quote

Harry Potter is not Dragonball Z, and thank god. There is a refreshing lack of preoccupation with size/scale/flashiness in the way the magic system works. Some of the most powerful spells maybe be visually subtle (Dumbledore's powerful spell in OotP) or even lack any kind of appearance at all (Fidelius, anyone?). And laying waste to a huge area around you is tactically pointless in the HP system, unless you happen to be facing a large number of opponents who lack the ability to raise a magical defence (like inferi).

For example: what's the point in burning down 5 blocks when you're just trying to kill one person? The only fire your opponent has to defend themselves from is the fire in their immediate vicinity. Wanting to see "big" spells comes off as a somewhat juvenile obsession with dick-measuring contests.

I'll take the cleverness of the OotP duel over big explosions any day of the week.

*** To be clear, I'm not looking for the type of battle where a single bombarda spell is cast, and a city block is gone.

The OotP battle has about 3 spells per opponent, one of which is just them pointing their wands at each other, and what looks like a ghostbusters energy beam shoots out. Next up we have Tommy conjure up a Fiendfire Basilisk, and Alby D. Takes it out and pulls a leaf from Zabuza and traps him in a water bubble, and then has to blast Harry back bc he's being a dumbass and trying to get close to their throw down, allowing Tommy to get free and shatter all the glass in the area, and do a controlled summoning which directs it all at Alby D. and Harry. This is swiftly countered with a dissolving charm and the battle ends.

If it hadn't been for Harry's punk as for getting in the way, we would have gotten to see some more flashy transfigurations, magical constructs conjured and sicced on their opponents, or possibly some ancient BS spells that do stupid amounts of damage to the surrounding environment when deflected.

My main complaint to the series is that we almost get a large battle but something happens, the battle takes place off screen, or its just lasers shooting at each other, which has some excitement, but lacks the spectacle I was hoping for in the scene.

My best comparison is the Star Wars movies, and no I'm not going for a cross over here. In the first 3 episodes, we are treated to a delight of light saber battles between masters of their craft, 2 combatants guided by the force, things are going so fast it can be hard to keep up who did what. Bodies are moving all around the room, jumping, flipping, etc. And of course the ever pleasant sounds of light sabers moving and clashing.

But in the latest episodes, it's kids basically using light sabers as bats to beat on each other, and hoping the other side falls down.

It's dissapointing because you know what level the previous ones were at, and you were at least hoping for something similar. Not 2 people hitting each other with bats.

I enjoyed the dueling scene between Draco and Harry in the 2nd book more than other battles, why? Because we had spells being cast out loud so we knew the effect of what was being cast, instead of silent stunners or silent curses being thrown around.

--------------

McGonagall huffed in irritation. The headmaster was having another one of his "episodes", and now he had disappeared. Again. She shifted into cat form and hurried off to try to catch his scent.

In the dungeons, an old gray donkey trotted down the hall near the Slytherin dormitory. A school bag hung around his neck. A line of half eaten parchments littered the ground behind him. He nudged a door open with his nose and happily disappeared into the empty room. Two floors away, a cat's nose twitched.

McGonagall ran as fast as her four legs could carry her. There was no telling what the headmaster was planning, but she knew it wasn't good. She paused as she spotted the remains of a Transfiguration essay, due tomorrow, with the name Malfoy scrawled across the top. She smirked at that as she imagined the blonde boy whinging "the headmaster ate my homework".

Inside a dreary office filled with boiling cauldrons and jars of plants and animal parts, a donkey was was standing on a desk near the back of the room. A nameplate reading S. Snape had been knocked slightly askew and the donkey squatted over the desk chair.

A now human McGonagall approached the door to the potions master's office. She pushed it open and was greeted by an awful stench. The scene before her was truly disturbing. She sighed and wondered, not for the first time, if Beauxbatons was hiring. Steeling herself, she walked into the office, avoiding the small messes littering the room. She conjured a newspaper as she went. As she reached the animal, she drew back the newspaper, smacked it on the nose and in a firm voice said, "No! Bad Ass-Dumbledore!"

*** I know I'm stepping into the firing squad for a fictional character, but the Dumbledore of canon absolutely doesn't need to redeem himself. It's easy to forget his real character after reading a shit tonne of fanfiction picking apart and twisting his actions out-of-context.

**** Yeah, the books are called the Harry Potter series, not the Dumbledore and the other adults save the day in chapter 2 and then everyone drinks tea for the rest of the book series. No shit Dumbledore isn't the one solving all the main conflicts in the book.

** The Power of Paranoia features a Dumbledore who takes the fight to the Death Eaters, but it's not his choice. He had to be blackmailed into doing it.
