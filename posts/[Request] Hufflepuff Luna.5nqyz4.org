  "We had a very nice conversation about which house I should go to, of course," Luna replied. "The Hat said that my best quality was my intelligence---" That was a little surprising to Hermione given how...non-standard the girl's intelligence was. "---However, it was strongly of the opinion that Hufflepuff would be better for me than Ravenclaw."

In this fic she went to Ravenclaw, but now I want to see a Badger Pride Luna!

Imagine if she had 'Puff loyalty around her, perhaps she would still have not developed close friends but she may have avoided in-House bullying.


** Or the bullying might have been even worse because she's unable to conform.

*** With Nymphadora Tonks in Hufflepuff, I don't think conformity is part of their House.

**** Nymphadora is able to conform to anything. And should she find herself unable for once she can still hide behind another one's face.

***** Tonks was most likely a social butterfly in school, if what we know of her is any indication. Luna...well, she was rather antisocial.

** Weasley Girl's sequel has Hufflepuff Luna! She was doing mostly well there IIRC. linkffn(8202739), linkffn(9932798)

I don't really remember if she had much screentime though...

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

*** She is in Hufflepuff in that story! She's not a main character, but she does show up every few chapters to be adorably spacey and/or deliver plot-relevant clues. While the other Hufflepuffs don't figure too much in the story, Luna doesn't appear to be as much of a loner in that house as she was in Ravenclaw.
