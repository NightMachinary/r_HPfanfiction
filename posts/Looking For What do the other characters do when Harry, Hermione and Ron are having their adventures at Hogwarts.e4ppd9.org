I thought it'd be a interesting idea to see what the other characters in Hogwarts would do, while Harry, Hermione and Ron are in their adventures at Hogwarts

In first year, in second, in third, et cetra. It could be characters like Fred, George, Percy, Ginny, it can be characters like Neville, Seamus, Dean. It can be characters like Luna, Cho, Cedric, Colin. (It can be outside the ones I mentioned)

It can be the teachers, Ghosts or anywhere in between.

It can be oneshots focused on different characters each chapter, or a full story focused on different characters or one character outside of Harry, Hermione or Ron, or whatever you can think of.

** I recently read a fic where James and Lily were brought back to life in 4th Year. After meeting, an awkward James asked, "So... how's school?" Harry responded, "Weird." James completely understood. I imagine Harry and CO certainly aren't the only ones having adventures at the ancient magic castles with ghosts and monsters. Harry just gets all the press.

#+begin_quote
  For the first time in seven years, Cedric Diggory won't be on the start-of-term Express to Hogwarts. Instead, his friends return to school for their final and most stressful year, still trying to adjust to the loss of their best mate amidst rapidly-escalating tensions in the classrooms and the corridors. Together, they must negotiate Quidditch, life, love, and learning, all while the Ministry of Magic is more intent on disrupting their education than dealing with the looming threat of the most feared dark wizard of the age - and that's without the small matter of the end-of-year exams that will affect the rest of their lives.A story about keeping on, about keeping it together. A story about keeping up.

** Gets rec'd here semi-often so you may have already seen it: it's an SI and therefore alternate timeline (she's changed a couple things already), but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]) is really good about having little slice-of-life moments involving the other kids. The spacebattles thread also has some adorable [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/16/reader/][omakes and side stories]], such as a Ravenclaw first-year desperately trying to introduce the wizarding world to D&D.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.
