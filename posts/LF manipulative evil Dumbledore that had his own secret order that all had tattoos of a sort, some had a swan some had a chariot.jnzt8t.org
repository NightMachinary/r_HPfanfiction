:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I can remember about this fic is that Madam Pomphrey kept getting obliviated as to Harry's healing results and that Ron Ginny and Hermione all had these tattoos but were the lowest rank. Dumbledore had his secret army/order and everyone in it had said tattoos. Elphias Doge was heavily involved in Dumbledores side of operations.


** Argh i have read this one but the name doesn't come to mind! I know that the main bad guy helping Dumbles was related to Umbridge, though had a different last name. The tattoo was connected through family magic, which he lost when a bunch of his other family members who hated him ousted him as lord of the family. The tattoo was symbolism for some goddess of revenge. I know the guy helping Dumbles hid as an unspeakable until he got outed. He was under glamour in his unspeakable guise, so he disappeared and tried to re-enter the ministry to be hired as a hit wizard, but was caught due to family members outing his true appearance. There were some attempts to get both him and Dumbles out of ministry jail, but Harry's team was prepared and stopped those.

Hope this helps you find it!

*** Pretty sure that Umbridge and Selwyn were connected through cousins or something and it took a while to figure out that connection and the tattoo was related to Nemesis - Greek goddess of revenge but I still can't find it! Nice to know I'm not the only one that knows of it tho ðŸ˜…
