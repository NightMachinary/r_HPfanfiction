:END:
Tom riddle and bellatrix are raising Hermione and harry and maybe draco I cant recall when they adopt Ginny. This makes Hermione upset and believe she is being replaced as her father does not accept and praise her bookworm nature and instead makes her feel inadequate and as though she should have tea and play with dolls to make her mother bellatrix happy. This is furthered when the boys are taken out without her and harry? I believe gives her a doll which ends up being a woman trapped who takes Hermione and says if they cant accept her she will come with her.

Can someone please help me find this fanfiction as it has been driving me crazy??

Thank you
