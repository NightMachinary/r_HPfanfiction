I'm interested in fics where Harry is perminantly damaged by his aunt and uncle before Hogwarts! Blindness, disfigured, dismembered, needs a cane, the whole shebang!

Even better if Dumbledore, as Harry's Magical Guardian, is punished in some way by the ministry!

Any and all ships welcome!


** I've always thought a Harry that comes to Hogwarts unable to speak would be interesting. Either because of Dursleys abuse, or my latest idea is that Lily cast a silencio to keep him quiet before Voldemort attacked, and because of Voldemort's backfiring killing curse, it becomes permanent.

*** The silent world of Cassandra Evans has a mute fem!Harry. It's crack, but very entertaining after a rather grim first few chapters (Cassandra kills the troll and that scares Hermione shitless) it becomes an OP Harry done right (not much cringe, just a Harry who loves mayhem and chaos). The muteness is Dursely abuse though.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** Dumbledore Bashing can be executed correctly, especially since canon leaves too many unanswered questions on how he handles many things, like sending Tom back to the Orphanage despite it being obvious he's never wanted there, same with Snape really.

Most people don't present the bashing in an understandable way, making people hate the tag when there's one or two good portrayals I've stumbled across!

When blown off the Atlas airship, Neopolitan was saved by a power from the world she came from. For Neo is actually Rose Potter...and she has been entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
