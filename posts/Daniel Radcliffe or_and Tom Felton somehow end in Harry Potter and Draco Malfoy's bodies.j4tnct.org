A fic like that exist? I'm really curious. And can you imagine Daniel in Dracos' body or Tom in Harry's? Will Tom get Draco sorted in Gryffindor if he is in his body? They are actors so maybe they could imitate them well enough?

(Sorry for my syntaxis, I'm not an english native speaker)

It's a two-way swap, with Harry having to blend in as an actor while the actor pretends to be a wizard. I didn't enjoy it at all, but maybe you will

  An attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is just a story. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP. Harry still has magic.

** Maybe it is just me, but personally do not like using real people and their names in fanfiction like this. Unless you get explicit approval from them ...
