** This is ringing a bell (but unfortunately not bringing up a title). The students had to Polyjuice as the Carrows because some Death Eaters (and possible the Dark Lord) were coming for an inspection and they needed to hide what they'd done. All of the students were in on it, and they pulled a major dog-and-pony show that totally fooled the inspectors. They had a discussion as to who would be the best impersonators. As I recall, Snape was with the Dark Lord when he announced the inspection, but he was able to get a message back and wasn't sure if they'd pull it off or if he was about to be found out and crucio'd to death.
