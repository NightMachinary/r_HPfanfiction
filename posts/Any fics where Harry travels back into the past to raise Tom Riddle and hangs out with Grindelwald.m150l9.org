I've been reading some of the fics like Two for One on Ao3 and Triple Trouble. I like the combination when all three of them hang out together, be it in Hogwarts or anywhere else.


** Just reccd this in another thread.

Linkao3(crawlersout) Grindelwald discovers that fem!Harry is the master of death. He works on solving the mystery.

** This fic meets 2 of 3 of your requirements. Harry travels back in time with plans to kill a young Voldemort, but raises him instead. The part that doesn't fit your request is that HP defeats Grindelwald before Dumbledore acts. This fic also has a pairing with Daphne Greengrass. linkffn(12233209)

*** Ok. I don't usually bother too much about fanfiction ideas but now I'm really curious. What the fuck is Daphne doing in Voldemort's time?

**** Ha! Great question. She traveled back with Harry. Thankfully, the backstory is explained fairly quickly in the first scene in about 300 words. In summary, it's 2007 and the war has basically been won by Voldemort (I would have loved to have more backstory about this part). Traveling back is a last ditch effort by Harry and Daphne to change things.
