It makes me so sad when really good works are just left alone. Does anyone know why some of these were abandoned?

** I hate this. I'm not an author, but I imagine if I had a really long and popular story and for whatever reason couldn't finish it, I would at least tell my readers. That said, I never truly give up hope that the authors will get back to the story eventually. The perfect example is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]], which is an incredibly popular fanfic that I discovered last year. At that time, it said that the story had not been updated since 2008 or 2009, so I had assumed it was abandoned for good. Then, at the end of last year, the author updated out of nowhere! It was pretty awesome.

*** I liked that one enough that I occasionally checked the author's website. So if you dug into it, it was clear that it wasn't abandoned, although I was also caught by surprise at the update (just a couple days before it updated, I was predicting "before 2013").

** Being an author, I hate this...about myself. I've only gone months, not years, between updates but I know how annoying it is and I hate myself for not updating more often.

But life gets in the way, you can get burnt out, you can just lose the thread of where you were going and sometimes it takes a while before you have an "ah ha!" moment and suddenly put out 2 or 3 more chapters, or even finish the story.

These are the things you have to put up with reading WIP fics, think of it as the season being over for a show. I do agree though, that having no communication from the author sucks, it leaves it in limbo.

** There's a thread on darklordpotter.net about Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. Apparently the author has said that he plans to update it at some point, but he's really busy (although he said that quite a while ago...). His DLP profile shows that his latest activity is four months ago. Also, the thread where he posts updates to the story goes up to chapter 16, instead of the chapter 11 that is on fanfiction.net

** I wrote something once upon a time. I eventually stopped having time to write, and when I regained time, I reread what i wrote (and had posted)... It was AWFUL. I mean seriously, the kind of thing people point to when arguing how bad fanfics are. But even so, I /still/ got multiple requests to continue...

** For the first, you'll be happy to know that the story extends to Chapter 16 in its beta form on darklordpotter.net. You need to register in order to access the Work by Author section, but I'd say it's worth it.

On the downside, even the commentary thread has been locked and marked Abandoned, if only to prevent more people posting 'When will this be updated?' If that's all you want to do on the forum, I'd advise you to refrain from posting beyond the requirements of registration. (Hogwarts motto applies)

** Happened to me once in particular with a story I really loved. I had at the time presumed it was finished as the story line ended at the beginning of the story line for the books (lily getting pregnant). That it had deliberately finished the alternate history leaving the reader to speculate at the possible outcome. Then about four /years/ later the author started updating again. Initially I was delighted. But I had reread the story so often and day dreamed what the new time line might be like that the first 50 or so chapters were ruined by the author grasping at straws trying to change characters too much and what not. I just had to stop reading.

--------------

some stories should stay dead.

There are two I've always wished I knew the ending of that were abandoned years ago.

It's sad.

I know one author who half way through updating started talking about their cancer treatments. Fought on updating slower and slower and then just stopped. that's from about five years ago. Never finished the story.

When I've read several stories from a fan fiction writer and then hit that one abandoned, unfinished one I always worry about them. You grow strangely attached through their works.

It's a mystery. I always hope their lives have gotten /so/ fantastic that there is no more time to slave away obsessing over writing stories on the internet any more. My more morose side fears the worst however.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1657629/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Time]]

This was one of my favorite fanfictions for years. I've given up on it, it seems the author is a full time writer and has other things going on in life.

** That's so sad . . . I can still feel the disappointment from ten years ago when I reached a final posted chapter and found out the story was not and would not be finished . . .
