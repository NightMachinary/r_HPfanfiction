** As Snape opened the envelope a booming and thunderous voice escaped.

*"PROFESSOR SNAPE, WOULD YOU BE SO KIND TO HAND THIS LETTER TO MY DAUGHTER?"*

The pleasantness of the voice stood in stark contrast to its loudness.

Fred guffawed and elbowing his twin brother whispered, "Seems like Mum outwitted our dear sister by not sending the howler to her directly, eh?"

George snickered in response.

After Snape made his way to the Gryffindor table and handed the letter to a blushing Ginny Weasley it continued.

*"GINEVRA MOLLY WEASLEY. HOW DARE YOU CAUSE SUCH A SCENE IN POTIONS CLASS AND EMBARRASS ME AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY? CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SHAME YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH HAVING OUR DAUGHTER BE THE TALK OF THE SCHOOL? PROFESSOR SNAPE IS ONE OF THE MOST GIFTED AND WIDELY RESPECTED POTION BREWERS IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU -- REFUSING TO BEHAVE IN HIS CLASSROOM?!*

Ron Weasley cringed and the Weasley twins had somewhat sympathetic expressions on their faces.

*" - I'VE HAD A LONG HEARTFELT DISCUSSION WITH YOUR TEACHER AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE TOLERATED WAY TOO MANY OF YOUR CONSTANT DISRUPTIONS ALREADY AND THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO PUT A STOP TO THEM. PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE ALSO ASSURED ME THAT YOUR POTIONS TEACHER HOLDS THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL OF HIS STUDENTS AT HEART.*

Snape grinned. What a unique way to phrase this. Molly Weasley truly had a way with words.

*" - I PROMISE YOU, YOUNG LADY, IF YOU CONTINUE TO DISRESPECT YOUR OWN EDUCATION AND THE EDUCATION OF YOUR PEERS IN THE FUTURE I WILL NOT HESITATE TO PULL YOU OUT OF HOGWARTS! DON'T YOU DARE THINK I'D EVER FALL FOR YOUR CROCODILE TEARS! YOU'VE TRIED THAT TRICK WAY TOO MANY TIMES ALREADY.*

*" - HEED MY WORDS! YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR THE SUMMER! DON'T MAKE IT WORSE!"*

The red envelope floating in front of Ginny Weasleys face burst into flames and the mortified girl quickly made her way out of the great hall, to wherever little girls like her went to wallow in their misery.

Snape allowed himself to indulge in a little smirk. He'd been going toe to toe with the Dark Lord for years. Putting little brats in their right place and manipulating circumstances to his own advantage was child's play. He gave a mental shrug. Maybe the Weasley girl would learn something from this and keep her head down in front of her betters, it would do her well for the future.

*** Eyup, I could see that spectacularly backfiring if it happens during her first year.\\
Executing a plan to publicly shame and discredit an innocent Ginny whilst she's being manipulated by that diary? She'd be driven into Tom's clutches within the week.

*** Sadly, this is how it would most likely go down. Just look at the following passage from Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 3 pages 34 and 35:

#+begin_quote
  “They were starving him, Mum!” said George.

  “And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.
#+end_quote

She completely dismissed the righteous accusations of child abuse because she was angry at her sons. So Ginny would not fare any better.

**** She dismissed accusations from her irresponsible 14 yo twin sons who pulled a stunt that could have caused their family some serious legal issues. Wizards take the secrecy of their world very seriously, and in that moment, nearly anyone would think the twins were trying to make excuses. Arthur would have been booted from his job, and probably have had to attend a court hearing about their actions, if his sons were seen.

Not saying that what the elder Weasleys (or anyone really) did was excusable, but it is understandable why and how they dismissed the accusations. And it isn't as if HP ever had a spine regarding his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys either - he never tells anyone much beyond the general "we don't get along/they've never liked me". Ron, Fred and George (and maybe Sirius) were probably the only ones who had an inkling of an idea of how bad it was, but teenagers can't do much. Neither can an escaped convict.

Snape knew too, from the Occlumency lessons, but Snape is a motherfucking bastard, so that's that.

****** In that guy's write up, yeah. In another write up, she can just as easily take Ginny's word over Snape's.
