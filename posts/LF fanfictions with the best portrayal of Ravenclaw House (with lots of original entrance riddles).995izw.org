Its traits are creativity, acceptance, originality, wit, wisdom, intelligence and individuality. Yet every single story I open has Ravenclaw with all these Hermione's/Percy's everywhere. I'd expect more people like Luna there and an explosion from the dormitories as not an uncommon occurrence. If you want the real mad geniuses of Hogwarts and the ones who invent some pretty rad spells and potions, go to Ravenclaw, that's how I've always seen it anyway. At least they'll have /some/ ideas if not fleshed out.

*Bonus points for unique and original riddles that aren't used every single time*

Thanks in advance!


** You might enjoy: Tell Brave Deeds if War. For Tell Brave Deeds of War the characters aren't Hermiones but they're not exactly what you described either.

  Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal.

  Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron - how will she cope? [AU, Dramione] Prevalent alchemy. WIP

****** He's dumbed down a bit and his love for food is over exaggerated but doesn't have a very prominent role in the story. He's resorted into Hufflepuff while Hermione's in Ravenclaw and Harry and Ginny are in Slytherin, so they don't really spend as much time together.
