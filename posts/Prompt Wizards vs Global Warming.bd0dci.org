Without the muggles noticing


** Scrolling through my feed, I just saw the title and my first idea was 'exterminate all the muggles' but I guess that would include us noticing.

Edit: 'us', not 'them'

** Crackfic alt prompt: rising sealevel isn't due to global warming, it's all the damn wizards that keep conjuring water willy-nilly.

Wizards realize this, go "Oh crap", and try to fix it without muggles noticing.

**** I'm just imagining them putting cooling charms on ice-burgs, not realising the effect of dumping non-melting chunks of ice into the middle of the pacific ocean and then cooling down the massive currents that keep the oceans regulated.

*** Or the easier version:\\
Step one - cast permanent movement charm on a motor trubine. Seriously, they have magical flying brooms, they must have something of that sort somewhere.\\
Step two - repeat\\
Step three - ???\\
Step four - profit and substantially reduced carbon footprint.\\
Bonus step - transfigure a batch of coal into lithium for additional profit and mass-produced batteries for e-cars.\\
Bonus step 2 - introduce wizards into material science, watch them make better batteries and fuel cells.

Also would make for a better story, noone would get pissy about questionable political or ideological elements

***** Huh. Then simply crank up your wizarding material science division up to 11 and lay super efficient mass-solar panel fields in sahara connected to a crapton of even more efficient fuel cells, with current transported via superconductors that work in room temperature you've figured how to make along the way. I mean, that's something that is possible according to muggle science, just make sure you don't disclose how you made the stuff.

** My personal idea: Fight the causes, but also fix the effects. Go for the big polluters that require few men and replace them.

I would need a budget of a few hundred wizards working for me, which doesn't seem unrealistic considering the apparent size of the ministry.

- Buy out the top maritime shipping companies. The top 15 ships pollute as much as all the cars in the world. Staff with 2-3 wizards each, they make sure the ship is moving ahead.

- Enchant as many coal plants as possible to vanish or capture the CO2. Work with the Muggle Worthy Exuses commitee to figure out a plan to explain why these plants are so clean.

- Work with one or two material-suppliers for airplanes to make a new super-secret wonder-steel that's super light, to make airplanes more efficient. (In truth, just charm them feather light)

- Also, look into metal works (steel, aluminium): They take energy like crazy, and with their own power source you might reduce their emissions by quite a bit.

- Invent some cow food that makes them not fart methane. Bring it on the market cheaply.

Now, most of these might have /some/ Muggels noticing, but they are few enough that humanity at large doesn't notice. And if anyone makes problems, that's what obliviate is for, isn't it?

And now, let's fix some of the effects:

- Try to cool down the sea around the poles as much as you can. Preserve the arctic!

- And generally, find a few ways to remove heat and energy from the planet.

And when we're already at this: Break into nuclear waste storages and either secure them or vanish that stuff.

I love this concept, you'd have competitors trying to figure out the secret behind this amazing material, but it's just charmed steel.
