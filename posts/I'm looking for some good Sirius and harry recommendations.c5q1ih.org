Hi I'm new reddit

I'm looking for fanfic recommendations for Sirius black and harry fics (not slash ) thankyou in advance


** When you say "not slash," do you mean just no Harry/Sirius, or no slash ships at all? I know a couple good fics about Harry and Sirius, but both have background Sirius/Remus.

  Hogwarts is alive, sentient, and able to speak. There is a world of difference between pets and familiars. Harry Potter uses the brain he was born with. The Wizarding world gets an object lesson in why you never underestimate (or worse, make an enemy of) a Black.Harry Potter has a destiny far greater than he could possibly know. A destiny that will shake the Wizarding world to its foundations

** If you're up for a very long read, there's an excellent series starting with linkffn(Innocent by marauderlover7).

The primary divergence is that Sirius escaped from Azkaban essentially by accident, several years earlier than canon, and since he lacked the immediate vendetta that drove him in PoA, he instead went to check up on Harry. Who was keen to get away from the Dursleys, and the Dursleys were more than happy to hand him over, leading to a great deal of action and intrigue and and magic and canon derailment as they get to know each other and deal with the magical world's pursuit of Sirius. With Harry being just nine years old, there's a lot of focus on the Marauders' generation and Sirius POV, even though it's not actually a Marauder-era fic. Really great worldbuilding, and I love the way it fleshes out a lot of adult characters like Remus, Tonks, Gawain Robards, Rufus Scrimgeour, and even Wormtail (of /course/ Tonks turns herself red and green for Christmas, because why wouldn't she?).

And then, after nearly 500k words of that, the first story ends, and Harry finally starts school. And the second divergence starts to hit its stride. Namely, the Malfoys had /two/ sons, and Lucius decided to play both sides, with their older, Hydrus, remaining a proper Slytherin, while Draco was instead deliberately conditioned to bring out Gryffindor traits, in case Voldemort didn't return and Potter became an important figure. Except that Narcissa had her own ideas, and set out to protect her son: she tasked Severus with teaching him Occlumency, so that whether Draco ended up spying for Dumbledore, or for Voldemort, either way he would be able to protect himself. Cue Lucius later changing his mind, when it becomes apparent that Harry will never be any kind of Dark Lord, and that Voldemort is indeed still around and still seeking to fully return - but by then, the changes in Draco have taken root, and to Gryffindor he goes, snarky, confused, but with some consideration for others' feelings and ultimately not believing in blood purity.

The characterisations are really great, and with the series being so long - much longer than canon - there's time to see a lot of points of view that canon skips. We get to see Remus and Tonks getting to know each other, life in the Auror office, Ginny's interactions with Tom Riddle's diary, and many other segments, from a werewolf camp to the Malfoy manor to the timeless struggles of parenting a teenager - and in this case, a teenager who is a magnet for trouble. Many canon stations occur, but they're always toyed with, expanded, reinterpreted, never just railroaded.

I actually haven't finished the series; I'm on the fifth book, which is still in progress. But that's over a million words in. [[/u/JavaliciousJean][u/JavaliciousJean]] You know what you did.
