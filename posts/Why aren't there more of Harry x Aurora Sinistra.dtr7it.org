Harry has been paired with older women (e.g. Bellatrix, Narcissa, Miverva, and even Lily) so why isn't there more of Harry x Aurora? I only watched the movies so I don't know much about her but I assume she can easily turned into an OC like Daphne Greengrass.


** She isn't mentioned much, or really have a decent amount of dialogue( If she even has any in the first place, I can only remember that she may have said something when McGonagall was attacked by Umbridge.) so most ignore her or just use her for smut.

As for just making her an OC, it wouldn't be too difficult but most writers tend to stick to established character traits (Both Canon and Fanon). Especially with characters such as Narcissa and Daphne. It would be intersting to see (or write) something that expands more on some of the lesser know characters like Aurora.

*** I agree that it would be interesting to see what authors would do with Aurora but it seems like they have either forgotten her or just don't care. Also considering the range of smuts (with and without plot) there seem to exist in this fandom it's surprising there aren't more of Aurora.

*** This fanfic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13005120/1/Beneath-a-Moonless-Sky]]) is the only fanfic I know that is strictly Harry x Aurora. There is another one ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14188524/chapters/32705163]]) where he has a relationship with her among others.

** Narcissa is Malfoy's mum. So Harry getting together with her is the ultimate slap in Draco's face. Bellatrix is one of the best fighters in the series (her insanity usually gets axed via time travel, so that's not an issue). Lily I haven't actually seen outside of bad smut and harems. McGonagall is usually the go to teacher, despite her canonical uselessness and her age (usually, a magical solution is offered here). And if you want to merge the lover and mentor role, Fleur and Tonks are the go-to option.

Perhaps most importantly, most of those characters guarantee you a lot of views. But who searches for Sinistra? You want to tell a story in fanfics, but you don't want to talk to yourself.

** My guess is that a Harry/Aurora, or any OC teacher, doesn't really lend itself to an intriguing story outside of smut, and there are at least a couple Harry/Aurora PWPs out there. On the other hand, Daphne matches well with indy!Harry and pureblood culture fics, and Bellatrix or Narcissa have some inherent conflict given Bellatrix's nature and Narcissa being Draco's mom. And even then, most Harry/Narcissa ends up being smut anyway. I guess you can argue for a magical mentorship/discovery kind of story, but you can write that either without the improper relationship or using a character closer to Harry's age (Fleur, Tonks, Cedric, etc.).

Theoretically a cult following could start for Aurora the same way Daphne did, but someone would have to write a solid fic and give her a baseline personality, and if enough people were inspired by it and wrote the same kind of fic, she could take off in fanon.

  keeping the age difference to, say, 5-10%?
#+end_quote

what does that mean? age difference doesn't seem to matter in the wizarding world anyways, just look at the canon pairing of tonks and remus, tonks was born 1973 and remus was born 13 years earlier in 1960
