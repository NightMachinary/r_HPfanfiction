Here is what I remember about the Fanfic: 1. Harry x Fleur 2. They meet during the GoF (obviously) 3. Something happens and Harry goes to an undisclosed location to learn and control his magic 4. There he meets 3 other Veelas and they become like his sisters and help him with his relationship with Fleur 5. The one thing I clearly remember is that Fleur worries that Harry will have fallen in love with these other Veelas because they are not only beautiful but also a "beautiful human"


** I'm 80% sure it's "when a veela cries" because of the three vela friends but I can be mistaken.
