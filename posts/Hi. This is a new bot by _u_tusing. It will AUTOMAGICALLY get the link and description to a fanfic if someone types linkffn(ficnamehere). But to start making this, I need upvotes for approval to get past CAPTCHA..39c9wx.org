Guys, I can confirm this. To start developing this, though, I need manual upvotes, otherwise Reddit's API never lets bots through the CAPTCHA.

It's been a really long time since I've developed in Python, so it will take some time to develop, and iron out bugs.

Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to /go/ to fanfiction.net, and then you have to /copy/ the link, /hyperlink/ it, and then /format/ the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is

#+begin_example
  linkffn(Dagger and Rose)
#+end_example

to link Dagger and Rose.

 

* *OUTPUT*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: output

Output for

#+begin_example
  linkffn(Magics of the Arcane)

*** Maybe, but sometimes it doesn't change much for a whole year.

Either way, the bot grabs new stats every time it's pulled, so if a story has very few reviews during one pull, and then it gets a lot of reviews, the bot will grab the brand-new stats next time someone references them.

Either way, no one really reads a story by the number of reviews or favs, because let's face it - those are not indicators of how good a fanfiction is, especially in this fandom. You have really good fanfics, like linkffn(By The Divining Light enembee), linkffn(Conlaodh's Song enembee), and then you have absolutely terrible fics - linkffn(Harry Crow). No one in their right mind would choose Harry Crow over the first two just because of the number of favs/reviews - they're just an indicator of how /popular/ the story is, not how /worthwhile/ they are as a read.

**** To me, all the points you made at the end of your post are additional reasons to drop fetching those data. If no-one reads a story based on reviews or favs, and those metrics aren't worthwhile for judging a story, why have them cluttering up replies?

Although, maybe it's difficult to parse out useful info (pairing, genre, rating, chapter count, wip/completed, etc) from the favs/reviews.
