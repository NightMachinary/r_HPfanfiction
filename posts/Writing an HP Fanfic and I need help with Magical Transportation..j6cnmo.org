At its very heart and essence, it is a Harry goes to Beauxbatons story. I need help with the Beauxbatons bit.\\
Transportation. How should I transport the students? It is a problem that is driving me mad. I am dead against portals. Portals as a whole aren't dealt with in-depth by JKR and I don't want to go too far away from the same thing.

Portkeys, Apparition, and Floo are not feasible, to say the least. I'm not keen on Abraxan drawn carriages pulling the students because I feel they used that only for the TWZ and it isn't easy to blend into surroundings.

Do you guys have any ideas? I'd really appreciate it.

I'm not in favour of trunks in general. Between the movies and fanfic trope I don't think I could digest that.

** What are you trying to do with the story? Are you just looking for a Hogwart's analog? All because something is a Hogwarts tradition doesn't mean Beauxbaton needs an equivalent. Just have the families drop them off at the school, and then have have something basic for muggleborns, like professors picking them up with portkeys.

*** I'm building my idea of Beauxbatons to be inaccessible and closed off from the world. People can't access it as freely as you'd find people accessing Hogwarts, i.e. by going through Hogsmeade. That's why I want a common mode of transport so that it isn't easy for anyone to make their way there.

Made them some token that every student has to have. Like their uniform! That way the travel is more selective, the intruders would be stopped at the gates or dumped in some prison area!

That could be used like some hazing thing for first yrs too

Or an alumni who want to visit without asking permission first would get to 'prison' on purpose just to inconvenience their old professors lol

** I think you could go with mixed transportation eg. Main travel mode are portkeys that all arrive to some meaningful destination on the school grounds, maybe floo or apparition in some special cases like motor sickness from portkey travel in younger students. They meet up, chat, have a moment to welcome friends. And then your chosen Original Mode of Transportationâ„¢ gets them to welcoming feast or some other official ceremony opening the term :)

*** I feel you about not reusing carriages, I think in TWZ they were used as 'that French thing' and were allusion to what was popular, like, in times of Ludwig XVI xD similarly I imagine Hogwarts carriges more like XVIII century English ones used for admiring the countryside etc.

In that vein you could look through historic French transportation and adapt it for wizard use

Maybe aeroplanes lol

** A barrier like the one at kings cross/multiple barriers.

A tunnel/ room where u go inside through one door and leave through the same door but to a different place?

Really dramatic portkey with added affects - everyone thinks its some magical innovation like a recreation of pheonix fire, but its just a portkey that they stuffed an illusion on.

A fountain somewhere that you step into and come out like the durmstrang ship from the Flamel fountain.

A maze that only students can pass through where they just disapear somehow, non-students just get lost.

Stepping through mirrors in their own home- alice in wonderland style.

They have a dream the night they are supposed to leave and wake up in beaubatons, if your not asleep you miss out and have to wait a day.

A potion/ charm on their invitation that transforms the students into birds and has them fly to school.

** If it's supposed to be something traditional that Beauxbaton does similar to how Hogwarts has the Express, then how about enchanted 1940's era cars? With the backstory that the original Renaissance era enchanted carriages were destroyed in the Grindelwald war, and promptly replaced with the best the post war french automotive industry had to offer.

**** Curious, what part is difficult to write? There are thresthals carriages for all students at Hogwarts. And Beauxbatons are bigger... In the book a single carriage transported all required students and luggage... I looked like a house. It seemed to me the carriage could hold at least 50 people... And considering Beauxbatons is in a mountain zone, pegasus can be handy.

***** The Thestral Carriages are used to shuttle the students from Hogsmeade to Hogwarts, with all the students already assembled in Hogsmeade and away from the presence of mundane people who might stumble upon it.

Right now I'm trying to figure out how to transport the students to that Hogsmeade-like point. Mass transport.

Organising dozens of carriages to pick them up, I'd either have to have them picked up at home, which would be difficult, or picked up from a common point with kids joining their friends in separate carriages from a common magical point (like platform 9 and 3/4), but then we'd have children in unmonitored in a closed space in a flying carriage, and it isn't an idea I'd personally be comfortable with if I was organising it.

****** I was thinking on the 9 3/4 approach. A farm or something with invisible carriages ready to depart. If you think kids can open a door and jump out of a carriage... Well you could have spells on doors... Or as the carriage is certainly bigger from the inside have some sort of "compartments" away from the main doors.

I mean, it's not like it's perfectly safe to jump out of the Hogwarts Express either.

******* Fair points. I'm liking this idea a lot more now, and I'll definitely give it some thought.

Like, it could be a certain number of students from each year in a carriage, with the seniors required to keep an eye and even a faculty or attendant to watch over them?

******** It could go any way you like. In GOF it seemed like it was only one attendant, Olympe, for the whole delegation and it was a single carriage. So I guess she gets to stay near the door. The carriage could be a massive thing considering what we saw with Arthur's tent.
