Upon rereading the HP series I decided it would be fun to write a fanfiction. But I've been running into problems and am hoping for some tips.

First off I keep coming up with ideas but then find out there are already tons of fics with those exact ideas, nothing I come up with seems to be original and I don't want to write a story that's filled with cliches and tropes.

Secondly I'm having a hard time writing certain characters accurately. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny are my favorites so I feel I've got them down pretty well, but writing characters like Ron is much harder. I have no intentions of bashing him or any other character, I just don't know Ron's character well enough. When reading the series I'm too busy focusing on my favorite characters that the others just fade into the background for me. My biggest problems are Ron, Sirius, Snape and Neville so any advice for keeping them in character would be greatly appreciated. I also don't know quite how to keep Ron relevant. My fic involves adventures and romance between Harry/Ginny/Hermione but I don't want to remove Ron from the trio and replace him with Ginny, I want him to still be as important and vital as he is in canon, I just have no clue what I want his role to be in the group.

Thirdly as I've been planning this story in my head I've realized it feels like just a bunch of jumbled up ideas thrown in without really fitting together well, I also keep going too far out of canon and I don't want it to be so au that it's unrecognizable. I'm starting to think I can't write a well written HP fanfic when compared to so many great ones out there and that I should maybe just give up.

Please give me any advice you can regarding these problems to help me make my fanfiction better! Thanks!


** First off. Throw out the idea that you'll write something original. Especially for your first foray into fanfic. If you manage coherent, not grammatically awful and finished you'll have surpassed the majority of first fanfics. This is why, sometimes, looking at lists of cliches and tropes can be a bad idea. So what if you want to write a trope filled, cliche ridden Indy!Harry fic. Go nuts. Have fun.

Refer back to the books, try and focus on scenes with the characters you're having trouble with. Maybe find some fics centring around the characters you're having trouble with (or at least, some good ones).

Writing good fanfic, or indeed writing good anything, is mostly about volume. You are not going to be perfect on the first go, nobody is, but fuck it. Enjoy what you're doing. You can always write more and the more you write, the better it gets. Figure out whether you're the person who /needs/ a scene by scene plot or if you just need rough goal posts or if you're just going to make it up as you go along.

** My advice:

1) Start easy by writing one shots that depict certain scenes

2) Write characters you feel comfortable with

3) If you write canon, make sure it's really canon compliant, research resources thoroughly, because reviewers will tear you apart if you make factual errors

4) If you write AU, develop your own plot. It's difficult, but also a lot more appreciated by readers. However, your plot has to be plausible.

5) Find a beta, they are very helpful

** Just because someone else has written something similar to you doesn't mean it can't be written in an original and authentic way. I mean, you're writing fanfic so it's never going to be a wholly original idea anyway! Write what you want so you enjoy the process of writing and don't compare yourself to other fics or let their plots and character interpretations influence you - I actually read very little fanfic for this reason.

As for characterisation, this comes with practice and trial and error. Read the source text closely. Write out their dialogue to get a sense of what their voice is, and mannerisms that come with their speech.

** First things first: breeeaathe...

Now then. Regarding your points. Write what you want. Someone is going to like or dislike it no matter what its about, so don't waste time worrying about that.

On writing Ron. I think you may want to reassess your narrative abilities regarding the other characters. If you think you can't write one major character, it calls into serious question your capability of writing other major characters. Its not implausible at all, but its something I think you should reconsider before you dive down the rabbit hole.

Also, if you make a muli-fic, all male characters aside from Harry usually end up being either ignored, relegated to the side, or irrelevant unless they are bashed/bad guys. It doesn't have to happen, but it seems to be the natural evolution in these fics.

There are literally millions of HP fanfics that cross into hundreds of different story types and alternate universes. Never assume you are the first to have thought of any of this. Arguably, the most original fics are the ones that started before HBP actually came out.
