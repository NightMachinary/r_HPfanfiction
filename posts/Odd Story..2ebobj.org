So i'm looking for an odd story where the Dursleys want a girl but Petunia can't have one so when Harry arrives they raise him like a girl but they keep him in diapers and baby him until hes eleven. Then dumbledore and snape come and dumbledore wipes Harry's Relatively happy childhood and replaces it with canon. Then canon happens but Snape hid some of the memories and then after the war him and george get married and Harry is an Adult Baby etc. etc.


** Still a better love story than Twilight.

** Is this it?

[[http://hp-ageplay.livejournal.com/11451.html]]

I found it using the method I described earlier with the search terms ""Dursley" "petunia" "baby" "eleven" "adult baby""

It was the first result.

*** Thanks I already tried that though and all I found was alot of trashy archives of our own fics. Not to disrespect Archives of our own but there is a lot of incest and bdsm on there. So I frequent it alot and I know its not there.
