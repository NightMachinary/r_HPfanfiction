Greetings, and sorry for posting twice in such a short time. But I need your help. I am currently writing a piece of fanfiction with the working title "Helios, Luna, Yggdrasill". However, I am unsure if my work is something people would be interested in. I'm reluctant to post it on fanfiction.net since I'd like to make my first post there something serious. And since I know of no other fanfiction sites (I am fairly new to this thing), I hoped you would help me with your opinions.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/y51scc9f3jvve5a/Chapter_1_2_Aurelius.pdf?dl=0][Heres the link to the first 2 Chapters from Aurelius' perspective.]]

Any feedback is welcome. But please be aware that I am normally writing in german. This is my first attempt at writing a novel with the help of the english language. So some grammatic mistakes (its still a draft) may occur.

Also, as I already wrote in [[http://de.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2teoej/how_to_recruit_beta_readers_advice_please/][this thread]] I am looking for betas to help me out. If you're interested, pm me please.

(I have no idea what flair to use. Went for Request.)


** Just opened the pdf and the first thing i noticed was a MONSTER of a first paragraph.

There is nothing wrong with long paragraphs, but they can be a bit daunting before you get a reader invested in your story. I'll read through a bit and let you know if anything else pops out at me.

Reading just the first few lines of the paragraph it could quite easily be broken after "planned on reading"

Some of the language feels a little wooden, but that could quite easily be solved by having a native english Beta go through and adjust the wording.

From the first page, the plot feels quite disconnected from the harry potter cannon, and while that is not necessarily a bad thing as some people like that, others do not, and if you are planning to close in with the cannon characters, a prologue with the cannon characters, maybe a preview of what is to come, before the first chapter turns back to introduce this Aurelius character.

Finished the first chapter, it felt like it has potential to be an excellent story, despite the OC focus, something I typically dislike. I'd be happy to give you some more suggestions focusing on tone and flow at a later date, but unfortunately i can't help you with grammar, it's really not my fortė.

*** Thanks for the feedback. I'll tame the monster :D

And yes, the plot is quite disconnected in the beginning. I planned on jumping over to Hermione and Harry after the first Chapter of Aurelius. Now I consider swapping.

Yes, my english is heavily influenced by my german writing. Stuff that works there doesn't work in english and vise versa. This is going to be a good learning process.

** The errors in the first paragraph should give you a good idea of what areas of English you should brush up on...

- Sentence beginning with "As if the orange ball" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- "Grandfathers pasture" should be "grandfather's pasture" (English uses the apostrophe to denote the possessive case. [[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/][Helpful link]])

- Sentence beginning with "Last of the old mans" is a fragment--use a comma instead of a period before it. ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_construction][Helpful link]])

- "old mans" should be "old man's"

- "hinder" sounds like the wrong word here--try "stop" instead. (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "Cake and cookies", as well as the sentence after it, is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it and after it. ([[https://www.uncg.edu/eng/writingcenter/handouts/APPOSITIVES.pdf][Helpful link]])

- "But for now, he'd linger" should be "But, for now, he'd linger" ([[http://drmarkwomack.com/a-writing-handbook/punctuation/commas/parenthetical-commas/][helpful link]])

- "He had finished the Macchu Picchu School" probably should be "He had graduated from the Macchu Picchu School" (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "Leaving him with great knowledge" is a fragment--use a comma instead of a period before it.

- "Why Muggles flew to the moon without us" should be "Why Muggles Flew to the Moon Without Us", shouldn't have a period at the end, and should probably be italicized rather than in quotation marks

- "Analysis" should be "analysis" (no capitalization)

- "Arithmetic" should be "arithmetic"

- Sentence beginning with "All to end in a prototype" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- Sentence beginning with "This pivot" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- Try using "fulcrum" rather than "pivot", and "anchor" instead of "point of orientation". (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "How they dealt with their dream" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- "dream" should be "dreams" (you're referring to /multiple/ "greatest minds")

Don't give up on your study of English! I've read several very good stories written by foreigners (two or three by an Italian, one by a German), and even /their/ English sounded rather weird, even though it was almost perfect.

  In linguistics, an *absolute construction* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_construction][grammatical construction]] standing apart from a normal or usual syntactical relation with other words or sentence elements. It can be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-finite_clause][non-finite clause]] that is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_clause][subordinate]] in form and modifies an entire sentence, an adjective or possessive pronoun standing alone without a modified [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive][substantive]], or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_verb][transitive verb]] when its object is implied but not stated. The term /absolute/ derives from Latin /absolūtum/, meaning "loosened from" or "separated".

*** The lone fragment is perfectly ok in german (even though considered a bit artsy) so you'll stumble upon it quite some time :D I didn't know you couldn't do it in English.

Thank you very much. This is more than I expected. The links are amazing.

** Anyone attempting to write, especially non-native english speakers, should find a copy of "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. It is a very small book that will completely explain how and why to put sentences together; proper application of it's rules and advice can turn an unreadable piece of shit into what you're really trying to convey.

  */The Elements of Style/* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription][prescriptive]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English][American English]] writing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide][style guide]] in numerous editions. The original was composed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strunk_Jr.][William Strunk Jr.]], in 1918 and published by Harcourt in 1920, comprising eight "elementary rules of usage", ten "elementary principles of composition", "a few matters of form", a list of forty-nine "words and expressions commonly misused", and a list of fifty-seven "words often misspelled". It was much enlarged and revised by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White][E. B. White]] for publication by Macmillan in 1959. That was the first edition of so-called *Strunk & White*, which /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)][Time]]/ magazine named in 2011 one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.

*** Thank you. I've already made some improvements with the tips I gathered from other redditors, but now that I read a bit of The Elements of Style I am sure I'll improve even more with the help of this book. I just ordered it and I can't wait to get it into my hands.

Thanks, again.
