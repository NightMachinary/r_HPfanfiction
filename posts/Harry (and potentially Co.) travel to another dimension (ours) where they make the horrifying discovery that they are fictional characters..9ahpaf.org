I've had this idea in my head for years. I love writing stories (hell, I majored in a Creative Writing English degree), and I've built this whole idea where someone built a virtual reality with real living AI and, of course, one of the first things ported over was the HP universe. Then someone gets the bright idea to tell Harry he's fictional...guess how /that/ turned out.

Anyway, are there any stories like this? It's a fascinating idea.


** Star Trek deals with that in a few episodes? Have you seen those?

#+begin_quote
  guess how that turned out.
#+end_quote

depends. Can they get out of their VR environment? Are there artificial bodies? Is their mind even separable/distinct from the AI running the simulation as a whole? Being able to create or destroy sapient&conscient beings on a whim is a huge ethical can of worms anyway. I'd expect such a story to entirely derail into those kind of sci-fi discussions quickly - not exactly HP anymore.

** The second to last chapter of the third part of The Sword of The Hero trilogy has this, but it is quite a long read just for that moment. It is a good read, and in each book the stakes get exponentially higher. linkffn(The Sword of the Hero; The Defiance of the Hero; The Soul of the Hero)

** It's an interesting concept, but it's very very difficult to do well. The only one I've read and liked ( linkffn(The Wonderful World of Fanfiction) ) is basically a Q&A fic for all stories written by The Carnivorous Muffin, so it isn't actually something you'd read to read. I mentioned it because it actually does pull off the characters finding out they're fictional and written by someone in the way that those characters would react to it, and funnily enough, also realise that that reaction was written by the author too.

There is linkffn(The Substitute) which deals with something a little bit in a similar vein, so check that one out.
