What kind of stuff would Harry learn and use against Voldemort? And if Voldemort was able to use the powers of the things he's horcruxed, what would he do with it?


** No clear idea what Necroscopes are or who Brian Lumley is, but... even with the plain old canonical Resurrection Stone, the reason neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore makes actual use of its powers in a plot-significant way is that if they did the entire edifice would come tumbling down. The ability to call any dead person to you and have a chat with them is absurdly overpowered for the story Rowling was telling. This is why some fans resort to the hack-y fix of theorizing the Stone doesn't "actually" bring back the dead but only creates realistic "holograms", for lack of a better term.

*** Totally agree that it would be OP for canon. Harry Keogh, the MC of the Necroscope series becomes insanely OP with just that power. It includes the ability to absorb skills from the dead, so he learns martial arts from an old sergeant in the graveyard by his school, for example. But one of the most broke things he learns is from the mathematician Mobius, who spent the years since his death further refining his theories. Harry was able to grasp conceptually extra-dimensional travel, giving him an improved form of apparition, basically. And so on.

But imagining being able to absorb knowledge of spells directly from the likes of Merlin and the Founders is just scary.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.
