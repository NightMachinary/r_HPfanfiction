** - Lily called Snape Sev.
- Marauder nicknames. Also Snuffles
- I think someone called Bellatrix Bella. Maybe Voldemort.
- Tuney for Petunia. Vernon may have called her Pet.
- Cissy for Narcissa.
- Mollywobbles
- Mad-Eye
- Dora and Tonks for Tonks
- the occasional Gred and Forge
- then, of course, you have names like Loony Lovegood, Snivellus, and Phlegm.
- and don't forget TMR's many nicknames.

** Some were actually used in canon (eg Lily calling Snape Sev and Petunia Tuney) and some weren't (eg Siri). But it's not just important what nicknames were used, but by whom they were used. Just because Lily calls Petunia that, doesn't mean anyone else does. Many fanfic authors don't seem to bother much about making sure the characters actually sound in character. You also have to keep in mind who all is present during a conversation. Two professors talking to each other in front of students will talk differently than them talking in private. Students talking to each other will be less formal than a student talking to a teacher.

** They weren't. I think it's practically fanon headcanon now that Ron and Harry called Hermione "Mione" all the time but I don't remember them ever doing it in the books? Siri makes me cringe because it just reminds me of the Apple assistant LOL and was never used. What on earth is Jamesy?? I'm counting my blessings I never saw that. Minnie is so strange to me. And Drake? @.@

Bellatrix called Narcissa Cissy; I'm surprised people don't use that instead of Cissa. And Lily did call Snape Sev at least once, I'm pretty sure.

*** I think Ron called Hermione "Mione" exactly once, during a sorting feast (in HBP I think?) because he talked with his mouth full and was not able to prononce the full name.

**** Some translations have Hermione with a nickname of Mione.
