Even though the characters are all the same, I find they always look a bit different in my head depending on what I'm reading?

It depends on the story? Sometimes Harry sounds like he's quite short and wirey but other times he sounds tall and broad shouldered. Even though he's described the same way he just reads different? But he's unique to that fic. If I reread that fic he'll always look the same he did the first time, even if that's completely different to every other version of Harry I read.

Do you find this? And when you reread stories do the characters look the same in your as they did the first time or do they change? Or does Lupin always look like Lupin regardless on where you put him?


** Definitely happens with Harry's aura. In general his physical characteristics look the same in my head for most fics written by different authors unless stated otherwise but for each different fic, Harry's demeanor and aura is unique to the atmosphere of that fic the author created.

** Hmm, Harry usually looks the same in my head no matter what until they mention long hair. Then it doesn't matter if it's described as shoulder length, it always becomes super long in my head ðŸ˜‚

** Depends on how they describe them. If one fic describes Harry as short and wiry, that's how I'll imagine him to look. If another describes him as tall and muscular, that's how I'll think he'll look.

*** This is basically how it is for me. Most stories make a note of his physical characteristics (like whether he is small for his age and/or suffers/ed from extended malnutrition or what not). If they don't mention it at all I guess I see him as my initial interpretation of him from his physical characteristics in the books. Basically like a less good looking Daniel Radcliffe.

** I struggle with jumping between ages, specifically if I've gone 3rd, 8th, 1st, 1st, adult, 5th, child, MOD, 3rd. Sometimes Harry has cheeky little shit vibes and sometimes he is very troubled, or adult whose seen shit, child whose seen shit, young man in love.

** Hermione is one who varies a bit to me. I think if she's dating Harry she generally puts a bit more effort into her appearance and her hair doesn't appear as bushy but more soft waves. I know in Harry Crow she is very atheletic so I always think of her as rather flat-chested there with a runner's body.

Harry varies a lot. Sometimes he's really malnourished, he takes potions and vitamins to get back to his recommended weight/height for his age. I usually see him about 5"7' - 5"10', slim atheletic build. Even in the AUs when he's treated well he's not considered that big. I think Harry is one of the youngest of his year which definitely makes him seem smaller than the rest.

Ron is always the tall, lanky one. I'm not nsure how tall he will end up (he does have a healthy appetite) but he will always be tall compared to Hermione and Harry.

Ginny is described as quite pretty but I never see her that way. I always see her as very freckly with skin that would burn in the sun. Kinda like a female Seamus.

Hufflepuffs always seem the same. Slightly chubby (with a little baby fat). Ravenclaws seem a bit thin on the side (maybe they forget to eat or something).

** It depends on the character. Some characters have fixed visual appearances in my mind, and even if a fic decides to contradict it, it doesn't really influence my longterm visual impression of them for the fic (like, I can imagine makeovers and such, but they don't really last as I continue to read). These cases are mostly movie characters, and some major characters that feature in a lot of fics I read (for instance, teenage Severus or Lily in Marauder-era fics or adult Hermione in postwar). Some have a "default" appearance but isn't fixed enough, so fics contradicting it can change it. An example of this is Daphne Greengrass. Then, there are characters that don't have a visual representation in my mind at all, because they have appeared infrequently enough to not make a solid impression on me. This obviously includes all OCs, but also people like Theodore Nott or Marlene McKinnon.

** Some stories do describe them so that changes one's perception. Sometimes Snape is this ugly git of greasy hair who always wears this black cape. Others he rips his cloak and is Ned Flanders underneath, a muscled beast who got oily pecs from spending hours scrubbing at his cauldrons.

*** I get this a lot too ðŸ˜‚. I tend to read either Marauder stories where Snape is the obvious villian, or Snape Redemption stories where they give him proper motivation and character and personality.

In the first he is the human equivilant if a decaying hangnail. In the latter he is a broad shouldered, chiseled god whose, and I quote "robes have the privilege of being on his body".

** Well, I can't actually "see" any characters when I read (or just think), but I do see them differently depending on what I read. Harry usually defaults as short and skinny but what he looks like changes as I read the fic.

It's the same when I read Supernatural fics. I don't read about Dean and see Jensen Ackles.

** Yes, for me this really makes an influence. When I read about a martial arts Harry, I have some real trouble connecting him to my baseline Daniel Radcliffe Harry who is a bid pudgy in those last movies. That said, if anyone writes a blue eyes Harry without any explanation I drop the story.

However, the way I imagined Lupin never could unite with the movies porn moustache and the manner in which his clothing and looks are described made a huge difference for me as well. What really ticks me off is when people disregard Rowling's source material about the amber/yellow werewolf eyes, and they start waxing poetic about his baby blues.

When people write book 3 Sirius as an unkempt tramp I really can't reunite him with the always smooth looking Gary Oldman.

Snape is even worse. 99% of the people actually describe Alan Rickman in stead of Rowling's Severus Snape, so I see Alan Rickman (but that voice will stay always with me regardless).

But especially with the actors with less screen time I will really see in my mind's eye what the author describes. But that might have something to do with the fact that if I was even marginally worse at faces than I already am, I couldn't even pick my husbands face out of a line up.

** Harry and Ginny are the main ones that vary for me.

By default I imagine a runty abused Harry who looks much like I did when I was underweight in my late teens, but with shorter darker hair, a little more muscle from Quidditch training, green eyes rather than hazel, and just, y'know, generally more attractive in terms of facial features and stuff. Being compared to Harry from the book covers is why I grew my hair out and switched from round to rectangular lenses.

When Harry's described as being all tall and broad shouldered and shit, I imagine something like a cross between Daniel Radcliffe and Handsome Squidward.

Similar issues with Ginny - in my mind I have potions-creep!Ginny who looks like movie Ginny, and then I have hot!Ginny who has a totally different face, slightly curly hair that's more flaming red, and a constant mischievous smirk like a third Weasley twin. Different body shape as well. Basically a completely different character depending on whether I like how she's portrayed.

** Daniel Radcliffe is great at Harry but he doesn't exactly match the book description. I picture him differently anyway. I don't really deviate from the idea of canon book Harry but that's how I picture him.

Harry is supposed to be tall, messy haired, green eyed. Daniel just doesn't match. His hair is closest it gets and even then it's just the style.

****** Well, I am not much into heavy-abuse Dursleys, but I can accept that years over underfeeding can limit child's growth. And the boy's height at 11 is quite unreliable predictor of his height as an adult.

And concerning the Mirror of Erised, the only description of his parents I can find is this:

#+begin_quote
  She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes --- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green --- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.
#+end_quote

It doesn't say that Harry was as tall as James. Almost just contrary, it emphasises how James was tall (as if Harry was not), but that's a speculation. Or did I miss it somewhere else?

** It changes depending on how their personality is written. Physical descriptions don't really have an effect on how I see them compared to canon.

Sometimes I see the character as their actor or based on fan art I've seen, depending on which of their personality qualities the writer puts more emphasis on.
