With the ever growing Muggleborn population, the largest issue Albus Dumbledore had in his tenure as a Headmaster (before Voldemort's return) was ensuring the school's compliance with the Statute of Secrecy. Hiding the castle itself was never the problem, but in a world where even Purebloods were having to deal more and more with the Muggle world, many question what boarding school these children were disappearing to.

Building on the idea Dippet had left him, the ruse of Hogwarts School for the Gifted and Talented (a prestigious and secretive school in the Scottish Highlands that handed scholarships to extraordinarily gifted youngsters) was established.

But a problem arose from this lie. Students were being investigated too closely for the "talents" that had awarded them these scholarships. And Hogwarts itself became under closer scrutiny as people began questioning why they hadn't heard of it in any social circles. Particularly if it was throwing about scholarships willy nilly.

A coordination with Obliviators was able to help with the "reputation" problem at first, but they couldn't be relied on to maintain that reputation.

Hence a fairly controversial change...

Fast forward to day one for Harry James Potter at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Instead of being thrown into his first lessons in magic, Professor McGonagall was holding meetings for her first years to cultivate "Muggle Friendly Talents". A skill that they would develop as a cover for interactions in the Muggle world to explain their scholarship placement at Hogwarts.

Though they weren't expected to begin any form of competition until second year at earliest, Hogwarts was a competitive school that fought to win.


** This sounds hilarious. Ron would be a chess genius, of course, but the others could be ‘assigned' some random obscure talents. Maybe Harry could be trained to prodigy level at playing that wooden flute Hagrid got him. Hermione could be like one of those University Challenge kids who knows a crazy amount of irrelevant historical facts.

*** I like to think Harry would be put on some athletics track, possibly encouraged by Oliver when he gets the Seeker spot. Though Harry playing the flute would be great too, I did consider the idea of him doing something musical but completely forgot about the flute in first year.

I def live the idea of eventual Chess Grandmaster Ron Weasley and Hermione being queen of Trivia.
