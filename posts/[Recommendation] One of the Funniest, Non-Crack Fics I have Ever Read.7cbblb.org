** I am five chapters into this fic and it is proving to be one of the most delighftully funny stories I have ever read, on par with the likes of /Seventh Horcrux/ or /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/. Give it a try.

**** I really don't know. The best way to sum up the point of departure is "Harry has read quite a few books before the Letter comes around", and increasingly-big changes pile up, culminating in things like Not-Steve the Dementor helping Neville, Boggart-as-Neville, Harry and the Twins fight a Diary-possessed Sirius Black in the Chamber of Secrets. And it's wonderfully well-written.
