:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic that I read ages ago but can't find. It was an after war fanfic where Harry had broken up with Ginny. Harry was friends with Draco and ran a sort of business/ charity where on a mission to see if a science lab needed funded falls in love with an American witch. At one point Ron comes for a job but Harry blows him off

Any help in finding it would be appreciated
