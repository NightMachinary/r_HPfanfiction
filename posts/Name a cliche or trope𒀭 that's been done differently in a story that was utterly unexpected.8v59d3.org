ð’€­ While trope and cliche are synonymous, they usually mean commonly recurring/accepted literary conditions/devices versus trite and overused in most fields respectively.


** Going to be obvious, but the soul-bond in linkffn(Lady Archimedes) was both utterly unexpected, and very elegantly done.

** - Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): Potter twin, Harry is a more talented Potter twin with darker leanings, but his parents are loving and kind and never treated him as inferior to his brother.
- The Firebird Trilogy: harem and forced marriage, the entire purpose of Harry getting a harem in this fic is to not only mock the trope but to end the forced marriage/harems in the AU.
- The Amalgamation Agreement:linkffn(The amalgamation agreement): multiple tropes, is a fic almost entirely about subverting several tropes, including Ice Queen Daphne and marriage contracts.
- Hallows and Pathos linkffn(Hallows and Pathos): Master of Death being more than a title, one of the most unique takes on the Hallows I can remember.
- Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): house-elves are overpowered, I was not expecting at all just how they are revealed to be in this fic (its one of the most memorable scenes I can think of).

**** A good bunch of FF authors seem to believe that extremes are needed to create exciting and unique stories.\\
While It is true that this offers some options; most never seem to notice, that the writing has to get exponentinally more immpressive the more absurd the plot becomes.

I often view it as one of the entry traps to being an aspiring author that absolutly wants to create a crushing experince.

***** It seems to me like many authors don't even do it to make the story "exciting and unique" but just to show the reader how bad Harry has it "and it's all Dumbledore's fault" and the worse Harry has it the more evil Dumbledore obviously is. At least in regards to the "Harry is treated even worse than in canon" thing. With regards to other overly extreme stuff I agree.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
