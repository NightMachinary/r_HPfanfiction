:END:
One-shot, dunno year. Harry finds himself suddenly noticing how sexy Draco is during potions, then starts to freak cause he's straight, and starts to suspect that he's been dosed. First he asks Snape about how to know if you've been love potioned (the answer was "you don't" and a brief description that most love potions only last for a few hours max with amortentia being the exception as it's permanent), then later that day he goes to Hermione. She quizzes him on who he's fantasized about before now, to satisfy herself that it isn't just a gay crush he doesn't want to admit to (he lists her, Luna, Susan, Ginny, iirc there might've been a couple others, pretty sure Daphne Greengrass was mentioned, maybe Lisa Turpin?), then she starts researching.

Some time later, she drags him into an unused classroom where Ginny, Luna, and Susan are waiting, and explains the situation to them, and that she's found that while there is no cure to amortentia and it appears that Harry has been dosed, but you can override it if you dose with a new amortentia potion within iirc 24 hrs. There's a brief moment where Ginny and Luna start cheerfully discussing the possibility of a dueling competition over who gets to have the new potion keyed to them, with Susan despairing that she wouldn't have a chance in that case against the other two, before Hermione points out that a potion can be keyed to more than one person, resulting in everyone agreeing that Harry will be dosed for all 3 (Hermione doesn't feel that way about Harry in this fic, and Harry was fine with that).

The stinger at the end is a couple of Prophet articles, first of Harry's surprise marriage and going on honeymoon (I don't think the in-universe writer knew that he had multiple women), second that Draco had died from some sort of veela mate rejection syndrome (implying that Harry taking amortentia keyed to the girls and eloping essentially killed him).

I'm starting to suspect that this might not exist anymore given my fevered search session including google quote searches (both with and without the "site" command) trying to find it via various permutations of that stinger has utterly failed... I also can't remember if it was on FFN or [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]] either, which doesn't help (I'm fairly certain it wasn't on AO3 as I've barely touched that site).
