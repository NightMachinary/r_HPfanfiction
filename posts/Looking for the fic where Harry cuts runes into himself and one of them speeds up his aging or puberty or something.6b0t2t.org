** That would be linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer).

Haven't kept up to date on it, but I enjoyed his Naruto works, so I should probably see what I've missed out on so far. . .

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
