If you love Harry Potter and love the Holidays, this honestly is the festival event for you! And its not just my opinion, its a certified fandom tradition. [[https://mini-fest.livejournal.com/207445.html][MiniFest]] as run every year, for over 10 years! It is, to say the least, a staple of the HP Holiday season.

Sadly, signups are running very low this year. And if interest continues to decline, this may unfortunately be the last year of the fest, which would be heartbreaking!

I implore you if you are a writer/artist, consider signing up for this fantastic event and help to keep the tradition alive for years to come!

[[https://mini-fest.livejournal.com/207445.html][Here]] is a link to sign up! You do not need an LJ account and there is no penalty if life gets in the way and you can't complete your gift. This year, the Fest will also be posting on AO3!

I've included the rules for the fest below for considering participants convenience:

# Fic submissions must be at least 500 words long. There is no upper word limit, so if you want to write something that is 30,000 words you are more than welcome to.

# Submissions can be any rating, any pairing/moresome, and any genre. This applies to both fic's and art.

# All submissions must have a theme of any holiday held during December. This includes Christmas, Hanukah, traditional Yule or Winter Solstice celebrations.

# Prompts are available for use by everyone and can be used by multiple participants.

# You can use as many prompts as you wish, in any combination you wish. E.g Harry and Draco want to go somewhere warm for the holidays, Picture prompt of a beach, "I'm sick of freezing my bits off", watching an eclipse.

# You are more than welcome to submit more than one entry. The more the merrier.

# Art can be any of the following: Traditional art (pencil, painting, digital etc.), photo manipulations, graphics or handmade crafts e.g Christmas tree ornaments.

# Chan is allowed, providing it is properly warned for.

# Participation is through registering your interest on the sign-up post and giving an indication if you will submit Fic, Art or Both. Sign ups will close one week before entries are due.

# All entries must be emailed to [[mailto:HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com][HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com]]

# There will be no penalties if you cannot fulfill your registered interest in this fest. December is a busy time of year for everyone, and this is supposed to be fun and relaxed, everyone knows that Real Life gets in the way of our fandom lives from time to time.

# If for whatever reason you need to pull out please just email the mods [[mailto:HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com][HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com]] and let them know that you need to pull out.

# If you're submitting fic's please ensure that it's been beta read, is free from errors and that you are happy for it to be posted as it is received. If for whatever reason your regular beta is unavailable let the mods know and we will see what we can do.

# Submissions are due in November two weeks before posting starts on December 1.

# Submissions will be posted anonymously, by mini_fest_mod with reveals occurring in the New Year, within in the first week of January.

# Any questions can be sent to [[mailto:HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com][HPMINIFEST@GMAIL.com]].


** "There will be no penalties if you cannot fulfill your registered interest in this fest."

Curious: How authors are penalized generally?

*** Mini!Fest does not have any penalties for this. For many prompt fests, if you sign up to write a fic and fail to do so without informing the moderators of the fest in a timely manner, you are prevented from participating for the next year that the festival runs. This is to help ensure people's commitment to the festival and to help alleviate the added stress for the moderators when they need to fill in the posting gaps in the fest. Mini!Fest, as it does not have any penalties for failing to complete a fic for the fest, chooses to employ pitch-hitters who write additional stories to fill the posting roster (Mini!Fest posts once a day or more in December I believe).

I hope that answers your question in full ðŸ˜Š Let me know if there is anything else I can help to clarify or answer.
