Look, if a witch or a wizard can just swish his or her wand say some fancy (and often misleading) gibberish which he swears upon his/her magic (then is promptly announced as truth by a bright flash) the whole HP series can be simplified by cutting it in half. There would be no need to have trials except to determine the punishment.

And I hate how in every fic with some potential the s**** begins with Harry saying "I swear on my magic ...blah blah blah... so mote it be." and a whole fucking arc is destroyed right there. Just because it's in the HP fandom doesn't mean you can have a just say 'MAGIC' to every problem in life. I hope that the first person to use that in a fic has to read a lifetime of s****y fanfiction.

What do you think about this? Coz I really think that something so convenient as a 'magical oath' shouldn't exist unless it has benefits that outweigh its advantages.

(Did u guys read 'HP &draft morons'? I dropped it not even halfway through the first chapter.)

The HP fanfictions must be about magic and other worth reading s***, not trying to interpret some mumbo-jumbo to the way that benefits you the best.


** I think this is fanfiction inheriting from the concept of the Unbreakable Vow that we see with Snape and Narcissa in canon. I can see why people would not always use the vow - the punishment for breaking the vow is death.

Thus, it would seem pretty silly if Harry went around making an Unbreakable Vow with everyone he wants to become friends with. It'd be the equivalent of trying to make friends with someone by handing them a dagger and holding their hand up to your throat. Doesn't sound remotely sane, does it?

That's reason enough to avoid the vow in fanfiction despite supporting the existence of it in canon - the gravitas of the vow alone is enough to dissuade people from using it except in situations more valuable to them than their own lives.

Still, I see where you're coming from: perhaps both canon and fanfiction would be better off without a perfect, unbreakable seal of trust. Part of what makes these sort of human interactions so interesting in the first place /is/ the potential of betrayal.

(Snape makes a vow to Narcissa to protect Draco, and it feels very solemn and all, but it might have felt even more significant if Narcissa implicitly trusted Snape to carry out the promise. Without a vow, there's also more room for internal conflict, which would fit a character like Snape.)

You can still make vows work in fanfiction. In addition to the punishment of death, add serious adverse effects on the participants of the vow until its completion - and perhaps even a stacking permanent adverse effect so people can't simply use it all the time to confirm the truth of a statement. There's a lot of room for creativity with this, and now you've turned an annoying plot device into an interesting one.

(The same can work for plot devices like Veritaserum - a permanent adverse effect could limit the use of the potion to capital crimes, where the consequences of being guilty or not are of greater magnitude than the adverse effect over the course of the lifetime of the bearer. A last chance for a wizard being sentenced to the Veil as guilty when they know they are innocent, for example.)

** There's a crackfic somewhere that plays this as a joke. I think it had a couple of purebloods talking to Harry and Hermione after the Battle of Hogwarts, and to persuade them to reveal everything about the horcrux hunt and other stuff, they swear a magical oath to keep everything secret.

Harry & Hermione lose it, pointing out a half dozen of times where one of them could have used the oath to cut out a load of unpleasant stuff (Heir of Slytherin, Sirius' innocence, Harry's name in the GoF, etc).

The story was done as a comedy, but as you say, it's pretty much true.

** I despise the phrase "so mote it be" enough that I had an option on my fanfic-to-epub program that would redact it. I had a few other phrases and corrections it would automatically apply, such as "Mione" â†’ "Hermione". (Sadly lost in a rewrite, but I'll probably add it back in at some point.)

Simple, binding magical vows of truth cut out a source of problems for a person, typically the protagonist. It's /usually/ useful to add more sources of problems and preserve the ones you start with, but not always. If you want to use it to clear up a canon issue quickly in order to tell a different story with a starting point temporally similar but not thematically similar, it could be useful. Like if you're writing a romance, that might take center stage and require you to downplay other conflicts. Providing quick and easy solutions to Voldemort's continued existence and the Tri-Wizard Tournament might help your story on the whole.

Except it's seldom used that way. Oh well.

Daft, not Draft.

You might have continued on a bit to see a scene in which Harry explains to Hermione that house-elves are not slaves, they're just magically bound servants that can be tortured or murdered at their owner's whims without the ability to defend themselves or leave. Without actually giving any arguments that the text relays. And then telling Hermione that she can't be right in thinking that they're slaves, and she needs to learn to shut up and believe him. And that he doesn't like it when she makes demands of him, so she should either stop or not be friends with him. And then following her in the Invisibility Cloak to ensure she actually does the research (without asking any elves, obviously).

  Dumbledore gave a little start of shock upon hearing that. He was absolutely positive Harry did not know of his heritage. He did not even know the boy knew his true first name.

  Harry gave it a moment for everyone to absorb what he'd just told them. To a child, they all immediately shut up and looked back with expressions ranging from shock to outright fear.

** Usually, magical oaths and veritiserum are not admissible in court because old purebloods want to game the system. At least if they deal with the issue at all.

Keeping this kind of thing from children is the sort of thing a manipulative Dumbledore would do.

Generally, I've seen it done well in order to tell a completely different 4th year story, or to demonstrate that the magical world is completely against Harry anyway.

Logically, Harry could not have been entered into a magically binding contract in the goblet of fire if he did not enter himself. Unless maybe his guardian entered for him...which again requires manipulative Dumbledore... or possibly using imperius on Petunia?

In any case, there are plenty of cannon plotholes to fill or ignore. I do the same with fanfiction plot holes unless they serve no purpose.

/Is/ there something called magical oath written by JKR save for that scene with Narcissa Malfoy and Snape? Especially something that does /not/ require a middleman in extra to the two people who are giving/receiving the oath the oath (which ends with a mote it be and a blinding glow)

Do you remember being a 15-year old that thinks, talks, acts and lives like a mature adult at 15? You'd be lucky to see one of those that are 25 years old.

Maybe even Dumbledor wasn't sure about a magical contract is there. He himself admits he is prone to making mistakes and It's not like GOF was made by him. It's probably a few centuries older than him at least. And you do /NOT/ f*** with old mysterious s***.

** This is one of the many many plot holes in cannon. A magical oath is basically a contract with magic enforcing the contract. In Harry 4th year he was entered into a magical contract unwillingly, another plot hole, and then the consept was not mentioned again for a while. In order for cannon to have any meaning, oaths and contracts had to be mostly ignored in cannon, and only used in order to try to close other plot holes so that more of the story would flow or make sense

So for fanfiction writers to include magical oaths in their story actually fits in with existing lore even if the original plot tends to ignore them and if written right often does not detract from the stories at all.

My previous post from months ago on this subject. In a nutshell, I was wondering at the time 'how do people know that whatever language you're swearing the oath in is the exact same language they're speaking?'.

I mean, if someone swore a 'so mote it be' oath in, say, Greek, or Gobbledegook, would witnesses to it who don't know the language be magically able to comprehend the meaning of the oath? Can you invent a language for the sole purpose of swearing an oath which sounds very similar to English except for the meanings of did/didn't, am/am not, etc being swapped around?

Please do not misunderstand. What I meant was that there are many other magics that could be written about while an author is writing about 'magical oaths'.

Also, I disagree with you on something. While yes, characters are very important, what makes Harry Potter fandom the harry potter fandom and not Naruto or hunger games fandom is the magical world created by JKR. Therefore I think in extra to the development of characters, without which a fanfiction will be almost never read, the most important thing is the magic itself, the world that depend on magic and how the author explores what JKR did not.

#+begin_quote

I also disagree with this statement on the grounds that you might have confused HP fanfiction with HP Wikia or Pottermore as the point of a fanfiction is exploring the characters. and most if not almost all the fics do this in their own way. BUT and this is a big but+t+, MAGIC is what makes this fandom special and its significance should be grasped by us all in the community.)

Without magic, it would not be Harry Potter and without Harry Potter 'magic' will not be the same. As seen on the most mundane topic (cleaning something with scourgify) to the most intense battle(spells of every kind flying everywhere beating the world in luminous lights.
