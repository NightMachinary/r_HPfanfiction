No character bashing.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Would rather it be complete but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No crossovers.

Not with the Dursley's either, come on guys! lol.


** Il would suggest "Harry Potter and the philosopher Stone". The author isn't well known, like "Bowling" or "Roeling" but the story is good, and it is complete. Well, don't read the epilogue, "The damn kid" or such crap, it ruins the all serie, worst fanfic ever.
