As title says im looking for fics set in a zombie apocalypse. No slash for harry. Prefer Harry to fight smart (extended bags are op for looting, silent casting is great for stealth etc) Please no 'oh the world has ended, but we still have to hide magic, and/or the zombies are magic resistant for no reason'

** Try linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma). It's not exactly what you're looking for in an apocalypse fic, but it's still one of the better ones in the fandom

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** It's only a subplot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), but nevertheless an important one because it would have some nasty repercussions down the road.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  Spring, season of meetings. Encountering Rick Grimes and his rag-tag family, Harry and his portkey lost friends are left wondering if this is the end of their troubles in a world infested with the undead, or the beginning of them. At least they have each other. Bonds form and new families are made as those who do not rise are buried and burned.

  The war between humans and zombies rages even after five years. Military efforts to repel the hordes of undead prove less than entirely effective. A team of military medical specialists are brought together to try and find a solution. They are joined, however, by some unexpected participants. The survival of humanity rests in what emerges from the meetings. (First Tale)
