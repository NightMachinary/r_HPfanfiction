There's a miniseries that takes place after the final battle of Hogwarts. It's something like "One day after the final battle" "One week after the final battle" "One month after the final battle" and I think "One year after the final battle". I can't find it anywhere and I never got to read the last installation. Any help locating it would be immensely appreciated.

** Do you know the primary characters it focused on, plot points, AU/canon-compliant, etc?

*** It was pretty cannon compliant, it mostly focused on the rebuilding of the wizarding world the day, week, month and year after the war ended
