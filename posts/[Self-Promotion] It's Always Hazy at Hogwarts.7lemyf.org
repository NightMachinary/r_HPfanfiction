Summary: The gang hotboxes the Prefects' baths.

I finally got around to finishing up a one shot. Writing something that isn't garbage is a lot more difficult than some authors make it seem.

It's a 5k word one-shot that takes place during Goblet of Fire, where Harry gives gillyweed (the wizarding analogue to marijuana) to Krum, and the champions end up smoking together in the Prefect's baths.

Thanks for reading, and I'd appreciate any critique to my writing.


** I love reading about Harry getting high. This was hilarious. So many great lines. It's definitely how I felt when I got high for the first time. And the thousandth.

***** the 'man in an hour' was krum suggesting that within an hour, Harry would have lost his virginity to Fleur, which puts for the idea that perhaps fleur has a small crush on our boy

e: and im gonna be honest i've never watched the movies and it's been a long time since I've ever read GoF, so I took a lot of liberties with Cedric lol

** Cut off everything before "Hey, is Krum here". It's like you need a bit of a run-up for anything interesting to happen. The back story, the details about the owl, all that? It's filler.

After that, things start happening. It was pretty much what I expected, and the audience for which this is written will certainly enjoy it.

** I liked it. It seems like a good starting point for a canon divergence fic too. Harry gets wasted with the other champions, causing them all to bond, and they reappear to help Harry with later problems.

Any story where Harry gets wasted and loosens up is usually good enough to read.

** Loved it. There really is nothing on this earth better than some ice cold water after you've had some great gillyweed. The only thing I was unsure about is if Cedric wouldn't be aware of how to get into the kitchens. I have this headcannon that the Hufflepuff's are all about impromptu common room picnics, but obviously there isn't actually anything in the books to support that theory.
