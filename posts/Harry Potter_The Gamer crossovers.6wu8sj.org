I just caught up with linkffn(11950816) and am extremely upset that the author hasn't updated in months. I really like The Gamer, and it fits well with Harry Potter. Especially when Harry slowly becomes a badass. If any of you know more of these types of HP fics, please tell me.

  I was nothing special before I died the first time but when something offers me the chance to live again I take it. Reborn into a world of death I will survive. There will be no mercy and no pity. For there are monsters that roam this world and to survive I might have to become one myself. Elements of the Gamer and X-overs in later chapters.
