  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
