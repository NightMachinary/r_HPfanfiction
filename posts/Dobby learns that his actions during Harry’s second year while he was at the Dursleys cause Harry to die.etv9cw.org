I love Dobby, honestly!

But like everyone else, I know that Dobby frustrated everyone during year 2. I was curious if there are any stories out there in which Dobby's actions led to Harry being trapped at the Dursleys (and the Weasleys never come to rescue Harry)

So when the staff from Hogwarts come to finally check up on Harry when he didn't arrive at Hogwarts, they discover that Harry has died of starvation/dehydration and the news gets circulated back to Dobby.


** That happened in a fic where they summoned Harry from another universe after they had let their Harry die. It went downhill from there for the OotP iirc.

**** Found it, it's alright, don't expect a masterpiece but it is fairly good overall.

  AU lighthearted funfest with mature overtones,Post DH Harry gets pulled to an AU only to be expected to do it again. Dumbledore bashing is rampant Harry is doing it his way but he's going to have fun doing it! RATING FOR LANG. AND SEX INUENDO

***** Just read it. Pretty good, but no masterpiece, as you said.

​

Harry died of starvation as you said, but no Dobby at all in the story.
