He's a very minor fanon character but I love the way different authors write him.


** Honour Thy Blood. Good mentor fic following the third task. Daphne is the pairing. Does show a good mentor in Arcturus.

*** He's generally seen as tough but fair, and I think the main reason is because he didn't disown Sirius and made him the heir

** Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina by Karmic Acumen: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/2/]])

It's an older Black Family-centric fic that centers around Regulus trying to clear Sirius's name a few years before canon starts (Harry is 7). It's definitely a fix-it, I don't remember much of the details since it's been so long. Arcturus is the Black Family patriarch and comes into play a bit later and he's great.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety.

** This isn't Arcturus centric, but he's a major character. Linkffn(honour thy blood) There is also linkffn(stepping back) by the same author. I prefer the first, but both are good.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** linkao3(Ozymandias by sirtwentyofhousegoodmen)

I recently read this fic centered on family Black and enjoyed it very much. Arcturus is one of the main characters and gets a lot of character/backstory/moments. The summary is great and made me smile as soon as I read it so I won't explain more :P

  The Black Family had seen its rapid decline over the course of five years. Now, with the apparent death of the last male heir, Arcturus Black presides over a dying dynasty, Walburga Black begins a slow descent into madness, and Sirius Black is jailed in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit.However, Arcturus isn't content on letting his ancient family name die out just yet, nor is he all that keen on handing his estate to the terribly déclassé Malfoys. So he, along with Walburga and a very reluctant Lucretia, begin a quixotic crusade to free their wayward heir from Azkaban.Meanwhile, in a more bucolic setting, Regulus Black lives in peaceful self-imposed exile after faking his death to protect his family from his betrayal. Until one night, he finds the long-forgotten mark on his forearm is burning once more.What happens when this highly damaged, emotionally constipated, extremely dysfunctional group of individuals meet under the roof of Grimmauld Place 16 years later in the midst of the second wizarding war?Chaos. Utter chaos.Set mainly during the events of OoTP, with a relatively lengthy prologue covering the years from 79-95.
