Harry finishes the first task in a cool way (not flying). Like in linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) Harry uses parseltongue. And in linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) Harry uses obscure magic to tie down the dragon.


** Inspected By No 13 linkffn(10485934)

Harry lets the dragon off with a warning for having a non-standard egg in her clutch. The dragon is suitably relieved to retain her dragondom and not be downgraded to a large salamander.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Hadrian Black is entering his fourth year at Durmstrang Institute, and looking forward to it. He has excelled during his time there, and hopes to bring pride to not only his aunt, but his school as well. And, he has been given the chance with the reemergence of Triwizard Tournament, only problem it is being held at Hogwarts. Rated T.

** There was one that I remember from a long time ago where Harry summoned up a bunch of cows for the dragon and traded them for the egg. I cannot find it anywhere though, I think it may have been deleted from ffn.

I also remember Harry created some modified type of niffler at one point, and the pairing was probably Harry/Luna but I'm not sure (could have been no pairing at all). If anyone knows what it is or how to find it, I'd appreciate it.

** Honestly there was a fic I read that talked about Harry being absolutely terrified of the dragon. Hagrid warns him about it and Harry is so scared he goes to Hagrid's hut begging for any tips on dealing with the beasts.

Hagrid was like: there's one thing dragon's respect: Domination. And how does one creature dominate another? He throws his shite at it.

And so for the task Harry brewed a simple laxative, popped a squat in the arena and hurled his steaming mudpies towards the dragon and it backed down long enough for him to retrieve the egg.

I've forgotten the title, though.
