**** Well good luck with your story than, hope you will enjoy writing it.

Since you are writing a harem story you shouldn't make the girls all be oke with each other it makes it complete unbelievable. No one likes sharing a lover unless they gett off on that or are bi? And i doubt all the girls you have mention are all like that
