What's the story or stories that had a background pairing (so not the main focus) where you were like I'd never thought of that pairing before. Or wow, that pairing makes a lot of sense, or I like how the author did that pairing, wonder if there's any more?

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. Et cetra.

Can be ANY era, can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, the plot itself can be focused on anything. No Weasley bashing. If Harry is in the story: No OP Harry. Harry smarter and stronger then in canon is fine, but I want it to be because he worked for it, and I want it believable.

Can be an older or newer story. The Horcruxes can be a part of the story or doesn't have to be. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.


** I still push linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee) and its sequels. I don't think most participants of this subreddit will like it, it is really mostly for adults, but I really liked it.

** Harry/ Lisa Turpin

Call Me - linkffn(10751741) It was an odd fic that got me interested in the pairing and how its dynamic might work.

No Longer Alone - linkffn(12745758) Also does a good job with that pairing

Harry/Hestia & Flora Carrow - Another pairing that I wish there was more of. Its just an interesting and fresh change of pace.

Rage - linkffn(11136250)

Twins - linkffn(13491812)

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

  Harry makes unexpected friends in his fourth year, when his friends and his housemates abandon him. Hestia and Flora, daughters of some of Voldemort's most sadistic enforcers, know what its like to live in fear. In this unlikely relationship, the three plot to bring down Voldemort and escape the society that tried to destroy them. Dark, violent, potential H/H/F pairing

** Petunia/Sirius

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14074770/chapters/32426100]]

Petunia is a witch instead of Lily. They're opposites that bring out the best and worst in each other.

---------------------------

Lavender Brown/ Tom Riddle

Lavender Brown accidentally goes back in the past and meets Tom Riddle. It's a great twist on the trope and honestly worth the read for it's take on divination.

[[https://www.ao3.org/works/19949440]]

---------------------------

Pretty much every (healthy?) pairing in this:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2407704/1/]]

Primarily Hermione/Theodore Nott. Muggleborns are given to Death Eaters as rewards. Very dark, but is really about kids being forced into war. Almost like a reverse Stockholm syndrome in some of the cases, where they get to know the muggleborns and realize it's all fucked up so they rebel. At one point Theo has to do something so terrible he gets Hermione to obliviate him afterwords.

Warning that is VERY DARK.

There is a a lot of mentioned rape of both genders, because it's a story about human nature and while characters like Theodore want to do good, there are others like Marcus Flint that take the opportunity for what it is.

** In a Snily reading spree, I found a post-halloween fic. Never liked this kind of LESS (he does not deserve her at that point in time IMO, considering the circumstances that brought the Halloween event on, and the whole being a Death Eater thing), and this fic wasn't really any better, but I had nothing better to do at the time. However, what did intrigue me in the fic was the portrayal of Petunia together with Sirius. I found the ship really cute in it. With Petunia showing Sirius the importance of actual responsibility while Sirius teaches Petunia that it's good to just let loose sometimes and have fun.

** Harry/Severus with a background of Neville/Remus. [[http://www.pornbunnyfarm.com/pages/strangecreatures.html][Strange Creatures]] by Swtalmnd. She also wrote the Neville/Remus story (not sure which came first), [[http://www.pornbunnyfarm.com/pages/floraandfauna.html][Flora and Fauna]], but Strange Creatures is the one I reread often.

Due to the recent Rule 8 kerfluffles, I feel impelled to state that Harry and Neville are both full adults, no longer in school, and their partners are not teachers at all, much less of the younger men.
