:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think he could control like strands out of his core and near the end of the fic he had created like and island or a really large piece of land and one small detail I remember was he had a chef on that land who used clones of the best tomatoes to make the food. Harry's power basically was to be able to use strands of his core outside his body. That's all I remember so sorry if it isn't enough.


** Found the fic I was looking for. It's called Core Threads Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/73/]])

** So you're looking for a specific fic or you want recs that also fit into that category?

There's a brilliant series called Pacify in which Harry becomes SUPER powerful and is able to create land and grow flowers and life, etc (it's a Snarry fic). I don't think that's the one that you're describing, but if you're into this concept (abused/traumatized Harry becomes super powerful), then I'd definitely recommend it.

**** Oh, so glad you found it! I'll definitely check it out. I'm not even a Snarry person, per se, but I got addicted to this fic because it is SOOO well written. And I am a huge Snape fan, and he's so well-written here. It is definitely worth checking out. Of note- someone has created a “podfic” so if you're into audio, you can also listen to it.

It will destroy you.” I will destroy you. “I want you to,” Harry murmured, and Severus' resistance wasn't enough to keep him from being pulled closer, Potter's breath feathering across his lips. And in some ways, the fact that his eyes were closed made it worse - made the words whispered against his mouth all the more obscene: “I want you to tear me apart.”***Harry and Severus tumble into an intensely inappropriate physical relationship after events at Headquarters spiral out of control. Severus, digging his heels in, tries to stop, but he is just not strong enough.***Cover Art by Mousewrites
