  Dear Ms. Honey née Wormwood,

  We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
#+end_quote

The eponymous character from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(novel)][Roald Dahl's /Matilda/]] receives an invitation to Hogwarts, a couple years after being adopted by Miss Honey.

NOTE: I just made up a random address in Buckinghamshire. I have no idea what's actually there.

EDIT: I find it amusing that far more responses were concerned with whether or not I should have used “Ms.” or “née” than the idea of the prompt.


** Matilda is 5-years-old in the story, and the book was published in 1988, so an approximate birth date for her would be maybe 1983 (3 years younger than Harry). Given that Harry is young for his year group, likely she would just be 2 years behind him rather than 3. So she could conceivably be a first year Muggleborn during Prisoner of Azkaban.

Matilda is definitely one of the stories that fits best with the HP magic system. Another being Mary Poppins.

*** It can be used as a general "your name once was", but it's definitely not used for adopted children. Generally, adoptive children gain the name of their adoptive parents, and most records are changed to reflect this. In the case of the hogwarts letters, the quill probably crosses out the old name and writes in the new.

Additionally, it is generally considered in bad taste to refer to an adoptive child by their old name, as that implies they're not "really" part of their family.

**** Actually, the original rationale for 'Ms.' was because the feminists of the time claimed that it was patriarchal discrimination to require women to use a form of address that depended upon their married status while not requiring the same of men.

Also, 'Mister' is also derived from 'master,' which was another sign of patriarchal domination. The distinction between 'mister' and 'master' is one of control - a man is 'mister' unless he is in charge of something, in which case the title 'master' is more appropriate. Things like 'Master of the Horse,' or 'Master of the Household.'

'Mrs.' is an abbreviation for 'Mistress,' as in 'Mistress of the Household' as a title for the master's wife (which was itself a problem for feminists because it was a title derived from a woman's relationship to a man), but the word 'mistress' can also be used to refer to a woman involved in an adulterous relationship with a married man, which was another reason (IIRC - the 60s were a long time ago) why the feminists argued for 'Ms.'

Besides the feminists' arguments, there was also the awkwardness in social situations (and business correspondence) in addressing a woman. Unless you already knew, or there were indications such as a wedding ring, did you address a woman as 'Miss' and potentially dismiss her life choices and experiences, or do similarly in the other direction? I don't really remember, because I was still a teen in the 1960s, but I think in business situations, it was considered more appropriate to use 'Miss' as the default form of address until corrected.

***** Yes, all of that in terms of origins is true. But none of that takes away from the fact than in modern day, it's very common for adult women to choose to use Ms as their title even if they have never been married, and therefore assuming someone who is unmarried is a ‘Miss' is potentially as problematic as calling a married woman the same thing.

There is a large swathe of young to middle aged women who find ‘Miss' old fashioned and cringey, especially after the age of ~25. Ms doesn't have the same connotations of prissiness, perpetual single status or childishness.

We are advised when dealing with clients to use Ms unless otherwise specified - and when taking details just to ask for the preference.

****** Oh, true, certainly. I was just continuing the conversation and expanding on your reply, so to speak, to blue-mandarin, who said that 'Ms.' was for women who hadn't changed their name upon marrying, and also to be used if you didn't know the marital status of a woman you were addressing. It was meant to make marriage-status-dependent titles unnecessary, not to supplement and add to them.

I'm also aware that usage has changed since the days I was talking about, which was before 'Ms.' became widely accepted. I kind of side-stepped having to deal with that, first by spending the 1970s in the Navy, then by taking a job in a heavily-male industry that didn't involve me dealing with the public when I got out.

However, back in the 1960s and 1970s, while there were women agitating strongly for the use of 'Ms.,' and women who thought it was a good idea but didn't care to push the issue, there were also a large number of single women who did not want to use 'Ms.,' because they didn't want to be lumped in with married women, and married women who didn't want to be lumped in with single women. Their position was something like, "I'm proud of the choices I've made, and want my title of address to match that."
