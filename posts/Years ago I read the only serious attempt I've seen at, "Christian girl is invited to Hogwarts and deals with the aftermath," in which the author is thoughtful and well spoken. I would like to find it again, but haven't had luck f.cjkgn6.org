:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember she spends a lot of time gardening, I think, with her witch aunt, if that's any help at all.

Here's the comment I made on the subject in another thread:

#+begin_quote
  I once read a fic where it sideways tackled the controversies from conservative Christianity's perception of the books by having a girl from a Christian background be invited to Hogwarts and her struggling with her parents' perception of her as well as her self-perception.

  Just occurred to me that it could have been a metaphor for coming out, but it was explicitly about perceptions of religion, so... who knows? Point is that it is the only HP fanfic I've read that actually did the topic justice. Shame I can't remember it.

  EDIT: Just tried to find it. Searching "christian girl goes to hogwarts fanfiction" reveals miles and miles of parodies. No dice.

***** I remember it fondly, clearly. (And I'm a theology student if that counts for anything.) It's more about the emotional angle, feelings of rejection from your culture, etc. The author's voice is largely with the aunt comforting the viewpoint character with, as I recall, an age appropriate imaginary version of what you might say to a conflicted child from a religious background considering attending a fantasy magic school. The TV tropes reviewers (how I re-found it) seemed to like Michelle, the protagonist.

***** Headcanon post!

​

- Jewish magics generally tended more towards ritual and runic magics, although we've had some amazing Staff wielders (see for example the Midrashic Crystal Staff that Moshe held)
- IRL Jewish history is seamless fused with magic (Basically, the 'real' Jewish belief is that some of the mitzvot are magics that God gave us to keep us safe). In particular, most of the rituals have a requirement of brotherhood and stuff of the people they are being performed for - thus the baseless hatred amongst the people eroded at the strength of the magics until the crumbled.
- The Christian censorship and persecution of Jewish texts forces the laws and methods of Jewish magic to be hidden away - they effectively enact a mini Statute of Secrecy on themselves to protect their mages, who are vital for the survival of the Jews in their exile.
- As a result, there is an entire secret body of Halachic literature and commentary about Jewish magic. This is the true 'secret knowledge' that only the wise and old are taught - the nonmagicals who are taught the knowledge serve as a safeguard against it being lost (since there are so few magical who are also Jewish, because of their small population to begin with), and to aid in hiding them.
- The SoS was very problematic for Jewish Magicals - they already had a long tradition of hiding, and preferred to remain in open hiding amongst their brethren, doing their best to help them survive from the shadows. This sometimes led to conflicts between the magical governments and the Jews. Due to the circumstances that led to the SoS, this eventually led to a new form of magical antisemitism, claiming that 'the Jews want to expose us to the muggles so they can wipe us all out and replace us'. As such, numerous extremist groups (such as the Death Eaters) since have tacked on antisemitic elements to their platforms.
- Dumbledore was a major hidden player in the formation of the State of Israel, acting in large part out of guilt from his association with Grindelwald (who had seen the Jews as a major threat to his vision, as their magicals and nonmagicals are inextricably linked. He was very nearly successful in wiping out Jewish Magical Europe.
- He actually took a supporting role alongside the IDF Battlemages in '48 and '67. The Yom Kippur War occurred during the First Blood War, and the First Lebanon war during the chaotic period immediately following its end.
- His expulsion from the ICW lost Israel a strong voice there, and his death in battle against Death Eaters on the evening of the 26th of Sivan 5757 was met with great secret mourning by Jews around the world.

** There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b2b2qj/probably_gonna_catch_some_hate_for_this_religion/][a similar thread on the religion in the HP fandom in March]], and I have contributed to it my own list of faith-related fanfiction stories. In the end I have rewritten and extended it into [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/religionless-universe-of-harry-potter.html][this blogpost.]] I am glad to see some stories I haven't encountered before here, thank you! One comment about “Goldstein”: it seems to have similar problem as “Trading My Sorrows” by ShadowBallad (link in my post) ... the author so much wants to educate us about his religion, he drowns the story in religious details, which is a pity, because the stories underneath are actually pretty good.

*** As an Orthodox Jew who follows Goldstein fairly closely, I can tell you that the author is not shoe-horning in religious details. As anyone familiar with Orthodox Judaism can tell you, religion and life are very intertwined and also very detail-oriented.
