I'd thought I would try again since I got one fic and was hoping for more :) So I'm looking for fics where James, Lily, Snape, Lupin, Sirius etc returns to life but in the future where Harry is an adult or married with his own family. I didn't have much luck finding those fanfics. More the merrier! Thanks!

Also, maybe fics where Harry's parents returns to life but he is being raised by Snape at the time. Thanks again!
