After Voldemort "kills" Harry, Dumbledore gave him a choice. Is there a fanfiction in which he didn't choose to return.


** I know of a couple that are hidden in snippets files.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788731/5][Kings Cross Station]] by arekay, a one-shot in which Dumbledore's knowledge hoarding backfires.

Turnstile Jumper by dogbertcarroll, in which Harry chooses to go on but lets somebody else take his place. Cross-over with Southpark. Unfinished crackfic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/21][Part 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/28][Part 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10491415/35][Part 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13064230/42][Part 4]]. /Note that part 4 is in a different snippets file than the first 3./

** Sort of linkffn(6471922). Harry doesn't return until the battle restarts then he kills Voldemort from a distance and fakes his own death.

#+begin_quote
  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
