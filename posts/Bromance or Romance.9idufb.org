There have been many great fics within the vast scope of harry potter fanfiction. In most fics exist romance. And in some cases, they contain a bromance.

Which do you find more interesting/fulfilling to read?


** Great romances are extremely rare, great bromances are even more so. I'll take a pisstake of a fic that just features Harry and Ron trolling Hermione for fifteen chapters over the most emotional, well-crafted, lovely romance that's ever been put to words.

That said, Harry and Ron are great, but we need to diversify the bromance category my dudes. Sure we've got a couple of oneshots where Harry and Cormac find they're soulmates, but that's about it. What about Ron and Viktor Krum broing it through the world of professional Quidditch? Or like, Neville, Dean, and Seamus forming into a lad culture version of the golden trio. Or Harry and Hermione being platonic life partners because I've read Allure Immune Harry and I /need/ more of that dynamic in my life.

*** I mean, the Marauders were canonically something of a four-way bromance, weren't they? I'm sure there's some at least /goodish/ stuff between James and Sirius in the vast unexplored ocean of Marauder-era fanfiction.

** If Bromance means actual deep friendship and not just jerking and trolling around, I am all for it, but this is truly rare. I can not recall reading any fic that included something like that. Some books come to my mind though.

I love well written romances and I kind of started reading fanfiction, because of my need for more romance. So yeah, I like both.

** This is a great point. Now I want to read some fics with really great male friendships in them. Recs?

EDIT: I just realized everyone's just gonna recommend me Marauders fics, but I've read plenty of those. Anything but Marauders bromance.

There is more to the relationship between Sirius and Harry than them just getting up to ridiculous hijinks. The story goes a bit into the deep trust between them, both in battle and out of it. They also get some deeper bonding moments in chapter 27.

*shrug* If that doesn't count as a well written bromance then I don't know what would fit your criteria. Perhaps you could provide some examples of what you mean?

** It really depends on what kind of story we are talking about. Especially longer stories covering multiple years feel empty without some romantic subplot. That being said, the two aren't exactly exclusive. For example, Harry can have a romance with Ginny while Hermione is his wingman and runs interferences so they can get some quality time. Can you imagine the hilarity of a How I met your mother -esque story where Harry and Ginny become Marshall and Lily while Hermione snaps after the war and becomes Barney, trying ridiculous stuff like the perfect month (a different woman each day) or telling everyone to suit up.

**** If you cover the later (4-7) years, it's not about kids. It's about teenagers, who undoubtedly have crushes and explore sexuality. Even canon Harry wasn't exempt from that, and Rowling heavily censored her works because she was writing children literature (stuff like the darker implications of Lockhart or Pettigrew when it comes to girls). Fanfics do not have the same restrictions, if you want an accurate depiction of teenagers, you can simply rate it M (16+), which allows you to include everything short of smut and explicit gore.

***** Fair enough. Teenagers have crushes and some of them have sex. Yes. /That doesn't mean romance/. Being a normally-formed human I had crushes in school, but no big romance, and most of my friends were this way.

Also, Lockhart... fine, but I really dislike any notion that Pettigrew was a creep. I find his character much more entertaining if he was just so disillusioned and paranoid and desperate that he just turned into a rat and did his best effort to remain a rat forever, giving as little thought to his human life as possible, until he thought once more that there was a threat to his life.
