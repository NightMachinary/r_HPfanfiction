What would the Muggle world look like in the year 2000 if from 1692 onward Muggleborns were left to fend for themselves in the Muggle world with No the Wizarding world no longer taking them in and Training them.(and assuming major events of muggle History stay the same.)


** this is a very interesting idea because there is nothing to stop this process repeating constantly. At one point in the past the community might have completely hidden and the muggleborns have built up their own magical society again for it to seperate. You could have hundreds of different societies out there untill the present magical society decided to be inclusive.

*** Once muggle borns are no longer being taken out of the muggle world I think magic would spread at a exponential rate, in the uk lets set say there are 3 new muggle borns a year that is 924, being born between 1692 and the year 2000. Then you have to take into account their children, grandchildren and so on and so forth, after all from what we saw being magical is the dominant gene(I think magic has nothing to do with genes but you get what I mean).

The the original 3 muggleborns would have like 7 children each who would also have 7 children, with 3 new muggleborns being born each year.

Sure not all of them would survive, but accidental magic would make them more likly to survive than their muggle counterparts.

** I would suppose that the Muggleborns would build their own community eventually. Could start out as some sort of X-Men organization, initially to protect each other from witch hunts and then to learn from each other how to manipulate their powers, but since magic is hereditary, eventually these people would have children, either with Muggles or amongst themselves.

The numbers in the books are inconsistent, with only two known Muggleborns and one with uncertain past out of fourty students in Harry's year. This would indicate that the number of Muggleborn population is very small compared to that of people from magical families. However in DH it's implied that Azkaban is full of Muggleborns, it's implied that Umbridge is really busy with interviewing Muggleborns and there is a large number of wandless on Diagon Alley.

Anyways, the point of the above paragraph was that it would be hard to say how big that community would get in 300 years and it's hard to say whether you would have people developing similar elitist attitudes to those of bloodpurists. I guess it depends on how big this community is and at what rate it's growing. If it would grow too fast, I assume that those coming from older families would start to despise the newer members of the community, but if it's fairly small, I can imagine it being more supportive.

Also, JK implies that Muggleborns were the more likely victims of Muggle persecution since people coming from magical families knew how to hide their powers so I can imagine that the anti-Muggle sentiment in this community would be quite strong.

*** One thing to keep in mind is that magic seems to be hereditary, and the dominant gene(magic probably has nothing to do with genes but you get the idea).

So once you stop romoveing the muggleborns from the muggle world I would expect it to multiple at a exponential rate over the generations.

So you have 2-3muggleborns per generation and each of those muggleborns will go on to have magical children like 7 each, because of magic those children are more likely to survive to procreate, so then you have the 14 kids of the first few muggleborns plus the three new muggle borns.

Mabye I am wrong but I feel like three hundred years if a lot of generation for the about of muggleborns and their decendants to multiply.

**** Maybe but according to JK, Muggleborns also had magical ancestors so I think their gene is more predisposed to creating Squibs. Also, while the Weasleys have lots of children, most wizards in the series have only one or two siblings or they are an only child and also many wizards or witches choose not to marry or have children. So the increase would not really be exponential even if we assume that all the children born out of the initial Muggleborn community would have magical powers.

***** I Hate the Idea that Muggleborns had magical ancestors it just plays into the Pureblood narrative. and if All Muggleborns have magical ancestors were did the first muggleborns come from, their has to have been a first one, and if there can be a first one there can be a second and a third,ect.

and the Muggleborns left in the Muggle world would probably live similar lives to their muggle counterparts. and not in the post scarcity society of the magical world.

****** I'm only telling you what JK said. I have seen people who took into account Pottermore stuff as canon and other who didn't so it's up to you. Also with regards to my thoughts on magical origins, I think that wizards and muggles evolved together. Dumbledore says that "words are an inexhaustible source of magic" and thinks that love and sacrifice are the most powerful forms of magic. That would indicate that even muggles are capable of rudimentary forms of magic, since they refer to charm as a trait of someone that can make you feel good and refer to curses as words that cause revulsion and discomfort. The initial magic might have come from acts that we consider nowadays mundane such as women seducing men for protection or men using charisma to get other people to follow them (things that other animals are not capable of). Later they tamed and domesticated animals and some people had such a good predisposition to manipulating nature that they could protect or harm people and even influence weather through willpower, while others didn't. These were the first wizards and muggles, respectively.

Edit: that's my headcanon at least.

** *Its an interesting idea, here's my take:*

The old wizards are gone, no one knows where, but its pretty clear they are not coming back. There are a lot of stories about the lost wizarding golden age, how they could pull memories from your mind, secrets from your tongue, cross the world in an instant and even command time itself.

Most people don't believe any of this, the mages of today certainly can't manage anything that impressive.

Muggles know all about magic, dragons and trolls are hard to miss. That being said, its a background aspect of the world and everything looks more or less the same as it does in our world. The magic is there, but it doesn't affect most peoples lives.

You might be trying to keep your bird feeder safe from gnomes instead of squirrels and when you go into the woods you need to be aware of devils snare instead of bear attack and the government has a department responsible for keeping the dragon population under control and putting down the ones that gain a taste for human flesh.\\
But, at the end of the day, most people are still doing the same jobs, have the same hobbies, and live basically the lives you would expect.

There are mages too, people born with an ability to work magic. It can be a nice advantage in life, like being very smart, but it doesn't guarantee success or make you superhuman. Also, it takes a lot of work to be able to do anything truly remarkable and most people with magic lack the opportunities or simply aren't driven enough to put in the work.

Being a mage can also cause problems, magic is an unruly and chaotic thing and if you lose control over it it can cause all kinds of trouble.

Then you have Hogwarts, an ancient place of power, steeped in tradition and overflowing with magic, the ancient castle has been an institution of magical learning since the times of the old wizards. It is a vast and sprawling castle built using old arts long lost, with enough secrets and mysteries within its walls to keep someone occupied for a thousand lifetimes.\\
Within its walls, mages and mundanes work together to unlock the secrets of the universe. At least in theory, in practice there is so much stuffy tradition, academic rivalry and mischief caused by errant magical forces it's amazing any work gets done.

The four great departments of Hogwarts are focused on the following topics:\\
Training new mages to control their powers.

Researching magic and trying to uncover the fundamental rules and secrets.

Melding the magical and the mundane together to create something greater.

Solving otherwise difficult problems of a magical nature in the wider world.

*** The way I was thinking about it the magical world would take everything magical with them with them going it threw a global spell so there would be no old magic to find and the only magical creatures and plants would be tha animal equivalents of muggleborns.

So the magical world would be shifting everything magical to a empty parallel version of earth. So magic would be coming back from the ground up threw new muggleborns, that were born after the event.

** Reminds me of this oneshot: linkffn(The Wall by CypressWand)

After Sirius' trip to the Veil, he ends up in an AU where Grindelwald and Dumbledore together arranged to completely split up the Wizards and the Muggles from each other, with a magical wall.

I was intrigued and slightly disappointed that it didn't go further than an oneshot.

** Honestly my first thought of what would happen would be a world of Super Heroes (and of course, Super Villians).

I personally head-canon that any person that can use a foci can also do the same magics without a foci, perhaps just taking more concentration or power if you want a limiting factor.

Of course, if all the new muggleborn aren't trained in their magic then they won't necessarily know what their power can do, they just know they can do somethings. For example, a muggleborn who learns that they can have a seeming telekinetic ability may not then think to try pyrokinetic abilities, because they 'know' that they're telekinetic.

This could go hand in hand with the idea of magical affinities, someone who would have had an affinity for transfiguration magics will more likely to be, say, a shapeshifter (whether that's through a natural metamorphmagus talent or through some sub-conscious self transfiguration, the effect would be similar if not the same), or someone with a natural affinity for herbology based magics might be able to make plants grow on demand. Most if not all of the typical super power traits could be ascribed to an affinity with a particular type of magic.

This could even explain the relative scarcity of super powered people compared to even the number of magicals that we think exist in the HP verse. After all even if anyone /can/ do wandless magic if they can do wanded magic, it's still hard to do. Only the most powerful or focused or determined individuals are likely to ever really claim the same sort of mastery over wandless magic compared to their wanded magic.\\
This means that most magicals in this world will the type of people who either have a very specific (and low level) ability: say a fortune teller or medium (divination affinity); or someone who has perfect aim; or someone who has better than average luck; and so on. Or they'll be people who perform a 'miracle' of some kind, like you can see in real news, say someone bending a car door out of shape to rescue someone from a car crash.

This way, you'd have a few dozen/hundred/thousand super powered individuals, coming from those with the most potential (be it power or focus or will power) matching up with a particular magical affinity.
