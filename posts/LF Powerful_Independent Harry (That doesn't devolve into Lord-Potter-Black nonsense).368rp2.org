I am a big fan of Powerful/Independent Harry especially when it doesn't get slowed down by the cliche Harry gets emancipated from Sirius' will/travels to the Gringotts vaults/participates in a million political things etc.

Would prefer it to be AU as well, rather than Harry suddenly turns god mode after 5th year. Novel length would be preferred!

Thanks

The change from canon Harry to Powerful!Harry is either gradual or immediate depending on how you look at it, but it's point of departure is before 5th year, and Harry takes time to adapt to having power without being overly training montage heavy. It's also very un-shipy in that Harry just kind of staggers through his love life with about the usual level of planning exhibited by a teenager.

** Maybe The Wise One trilogy would intrigue you.

** On mobile so can't link ATM. But Taking Control is good in that it isnt cliched. And I think the ones already linked are great as well.

**** Without being too spoilery could you tell me what you mean? I'm interested in this premise but I'm not fond of overly dark stories, especially ones that are cruel/tortuous without any real reason.

** This is my favorite story bar none. It starts out a bit cliche, but turns into the best story I've read to date imo.\\
