**** It definitely will. Be prepared for no one reading your fic, and the ones that do will be very critical and not necessarily, or likely, in a constructive way.

** My inner grammar nazi compels me to tell you to look out for run-on sentences (unless they are consciously used for stylistic purposes) and to make sure to use punctuation before closing a direct quote.

Moreover, I would suggest against too small chapters. 5k is usually the norm, and anything below 2k is too little.

Won't chance a guess at who the kid and the man are, since there are no hints really, so any estimation would be a random one. Anyway, have fun with the writing of your story. That is the most important thing, after all.

*** I dont know how bad my grammar was ): And the man and the kid thing was basically just for random estimation. The kid will be a big part of the storyline i can say that much

** Formatting issues. Grammar issues. Run-on Sentences. Lack of punctuation. Weak opening. Choppy sentence structures. Have I mentioned the Grammar issues? Sudden narration time skip is bad. Show, don't tell. Learn to use names

And if you have that many problems from a snip 150? 200? words long, then I strongly suggest practicing a lot more before publishing anything. As it is, I don't consider this beta-worthy as it would require an entire rewrite from the beta to get this anywhere near readable.

*** The problem with writing is that you need the imagination, ability to tell a story and have good grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. The sad thing is, if someone amazing at the first two doesn't have the latter, they've had it without a beta. It needs work, certainly, but it's saveable. Look at linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) . The author is excellent at both storytelling and coming up with a plot, but obviously can't do shit involving English, which is apparent from the start. Then, later in the story, it becomes a frankly excellent story (although the last couple chapters are mind-fucky), either due to the fact the author improved throughout, or got a Beta. Seriously, it's impossible to put a number on how many amazing fics would be dog shit without betas.

**** I'm not saying it isn't savable. I'm saying it isn't beta-worthy.

Something savable is when the very story itself, either the plot, the character development (something integral to the story) is bad. We can't really say any of that here since it's too short.

I'm saying it isn't beta-worthy, because to get this anywhere near readable, the beta would have to rewrite the entire thing. This level of writing needs so much work the beta should be given co-authorship because they'd need to put in just as much, if not more, effort into the story.

Also, I never liked that story. I don't see what you mean by his excellent storytelling either, but that's just my opinion.

** Hey, you have an intriguing start, but I really recommend finding a beta to help you format and structure your writing to a higher quality. It would be nice to see your skills develop through fanfiction, but I think you'll need some guidance. In the mean time, read, read, read! The more you read, the better your writing will get :)

** I have 9 fics being written right now, and I have writer's block on 8 of them. None have been posted yet, even though 2 are near completion (one of those is the first of a next-gen series, like yours). Take a look at the the full picture, see if you have a plot set out, see if the story is going somewhere, see what plot points you have to make later on, and adapt the story accordingly. If you want, I'll beta your first chapter. Also, find something which has a spelling/grammar checker. Seriously.
