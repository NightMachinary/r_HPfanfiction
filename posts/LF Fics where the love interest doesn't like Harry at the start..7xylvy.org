Looking for good romance fics where the main love interest doesn't like or outright hates Harry at the start of the story, but warms up to him as time goes on.


** linkffn(Contract Invalidation; The Lies that Binds; A Fateful Walk; Fraterculus; Unatoned; A Cadmean Victory)

There's a lot more with this premise, mostly because authors like to create their own circunstances to spark the romance later on. If you didn't notice, I like Daphne, sorry if you don't.
