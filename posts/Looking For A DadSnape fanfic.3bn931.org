There's a fanfic I found, waaaaay back, where Snape was Harry's dad. He knew it, Harry knew it- everyone knew it, but Snape refused to acknowledge it. On Parents Day, Lucius took Harry along with him and Draco, citing that since Severus would look after -his- son when he couldn't, he would look after Harry when Sev -wouldn't-. For the life of me, though, I can't remember the title, or even what website it was on. I've tried searching for it, but there are a -lot- of stories with similar traits.


** Sadly, it looks like the "like no other" series will never be finished. It was getting pretty wordy, no doubt, but it was a prime example of this genre imho.

** That sounds like linkffn(In Blood Only by E.M. Snape)

It's been a while since I've read it though.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

*** I'm fairly certain it's not that one.

Lucius wasn't a nice character in that story.
