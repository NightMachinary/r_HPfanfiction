Most people thought divination was just a hoax, and people who claimed to be seers were just making up prophecies to try to change the world.

In Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall would be amused whenever people came in scared from Trelawney's class, which she believed shouldn't even exist.

Hell, inside the Department of Mysteries, being assigned to guard the Hall of Prophecies was their form of punishment, because it was mind numbingly dull, which to an Unspeakable may be classified as cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, whenever a new "prophecy" was made, and put in the Hall, it would have to be listened to, which meant the resident Unspeakable would have to listen to dozens of prophecies, probably fake, about god knows what. While the memories were erased from them, the feelings remained. /Punishment/

That being said, some people did place at least some stock. People like Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle. An interesting coincidence considering that two of the most powerful wizards in the world believed divination was real.

And believe it or not, it was. Though, it went far deeper than Dumbledore or Riddle, or anyone thought, save the seers themselves. Dumbledore and Riddle thought that prophecies would be able to either stop or aid Riddle's rise to power, respectively, so they placed faith in the belief. But both agreed, as did every other believer, that seers would enter prophecy giving state at random times, having no control over their divination power.

This was also true, to an extent. Yes, true seers could not give prophecy's whenever they wanted, but some had control over another aspect of divination, an aspect in which Sybil Trelawney was the master.

Battle Divination. It was exactly what it sounds like. It was divination that could be used in battles to predict exactly what the opponent will do every time.

Albus Dumbledore thought that he would control the direction of the world after Voldemort was gone. He thought himself to be playing the world like a fiddle.

Tom Riddle thought that he would control the direction of the world once he conquered Britain. He thought himself to be a genius in setting up himself for his conquest.

Sybil Trelawney *knew* that she would control the direction of the world. She knew exactly the prophecy she had given, and was able to recognize the opportunity. She would let Dumbledore and Voldemort make the world their playground, and when it was weakened, she would come in and take over. Her battle divination would allow her to easily defeat Voldemort or Dumbledore. Her plan was fool-proof. Not only was she impossible to beat in a fight, but no one suspected her of being able to do anything. She had been manipulating Dumbledore and Riddle since 1980.

"Soon," she thought. "Soon, the world will be ripe for picking, and I will be able to shape it in *my* image"
