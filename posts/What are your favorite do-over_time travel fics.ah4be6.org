I know a lot of people dislike them, but time travel fics are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. Especially fics with unconventional time travel in them that mix up the over used tropes that we're all pretty familiar with.


** I like time travels that throw away the "time line" completely:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories and power to her two years old self. Voldemort was easily taken care of, but that was the easy part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. After a slow start, things looked up until an accident hit. This is my favorite time travel fic, and the characterization of Bellatrix is excellent.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He did well and remained in character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Luna raised Tom Riddle, who still couldn't escape the fate of becoming a dark lord. But he would at least have Luna at his side this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly, but had to fit in this new reality.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV, and she wasn't paired with anyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Time traveling Harry killed them all again, but without getting kids involved. Hermione wasn't too happy though when she found out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Time traveling Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan killed most of them even before going back to Hogwarts, and also did the Goblins in soon after. But they were unable to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix became very impressed.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.

  Time has passed - he's married, even has two kids - and Ron had thought he was done with the past. Unfortunately, the past isn't done with him. Suddenly Ron finds himself back in August, 1994...in his 14-year-old body. Even worse, his 14-year-old self is still there, and the two of them - or technically, the four of them - don't always agree on what to do... Rated T, for Language.

** Here are my three all time favs: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][the Adventures of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited by michaelsuave]] Harry finds out his whole life was a video game when he does in DH and has to go all the way back to the beginning. He goes mad trying to be the best.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8462437/chapters/19386787][This is gonna be good by Gstarshine]] features femharry/Weasley twins and HP/Marvel Crossover. Harry who has a Phoenix animagus goes back in time while dying and rebuilds her family kill those who killed her and her loved ones.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14469255/chapters/33426591][Let's Try Again by DayDreamer315]] Lots of slash but if you are okay with that it features a much better run Hogwarts and Ministry of Magic.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) You've probably read this one but adding it for prosperity. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]) Harry fuses with past lockhart Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]) Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN *silently weeps*"

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
