Let's take quills vs pens as an example. Thousands of years ago, everyone wrote with plain, unenchanted quills. They worked somewhat, but they couldn't write very much until you had to dip it in an ink pot again and they broke really easily because thin keratin isn't exactly the most durable substance.

Let's examine how people solved these issues:

Wizards still write with quills today, but they solved both the ink capacity and the durability issues by adding enchantments that do exactly that. This results in quills that are quite good writing instruments.

Muggles don't have access to enchantments so their solution, the fountain pen, is basically a replica of the nib of a quill but made out of metal to solve the durability issue, and with a large reservoir for ink inside the pen to solve the ink capacity issue. This also results in good, usable writing instruments.

If we generalize and look at other examples, we can see a general rule: When wizards need something to do something, they usually take an existing device that's closest to what's needed and add enchantments to improve it until the problem is solved. Enchanted quills for writing, enchanted candles for light, enchanted flying carriages for transport, et cetera.

Muggles don't have enchantments so they generally have to go back to the drawing board and create a new, more complicated and sophisticated device. Pens made of metal for writing, light bulbs for light, airplanes for transport.

The wizarding approach has the advantage that it's really easy and straightforward. Magic is great, most issues can be solved with a single enchantment.

The muggle approach takes a lot more effort to solve problems, but thanks to the much higher population and therefore much higher number of talented problem-solvers we can afford complicated solutions.

Things get interesting when you consider how this affects economics. In the wizarding world, most items are quite simple in design, a good enchanter can create almost anything needed by himself. In the muggle world, it takes thousands of people just for the supply chain needed to make a toaster. However, economics of scale are on the side of the muggles: When the supply chain is there and you make them by the thousands, even incredibly complicated devices with thousands of parts are affordable. Wizards have incredibly complicated devices too, but they are usually very valuable artifacts and not mass produced commodity items because you can't build a robot to enchant something. The most sophisticated mass produced items we know of are brooms, which are actually quite close to muggle items in that they are mass produced by companies, but they're still made in very low volume due to a small market which limits how cost effective they can be made.

Wizarding items are either simple and nonmagical like parchment, thus dirt cheap because they can be duplicated with magic, or relatively simple and enchanted like quills and a bit more expensive because someone has to enchant each and every unit produced, complicated and magical and very expensive even if they are mass produced like brooms because there is little automation, or very complicated and completely unique artifacts because whoever made it only made one.

Wizards don't do complicated nonmagical items, because it's easier to use magic than to design a complicated device, even though complicated nonmagical is where mass production really drives down cost thanks to automation, which is why you can afford the millions of transistors you need to read this text.

If someone could come up with a magical machine that could apply complicated enchantments as easily as a photolithographic machine can turn bits of silicon into computer chips at a rapid rate, then it'd be possible to create much more sophisticated magical items with hundreds of enchantments, as complex as the most incredible artifacts, at a very affordable price.


** This is really well thought out and makes a lot of sense. Do you see the wizarding world ever reaching this?

*** It'd be fun to explore how a new invention could completely change the dynamic of power in the world though. There would be political opposition for sure, but would that be enough to stop an economical revolution?

The raw materials in a Firebolt aren't that expensive, just a bit of wood that can probably be duplicated magically. The expensive part is dozens of enchantments that need to be done by very skilled professionals, and R&D money. If you had a printing press for enchantments, and knowledge about the enchantments themselves, you could churn out Firebolts at a per-unit cost of practically nothing.

Same goes for practically every other magical item. Raw materials can be duplicated (except for gold, probably), muggle machines or transfiguration can be used to bring them in the right shape, and enchantments can be stamped on. You could churn out Goblets of Fire by the millions if you knew how the original was made. Only cost is R&D and setting up the assembly line.

How would the magical world react to someone selling incredibly sophisticated magical items like super-brooms, omnioculars, communication mirrors, magic maps (a map of your surroundings that keeps track of people around you could be very useful for aurors, think mini-map from video games), flying cars (with some improvement, FTL-capable and with interstellar navigation system), all dirt cheap?

It'd be very OP but also very interesting to write about.

**** Perhaps a middle ground of using Muggle manufacturing techniques in addition to enchantments would be interesting. For example, the lightbulb: say you purchased Muggle mass-produced empty glass bulbs and magically modified (i.e. doesn't need electricity or something) a Muggle machine for some aspects of assembly. And then for the filaments,instead of using Muggle tungsten, you used enchanted gold wire (maybe not Goblin wrought as they have different ideas about ownership and would object to mass production of their work), which has it's own self-contained everlasting power source and only needs replacing once in a great while of ever, as the magic imbued in it would prevent shorts or the wire wearing out.

So, you have a wizard lightbulb -- a safety light without dripping wax -- using enchanted wire, Muggle-made glass, and assembly line techniques. The product lasts a very long time with the Muggle glass only needing replacement if it gets broken or gets burnt spots (like Muggle lightbulbs sometimes get), but the individual purchaser could prolong the life of the glass by adding an Impervious charm to the surface or something. And of course, everyone would want at least half a dozen each. There would be a small spike in the market and then it would taper off into a steady business of repairs and occasional manufacturing batches.

*** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  One of the reasons I like magic so much is because you, as an author, can choose to limit mass production capabilities while allowing a civilization to create powerful objects.
#+end_quote

But that makes no sense. Consider how complex even simple animals are. How many different cells, neurons and everything even a simple spell creates. And you can transfigure that by year three. Canon transfiguration also seems permanent.

So even an average wizard should be able to mass-produce almost everything (with the exception of things which are made out of gold or are food).

***** But to some degree, even that ought to be possible. We never get much on enchanting, but IF it is rune based, transfiguration should do the trick. Or even just to speed up the production of the things you want to enchant.

Also, an assembly line style of manufacturing would speed up production by a lot, even if it would make the job a lot duller. For example, someone just enchants the same kind of twig with the same spell again and again while the next person works on the handle and a third one puts the broom together.

****** I can't remember if it comes from canon or fanon, but there was that theory that said that enchantment are hard because it takes a very skilled wizard to make the enchantment stick together.

Like, applying one spell to an item (like a glowing ring for example) is easy, but if you try to add several spells to the same item, they may be interfering with each other, and the difficulty increase with each new enchantment. So, if we were to take the firebolt as an example, it is not manufactured by enchanting each individual twig and then puting the broom together, but rather by first crafting the broom, and then having a very talented person making every enchantment on it alone.

*** I think this is one of the places that anime outshines traditional western sci-fi or fantasy. It is I afraid to set the base limit and upper limit of what it's powers can produce, however, this generally means that anime is almost exclusively made of soft magic systems.

*** There's a book called Master of the Five Magics that takes a look at industrial magic. The main character apprentices with a Master Alchemist (basically potions). However there's no real money at the 'mom & pop' level. Most people are happy with the inferior, but much cheaper mass produced option. The competition uses a sweatshop like assembly line to sell in bulk.

Meanwhile enchanters can sell their indestructible swords and armor for astronomical prices. However they're so difficult to make, it takes the entire enchanters guild years to produce one.

** The problem with magical society is that they peak too early. If the magic fluctuates significantly from time to time it's easy for them to plunge into dark ages because their entire previous technology accumulation was based on the strong magic which no longer exists now . The Song of Fire and Ice is a prime example for this. It's true magic solve a problem better and faster than muggle technology in earlier stages. But if magic no longer develops,it will no longer be at advantage in comparison with muggle technology which does steadily evolve and improve from the lowly place it started from. The size of magic population might be to blame. However,it's unlikely to be the only reason for the stagnant of magic development.

** Neat analysis.

I can't think of a single canon device that bestows enchantment onto another thing. I think cursed items like Draco's Necklace and Gaunt ring in book 6 can count as enchanting an item to pass on an enchantment, but they're shown to be single-use.

Horcrux have some persistent ability to influence/curse whomever they're exposed to, so maybe you could make a enchanting printer if you did a little soul magic.

I assume potions can be brewed at scale, since they're finished by the cauldron. But potions are not explored much in canon.

*** Potions can be manufactured at scale, but I think some of the ingredients (especially parts of magical creatures) might not be that easily mass produced. A common theme in fics where muggles find out about magic is that muggles want mass produced potions, because of course they want cures to all diseases if they find out that they exist, but there just aren't enough magical creatures and plants around to supply much more than the existing magical community.

** Taking this a step further, the logical next level would be enchanting these "advanced" muggle devices - unbreakable, ever-full ballpoint pens, flying cars that repair themselves if damaged, apparating buses that squeeze unseen through traffic, a floo network based on flashbangs (for emergency situations and wizards who can't apparate nor make portkeys)

The step after that would be working with the muggles, then - using enchantment where mundanities fail, using mundanities where enchantment fails. Artificial gravity on a starship, inertial dampening in fast-moving vehicles, interstellar transport through wizard space-fuckery.

Who looks at complicated muggle technology (Knight Bus, Hogwarts Express, even MoM phone booth) and decides whether it's right for enchanting?

Arthur even has his car as an example / testbed. Was he involved in the creation of the Knight Bus, etc?

Is he secretly evaluating how phone networking improvements can be leveraged to improve the floo network or something?

Lots of scope for ideas there!

*** Exactly what I was thinking! Using magic to make otherwise almost possible engineering challenges possible could allow for revolutionary breakthroughs. I think it'd totally be possible to build thousands of "fusion reactors" around the world that actually run on magic everlasting fire, emission free and with practically no running cost = free energy for the world and absolutely bonkers profits.
