** It would explain why most of those who get the position are either incompetent or somehow related to the dark. There's no way "I know all" Dumbledore didn't know or at least suspect about Volde-Quirrell and Fake-Moody. There's no way he thought Lockhart was anywhere close to competent. Umbridge was placed by the Ministry and Dumbledore put her in the cursed position.

Lupin, Snape, and Fake-Moody were good teachers but Dumbledore knew Lupin was a werewolf and wouldn't last longer than a year, he knew Snape was going to kill him by the end of the year, and Moody only agreed to the one year even before Barty took his place.

I doubt there was a great deal of DADA teachers that Dumbledore cared whether they lived or died before Harry started either. So I can definitely see "Greater Good" Dumbledore cursing the position...
