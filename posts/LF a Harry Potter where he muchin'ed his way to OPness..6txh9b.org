What it says on the title. A fic where Harry took advantage from HP verse magic system's vagueness to go almighty. He doesn't need to be GOD-like but some degree of OPness is a must. Stealing peoples magic via confundus-magical contract, experimenting with rituals, runes, potions or etc. is welcome. Crossovers are also on the table.

Something like this exists in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118965/1/Always-Read-the-Fine-Print][Always Read the Fine Print]]; Harry devises a way to take a tiny amount of magic from lots and lots of people to make himself super powerful for the Triwizard Tournament.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
