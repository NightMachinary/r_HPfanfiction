I know the whole "summary is just a quote from the story" thing is a massive red flag as far as fic quality goes, but this one's an exception.

I disagree. Between from the incredibly awful formatting for speech, the 'everyone's-an-idiot-especially-Ron' plus 'everyone-thinks-Harry's-a-witty-genius' tropes that are not only boring but also incredibly overused, and the fact that there are at least half a dozen idiot balls in the first chapter alone, I'd rate this as a very poor story overall.

**** I agree, it reads like a poorly written crack fic. The author thinks that they are making Harry smart and independent while in reality they are making him and everyone else sound and act like a complete idiots.

*** I really hope this fulfills the office space vibe it gives off.

/edit/ Couldn't even get through the first chapter.

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.
