This was a lot more popular a couple of years back... and most are really interesting. Unfortunately, a lot of them have been abandoned.

Recently was very intrigued (due to the lack of anything new in the genre) with the idea and am planning on writing fic taking this angle. But when I actually stood back and looked at my outline---well there's just so much that could go wrong.

It's a massive project considering the Pandora's box that you would be opening. Seriously, the mythology, international magical laws, species and culture are hard enough to wrap your head around ... then basically adding Harry and keeping him in character?? It's daunting.

What are things to avoid? Suggestions?

Would love to hear your thoughts.


** Outside influences are what make people the people they are. If you send Harry to Durmstrang, he'd trend dark. If you send him to Beauxbaton, he'd likely trend to wear a fancier shoe.

The whole point of an AU is to take all these outside influences and show how they affect Harry, how he's different without Ron and Hermione.

One I quite liked was a James Spookie story I believe, where everyone thought he was dead but Riddle put him in the twt to get him in his grasp. Though admittedly I only read it once years ago.

*** That James Spookie story was actually a canon rehash centered on which girl Harry would end up with. Seriously.

** Well, it should be obvious considering what you wrote, but make sure that Harry isn't out of character and that any changes that happen to him are organic changes (as in, caused by something the readers can see in the plot and that they think could make those changes happen). Because if you don't do that then instead of being a story about Harry attending another school it will be a story about how much Hogwarts sucks, and needless to say “Hogwarts bashing” is ... well, probably not a good thing.

To add to that, don't make important people comment “obviously their laws are shit” or stuff like that about the British ministry. Yes, we do know that at least some parts of it are not very functional at the time they are seen in the books, but when someone belonging to another ministry or something equally as important speaks about a foreign (British in this case) ministry, there is something called “political correctness” and there also is the thing about not wanting to be deemed to arrogant to let rule (and people like Skeeter are a thing) so realistically nobody would go on a rant about how much a foreign ministry sucks unless they'd gotten formally involved, by the request of that other ministry, in fixing those many problems.

** Yes, putting a canon character in a different situation requires an adjustment to his/her characterization. viol8er is right about that, though I wouldn't really expect the most obvious sign of Harry attending Beauxbatons to be his fancy new shoes. I may be wrong, in that case I'd love to read a story like that ;)

For a writer, the most challenging thing is likely building a new and possibly entirely separate society, all the while doing it in a way that doesn't clash with any information we know from canon. For Durmstrang and Beauxbatons at least there are some details to work with and let them guide you, but what if you want to create your own fictional school?

If you're adding a new one within the British isles (like the story "... and the Irish Choice" did), why was nothing about it ever mentioned in the books or movies? Why does one get the impression from canon that there is, at most, one school per country, if even that? Why would Hogwarts be called "the best school of wizardry in Great Britain" in canon if it's the only one? Wouldn't it then also have to be the worst too?

Once an author starts with his own school, in most cases outside of Europe - the US being a prime candidate with the country's potentially larger readership originating there - it works mostly along the lines of inserting a canon character in your very original setting that is guided along a basic framework. You should respect the way magic works in the Harry Potter fandom, you should keep in mind the international references being made in canon (the ICW, quidditch being the most popular sport, etc) but otherwise you're left entirely on your own.

I personally quite like bellerophon's epic where Harry switches schools and starts a whole new life for himself in the US of A. It does all the must-have things right and it is not too outlandish as far as original wizarding societies go. Some others, Snow Point immediately comes to mind, are to me pure "in-name-only" stories and I abhor these with a passion.

*** I agree with that. The basic/standards of the Canon magical laws should apply. Magic shouldn't come differently in a different country due to the ICW.

There needs to be more investigation on Harry's part to understand the culture and practices--while still having a basis of certain magical laws.

This project is massive and I need to be consistent in small details and subplots.

** What I hate most about this "genre" if you want to call it that, is when there is just nothing going on at the new school.

Hogwarts was magical. From the talking portraits and moving staircases, to the horrors that called its dungeons their home. It got an animagus Transfiguration teacher, an evil potions master, a half-goblin charms teacher, a batshit crazy Divination teacher and Albus Dumbledore, powerful wizard and almost cliche in his getup as such. There were ghosts and a homicidal willow, a giant squid and mermen. There was an enchanted forest with centaurs and giant spiders, a half-giant gamekeeper who had a love for creatures that ripped Heros to shreds in other tales.

I get angry when I then read about a Salem Institute that is basically a american highschool with classes for magic. Period. Thats it.

Magical schools, in my mind, must be extraordinary. Complying with the safety standards of the respective Ministry of Education does not a magical school make.

*** I'm pretty sure that Hogwarts has safety standards too, they just aren't followed very rigidly (or at all). Can you imagine all those influential pure-bloods in the ministry and on the board of governors putting their precious children in a school that's dangerous to the point of possibly serious injuries or even death? That's what happened every year during Harry's attendance.

Although the school appears to be largely outside of ministerial sphere of influence, that's in part due to Dumbledore's standing in the community. When it suits them, outsiders can and will take action within Hogwarts and there's nothing any of the staff can do against it, therefore some kind of legal framework must exist which allows them to act.

The wizarding world may look vastly illogical and very exciting to a non-magically raised Harry Potter, and there's no doubt that his time there has been extraordinary, but any successful society with its own economy must have some rules that allows them to function properly. You can't tell me there's nothing of the sort, when you hear Percy Weasley drone on about something as banal as cauldron thickness.

Another point is the venue itself. Hogwarts is a castle out of another time. Back when it was built by the founders, apparently in the year 993 AD going by the unofficial wiki, the world and society was completely different and the wizarding world would not be separated from the non-magical population for many hundred years. In comparison, the oldest public school in the US is the Boston Latin School, which was founded in 1635 in the same state as Salem. What are 350 years in a school built by immigrants against one thousand years of history in a magical castle built by the preeminent figures of their time?

**** See? *SEE?*

That is exactly what I do not care about. Your logic ruins it all.

While your reasoning is sound, as a reader I simply do not care about it. I want to read about the fantastical side of the wizarding world, not its bureaucracy and laws.

In Salem I want there to be a vegetarian Wendigo as housekeeper who gets angry at air draft because his heart is frozen and wind makes it worse, because why not? I want the students in Mahoutokoro to play pranks on the Oni of the neighbouring woods and an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaname][Akaname]] spirit for keeping the toilets clean. Castelobruxo should have a huge [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl][feathered Serpent]] as its librarian and the students go on wild treasure hunts for El Dorado during free periods.

And so on and so forth.

***** Both of you make valid points. There needs to be an exploration of different cultures of magical society--while certain basic laws should still apply.

Think about it, the magical UK society is heavily built on secrecy. While the US do allow certain muggles to have the knowledge of magic.

For example, if Harry went to a school in Brazil or something, he would have a different set of rules to follow. Maybe the school wouldn't be boarding, then he also needs to get integrated into the culture of Brazil itself. And, different creatures based on what are common myths in that area.

Honestly, there's so little known about magical schooling that I think it's kinda difficult to assume that Hogwarts is the oldest and greatest school around. There could be minor school all over the world with just as eccentric personality but far older. Or there could be schools that keep a level of secrecy even from magical society--almost like an elitist group.

I love the idea of exploring the magical world based on present history and mythology.

Just imagine, a japanese magical school where there are different yokai attending school? Or even spirits. Where people travel using umbrellas or "clouds".

Or a school called in the ocean (or something to the effect) that's completely separated. You could have underwater classes-- sirens teaching you illusionary magic, mermaids teaching you languages of different creatures. There's just so much you can do.

  That is exactly what I do not care about. Your logic ruins it all. We like different types of stories then, that's cool. It also helps an author get an idea for the kind of audience he will have to live with, because writing to one end of the spectrum is going to make one part love and the other hate (him or) it.

I can see your side too. There's no reason why fantasy can't be fantastical like you've shown in your comment. If you ever get around to writing about this vegetarian Wendigo, look me up because I do enjoy good humor like that :)

That said, my previous posts were geared primarily toward the author and not the reader. When you start to write your own story and borrow another person's fandom to do that, you need to have an understanding of how that existing world works. To me this means not only the obvious things that are mentioned in books, movies or other official sources but also the deeper mechanics and any implications built upon that.

A good author writes fanfiction and gets the characters right, a great author can meld his own ideas (original characters but also new settings and ideas) with the source and make it work. I'm reinterpreting here, but I read a sentence just like that once before and thought it would fit here.

*** I think people can easily get lost in bashing vs exploring and explaning flaws.

While I have read a few bashing fics and can see where people do come from--they just exaggerate it far too much.

There are obviously going to differences in schools and their teaching style. Just think about the difference of private and public schools. What needs to happen is an exploration of the magical society itself.

This is soooo difficult. There needs to be consistency and proper explanations.

Also, if Harry does go to a different school does not mean that he would be interested in pursing a relationship with someone from Hogwarts. Especially, if he does leave it at that age. Think about it, if you ever switched schools as a kid/teenager---chances are you had very little contact with them. That's long distance and they're so young.

That's not to say something can't happen later down the road. I would expect Harry to be more focused on the new school.
