  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, and now the wizarding world is safe, right? Wrong. Betrayal, and secrets kept since his birth cause Harry to flee for his life, and run smack dab into his own destiny.

  Starts at end of 5th year, AU from there. What happens when Veela are Soul Bonded? Harry is about to find out. And maybe, just maybe, he'll get what he needs to survive as well. Response to Surprise on Privet Drive Challenge.

**** Thanks for that. I could find one where Harry was a veela, but none where he is paired with Fleur as well.

***** Harry as a veela is actually quite common: the issue is that it's primarily a slash prompt.

Aside from a few stories (all linked above, as far as I can tell), it's typically Malfoy, Lucius, or Snape having Harry, as their "mate", taking it up the pooper.
