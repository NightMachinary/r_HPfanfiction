** Daphne definitely has traits of it in the popular one-shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/1/Ice-Cream][Ice Cream]]

I also inadvertently gave Daphne some of my ASD traits in Scrambled Sorting, one of my fics. An excerpt from an upcoming chapter...

#+begin_quote
  "I wouldn't have taken you for the sort of girl who's afraid of bugs." Hermione said.

  "I'm not afraid of bugs; I just don't like them. I'm fine with the multiple eyes and multiple legs, but the sounds their joints make as they walk makes my skin crawl." She squinched her eyes shut and covered her ears with her hands. "Ugh, I'm feeling gross just thinking about it."

  Harry had realised pretty early on in their friendship that Daphne seemed to process certain sensations differently than most people. There were certain foods she refused to touch, and she was incredibly picky about the material and cut of her clothing. Harry couldn't relate, but it was easy enough to get used to; after all, he was pretty sure that all of his friends, himself included, were strange in some way or another. If anything, it was kind of a relief to have some oddness in his life after spending the better part of a decade in the oppressively normal neighbourhood of Little Whinging.

It's mainly not about autism, but the part with Snape is the best description I've seen.

It's an SI-OC fic, but one of the rare good ones.

** Harry isn't labeled autistic in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic][Harry Potter, Geek of Magic]] but he has a distinctive personality.

** Different not Defective: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1009469]]

I have a few other oneshot length ones on my bookmark list, but foolishly I subscribed to lots of fics without bookmarking and now can't navigate them easily.

Edit: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/254530]]

This one had it in the title. Only thing I will say is that I don't remember quality
