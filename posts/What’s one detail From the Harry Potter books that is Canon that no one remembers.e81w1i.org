** When Sirius Black first arrived in Godric's Hollow he asked Hagrid to give him his godson, and was refused. He didn't originally plan on a revenge spree, his #1 priority was Harry, and only his respect and trust in Dumbledore kept him from grabbing the boy and going. People who use 'irresponsible godfather went to kill pettigrew instead of caring for his godson' as a plot point in fics always forget that, are wrong, and they can fight me bc Sirius is the best.

**** That makes no sense. Hagrid and Sirius were comrades. Potters were just attacked by Voldemort, Death Eaters were still around, including the traitor Pettigrew.

What did you expect him to do? Duel a fellow Order member, one of the only people in the world he can really trust, in front of his recently traumatized infant godson? While Death Eaters are lurking, no one yet knows what the fuck just happened, and Hagrid can take Harry to Hogwarts, the safest place in Britain? In hindsight, yes, it would be much better for everyone involved if Sirius insisted on taking Harry. But how the hell was he supposed to know that Dumbledore would send Harry to live in an abusive household, while he was thrown into Azkaban without trial?

******* In the fics I've read which used this trope the "mudblood" carving on Hermione's skin is a curse scar, so it could never completely heal and I doubt muggle methods would help.

The Cruciatus is terrible, but ultimately the pain is temporary. The human mind has built-in coping mechanisms to eventually dull the memory of such trauma. The horror of the curse scar is that no matter whether Hermione escapes and goes on to live a healthy, happy life she will never entirely be rid of the reminder of her time as a victim and what was done to her.

  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time --- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

A couple lines later it's confirmed that Dumbledore had suspected this for quite some time:

#+begin_quote
  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

  “And you knew this? You knew --- all along?”

  “I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.

Her relationship with Harry and Ron are fucking awful throughout the whole book, and considering those are basically her only two friends that's kinda a big deal. She also was certainly not right about Malfoy, who she claimed to be innocent of pretty much everything he was guilty of, to the point she was ignoring any evidence Harry gave her. She also wasn't right about the book, outside correctly figuring out that Eileen Prince was Snape's mum. Hermione's jealousness is what caused her to hate that book, nothing else. And despite Harry stupidly using a spell he never tested more than once which led to him nearly killing Malfoy accidentally, Snape's book definitely helped the group more than hurt. It straight up saved Ron's life, and the Felix won by Harry due to it both got the horcrux and number thereof confirmation and likely saved the students who fought when the Death Eaters broke into Hogwarts at the end of the book. And I'd say getting Ron was a mistake too, but that's just personal preference.

After all, Ron and Lavender break up because Ron keeps saying Hermione's name when sick, even though she has been a total ass to him for months. She literally wins, despite what she does.

As for the book, she was right that the book was dangerous and they shouldn't be learning from it. The Felix would have been won BY HERMIONE if Harry hadn't used the book and with her personality, would have been the one to give it to them when they needed the horcrux information and the battle. Nothing would have changed. Ron's life was saved by Harry knowing that a bozar could cure poisons, which we've known for a while, not just from the book (if i am remembering correctly).

This is what I mean she is perfect in terms of character building. She is there as a mouth piece for the author by the end.

I'm sure that Ron believed Harry, even Hermione says so. So he is just an immature boy whose ego didn't allow him to apologize until there was a proper "good" reason.

In the movies it's even worse, because Ron KNEW it was dragons.

I don't really have a problem with how he acted in book 4 (an immature teenager, happens), but when it's repeating it becomes a character trait, and one that I can't accept.

Ron doesn't believe that. He hears that the Tournament is safe now, he hears Harry literally say that if he could figure a way to enter himself, he'd like to participate, and he sees Fred and George try it and get silly beards. Then he hears Harry's name get called, and instead of obviously not being allowed to compete, the Chosen One gets exactly what he said he wanted.

Like Fred and George, who tried the exact same thing. When you do the same thing an attention seeker tried and failed, but you succeed, then you can't blame people for thinking you're an attention seeker. Harry didn't try this, but Ron has no reason to believe that. The plot to endanger Harry was insanely convoluted by any standard - it doesn't make sense. Ron is absolutely right to believe that trying something under Dumbledore's watchful eye is nearly impossible.

** Witch-hunting and burning in the medieval ages was mostly pointless and largely unsuccessful. A lot of people seem to think wizards went into hiding because muggles were driving them to extinction or something.

#+begin_quote
  Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, ‘Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless --- discuss.'

  /Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises./

**** Some wizards /were/ killed, so I suppose it's not entirely correct to say the muggles were /completely/ unsuccessful. But there's really nothing to suggest that muggles were a serious danger to the general wizarding population. They certainly weren't able to wipe wizards out as so many fanfiction authors pretend.

Rowling says the wizarding world's biggest tragedy when it came to witch hunts were the Salem Witch Trials. Nineteen were killed in those, and only /some/ were actual wizards. If that's the biggest blow muggles dealt to wizards, then I'm staying confident in my argument that the Statute of Secrecy was put in place out of irritation, not genuine fear that muggles would wipe them out.

Just take a look at Chapter 1 one of Half-Blood Prince. Even with modern muggles, wizards still do whatever they want. They waltz into the Prime Minister's office whenever they want, however they want, infiltrate the muggle government with absurd ease, and fuck around with the muggle leaders of other countries.

Muggles were a threat in the same way animals are threats to us. While they /can/ kill us, especially our children or if we're unprepared, we're obviously still vastly superior. We can literally wipe out entire species. We /have/. Despite that, though, we still board up our home to make sure that not even squirrels can get in.

***** It'd also depend on surprise, though. Most wizards/witches need their wand to be able to cast spells - if that got taken off of them when they weren't ready, there's no way to do anything. We also don't exactly know how much certain magic improved over time - were the spells used for infiltration as powerful/easy/well known back then?

It's also unclear exactly how the wizarding population was distributed at the time. Did they tend to live within muggle populations/isolated from each other? Did they mostly congregate in magical communities? Etc, etc. If it's the former case, muggles would be far more dangerous than you're implying - for every magical person, there's hundreds of muggles out there, and the magical skill of the average wizard/witch could be pretty low. Low enough that they might not have been able to handle getting away from 20-30 muggles on their own, depending on the spells available.

So even if most wizards could get away if they had their wands, that still leaves a large number from their already small population vulnerable (children, weak wizards, etc) even without the chance that they'd immediately be stripped of their wand. The scale of the threat is vague enough that fanfiction can easily take it either way without really breaking canon in my view - towards it being an inconvenience or a big threat.

Hermione /does/ make the potion perfectly and the book says it will last exactly an hour, which it does.

And again, with the fake Moody:

#+begin_quote
  “You see his hair . . .” Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”

Polyjuice last exactly an hour. Period.

Dumbledore was not avoiding the Minister for Magic. He was just not telling Rufus certain things, that's all. From Half-Blood Prince:

#+begin_quote
  /“Please don't leave on my account,” said Dumbledore courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.”/
#+end_quote

They also did not use magic during the 7 Potters thing. Moody actually points out that they can't use magic around Harry.

#+begin_quote
  /“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters./

** I wracked my brain to think of ones that were small moments but likely forgotten:

1. Luna Lovegood becomes quidditch commentator after Lee Jordan is gone.

2. Fleur Delacour wins Molly's respect after she stands up to her following Bill being attacked by Fenrir Greyback and declares her loyalty and love to him.

3. When Fred and George were hitting Quirrell in the back of the turban with snowballs in the 1st book, they were actually hitting Voldemort in the face.

4. The vanishing cabnet that gets repaired by Malfoy is the same one that Peeves drops at the insistance of Nearly Headless Nick to help save Harry from Filtch in Chamber of Secrets.

5. This one is not one of my own, but is one I have read about and its more an interesting fact. When Trelawney enters the Great Hall during Christmas dinner in Prisoner of Azkaban, she counts 12 people sitting down and says... "If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when 13 dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!". However there was another person at the table in Peter Pettigrew in the form of Scabbers at the time. As such, the 13th person to rise was actually Dumbledore when he did so to greet Trelawney. He then is the first to die out of the people at the table in the series.

**** Lol and if she put it in the books then there's people complaining about how she forced it in. There was no reason for Harry to find that out.

I don't get this shit. Gay characters are allowed to exist without their sexuality being pointed out. Only reason we even know Dumbledore is gay is because a fan asked her about it when she was answering questions, so she answered it and then moved on to other questions.

One of the things I really hate about the internet is how they'll take a random answer to a question /someone was asked/ and try to pretend they really came out from behind curtains to announce it.

JKR didn't come out of nowhere with it. She was asked by a fan in 2007 about it and she answered. Phrasing it like "she waited until the series was finished before announcing it" is dishonest bullshit.

However, the real kicker is that even among those that can do it, the use of a patronus to communicate over distances is not a universally known trait, but rather was specifically invented by Dumbledore, and is exclusive to the Order of the Phoenix.
