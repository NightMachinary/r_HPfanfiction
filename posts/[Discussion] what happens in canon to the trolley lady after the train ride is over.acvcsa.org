*** This was my answer. She either owns or works in a shop and relocates to the Express six days a "year".

****** I don't think I've ever seen anyone here refer to it as canon, it sort of assumes the books in my mind. You certainly won't find cursed child high up in my canon hierarchy lol

******* I believe Rowling said it was canon or something. I'm in agreement though that in the hierarchy of canon it's very, very low down. So low down that it's practically buried six feet down. However, it seemed to make the most sense as a reason to question what happens to the trolley lady (in the Cursed Child she turns out to have been on the train since it was first stolen from the Muggles and has knives for fingernails or something of the sort).

******** Personally I think it is better to ignore everything J. K. Rowling has said about the franchise after the last book was published. But maybe that is just me.

********** That's ... wow. I do understand treating the Pottermore stuff as canon at least to a degree because some of it actually doesn't contradict anything and can be fun to play with, and I always knew that Cursed Child is a wretched work that doesn't really qualify as canon unless you gouge out your eyes and only then take a look at it, but adding such a pointless thing for ... I can't even think of a reason, just highlights how much of a nonsense it is.

That said, it's not like I could have seen the stage play so I can't judge it based on the entertainment value of the play proper.
