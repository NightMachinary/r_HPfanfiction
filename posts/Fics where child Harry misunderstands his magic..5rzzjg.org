I read a fic the other day where Harry thinks his magic is bending and that he is the Aavatar.

There's also that other fic where he thinks he's an elf and carries magic stones around.

Are there any other funny fics like these where Harry doesn't understand what his magic is and comes up with an alternative theory?

  A surprising discovery leads Harry to question the fine line between normality and the supernatural. Drawing inspiration from the generation's brightest minds, he seeks to answer the proverbial question. Is he a mutant or some sort of humanoid alien? Status: Complete.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** linkffn(5846162) has Harry thinking his magic's chakra (/a la/ Naruto). He ends up, via accidental magic, giving himself a real chakra network and devotes his life to being a ninja - and a good one, not a Naruto-esque flamboyant ninja.

It's a good fic, though it gets weird (in the Lovecraftian sense) midway through. It is very much dead, but still worth a read.
