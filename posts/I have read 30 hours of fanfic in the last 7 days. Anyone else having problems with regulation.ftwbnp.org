I'm in a slump. I started reading a 377,000 word last night at around 10ish. I was so into finishing it I stayed up until 7am reading it. Then I had 3 hours of sleep and upon waking my first thing to do was to carry on reading. I then continued to read today until I finished it maybe half an hour ago. All in all, I spent 17 hours reading it.

I hate this. I forgot how addicting it was to fall back into old habits. I used to use fanfic as a coping mechanism and would only ever read super long fics and get emotionally attached to them. I was doing okay as of late because I was just reading around 40k words, but my sleep schedule is really fucked up rn with the virus and it's all I can do not to read.

Please tell me I'm not the only one. Have any of you struggled with this? It might just be my oddly obessive personality (I'm on the autistic spectrum - my therapist was in the process of diagnosing me but- corona) or just my bookworm self... Now that I think about it, I've always been so overly obsessive with books, reading and reading into the night and for hours on end. I didn't really start getting worried until like, one or years ago, but nowhere did I find any mention of it. Sorry this turned into a rant. Advice?


** You're not the only one. Every once in a while I'll fall into a similar rut, whether it's fanfiction or binging a show.

For times like you describe, something that usually works for me is just telling myself that it's just stories and the reason I enjoy them so much is because I get to put myself in interesting and crazy situations. It's fun. Really fun.

But we live in a world with so many interesting and crazy things that are /actually/ happening and that we can probably share with others (or not). Ever wanted to learn how to draw? Look up some tutorials and start. Always wanted to learn a new language? Download Duolingo and start.

Feeling lonely and isolated in quarantine? Text some friends and set up a video chat. Play videogames to get some social interaction if that's easier.

Still want the experience of reading a story? Get a history (audio)book and start. There's some crazy shit that's really happened that will probably be just as absurd as the HP world.

That kind of thing. Just remind yourself that the "real world" has plenty of fantastic things to devote your time to, and there's no rush to do them. Sleep and sleep early if feel you need to. All those things will still be there when you wake up.

This mindset helps me be get my head out of stories and be more present. Sorry, this got a little deep for a fanfiction subreddit, but I hope it helps you or anyone else with similar binging issues.

*** Thanks a lot! Tbh my post was a little deep in the first place ðŸ˜…

I think that's a great approach, actually. I do a lot of drawing in my spare time already but taking up another new, interesting hobby will probably help a lot. I think that a lot of my problems stem from when I'm reading, I'll tell myself that reading is good for you. And it is, actually, I guess, in moderation though. Fanfiction itself helps people build their own opinion on different aspects of life, in a juvenile way, because so many people love to project their thoughts, views, emotions and problems onto their characters, things that might get censored or wouldn't be the focus of a traditionally published novel. And this, and the familiarity of the characters and world intigrated into every day life, is what makes it so much more intriguing and raw.

Wow. Okay this deep view of fanfic is totally a product of my three-hours-of-sleep 1:30am post long fanfiction mood. And yes, that is a very relevant thing.

Thanks for taking the time to respond so throughly!

** One thing not enough people are talking about is that we're all living through a devastating global pandemic. It's okay to not be as productive, or to fall back into comforting patterns.

A lot of people in my life don't seem to understand that there's nothing wrong with feeling anxious or really tired during this time. Just because you mightn't be directly affected right now doesn't mean the entire situation doesn't suck for absolutely everyone. Nobody can function at 100% and the expectation that we should be fine is so unfair.

That said, you might look into forming a more consistent routine with less time for fan fiction. A proper sleep schedule is really important to your overall health and you don't want to fall behind with necessary life stuff. Could you try restricting yourself to oneshots?

You could also practise writing fanfic during this time! Or even draw some fanart, or write poetry.

** I don't have autism but was always into reading, writing, playing video games a LOT, so I think it can be a autism thing, but it can also be a just you're passionate about your hobbies thing as well.

Nothing necessarily wrong with it per say, though yeah, the time you need for sleep is definitely important, there's not much to do or places to go currently with the virus going on.

But, I suggest you can do stuff like reading as long as you want, but set a certain time for bed, and commit to that bed time, committing to it might help you go to bed at a decent time.

And the only time I can really read is at night (well, the safest bet) because I'm not allowed to. At all. Like, disowned and/or shunned, which is not great for quarantine times lol

**** Trying different stuff might also help. Part of it could just be you're really bored and are using fanfics as a way to pass the time, which is totally okay.

Part of is probably because you just really like reading fanfics, and again that's perfectly okay.

Set a certain time for bed. Say 9:30 Pm or 10 PM at night on a week day, and 11: PM or such on a weekend. Setting a specific time might help.

Picking up some new hobbies might also help as well. Normally if you had work or school, you wouldn't have as much time with reading, you'd still read of course, but probably not as much. But with the virus going on you're using it as a way to pass the time, which there isn't anything wrong with it.

** Same (binge-reading & ASD).

I find that I tend to do the read-until-the-birds-start-chirping more when I'm stressed...

On the other hand, the following can help:

- Try to specifically read shorter fics when you go to bed, to limit how far "just one more chapter" without end will take.
- Aim for fluffy fanfics, too - calm is good for sleep.
- If you're reading the fics online, consider downloading them to a phone or tablet instead, and using an ereader with a night-mode (I use Aldiko) (white text on black background), and install an app like f.lux or Twilight. Set them to make the screen as dark and red as possible without straining your eyes (if you experience discomfort, slowly increase brightness and decrease redness until it goes away, otherwise you end up with eyestrain headaches). The darker it is, the easier it will be get sleepy enough to put the story down.

** When I fell into a depression slump weeks ago, I did exactly this. It was a school night, but I stayed up till 7am to read, slept exactly 3 hours and went to class. It wasn't my proudest moment. I'm still struggling with regulating my reading habits now. I know it's not a problem most people face (my friend, for example, are more likely to struggle with regulating their bad habits of watching too much drama or youtube videos)... so not many can understand.

But I suggest keeping accountable. It helps very much to have something you have to do (e.g. studies, work), and I watched a video that talked about doing a dopamine detox day, where you refrain from doing the thing that gives you dopamine bursts (for me and you, I think that'll be reading) for a day, so that your brain can get used to wanting to do low dopamine things such as doing your homework or work duties. I've been trying that out but... it's hard, of course. It always is. All we can do is start, then try. Try, fail, make mistakes, but try again... Let's do our best.

** THIS IS THE STORY OF MY LIFE. I read fanfiction everyday, I have to read every night to fall asleep. I've done this for about DECADE now and have resorted to reading old favorites when I can't find new material that interests me. I've been trying all year to branch out & read some regular books for a change but I always get sucked back into a fanfiction blackhole. It hasn't affected my life negatively per say, at least not significantly, but my sleep schedule is also particularly fucked at the moment. Mostly because I'm a habitual night owl and no longer need to go to class or do anything in the mornings. Also, I don't read until I'm done, I just read until I'm tired, sometimes only for 10 mins. But I'm on the autism spectrum as well! I never thought it could be related but that's an interesting thought. I have a LOT of problems with time management in general, not sure how it links with autism if at all. I forget I have autism all the time so I don't think about it much. Long story short, no, my friend you are certainly not alone.

** I'm in much the same boat - nothing to do, nowhere to go, a ton of existential dread at the thought of this going on and on. Been reading a lot of fanfic (not just HP), playing a ton of video games, and skyping or chatting with friends a few times a week. Thankfully I live with my partner as well so I am getting some human interaction throughout the day.

However, I too am struggling to maintain anything close to a normal sleep pattern - it is 4am as I type this. I settle into a fic at 1am because why not? What am I doing tomorrow? The next day? Next week? Nothing, really.

I feel guilty for wasting time and sleeping in and all that but also, that's the least of mine or anyone else's concern right now. If it makes you happy, if it helps you relax, I say do it! But equally, if lack of sleep and feelings of listlessness start to take over then try and find some other outlets for your time and energy. Stay strong!

Forcing yourself to take breaks helps - make a meal, have a hot shower, walk outside if you have a yard/go check the mail, do laundry, vacuum.

Set a time you can start reading, say after dinner or lunch, for a set number of hours (set an alarm).

Make a little schedule for yourself of things to do each day: plan some things like calling/facetiming a friend, writing an email or letter, or watching a movie or a few youtube videos, etc.

Some people get badly obsessed, to the point they don't look after themselves. If you are going to read fanfics, find some gems, then don't look for anymore because apart from the few top fics, the other 99 percent is mostly trash and'll waste your time.

*** What are you reading off of? If it's a computer browser, firefox has a native e-reading pane you can toggle that will shorten the width of the text and increase the text size that can help. Chrome has a plugin you can download that does the same thing.

If you're on your phone/tablet and browser reading, adjust your accessibility settings to make the text a little larger. I do this on my phone, since I find it easier and faster to read off the smaller screen (less distance for eyes to travel = less strain)

Ff.net has something native built into the website (desktop) that does that. ao3 you can download epubs and use an e-reader app if you prefer. You can to the same with ff through ff2ebook.

Otherwise, you probably need glasses. I also needed glasses because of eyestrain when I was 18, but I also do the above as well and it helps a lot. That screen coating for glasses is also a godsend.

** Honestly, my desire to complete fics on one go plays into one of the reasons why I hesitate to read longer works unless I have a long period of time where I know I'm not going to do anything. I did the same thing that you did for canon. Within 24 hours of me picking up the books, I would finish them. My first fic (HPMOR) was like 600k words and had me reading that thing nonstop for 3 or so days, stopping only to sleep, eat or use the loo.

My only advice would be to go back to only reading shorter fics. Only read longer works if they are broken up into multiple stories that way you can give yourself a break (assuming that you can stop yourself once you finish one 'book').

Though I usually fall out of that cycle when I finish the (long) fic I was reading. On weekends I also read till 5 am sometimes if I get a story that really captures me. For me it was always normal tbh. I remember being in 3rd grade and finishing the 6th Harry Potter book at 3 am. If there is a story that grabs my attention, I can't help but devour it.

** I'm not autistic, but I do read constantly.

I mean, reading is never a slump imo. I've always been an avid reader, and it was super encouraged growing up (weekly unrestrained library trips, I would leave with grocery bags filled with books and devour them immediately.)

Obviously only sleeping for 3 hours isn't the best thing ever, but reading a lot isnt necessarily a bad thing.

Make sure to take breaks and focus on other things when they have priority (like work and school etc.) When I was finishing uni, I barely read since my courses were overloaded, and I had to put more energy there then elsewhere.

To this day, I will still lay in bed and read until I cant keep my eyes open, but I've never been a night owl so this is usually around 12am (2:30 at the absolute latest.) I value sleep a lot too, so I still get my 8 hrs in.

I also like to daydream a lot, so I use my time before bed thinking about my own fanfic ideas to fall asleep to, instead of reading fics.

But don't just listen to me, my reading habits are also probably a tad "unhealthy." Just because reading is a more "passive" hobby, doesnt make it a bad thing or anything. Just try to form good habits around it to make your experience better. Save long sessions for weekends or such, and save time for sleep/work etc.

Bonus tips: if your experiencing eyestrain, you might need glasses. Get that screen coating on them and also make the text size larger if your reading off a phone/tablet.

Shorter distances your eye has to travel is easier on them and let's you read faster.

Firefox has a build in e-reading pane that helps a ton, chrome you have to download a plugin. Fanfic has something native to the website that's similar. You can download epubs from ao3 to read in an app if the browser isn't your preferred reading apparatus.

Best of luck to your reading!

** 42 hours a week - That's what I normally do, no ASD or nothing, I'm neurotypical - is that the word for it? Anyways, it's pretty common. I don't know /why/ fanfiction is so addicting, but it is. The problem with fanfiction is that there is no end - but to a show you are bingewatching, there is an end.

** *Try making a schedule*- It doesn't have to be harsh and horrible, it can just be a simple planner with the times you'll eat, sleep, take breaks, etc on it. Put a few quirky things a week to liven it up, and life will feel a lot better.

We need structure and rythmth in our lives a lot more than we realise it, and right now everyone's feeling lost AND lonely due to coronavirus. Everything's cancelled, so our normal schedules have broken down, and we can't visit eachother. The covid-19 stress doesn't help.

** I do that on occasion, when I have the time to do so. It's fun to get lost in fanfic, books, short stories, etc etc.

...I really, really need to take time off work after covid stuff starts to chill out more. I work in healthcare and it's nuts right now. Days of doing not much more than reading sounds heavenly.

** This hit it home for me. There were countless times in my younger years that I have done this vary thing, and in the current climate that we all are going through I could see this thing happening to me again If I didn't have the job I currently have.

I don't recommend it though, as your mental health goes to crap, even worse if your mind is already in the crapper.

Vitamin D is your friend so make sure you take time out of your day to just sit outside for a bit, or at least sit next to an open window and let the sunlight in. Lack of sun/ fresh air after a long time can really mess with your head I have come to find out.

Give your mind a rest from technology for an hour or so when you wake up and/or before you sleep can help too.

Also, I know that it might sound strange but take a break from fan fic reading to actually read a real book also helped me get though it, I reread both the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson books during my last bout of this and it helped me a lot.

Also, if you got friends/ family that you can video chat with, do so every now and then. Talking to people about random things can help as well
