His unprecedented survival of the Killing Curse makes him resistant to magic.

All spells used on him or against him have reduced effects. A cutting curse gives him the equivalent of a paper cut. A stunner knocks him down but doesn't make him unconscious. An impediment jinx knocks him slightly off balance. A bludgeoning curse is like him getting hit with a paintball round. Another Killing Curse shot at him just puts him into a state similar to the draught of the living death for a day or two.

However, beneficial or harmless spells are also reduced. /Wingardium Leviosa/ makes him hover about a foot from the ground. /Episkey/ just speeds up the healing process by a bit (i.e. a fresh wound now looks a day or two old but isn't really cured). A warming charm just makes it as if a nice warm breeze blew across him. Disillusionment just makes him look really, /really/ pale.

He can use enchanted objects as normal, so Hermione putting the /Impervious/ spell on his glasses would still work as intended. But spells used on his body or nature have significantly reduced effectiveness.

*** To be fair, I think the only spells he actually gets hit with in canon are unforgivables.

He never actually has a full on duel like he does in fanon, for all that he's supposed to be really good in defense. It's usually his friends who get cursed.

You could make the argument that this is true because he can throw off the imperius and is still able to fight even after being crucio'd which is so bad it can drive people insane with prolonged exposure. And he survived two killing curses....

Now, what would be funny is if the spell Lockhart cast at his hand was a real one and it was Lily's protection that changed the spell due to Harry's own freak out. Perhaps even the obliviate Lockhart cast would have worked even with Ron's broken wand if not for Lily's sacrifice?

It also could still work with the Lily's protection theory---the prompt is that it reduces the effects of spells, not makes Harry impervious to them. Dumbledore could conceivably put enough power into it that it would constrain Harry until Dumbledore dies and that magic is no longer available.

This is because Harry's protection is working for their benefit. I also wasn't arguing that these spells can't be broken, but rather that Harry definitely didn't break the body bind by Dumbledore by himself. That's all.

******** I think it's mentioned in passing that the spell broke with Dumbledore's death, but since the books are from Harry's point of view, this could be just his theory on the subject.

That being said, I don't believe there's any confirmed example of someone breaking out of such a spell through sheer force of will. Neville, of course, was immobilized in this manner by Hermione in /PS/, but there's no mention of how he was freed from it - whether on his own or someone helped him. I feel the latter is more likely.

********** Right, I had forgotten that Voldy put a Full Body Bind on Neville that he broke out of in DH.

So yes, it does appear that the magic invoked by Lily's sacrifice for Harry, and then Harry himself for everyone else, does confer a degree of resistance to spells along the lines of what the prompt suggests - at least /in the specific case of spells cast by Voldemort/

Whether this applies to spells cast by others or not is less clear. However, it /is/ mentioned in OotP that Harry was */the only one in their DA Class the previous year/* who could fully throw off the Imperius Curse, so I suppose it is possible that this protection could be more general.

****** You are not wrong that she uses a lot of potions, but spells do have their place in canon. There are many healing spells, even minor ones, that are referenced in canon. That however, is largely irrelevant. Even if we take the fanon approach of "no spells, all potions" for the actual healing, there are still things like diagnostic charms that are critical to the overall process. If the diagnostic charm fails, or worse simply doesn't detect everything, then Pomfrey may well give Harry potions. But she may not give him enough, or worse, the wrong one entirely due to an inaccurate diagnosis. Regardless of whether the spells do the actual healing or not, this still royally ducks Harry over in the medicine department.

Edit: also, potions are magical too, what makes you think magical resistance of this nature would only affect spells cast with a wand? Magic is magic regardless of the source. This would probably turn Skelegro into "Splintergro"

******* I would assume the potions wouldn't work as well at the “normal” dosage amounts. That's something that happens in the real world too and usually a higher dosage or something is given and the patient doesn't experience the side effects associated with the high dosages.

I'd assume dosage is similar between all students? We see that on otc medications all the time and/or it's based on weight. A vanished bone is a vanished bone - doesn't require much of a spell to diagnose that. Maybe the healing hurts less or properly knocks out patients for anyone not-Harry?

I do wonder...if her spells do work properly, why isn't he getting nutrient potions and whatnot? Is he just not as abused in the books? (And by not as abused, I meant in comparison to the abused Harry fics)

******** Possibly, and as for the abuse, fanfic authors go to extremes when it comes to that. The abuse he suffers in the books is for most part psychological and emotional. He is certainly at least partially malnourished and likely suffers the consequences of that in how short he is. But the physical side of his abuse, while still abhorrent, is very minor. The psychological and emotional ramifications of, for instance, being referred to as "freak" as the primary form of address are far worse. Though without doubt the most insidious abuse of harry is the near Pavlovian conditioning he underwent in regards to academics. (In the books he is punished whenever he gets better grades than Dudley, something that is not at all helped by Hermione's near enabling behaviour of letting him use her notes and correcting his answers) which likely resulted in his permanently performing poorly on written assignments, homework, and anything other than practical work. He clearly pays attention and is capable.of studying, as evidenced by the fact that he knew enough DADA to teach despite (as Umbridge rightly said) having extremely inconsistent instruction in the subject. Any one of the abuses Harry suffered at the Dursleys is enough to subtly wreck someone's life, all of them together? Best case scenario Harry should have been a complete wreck and unable to function in society. Worst case, another Voldemort.

People don't exactly exaggerate Harry's abuse, but they do get the specific type and effect wrong consistently.

*** *Bartimaeus Sequence*

The Bartimaeus Sequence is a series of children's novels of alternate history, fantasy and magic. It was written by British writer Jonathan Stroud and consists of a trilogy published from 2003 to 2005 and a prequel novel published in 2010. The eponymous character, Bartimaeus, is a five-thousand-year-old boisterous djinni. The story follows the career of a teenage magician Nathaniel and Bartimaeus, whom he has summoned and nominally controls, through the alternative history of the peak of London's domination as a magical oligarchy.

Voldemort has 0 empathy so he would have just killed every member of a family he atacked previously.

That means no matter how many mothers would be willing to die for their sons/daughters, Voldemort wouldn't have given them the choice to live anyways.

So my theory holds that its because Snape begged him to spare Lily (and Voldemort actually tried to) that Lily's sacrifice counted as willingly dying.

We can also go the route of Fate, and the prophecy existing made the magic so Harry would survive and fullfil it.
