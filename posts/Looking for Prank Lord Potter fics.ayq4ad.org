A while ago I read a fic where Harry got out of Azkaban slightly crazy, Hermione had married Percy Weasley and they basically ran the ministry as absolute assholes. Harry effectively declares war on them, humiliating them and declares himself the prank Lord Potter to help destroy their credibility and make it so that other countries don't intervene. Anyone know the one I'm thinking of or any like it?


** You have very good taste, I must say. This is one of my all time favourites. linkffn(6568694)

That's a sequel though, this is the first one. linkffn(4544334)

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

** I remember that, the series had two stories and one of them was 'hitwizard' P think. Or at least it had hitwizard in the title.
