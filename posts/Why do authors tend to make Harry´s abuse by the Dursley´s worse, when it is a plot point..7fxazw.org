Just to be clear, even the tamest interpretation of canon events, is quite frankly horrible abuse, it´s the kind that quite insidiously flies under the radar something that get´s relatively easy overlooked from the outside, especially if you have to look out for 20 to 30 students as a teacher. Everyone is different so you cannot say for certain what issues Harry would develop, but he most likely would be a different person than canon!Harry. Rowling really underplayed what the Dursley´s treatment could´ve done to a child. So I don´t get, the abuse porn that some fan fics have, there is almost no reason for it, you don´t need to exaggerate it for dark/grey!Harry, if you want to have some drama or angst for a gay!Harry, the plot takes place in the 90s basically stone age where gay rights are concerned, canon says Wizards, not even blood purists give a shit about that though, but this could be easily changed for a fic and it wouldn´t be a stretch really, so no abuse in that direction would be necessary to explain, why gay!Harry might have problems with coming to terms with his sexuality. The same counts for transgender!Harry, though I don´t know how this is in canon. I´m actually appalled how often Harry´s canon abuse is downplayed, I actually don´t even like to read stories, where the Dursley´s are good, because the canon version left such a sour taste and fics that redeem after their canon actions, really sour my opinion of the piece, one example would be linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) a really enjoyable fic, that lost me when, the Dursley´s realized that Harry is family and are all good now. I realize this is to a degree, just a pet peeve of mine, but that´s really something that bothers me, just to be clear this isn´t a dig against authors that portray worse abuse than in canon, I just want to find out why this is so far spread.


** I guess I understand the reasoning behind this - Harry did not show any signs of abused child in Hogwarts. So if they want him more affected, they just increase the abuse.

I think this is one of the things Rowling did not really thought all the way through. It was always weird that Harry had no friends in the muggle word, but did not have any social problems in magical word. No teachers noticed anything, even if he was wearing rags, had broken glasses and was picked on etc. My guess is the point was to make Harry's childhood unhappy and without love (so even with similar starting conditions with Tom, he would turn out to be good) but it got out of hand.

*** The books were originally more of a fairy tale style than the later young adult style books, and evil step parents is a pretty common trope in fairy tales so I assume it was mostly a homage to that. When the later books were written more seriously though it was pretty incongruent. Would have been better if the Dursleys were neglectful by being cold and a bit mean towards harry, but weren't outright abusive by making him sleep in a cupboard, withholding food, making him wear rags that clearly didn't fit at all, making him cook their breakfast when he was 10, etc.

***** Yeah its still emotional abuse, which is still really bad, I didn't mean to imply that it wouldn't be, but it would be more realistic and less cartoonishly evil(which doesn't mean it isn't evil, just not cartoonish) both that they are doing it, and that no one else would notice it.

Plus if the Dusley's just didn't like Harry, but didn't really do anything active against him, then him staying there to keep getting the blood protection makes a lot more sense as well. Especially from the perspective of someone born in the 19th century.

** For some reason your text is using a non standard apostrophe?

This is a normal one ' yours looks like this ´ and shows up with a ton of space on both sides which looks weird. Interestingly enough to get your apostrophe I have to do alt + 0180, which leads to ´, but if I do alt + 180 I get ┤. I don't know enough about ascii or alt codes to know why these are different. A normal apostrophe is alt + 39 btw, which should be the default when you press the apostrophe key on your keyboard, but I'm guessing it isn't as I doubt you used an alt code every time you wanted an apostrophe.

Authors use people in real life who went through similar things and just write him in that scenario. I wouldn't say they make the abuse worse. But make it more realistic for the reader.

Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.

Harry considers the food they give him to be meager enough to starve him (he also has to share with hedwig) and later he reacts like this

Exxagerations happen, and we all did it. I get hungry every day and my stomach grumbles, kids all the time say they are "aching" or "starving" when they're not. Harry is also very snarky and sarcastic. Did you really believe his thoughts on still being alive? Throughout the entire narrative of every single story he has some sarcastic thought of the scene. I think it's always exxagerated how much he suffers. The dursleys were cold, petty, ignorant and vengefull; but not evil.

In this instance, I have to assume that being locked in his cupboard is not 24/7, for the simple fact of the school term still being in session. He must be let out to go to school; I can't believe the teachers don't comment on his being absent for 3-4 weeks (Dudley's birthday is 23 June, most state schools break up mid-July), or that the Dursleys would bother with some lie about his absence.

Not that it makes spending his non-school hours looked in a small cupboard good--it's too excessive to be qualified as just being grounded--but it isn't the 24/7 of the summer before second year.

**** I'm not sure about starved, but Dudley's favorite game was "Harry Hunting", and the Dursleys were willfully ignorant of that.

They might not have done the actual beating themselves, but Petunia at least once swung with a pan at Harry.

#+begin_quote
  how they put him on a diet during summer but I think all of them were on the same diet?
#+end_quote

A diet designed for a boy so fat they didn't have any more uniforms for him. Not a nutritionist, but going of the descriptions, it would have what? 1200 calories a day? Harry, as a skinny, relatively active boy growing up would have needed around twice that, if not up to three times (if he was doing any running).\\
At best, it's borderline starving.

Also, there is also the locking into a small, dark and confined space for a long time. Think of it: Harry was locked into the cupboard for /days/ after the vanishing glass incident. The average prison-cell is bigger and has more stuff to do.

That is inhumane, even if he was let out at times.

The only one redeemable is Dudley, because it wasn´t his fault that he was raised like that and seemingly got his act together after his encounter with the dementor. The beating and starving might be debatable, but the worst thing they did to him, is hardly ever mentioned, they deprived him of love and care, something that is crucial for a child growing up, this is basically the worst thing short of killing, you could do to a child.

** I backbutton when I see Dursley killing Hedwig in a fic. Too over the top. Also, unable to make friends in school is bad enough for anyone.

So Close deals well with the emotional abuse: Set at the end of 3rd year. Overhearing Harry by chance on his final evening patrol of the year leads Snape and Harry down an entirely unexpected path. [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3040]]

*** I usually don't bother with those kind of stories, where Snape is suddenly nice after seeing Harry's treatment by the Dursleys.

Snape's abusing children too, with his bullying. It's not even restricted to harry - Neville and Hermione get it too.

** I think a lot of it is done to make Harry look even more amazing. Oh look, he suffered not only the terrible abuse in the books, but even more heinous beatings/rape/etc. My impression from those kinds of fics is that the author is trying to make Harry look so amazing and OP for surviving that level of abuse. It comes off as very unrealistic and Gary Stu.

I also think that for some people, only physical abuse = abuse, so for them the emotional abuse doesn't even matter, so they need to give him the even worse physical abuse to make it “real”. Then Harry can be somehow edgy too for having survived it. Honestly, it doesn't make much sense.

** You answered your own question. If it's a plot point making the abuse worse makes sense. It wouldn't have taken that much to push the Dursley's into more horrific abuse and it's a decent point of divergence.

** I know the feeling. Just right now, I read a fanfic telling how the Dursleys made Harry, who was by then in his 5th going on 6th year in Hogwarts, cook a feast for them, when to my knowledge, the books only ever show him cooking for the Dursleys before he started going to Hogwarts. He was pretty much left alone every time he went back to them during summers, except for the one before 2nd year where he was locked in his room. I therefore propose that we make a thread copying and pasting passages from the books showing the ways the Dursleys mistreated him, to clear up once and for all what's in Canon and what other stuff has gotten blown out of proportion by Fanon.

** Yes! Like the abuse Harry went through originally is not bad enough for these authors, so they have to make it grotesque.

I think it undermines canon Harry suffering under (mostly) indifference and emotional cruelness. I think indifference is what would make Harry undervalue his own worth and sacrifice himself for other people so lightly.

If they were really that kind of monsters to abuse him extremely, I think Harry would be mentally damaged or become more like Tom Riddle, but that's my guess.
