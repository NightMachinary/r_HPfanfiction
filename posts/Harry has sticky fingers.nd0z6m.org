My barn got broken into last night and they stole a panting my grandmother made for my 10 birthday and it got me thinking if there where any fanfictions where harry is a thief anything from a quill to a panting if he can take it he does, Why because he can/wants to.

  What would happen if the Dursleys abandoned Harry Potter before he could attend school? What kind of problems would a street wise, self-reliant, and Slytherin Harry could create?
