I don't think I've ever read a fanfic like this. I assume they are hard to come by because you already know a lot of the plotlines going in since it's a fanfic, but there has to be some. There is a good bit of suspense and tension for sure, but not so much on the thriller side.


** linkffn(Blurring reality) I know this is not what you would expect from the summary of this fic at all, but this fic is well written and has an underlying psychological thriller plot line going on. Somewhat similar to the movie Black swan.

It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story of double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and lots of supernatural type events start happening as the line between what is real and not becomes blurred.

Not complete and updates super slowly but a very good fic.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.
