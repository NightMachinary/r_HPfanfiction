I'm going on a trip in a few days, and to my knowledge there will only be spotty or no service after a long plane ride. Therefore, I would love if you all could recommend me some longer fics that would hold my attention for a bit.

I would prefer no slash, but other than that have no preference for pairings. I'd rather not have overly bashy reads, though light or deserved bashing (in context) is acceptable.

Finally, I would like to read something fairly well written and unique, without too many tropes ( such as Lord Harry and all that).

Thanks in advance!

This one has long chapters. Some are like 40k words long. I don't think there's any bashing tbh, but I'm not sure. I haven't read it in a while. It's incomplete and has no pairing. I usually don't give a shit for Draco's character, but I liked having him here.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
