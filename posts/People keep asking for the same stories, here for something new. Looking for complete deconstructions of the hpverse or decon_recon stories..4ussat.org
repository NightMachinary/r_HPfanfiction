For those that don't understand the term watch hot fuzz, the first half of the movie breaks down all cop movies and says why they don't work. In the second half, it reconstructs the tropes and he does all the tropes such as pre-mortem one liners and so on.

Edit: complete as in finished.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

*** I have this in my queue to read I think but the summary has WBWL in it. Huge flashing warning sign to me that the story is going to be not enjoyed. And Slytherin!Harry means that Snape is probably his bff and mentor. And stating 'hopefully no bashing?' First thing I thought was "It's your story, Sinister Man, do you not know what you wrote?"

I don't think it's a straightforward WBWL. I think it might be a Boys-Who-Lived or maybe a BWL and his Horcrux-Twin.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not bffs, but some mentorship. Snape is still a sarcastic, bitter, angry human being.

#+begin_quote
  And stating 'hopefully no bashing?'
#+end_quote

His intention is that it isn't a bashing story, yet some elements seem bashing on James, Lily and Jim (but that's really an execution thing).

It's really worth a fucking read. The first year isn't as good (partly because that is when he first establishes the tropes that he is working on subverting), but I know he's working on getting the quality of it up. He's really working on subverting the usual tropes you see with WBWL, Slytherin!Harry and so on. Like, there's magical trunks, but in the one scene it is discussed, Harry mentions that the bedroom reminds him too much of being in the cupboard. There is over-the-top Dursley abuse, but the reason why is actually tied into the overarching mystery.

Legilimency and Occlumency are intelligently handled. Magical theory stuff is interesting. I really enjoy the worldbuilding. Two of the best characters are Lucius Malfoy and Gilderoy Lockhart. Peter is 10 kinds of terrifying, and Narcissa is completely insane.

Give it a read. I'd probably call the first part a 2-3/5, but second year for me is easily a 4+/5.

Also I'm really curious to find out whats up with the boy who lives stuff. Like obviously they are both involved somehow, but its really not clear yet how. Probably won't get those answers till the end though, which is pretty far away.
