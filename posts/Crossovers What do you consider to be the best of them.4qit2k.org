Cause I want more things to read.

My own recommendations are Browncoat, Green Eyes(HP/Firefly) and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For(HP/Star Wars). Both feature a Harry Potter that is very old, very powerful, and very much an out of context problem for everyone else.

EDIT: The bot seems not to like me, so no links. :/


** linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra) is a HP/The Mummy (remake) crossover that is probably my favorite HP crossover.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

** Martyrdom and Paradox By: UchidaKarasu: A Harry Potter/Death Note Crossover. It is slash (HP/LL), and I really like how the relationship develops. Aside from that is one of the only good HP/DN crossovers that I have managed to find (aside from some MoD = Shinigami King short stories). linkffn(5730598)

Madness at the Gate By: ZenoNoKyuubi: A Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover. I don't know much about SG, and I only really read this as it is a sequel with a Harry Potter that I rather enjoyed (mad scientist). linkffn(9261735)

Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens By: littlewhitecat: A Harry Potter/Warhammer Crossover. Thankfully, knowledge of Warhammer isn't needed to enjoy this story. linkffn(8400788).

***** Posts like this have a place, in LF threads. But without context i tend to skip over them in recomendation threads since

1) i want a recommendation, and that involves more than just a title in my mind. Strong points and weak points, why i should read it anyway, etc.

2) summaries are often horrible at predicting if i would like the story.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** linkffn(11759933)

Probably the best star wars cross that I've read. First chapter is a bit meh, mostly because it does that thing where hardly any of it is actually relevant to the rest of anything. But second chapter on gets pretty good.

** I've posted this before. Right now I'm in a PJO mood, so these. There are others from other Fandoms, but at the moment here are these

These are some of my favorite. I like the twice blessed challenge, but really I just like a demigod Harry. These are a fem Harry, so take that as you will. The author is quite good and I liked them. They are only the first part though. There are second parts being written. The idea for each is that a femharry is the daughter of one of the big three. The author wrote a story for each scenario. I like them all, but consul of the dead is my favorite. They ask feature a little crossover with Rick Riordan's other books featuring Egyptians and Romans. The reason I like this so much is because in Consul of the dead we see Harry grow into a person. We also see real family relationships between the daughters of hades. Yeah they might not seem possible because of the age gap, but the female goddess daughters of hades are portrayed as immortal college age girls. This has shown to be okay with the hunters and somehow the author makes it work.I'll admit there are some cliche moments and it's not for everyone, but I liked it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309061/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-The-Game-Begins]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey]])

This is a good one as well. It is a unique look on what kind of parents Harry can have. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.

I'm post more probably when I get home. They will be from different Fandoms.

  Every Half-Blood has one godly parent, this we know: however, Harry is different because of one reason: through the ways of the divine, he has more than one god for a parent - and those parents are NOT happy at being entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will. The solution is simple, give their son the power to make the whole shake and quiver. DISCONTINUED.

  "I do believe the two of you were in the same year as boys, were you not?" Headmaster Shaw said. "Charles is the most competent deputy any headmaster could ask for, Erik, and he's been doing this for years..." He trailed off, as if finally noticing something odd in the way his Potions and Divination masters were staring at each other. "Of course," Charles said quickly, his voice only a little hoarse, and stuck out his hand. "Welcome back to Hogwarts, Erik."
