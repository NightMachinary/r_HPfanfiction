*** Can you give more info on the fic, please? Just that one line of summary sounds A-MAZ-ING so I know the story should be too.

Who are the main characters? What happens on the story? Any trigger-warnings?

If you don't mind, that is, answering my questions?

Thank you for your time--now and in the future--I hope you have a wonderful day & that you and yours remain healthy and safe!

**** Goes against rule 8, even if it is more tongue-in-cheek. Involves a lot of consensual adult material as well as a few good funny bits. A play on the idea that the Dursleys advertising Harry as a deliquent would attract a lot of female attention, seeking a 'bad boy'. Fortunately, there is actual plot to this.

** This could be a fun way for Harry to learn he is a metamorphmagus, if you wanted to go down that route!

Working title, The Colour of Delinquency “Harry was fed up with the stuffy restrictions of Little Whinging. He was done with the sneers he got from the dullards he was forced to call neighbours. He was annoyed with taunts from his simpleton classmates. Then one day, his hair turned blue, and life finally started to turn around”

** The Very Best by Brilliant Lady. Incredibly cute.

Harry creates Pokémon, then Luna helps. Harry decides that magical rules are merely suggestions that limit his abilities. The Wizarding World think he's crazy. Harry/Luna

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
