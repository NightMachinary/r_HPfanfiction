*** Depends on what you mean by "better". Also, it's a 20-something year old Narcissa and baby Draco that grows up with Harry, so it's not such a stretch of the imagination. Draco obviously isn't raised a blood purest, and we don't know canon Narcissa enough to say that if she had split from Lucius at a young age that she wouldn't be different.

**** Could you expand on this a little? I suppose that when it comes to Harry/Fleur fics I've seen what real "trash" looks like, and this isn't it.

***** It's not trash but it's certainly not good. It has some stale tropes like super!Harry that plays national team quidditch, or manipulative, evil Dumbledore.I read this very early on, and it hasn't aged well.

It's a poor man's version of linkffn(Knowledge is Power by nkari217). Whike KiP has it's share of cons, there's something to be said for how amusing an asshole Harry is.

****** That's true, although I don't really consider this Harry to be "super harry". Victor Krum ended up on Bulgaria's team at the age of 17, and he was obviously quite well known before that point even, so the author is trying to explain that in some way.

I don't even pay attention to the other tropes, I was just pleased to find something that went sorta in-depth about Durmstrang.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
