** *Harry/Draco*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/41103][101 Way to Heal Your Wizarding Woes]] by who_la_hoop

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a trainee Auror, and Draco is living at Malfoy Manor, bored and petulant with nothing to do, and no career prospects. Draco's attempt to heal himself via Muggle psychology---including writing a series of 'why I hate you' letters to Harry---backfires when an overanxious house elf delivers the results to Harry. Harry is bemused, Draco is angry and together they have a lot of issues to work out.

But after Harry elbows his way into Draco's dark world, both boys find themselves in a strange new friendship, and they each learn new ways to see each other... and themselves.

She has a ton of Harry/Draco stories (go the AO3 route rather than ff.net, she only updates the AO3 anymore as far as I know and there are way more stories there than on her ff account.) Seriously, her stuff is SOOOOO good. Helix, Salt On The Western Wind, It Takes A Village, and Talk To Me are really good ones of hers as well.

If I can add to your list, I'd include:

** My all time favorite is Glass Silence, by Zarrene Moss. Incomplete but its AU HG/Black Sisters. Each relationship is really well explored; don't think its smutty but it might be that I glossed over those parts. Well written, avoids cliches. A decent length as well, and the characterizations are nuanced and interesting.

      This story was written back in 2003, so it's not new \- but maybe a few new people will find it if I upload it here \(it's been on fanfiction\.net forever\)\. As it was mostly written in the first half of 2003, it does not take into account anything beyond Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\. Comments for the story are still appreciated, although I've hopefully evolved some as a writer since I wrote this\.

  HPDM slash. Nothing in Harry's life has gone the way he expected, and that includes being the mediwizard assigned to treat Lucius Malfoy. But he's Harry; he can deal with this. And he can deal with Draco Malfoy's nonsensical flirting, too.
