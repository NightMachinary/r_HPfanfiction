We've all been there, picking up a new fic, getting into it and really excited about the story, but you notice something. You're getting close to the end of the fic and there aren't that many chapters left. You forgot to double check that it was completed or at least in progress. You tell yourself it will be fine, that maybe the conclusion is rushed, maybe it is posted as a separate fic, but you get to the end and realize it's not so and you will never get closure. It's abandoned or on permanent hiatus.

What incomplete stories did you find yourself blindsided by?


** Deprived by CrimsonLord(I think) for sure, I was so excited reading like a madman and when I realized I was in the last chapter and the story far from ending. Kinda of left me heartbroken lol.

** For me, it's the stories I read by active, updating authors that then turn into inactive, not updating ones. I was following Rent-a-hero when it was live, as well as stories like Junior Inquisitor and Courage and Cunning. All three authors have vanished from the face of the earth. Sir Poley's Natural 20 is similar, but at least he is active on other forums.

*** If you like natural 20, I just discovered a similar story, called Harry Potter and the Girl in Red, that I thought was decent.

linkao3(6835726)

It appears to still be active, but stories have a bad habit of going from being regularly updated to completely inactive just as I get caught up to their latest chapter, which just happened. So we'll see if my bad luck on that happens here or not I guess.

I followed rent a hero too when it was live, was so sad when it stopped updating. The worst one for me was probably What You Leave Behind. FF says I added an alert on 10/16/2015 and it last updated 08/08/2015 :(. Had a bunch of mysteries in it that I really wanted the answers to.

Wand and Shield I also added an alert for 2 months after its most recent update.

This is currently happening with the pureblood pretense series, which has had one update in the past year. I really hope the author starts updating regularly again eventually.

I know it's frustrating when your favourite fic seems abandoned, but priorities change over the years. Some of my favourite fics have been abandoned halfway as well but at least I got to read what the author has come up with so far. Better to have had something than nothing at all, imo.

** It's interesting - I've never understood the attachment to complete fics. I think it's because I have a very "sandbox" approach to fanfiction, where the only "real" story is canon, and I have closure with regards to that. Everything else is just playing around in the toybox of canon, and so I'm much more interested in finding engaging ideas than having a complete literary experience (if you want that then really fanfiction is the wrong place to look, given the standard of writing/plotting/pacing/structure).

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** The Mirror of Maybe....I still read even to this day, and I'm always pissed it's not complete nor being worked on.

When I first started it a long long long time ago, I thought it WAS still being worked on because there had been a recent update. Well, that update was the author saying they were no longer working on it - or that it was on hiatus.

** linkao3(Harry's Cousins)

It's a remarkable story where Harry is adopted by the Malfoy's. When I picked it up, I was under the impression it was completed. But NOPE! Far from it! Harry doesn't even get to Hogwarts yet!

It's been almost seven years since it was last updated. Cri

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

** linkffn(Time Warp by kittenn1011)

It's a pretty unique time travel story that /really/ ends on a cliffhanger.

What makes it unique: the fast pace (it doesn't drag through every single detail of the books to show every tiny little change) and the fact that Draco came back in time too. I don't think it was Harry/Draco either, which is also rather unusual.
