*** He created a lot of "Discussion" threads in the last few days, all with similar topics like this, or "Why do people write Harem fics" and "Why do people write sex slave fics".

Never saw him reply in any of his own topic though, so just think of it as places for discussion. The "slave" one was deleted when things got too hot, so maybe this one will too.

*** This^^ I don't like 90% of the "popular" stuff that is often recommended here, but you don't see me making writer bashing threads.

*** Yeah, I mean, I am not a particular fan of Starfox because I simply don't find his plots interesting, but his Hermione characterisation is rather solid from what I've read and his writing is technically good.

But compared to some other stuff, like that one German on A03 who writes smut one-shots where Harry gets fucked by every male character in the series and it's always the same exaggerated sub!Harry (those have a big dose of rape, statutory rape and abuse of power), or straight up "The +Nazis+, uhm, Purebloods did nothing wrong", I'd take Starfox every day.

** Ouch. This is going to get extremely bad very soon, I suspect.

We all have popular authors we don't like. No need to lambaste them. Just ignore it each time their work is recommended.

Funny, so far, nearly all replies have been other people saying just about the same thing /you/ did.

******** Then it would've been better if you'd said, "It's nice to see people are being decent human beings." Your first response is rather unnecessary, comes off as accusatory and is easily misconstrued.

  Starfox sorry all he does is the same Hermione worship and the pro muggles stuff in every fic. I don't get the hype.
