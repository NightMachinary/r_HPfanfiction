If i read one more fic in which will of Lily and James were sealed and in them it says that "if they died from voldemort they leave nothing to Pettigrew because he was their secret keeper" and "Under no cincurstances should Harry James Potter live with petunia dursley" in the same paragraf I WILL F*CKING LOOSE IT


** 1. When in the middle of the war and you have substantial property (I am not saying Potters were the richest family in England, but I think it is canon, that James technically didn't have to work), it is quite logical to make a will.

2. Making a note about the Sirius/Peter switch would just make sense, unless the will was made before the Fidelius Charm was set up, and nobody bothered to make an amendment.

3. It may just get lost, their lawyer got killed, or something, it doesn't have to mean the manipulative Dumbledore.

4. Yes, “never put Harry with Petunia” clause is silly. First because it is a pretty dick clause (“and I will carry my bitterness against my sister to my grave” by supposedly exceptionally sweet and forgiving woman), second with many magical friends around, it had to be obvious that Dursleys would be an alternative only in completely desperate situation, when it would be a choice between them and an orphanage. And however bitter I would be against my sister, I would still hope they would do the most middle-class normal thing possible and take care of an orphaned relative child.

*** On the subject of #4, I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of it. We don't know exactly how viciously Petunia acted towards Lily. It isn't necessarily an example of Lily being petty and bitter towards her sister, but her being afraid that Petunia's pettiness and bitter attitude would be taken out on her son(She was quite hostile towards her nephew in conversation with her husband, before she was saddled with responsibility over him, in the first chapter of the first book of the series)

**** I really wish Pottermore was still up and running with its original content, which was essentially an interactive version of the first 3 books which provided a lot of background information on many of the characters. One such detail was that the Malfoy family were actually french sheep/goat farmers that married into wealth and slowly worked their way up in society. They were in no way 'Pure bloods' even though they pretend to be.

It also had a whole section on Lily Potter and gave credence to Petunia's hatred for her sister. Snape and Lily became friends at around 9 years old. This is briefly touched on in the books but is never really gone into with much depth. Apparently Snape taught Lily how to purposefully trigger her 'accidental magic' to cause things to happen. Both Lily and Snape use to use this ability to pick on Petunia by causing her to experience disasters/misfortunes. They essentially bullied her with their magic (muggle bating).

Petunia thus wanted to attend Hogwarts in order to learn magic and learn how to defend herself against her sister's 'pranks'. When she was denied entry she became super bitter, she was also very resentful that Lily was seen as a perfect daughter by her parents when Lily was actually very mean to her. This is why Petunia grew to hate magic. This is also why she refers to her sister as a freak.

Its unfortunate that all the original content on Pottermore was taken down because it was much more interesting then what is up on the site now. It also showed that Lily was not the 'perfect' person she was made out to be. She was sometimes very cruel, after all, she was friends with Snape. Sure she got better as she got older but the damage was already done and it never indicates any attempt by Lily to make it up to Petunia.

***** For what it's worth, I'm not certain that really does anything to counter my observation. In fact, I think it would just add more fuel to the theory that she was afraid of how her sister would treat her son, even if it was confession through projection, and she deep down believed that she wouldn't have treated Dudley well, were the situation reversed.

Regardless of whether or not Petunia's ire towards Lily was justified, she /was/ petty and cruel to her nephew.

****** That may be true. It's just interesting background. Also in this case, keeping Petunia from the will, would stem from a sense of guilt on Lily's part. She knows Petunia has a very justifiable reason for hating witches and wizards. It would be Lily's own fault that her sister hates magic and not some unjustified hatred on Petunia's part.

Why making a note? They trusted Peter literally with their lives. They didn't think anything would go wrong. It may seem silly - but Lily and James were 21 years. That's not what I call full of live experience. They also survived Voldemort three times - so I am pretty sure they got a little bit cocky and did not think that their plan could possibly go wrong.

I don't think they would have put it in a will, not only because it is silly, but because they never considered it an option. Petunia and Lily weren't exactly on speaking term and with Sirius they had a perfectly fine guardian for their son in case of their death. I think it never came to their mind that there could be a scenario where he couldn't take care of Harry as long he was alive. And as Sirius was very much alive while they were in hiding they didn't have any reason to plan for a option B-Z.

That's what I meant. They never thought about it, so they didn't feel the need to explicitly exclude it. However, even if they had thought about it, they would probably not make that clause either, because the option was so far fetched that it would happen only in case really everything went belly up and then better unpleasant childhood with not very friendly relatives than an orphanage (nobody need to expect outright abuse; and still, perhaps even the canonical level of abuse was better than an orphanage?).

Also James and Lily seem both smart and practical to me, and they are in a middle of a war. Anyone who doesn't get smart (paranoid) and grow up fast would end up dead. So naturally they would think up a bunch a different scenarios that could happen and write them down in the will.

** Must have changed their will quite a few times

"To each of our friends we bequeath..."

A week later:

"To each of our friends we bequeath... The only exception is +Dumbledore since he+ is +Sirius+ Peter, because he is our Secret Keeper and if we're deat, he probably betrayed us."

The reason it's unbelievable is because

a) having a will is perfectly fine,

b) the will would probably be somewhere save, maybe in Gringotts, where not everybody can just come and manipulate or steal it. And I really don't think that in the few days between making Peter Secret Keeper and their deaths, when they weren't supposed to leave the house, that they'd be like "You know we should change our will so if Peter betrays us, he doesn't get anything!" ... In canon it seems like they didn't leave much to any of their friends. Remus at least seemed rather poor still. Also they TRUSTED Peter...If they trusted him so little, that hey changed their will just in case, why make him Secret Keeper... (That's one of my main pet peeves about a lot of Marauders/First War Stories... Nobody likes Peter, nobody trusts him...

c) why would they even think that Petuia would get Harry?

So they had time to update their will and mention it which would be the responsible thing to do but they wouldn't say "if we dead it was peter" they would have maybe said "if we were killed without the charm breaking, we want Peter (our secret keeper) to share the secret with X who will manage our estate and properties until Harry is of age."

Might be mixing it up with the movies tho.

I just don't think changing their last will to include an Information that Peter was the secret keeper was really a priority on their mind. In hindsight sure it should've been, to protect Sirius, but they DID trust Peter. There will was probably already all set up, with all kinds of provisions for harry, so that wouldn't be relevant and also... is writing the Name of your secret keeper Down on a paper really that smart?

Edit: as far as switching they switch as in they told Dumbledore they would do it and have Sirius as keeper and then they talked to Sirius and he convinced them to to use Peter instead and so they did. It's not like Sirius was the Secret keeper and then they redid it with Peter.

******* I think either way makes sense.

But seeing that most people keep their wills in a bank safe deposit box or a home safe, than their will would have been either just as safe (if it's a home safe) or possibly believed to be far safer at Gringotts.

Everyone believed no one could break into Gringotts (let along manage to steal something and get out) and no one managed to do so until Harry, Ron and Hermione. So they wouldn't have any real reason to be concerned about having a will, that reveals their secret keeper, in their vault at Gringotts (it would be reasonable for them to assume it would only be seen if they died and they they could die without the charm breaking which would cause real issues with the managing and passing down of their estate).

Could they decide not to, to be safe? Yes. But they could also think it was even safer than them and they needed the right person to be able to see and manage their property (it would be arguably be safer to edit their will at Gringotts in their safe, leave it there, and then go meet Peter before they and then Peter went into hiding).

******** A home safe makes no sense if the point of including him in the will at all is to FIND the house in the first place. That's why I said depositing it in Gringotts is likely the safest Option, however how would they ger it there? After going into hiding they can't leave the house. Else it would defeat the point of going into hiding. So they'd have to either ask for the will to be sent via owl and then send it back (at which point it could be easily caught and read by any death eater who's be trying to search the general area of Godric's Hallow or waiting at Gringotts for them to do exactly that, or they'd need to Trust a goblin or somebody else from Gringotts to tell them their hiding place so they can bring the will to them and carry it back to Gringotts which would be equally risky if not more so.

The point is not about the will being in Gringotts at which point, yeah, it would be reasonably save, but how do they get it their safely? I'm not sure if going to Gringotts themselves would have been an Option before the fidelizs either. They were already hunted and in hiding before they used the Fidelius. So going to Diagon Alley is a risk before or after the activating of the fidelius... and for what? IT's just an unnecessary risk if they really trust Peter. Because if they Trust Peter telling him 'if something happens please do this and that' would be far safer and arguably more effective since a Peter in hiding wouldn't necessarily come to the reading of their will.

Never mind at least in canon it seemed that the fidelius dissolved by itself... so if it just dissappears with the death of the caster why make provisions about how to Lift it after the death of the caster? There's no reason for it... Unless of course they don't Trust Peter, but then why make him secret keeper in the first place.

This will idea in hindsight seems very Smart, because it could easily safe Sirius from a horrible fate, but in canon it really doesn't seem in line with their characters and would only add another risk...

********* 1) As I said doing the will at Gringotts would be safe (the rest not safe) and as I remember cannon they and the longbottoms "went into hiding" when Harry and Neville were born but they still seemed to go out, see people, go to OftP meeyings, go to work - just carefully. They then did a real lockdown when they heard Voldemort picked Harry, that's when they decided to do the charm (and still they apparently saw friends and James snuck out under the cloak until he let Dumbledore see it). So I see no reason in their set up of "lockdown" that they COULDN'T update a will and put it in their vault.

2) Seeing that they trust Peter it's alot easier to tell him where your will is in the house than give him instructions that could have just been put in the will. Also it's more work for Peter to hunt down some random person, prove he knows the potters, get a meeting, and then share the secret (and then possibly tell the guy all the Potters last minute wish changes with no proof). BUT if it's in the will than Peter just gets the will and than everyone mentioned will be summoned to a will reading after Peter hands over the will (because they have no reason to think he wouldn't).

3) I don't think the charm disappeared by itself, it broke when the house was magically destroyed (but maybe that's headcannon). But seeing that Sirius house had the charm and it didn't break after Dumbledore died (just everyone he told became a secret keeper) its definitely not when the keeper/caster dies.

4) I don't see either as anti-their characters. They are in their early 20s so no will at all makes sense, but they are also rich, have a kid, and are facing the very real risk of death so making a will to make sure Harry will be taken care of and get his inheritance when he's older (and not be locked out of a property - of course they also COULD just have Peter write the address and put that in the will to be shown to their estate manager and then given to Harry when he's old enough).

There is alot that they could have done and could have thought.

Not trusting Peter isn't the only way to mention him beong the secret keeper in the will (it's far more likely they would mention it because they trust him and hope that he will out live them).

I just once want to read a fanfic that do that, execute the will legally, than happens exactly what Dumbledore predicted: Death Eaters get in, and because nobody on Lily and James list is left, they get Harrys guardianship and

a) raise Harry to be dark. And I mean dark. Not "the Death Eaters are missunderstood- dark" oder "the dark arts aren't evil, you can kill with normal spells too"-dark, but dark - dark. As in: "Harry becomes a bigoted massmurderer like Voldemort"-dark and there is nothing to redeem him

or

b) kill Harry instantly. Because without bloodprotection Harry would have died - latest in Hogwarts first year.

Harry also only stayed at very strong warded homes after Voldemort returned: between 4 and 5 at Grimmauld Place and between 5 and 6 at the Burrow which at this point was wardened with the help Dumbledore himself.

Then the only time Harry is attacked by Death Eaters in Summer is after he left Privet Drive forever - the moment the wards fell.

I am pretty sure if they had the opportunity to attack Harry, they wouldn't have discussed to wait until he left in that Death Eater meeting.

Arguable. Harry is attacked by the Dementors - tho admittedly it isn't a Death Eater, it still puts him in extreme danger, knowing of the effects they have on him. And by the Ministry, no less. I do agree that his placement with the Dursleys were mostly for his early life, but still.

Besides, he was supposed to be Incognito, but the ministry has a register of every wizard and witch and, now into the part I think it's arguable, there's the trace. Harry did a lot of magic as a kid, they could probably find him of they really wanted to, there's no way the trace is just activated as they turn 11, they just don't care bc it's accidental magic.

Harry was attacked as soon as he left Private Drive bc Snape told the plan to Voldemort (not getting into the merit of him being good or bad, just facts). And then, when he apparated to the middle of London with Ron and Hermione, they just followed his trace (his magical trace, not necessarily the one that was supposed to not be active anymore, since he had just turned 17). All I'm saying is that at this point, the Ministry was in Voldemort's hands, they found him bc they had the power to, not bc the protection fell.

****** I'm talking in the time frame between Voldemort's initial "death" and his resurrection, mainly. Particularly the 10 years at the Dursleys. Maybe it was necessary in the first few weeks after when Death Eaters were being rounded up, but certainly not the majority of the time.

Further, you note that he was in highly warded places that prevented the Death Eaters from attacking him even when Voldemort was back. That is demonstrable evidence that it should not have been difficult for Dumbledore to have done that at any place Harry would have been living at, particularly during a time period when Death Eaters were mainly in hiding.

** Canon hugging annoys me way more than fanon tropes, considering how Rowling's world building is absolute shit - especially compared to authors like Robert Jordan, George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb, Joe Abercrombie, etc., and there are plot holes in canon you can drive a double-decker bus through. It's so full of gaps and holes it might as well be a goddamn sandbox. Let people fill it in as they see fit.

I also find it funny how many people think a clause about Peter in the will is some big compromise of the secret. If the will is at Gringotts, NO ONE who isn't a goblin or Harry is going to see it.

If it's at the Ministry, fair enough considering how corrupt the Ministry is, but even then it's not like just anybody gets to look at it. If you believe otherwise I encourage you to go try and read private wills in the real world and see how that works out for you.

These things became tropes because there is a semblance of sense or logic to them. Frankly, Dumbledore being manipulative makes more sense than him being as grossly incompetent and negligent as the alternative would require. Two parents - one of whom is the last scion of a wealthy family and the other of whom is the brightest witch of her age - would logically want to make a will before going into hiding because their son is being targeted during wartime. Goblins handle matters of inheritance because they handle finances. Goblins are known to be some of the best curse breakers and the series claims only an idiot would try to steal from them, so it stands to reason they'd be excellent warders and provide other services. The Pettigrew clause would be a logical failsafe to ensure his betrayal is revealed in the event it happens, though this makes more sense if Lily wants the clause and James trusts Peter.

There are a whole host of things in canon that make way less sense.

*** For most of the people who hate this trope (me included), it's not really the existence of the will that pose a problem, but rather its content.

Honestly, considering the canon situation, you can easily argue both for, and against the existence of the will. From one sided, you can say that James and Lily were young (barely 20 when they went into hiding) and they had other things in mind that a will. But from the other side, you can also say that they lived during a war time, and knew that Death could come at any time, so they should have taken steps into at least taking care of their friends in case of problem. I believe that both opinion are valid.

​

But, under no circumstances, said will should contain a line along the lines of "Peter was the Secret Keeper, he gets nothing if we die".

First of all because this is completely stupid. The whole plan of the Potters was to present Sirius as the Secret Keeper and keep Peter a secret. So putting something like that in writing is incredibly reckless. Also, depending of the World Building, said will should be handled either by the Ministry, Gringott, or another 3rd Party. In any case, none of these place would be "safe", which means that there would be a true risk of Voldemort getting his hand on the will, and by doing so discovering the identity of the Secret Keeper.

The other problem is that, despite what happened in Canon, the death of the Potters does not necessarly means that Peter was a traitor. James and Lily may have been reckless and been killed while outside the protections (in her letter to Sirius, Lily strongly implu that, if he had not lent his cloak to Dumbledore, James would have probably used it to go outside). Or maybe Peter was just killed, and another of their friend (let's say Sirius or Remus), was the traitor who could them give their position to Voldemort. I would also add that puting something like in their will shows a lack of trust toward Peter, which totally contradict the whole point of the Fidelius.

​

Finally, I would just mention that, while Harry is wealthy, he is not rich. Sure having a vault full of gold is impressive, but it's not like he is set for life (as it's said in Canon), or like he had several companies or proprieties to manage. Since (according to the "English Common Law" that is usually invoked in Fanon) Harry, as the sole heir, is supposed to get everything anyways, it's not unimaginable that they just didn't bother writing a will.

​

​

PS: Also, the "Sealed Will" trope is usually tied to other tropes such as "Super helpful Goblins!", "Manipulative! Dumbledore", "Stupidly Rich! Harry" or (hurk) "Diagon Alley's Shopping Trip!", which are often . . . subject of discussion of this sub (some love them, other hate them).

JK's innumeracy kills that excuse unfortunately, since there's a grand total of 10k wizards in Britain. Even if the war was as bad as WW2 was for Germany (which it definitely wasn't) that's still only 800 wills that need to be executed. Most of which, unless there is some incredibly strange law in wizarding Britain that doesn't exist in muggle Britain would be handled by a lawyer rather than the government. If there was so much as one person working on them, it really shouldn't take more than a a year or so in the absolute worst case scenario. I'm always happy to ignore her numbers though, given how rarely they make sense with her world building.

2. Wasn't the entire point of the switcharoo that no-one, not even Dumbledore, knew about it? If they wrote it down in their will and Peter /wasn't/ the traitor, having it written down that Peter was the secret-keeper would jeopardize that.
3. This all depends on just how badly Lily and James got on with Petunia and Vernon by the end. If they got on /exceptionally/ badly, then honestly I would expect some kind of "Please consider literally every alternative before putting Harry there" in their will.

Overall, though, The Sealing of the Will is an early warning sign of a Manipulative!Dumbledore Cliché-fic, and I'm honestly grateful if they include it - it means I can stop reading then and there.

Making a will than 100% assumes Harry will survive them is quite optimistic (or informed by a great deal of hindsight). If it mostly assumes that, fine, but it's difficult to believe they never even considered the alternative. Also informed by hindsight is the idea they'll definitely both die at the same time; at the very least, they should have separate wills.

2. There's no evidence that Petunia and Lily had a particularly inimical relationship. There was a lot of distance between them, sure, and they had one or two bad encounters with each other after finishing school. But that's unlikely to lead Lily to just assume her sister would be a monstrous child-abusing evil stepmother to Harry.

***** Where is that even implied? Why go trough the bother of changing secret keepers? People would need to be retold the secret and then there is the question of how noticeable is it if a charm like the fidilus is cancelled to people in the region.

Sirius was only ever the decoy. He was James's best friend, and at least near equal with a wand. He would be the obvious choice.

********* One more plot hole for the series. Plus, how did anyone know where the potters lived? Peter was still alive and presumable still the secret keeper. I get that people he told might have know the secret, but how did Snape? Or how did the rest of the wizarding world? Did the secret fail when the potters died? It didn't happen when Sirius died. Grimmauld pl still was under the secret. Just something I thought of just now.

Would make for a good prompt. The secret was still up so no one could find the potters house. After James and Lily were killed, the only people who could access the house was Sirius, Peter and Voldemort. It's lost forever with the bodies of James and Lily still in the house where they died. Anyone who could've found them were either in jail or on the run.

********** The fiddy charm on the Potter House was "The secret of where James, Lily and Harry Potter are hiding...." while Sirius' house was "The Location of the Order of the Phoenix is...."

Once James & Lily die the secret is no longer necessary whereas Sirius dying doesn't impact the Fiddy charm because he wasn't the secret. Oh wait, they stop using GrimmyPL as HeadQuarters after Sirius died anyways...well I almost had a canon explanation that wasn't "JKR said so".

That's not true. They still used it as HQ until Dumbledore (the secret keeper) died. Dumbledore came to Harry at the beginning of HBP and asked if they can continue using it as he inherited it. Mundungus stole things there during 6th year (that's how the locket came to Umbridge) - and he probably did it while he was there as an order member.

********* Because while there wasn't ever a trial for Sirius, there was an investigation. And during this investigation Dumbledore stated that Sirius was the secret keeper (he said so in PoA) - and while Dumbledore didn't know about the switch he knew how long they were under the Fidelius-charm. And while Fudge was not minister at the time, he was part of the team that arrested Sirius, so he (and those who were on the team) probably heard that statement from Dumbledore.

** I don't think it helps in the creation of this section, that sometimes we don't take into part that James and Lily must have trusted Peter with their lives, not to mention the mauraders, they were best friends growing up. So the whole clause in the will stating the secret keeper being Peter and in the case something goes wrong would probably have never crossed their minds. And then there's Lily and Petunia, from the books Lily came across as kind hearted and loving, she would never have been so cruel to specifically bar off her sister as Harry's guardian in the case of an accident, Lily would have prayed in her heart that Petunia in the case of Harry having no other fit guardians would be kind enough to take him in and love Harry as her nephew. I feel like a more heart rendering plea from Lily to petunia in the will to look kindly upon the boy she left behind in the will would have been more believable and emotional for the readers too. And if anyone ends up going for the abuse! Dursley style fic the whole idea of Lily having faith in petunia in the will would probably end up being more ironic and soul destroying.
