In the style of [[https://fanfiction.net/s/11973480][A New World to Conquer]] or [[https://fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]].

Thanking y'all in advance.


** I have not read either of those so I don't know if it's in their style or not, but the Diary merging with the Scar to take over is the starting point for the hopefully-still-WIP linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19028845/chapters/45193261]]).
