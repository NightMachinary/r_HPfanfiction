Lemons?dark themes? Any-any thing?? Add the link or tittle ok cause I'm soooooo out of ffs to read and I want to try the dark part of ffs


** [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] gets pretty dark towards the end.

Hermione's timeturner shatters during an accident in Potions class, trapping the entirety of Hogwarts in a Groundhog Day-style endlessly repeating loop. Hermione and Snape are the only ones who recognise what is happening. I recomend checking out both endings.

** I'm fond of linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) - it's a great dystopia where Voldemort captures Harry and essentially wins. The surviving Order of the Phoenix has to find a way to upset his takeover, which seems to be supported by ten times as many wizards as they were expecting to fight. Hermione-centric, HP/HG, and though the Weasleys aren't bashed, they suffer as much as anyone in this harsh landscape.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** There's the one on Archive where Umbridge forces the entire DA to rape her. I think that's as disturbing as it gets. And since it is explicit, no link (rule 5).

If anyone feels like they have enough brain bleach on hand, search for Hermione Granger/Dumbledore's army and set the rating to explicit. And keep that brain bleach ready.
