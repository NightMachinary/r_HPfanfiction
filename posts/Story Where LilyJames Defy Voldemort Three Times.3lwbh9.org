I'm trying to find a well written story where Lily and James defy Voldemort. Unfortunately, most stories I encounter are about their time at Hogwarts or before their death. I haven't been able to find one about this topic (which I'm actually surprised about). I'm not picky about rating, as long as if it's relatively well written. Thanks!
