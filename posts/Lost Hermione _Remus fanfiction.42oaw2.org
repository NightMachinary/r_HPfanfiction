It followed along the lines of Hermione having a time turner accident (or something along those lines!) and going back to the maruderer's timeline. She and Remus became a couple and she becomes pregnant. Hermione returns to the normal timeline somehow and returns into I think Grimmauld Place where Remus comes running in saying that he had been waiting for her to return and was worried that she never would.

Phew! If anyone could help me find it I will love you forever. I think I first read it on fanfiction.net

** I've read a couple hermione remus time travel stories, but none with that ending/pregnancy. I stopped reading one, forget the name but remember the author. Did hermione ever obliviate remus in this one? I quit one that had that, can't believe in a romance where one obliviated the other.

I'll look up the title later if that sounds familiar you
