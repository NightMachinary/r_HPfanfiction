I was thinking of audioreading some fanfiction I enjoy (with permission from the author, of course.) and posting it on SoundCloud or YouTube. Some of the fics I will audioread are (I will definitely add to the list as I find more I enjoy)

The Psychic Serpent Series NoahPhantoms Albus Potter series The Arithmancer (and Lady Archimedes) Ron's Secret (Just kidding, but I'll link it anyway) linkffn(5523410) The Accidental Animagus Not From Others Backwards With Purpose: Book 1 The Golden Age The Best Revenge Emperor Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation The Alexandra Quick Series

They will definitely have to be well-written, and in the future, I will also take requests into consideration.

What do you all think of this idea?


** I think if you can put together a number of people to read the various characters to turn it into an audioplay, it would be very nice.

** I think it's a really good idea as long as you've got permission and link to everything. I think ao3 has audio support? I'd look into that, too.

** This is called podficcing, and it's not an especially new idea, though it's totally a cool thing for people who like to listen to podfics. [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Podfic/works][This is the podfic tag on Ao3]].

** I "read" my fanfics through audio by using text to speech software and at high speed. I don't know if I would use this service but that's just me.

** I can download a story, email it to my phone, bring it up in cool reader program on my phone, then listen to it with ivona text to speech .

I am not sure I need you to read stories to me.

- I don't think I am using the best programs available but I have gotten use to them.
