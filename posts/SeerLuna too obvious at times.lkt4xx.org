I'm just saying, I love Luna as a seer and I really could see it as a possibility but the way that some fics go about it just seems to odd or obvious. I think I've seen a pjo crossover fic that involved Luna calling the seven by their parents symbols or calling Nico “ghost king.” I mean, might as well outright say she's a seer instead of trying to tease it, in my opinion.

*** Canon Luna is a lot closer to a proud conspiracy theorist then her fans want to admit. The reason I don't like seer Luna is that it's kinda missing the interesting point of her character. Luna is a violently eccentric individual, so much so that it is embarrassing to be in public with her, she is also a selfless and kind friend. Luna is a lesson that you should make friends with good people, not cool ones.

** Why is Luna a seer when she needed a pair of glasses to see the wrakspurts?

** Oh my gosh I hate SEER LUNA fics!!! :( Like every time she first appears and says some "KNOWING" line or gives some "SECRETIVE LOOK" or whatever and harry goes "WHAT?" and I just instantly know she's going to be fanon SEER LUNA and not actual canon Luna who was a normal freaking girl who was a bit of a ditzy conspiracy theorist!!! :( I always drop those fics the instant Luna first shows up and does that crap. I already know it's not a good indicator of anything.

*** Silver linings! At least we get a somewhat early red flag (depending on fics)

*** You really need to spoiler mark this. Not only is this a pretty big spoiler in Book 2 that connects to a lot of other plot points, but you could have easily talked in not-too-specific terms about how POS has a unique and clever take on Luna's abilities that are distinct f/, though in certain respects similar to, Seer!Luna---this /isn't/ one of those cases where you need to spoil something b/c the nature of the thread demands it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
