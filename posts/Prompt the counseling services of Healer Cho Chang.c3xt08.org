Did she grow up to be a grief counselor? Is she renowned as a psychiatric healer? Is she helping other characters work through their poorly-thought-out marriages?

In a fic I'm writing (haven't posted anything for it yet), Cho Chang is a side character. She's mentioned as healer helping prisoners in Azkaban cope with the tortures they faced under the old regime, and laying the foundation for Wizard Prison Reform. I was just wondering if anyone else's imagination wanders in a similar direction.


** I always supported JKR's idea that she ended up in the Muggle relations (I would even like to read GOOD Dudley/Cho stories), but this has some seriously interesting possibilities. Thank you.

Ha, it is actually even biblical. “[God] comes alongside us when we go through hard times, and before you know it, he brings us alongside someone else who is going through hard times *so that we can be there for that person just as God was there for us*.” (2Co 1:4) Our painful experiences and especially experiences how we got through them is something invaluable, which gives us the unique opportunity to help others. She certainly knows that everybody have their own timeline for their grieving, and they need to get time to get through it.

** I've just learned she ended up in muggle relations, but I like your idea better. It seems very fitting for her to work in a field like that, both because of her personality and experiences.

*** Thanks! I recently went through OotP again and every time she's described as bursting into tears I'm like, “Well yeah, considering what she's going through, that makes sense!”
