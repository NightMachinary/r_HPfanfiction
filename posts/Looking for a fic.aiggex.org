Hey, I was reading a fic called Making a Merlin by SnitchesGetWitches yesterday, and now it seems that both the story and the account it was posted under have been deleted, did anyone manage to save the story or know where else I can read it?

It was on [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=2049]]

with this person apparently being the author? [[https://www.ficforums.com/index.php/topic,95626.msg100898.html#msg100898]]

but these are the only things I can find for it, maybe my Google-Fu isnt good enough to find it though.

[Edit] so I found a cached version of a couple chapters via google, but would still appreciate a download or another website to read it on.
