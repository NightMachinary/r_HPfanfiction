Context: I'm going to run a tabletop Harry Potter game! It's only for one person, and she chose to play Hermione.

Here's the thing. She's only read the books and watched the movies. I want to slip in some of the great tropes that have been developed by the fanfiction community. I was wondering what everyone's favourite tropes are.

Here're the restrictions:

1) Cannot counter canon (book/movie). She doesn't read pottermore, but I'd like her to feel like any lore she learns COULD fit with the books and movies she's seen.

2) It can't (explicitly) include R+/ mature content. Nothing against it, but I don't think she'd enjoy it.

Some I already am excited to include are the blood of Atlantis, Daphne Greengrass as neutral chilly Slytherin, and Hogwarts being less attached to reality the higher you climb in the castle.

What tropes would you want to include for a character that loves history and lore?

Tl:dr I'm running an HP game and I want to include your favourite fan fiction tropes!


** If you want to make it canon compliant, I think [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling][Rowling's Pottermore Articles]] would be the best source.

Stuff like Merlin being a Slytherin, the invitations to Hogwarts being written by a enchanted quill in an enchanted book, the entrance to the Hufflepuff dorm being two among many barrels you enter through tapping in the rhythm of â€˜Helga Hufflepuff' or else be drenched in Vinegar or there being a pack of highly intelligent wolves in the Forbidden parents who are the offspring of two transformed werewolves.

*** Yeah, I'm not too worried about canon compliance.

I've never heard of the intelligent wolves in the woods, thank you! That's excellent.

** Blood of Atlantis?

Also, wands work badly for you if they haven't chosen you, and wandlore in general.

-The castle is bigger inside than outside and sometimes outside reference doesn't work.

-Some dragons understand parseltongue.

-Slytherin's Basilisk had a name.

-The Chamber has stairs.

-There are translation spells.

  The Chamber has stairs.

I laughed at this.

The blood of Atlantis trope is that wizard myth/ early history says magical folk came from Atlantis.

Thanks for the suggestions! I love the idea of dragons speaking parseltongue. Would that extend the power to other reptiles, like lizards?

What fanon wandlore would you suggest?

**** Most wandlore is not on the books, but on Pottermore, BUT, you could increase the number of woods and cores, as long as it fits the story.

For example, some people add regional woods to the list of wand woods, AND more cores(which is canon because Ollivander says HE uses only 3 kinds, in Pottermore at least two others are mentioned(horned serpent and basilisk horn).

****** Ah, but that's from the books, there's also thestral hair from the Elder Wand(and Elder seems to be a valid wand too).

My favorite is Aspen(even if the site says mine would be Alder), it's silvery-white and it's considered to be the duellist's wand wood.

** This is often up to the author but I think it adds to the world is other languages have different words for spells. It kind of allows the world to feel much larger.

*** Oh, yeah. Good point.

I'm not much of a fan of the idea that Magic works off of faux Latin words. I always like the idea words are for directing the casters magic.
