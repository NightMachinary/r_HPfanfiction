I'll go first with two of mine:

My favorite Snape comes from the Inspector Carrow series. It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inspector Carrow and the God Emperorless Heathens]] and has Snape getting ptsd'd into an alright guy.

My favorite Harry comes from [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Dear_Tom/Dear_Tom/][Dear Tom]] because he's not the heir of Merlin Potryndufflerinclaw nee nee nee nee NEEEEEEE and solves his problems through passive agressive writing.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I cannot for the life of me find the fic, but it was Dumbledore teaching Fem!harry how to make antidotes and detect various posions, as well as pureblood etiquette by inviting her to dinner. Literally the funniest scenes of any fic I have ever read, simply because Dumbledore was so perfectly twinkly that it worked. It was the kind of thing where I was like this is so completely surreal that only fucking Dumbledore could pull it off and I fucking loved it.

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

** The characters from linkffn(Nocturnal by forcedInduction)

Ron is the comedic friend. Chess master in the making. Indulges in and plays with food. Hilarious antics in general. Read the Forbidden Forest scene and don't laugh. You failed.

Harry is the unsure leader who goes with the flow. Affectionate towards Hermione. Intensely loyal to and appreciative of those close to him.

Hermione is the sometimes insecure brain of the operations. Affectionate towards Harry. Thinks of others first like Harry but acts quicker.

Dumbledore is a badass with a past so amazing that half the time he isn't believed. Slowly going senile but his odd stories and habits make diagnosis difficult. Best friends with Ron in another time.

TL;DR - Read the damn fic!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
