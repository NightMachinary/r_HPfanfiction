And definitely more Harry/Ciri pairings. Like seriously.


** There are like a couple, or even less. the only ones I've read are (quality may vary):

linkffn(12343855) - which is flameraiser, nothing awesome but average, I suppose.

linkffn(11301154) - this one is not so great.

linkffn(11639174) - this had potential

linkffn(11804414) - this is OCs with Harry Potter names in the Witcher universe

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

  Having a deranged dark wizard after you is not too great. Having something you cannot quite explain after you in a strange world where the kindest fate is to find yourself on the wrong end of a sword makes that first thing seem like child's play. Geralt/Yennefer, Harry/? Rated M. Because there's no other way to write a Witcher story.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

** TBH i find it weird that noone tried (or at least I haven't seen one) to make a cameo of Witchers in HP lore as monster hunters of old in Eastern Europe. It could work even nicer with some uplift project, using modernised witcher creation techniques to magify muggles.

**** Eh. Witcher is at its absolute best when it plays a pastiche for fairytales and common fantasy tropes. There isn't much of thematical overlap between franchises, at least for me.

Sure, you can have a story with Witcher characters in HP world or vice versa, but it just won't feel right.
