** Minor ones but:

- Riding the Hogwarts Express no matter where you're geographically from\\
- Nobody tells their children about the Sorting Hat. Not even the Malfoys\\
- Ghosts have deathday parties, and I could imagine a family with a ghost in it also celebrating it\\
- There's the smaller tradition of keeping any magical schools specific location a secret. It likely used to be based in genuine need to stop other schools stealing their secrets but now it's just tradition

I imagine that in typical Wizarding families, a child's first occurrence of accidental magic is treated similarly to (if not more importantly than) a child's first step. I can imagine parents getting together and bragging about it.\\

  On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. *But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.*

Apparition is pretty much instantaneous and doing it anything accidentally always feels different then doing it on purpose - or at least I think so.

Jumping or flying, I figure you're gonna feel the height difference. Of course all of my school were 3 floors tall so... I've always pictured him having a ways to go, lol

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve]]

#+begin_quote
  Traditionally, a witch or wizard's Pensieve, like their wand, is buried with them, as it is considered an intensely personal artefact; any thoughts or memories left inside the Pensieve are likewise interred with their owner, unless he or she has requested otherwise. *The Hogwarts Pensieve, however, belongs not to any individual but to the school. It has been used by a long line of headmasters and headmistresses, who have also left behind their life experience in the form of memories.* This forms an invaluable library of reference for the headmaster or headmistress of the day.
#+end_quote

And except for the Elder Wand(which was buried with its owner) no character is seen using a wand that belonged to a dead person, both Ron and Neville used the wands of family members who were still alive.

Have you read canon? Wands get damaged all the time, and Charlie works with dragons so its not like there aren't plenty of chances for his wand to get damaged. And Ron explicitly calls it Charlies wand, the implication is that Charlies wand got damaged and he got himself a new one and gave his little brother his old one, things like that happen all the time.

******* If his wand was damaged to the point of needing a new one, it would have been useless for Ron to use. And if it was his original wand he wouldn't have given it away even if it was broken - Harry kept his snapped wand because he didn't want to get rid of it.\\
Charlie graduated the year before Ron went to Hogwarts. Not really much time to damage the wand with dragons and pass it on over the course of a summer. He called it Charlies wand because that's where he got it. That doesn't mean Charlie didn't get it from someone else

******** It was damaged enough that you could see the unicorn hair in it, but it was still functional, its understandable why he'd want a new one, but his brother also needed one and his family doesn't have much money, its perfectly understandable why he would give it to Ron. Do you not have siblings? Stuff like that is very common.

And just to be clear, Charlies age in canon doesn't make sense, like there is not even a point arguing about it, Rowling herself contradicted herself outside of the books multiple times, and in the books it also doesn't make sense. The only thing we know for sure is that hes younger then Bill, but wasn't in Hogwarts long enough for Gryffindor to not get the Quidditch cup for multiple years because of his absence.

As it is there is no indication that the Wand dint just belong to Charlie, it wouldn't even make sense to give him a second hand wand when hes only the second child to attend Hogwarts, meaning his family shouldn't have been near as poor then.

********* If we're going to be on about canon contradictions then I hardly see why my not wanting to accept something entirely absent of any source material is a problem.

Hogwarts Mystery firmly puts his age at graduating the year before Harry starts. I'm sure many people will want to dismiss that, but the same can go for pottermore

The Weasley family is poor in general, and there's nothing to say whether or not Bill's first wand was a hand me down or not - Molly had two brothers die so they could have very well both gotten hand me down wands.

I don't really see how a wand could get worn down to exposing the core through any damage other than over time. If it had been from working with dragons then the entire wand would be scorched, or scratched. Saying its worn down is a classic way of connotating age and wear, rather than some sort of damage.

You mean except the one person whose grave we saw actually being buried with his wand, in addition to there being no mention of anyone using a dead persons wand? Also this is a contradiction because Rowling is bad at math, those are typically ignored, because they dont really affect the story and because there are so many of them.

Thats different, Pottemore was literally written by Rowling, if you start accepting video games as canon, nothing will make sense, because they're not even consistent between each other.

The Weasleys are poor because they have to many children, we clearly see in the books that they are quite able to buy new things, but Ron generally gets handed down stuff because hes the youngest.

And there is still no indication that Bill and Charlies wands were handed down.

Wands are sticks made out of wood, just falling down with one on you can damage them quite a bit, as we see multiple times in canon.

*********** Dumbledore had an explicit reason to be buried with his wand though. He wanted the power of the Elder Wand to die with him, which included taking it with him. Not shown in said scene is the pensieve, which is only said to belong to the school out of the books.

Sure, pottermore was written by Rowling, but not everything on there had to be written. Even without buying into the overdone Rowling jokes, death of an author is in full effect. In regards to a lot of fandoms, people will take information contained in a new installment to be superior to anything stated outside of them.\\
Charlie being Hogwarts Mysteries age is fine. Just assume he quit the Quidditch team in fourth year or something because training was taking away his sneak into the forbidden forest time

Sure, falling on a wand can snap it. I really don't see some kind of accident that will wear away a part of the wood without causing any other kind of damage, though. Like I said, that's the kind of damage that implies time and wear, not careless accidents

There's no indication that their wands were handed down, but there's also no indication that they weren't. Based on what's presented in the books there is a precedent for them getting second hand wands (Ron and Neville).

The only precedent for wands being buried with the owner is the Elder Wand - and that's something that had plenty of other reasons to be buried with him
