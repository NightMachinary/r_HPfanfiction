** - Harry and Ginny had sex in HBP during their "long walks around the lake" that Harry spends so much time thinking about in DH.

- Aurors don't work in teams or have any kind of standard procedures, nor a hierarchical structure (beyond a Head Auror). They're less like police and more like legally authorised bounty hunters, each one with their own style, personally-made tools, and independence to go after their own leads. In certain circumstances they may be roped into more mundane work such as protecting the Minister or, in extreme cases, acting almost like soldiers, but their main focus is stealth, pursuit, and personal combat.

- The Ministry of Magic came about as a result of the English civil war and the Glorious Revolution, in which royalist wizards (the Warlock's Council, part of the Privy Council) fought Parliamentarian wizards. This inter-wizard combat instigated by Muggle royalty was one of the factors leading to wizards wanting to split with the Muggle world. The Parliamentarians won, strengthening the desire to split, as it was mainly the traditionalist royalists who supported continued links to the Muggle world.

- Merlin founded the International Confederation of Wizards. It is for this and other politically progressive acts that he is remembered, not for being some extremely powerful wizard. This British connection explains why Britain has such a strong voice in the ICW, such as British political events strongly influencing the adoption of the Statute of Secrecy (JKR said one of the instigating factors was William and Mary's refusal to grant wizards rights).

- The world is not uniformly magical, with some nations having significantly more wizards relative to Muggle population. Britain is one of these areas. There are 10 others. Each of the 11 has its own school of magic. The 11 are: Britain (Hogwarts), France (Beauxbatons), Albania (Durmstrang), Russia (Koldovstoretz), Japan (Mahoutokoro), New England (Salem), Egypt (Uagadou), Brazil (name unknown), Peru (headcanon), India (headcanon), China (headcanon).

Hmmm, you could have implied this in /The One He feared/ but chose not to, I think. In any case, this is my head canon too. In fact, I always thought Harry's first time was with Ginny while Ginny's was with Dean. Neither Ginny nor Dean seem like the type to wait to do anything physical, and it just makes more sense that way, even if most HG authors disagree.

  “Well?” Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. “How was it?”

  Harry considered for a moment.

  “Wet,” he said truthfully.

  Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.

  “Because she was crying,” Harry continued heavily.

  “Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading slightly. “Are you that bad at kissing?”

I'm pretty sure Ron thought of a different meaning of "Wet" too at first -- funny I never caught that before. Also, poor Harry. He had to wait almost till seventeen to kiss a girl who wasn't a sobbing wreck. Let's hope his wet kisses with Ginny were more pleasant than the one with Cho.

Agents of their 'government' track down muggleborns and take them away from the muggle squalor that they otherwise might interfere with. There is no element of choice in this.

***** I'm not a fan of the idea of ley lines, but I'm not opposed to the idea that certain locations are more magical than others. In those locations, more wizards would be born. This is canon-compatible, as places are referred to as highly magical in the books. The ambiguity is whether they're inherently so or made so by historical magical activity of wizards. But either way works, because the latter becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy: wherever wizards congregate in high concentrations, ever more wizards are born.

An alternative is that China had a wizard-cull at some point in its history. As it has a good proportion of Asia's population and a history of a strong central state, this kinda works, but you'd have to have some wizards surviving -- the wizards who helped the Muggles kill off all the other wizards.

Of course, there's always pure racism.

Also, just because the muggle world has become more heterogenous in the past couple centuries doesn't necessarily mean the magical world would do the same. A lot of the impetus behind migration is hardship in people's place of origin, much of which magic helps alleviate.

** I wonder about the infrastructure of the wizarding world. Where does there food come from? Who grows it, how do they fit into the society? Maybe they just buy it from muggles. Are there other British magic schools? I doubt it, primarily because muggleborns don't get multiple acceptance letters. I imagine there would be a strong master apprentice tradition or family trade (floo repair, brooms, wandmaking, potion supplies). And according to cannon students don't have any health classes so I guess St Mungoes teaches anatomy, physiology, obgyn, triage, emergency response, etc all on their own? Also, I hope arithmancy doubles as a basic accounting class. Yea, the Knight bus is fast, but unless it is messing with time (is it?) it wouldn't be able to serve the population needs. Even if the population really is tiny. And I think it is tiny. With hogwarts having so few teachers and smallish sized classes it is unlikely that they have a few hundred students enrolled. Maybe there are hundreds magic families who forgo hogwarts (too expensive? Trade school?), but I doubt it. I have read fics estimating the population around 75,000 which seems way, way to big. Last thought, consider how squibs are treated. Now we don't see any characters with mental disabilities, which is ok, HP is a fantasy novel, it doesn't need to show us every possible demographic (like women, and non-white people in star wars. I guess they are there, we just don't see them much on screen). But unless magic magically magics all babies to be without birth defects, what happens to them? Are they kept? Here is my thought: maybe squibs were babies with birth defects and their magic exausted itself in correcting the physical disabilities. This could explain the fannon idea of purebloods having more squibs: they inbreed, resulting in disabilities, but magic heals them, which puts a strain on their magic abilities, making them squibs. Hmm.

Russia formed in the mid 1500s and then started expanding east through Siberia. Would wizards? I imagine there's a vast expanse where no one with magical abilities ever goes except to maintain ward posts to locate Muggleborns.

The difficulty lies in the school itself.

Like come on! She was eleven with a murdering sociopath with sadistic traits and habits in her HEAD. There is NO WAY IN HELL SHE IS FINE AFTER THAT. That being said, in my opinion, the horcrux idea was not put together well enough for a work that was already set like JKR's. A dark ritual would have been better. Like tying their life to that of others. For example, tie Tom's life to Dumbledore, Bellatrix, and Nagini. He got Dumbledore's blood during one of their multiple battles, Bellatrix freely gave it, and Nagini was the same as Bella.
