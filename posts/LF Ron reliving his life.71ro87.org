I've seen many fics where Harry gets a second chance in life. Are there any where Ron gets a second chance?

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/][Backward with Purpose I]], linkffn(4101650): Harry, Ginny, and Ron went back to their first year.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]], linkffn(6452481): Harry and Ron went back from their 60s to their 4th Year. They spent lots of effort pissing people off around them (mostly Dumbledore, Hermione, and McG).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4778694/1/][To End in Serenity]], linkffn(4778694): The Trio travelled back to the end of Year 3. Extreme Dumbledore and Snape bashing.

--------------

Ron lone time travels are rare, and the very few decent ones seem to be abandoned.

  The war's not over. Voldemort created one last Horcrux and sent it back in time, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have to travel back to destroy it and prevent that timeline's Voldemort from rising once and for all, all while doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HP/OFC, RW/HG, RL/NT.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

#+begin_quote
  Ronald Weasley follows in his father's footsteps, pushing the envelope of magical application to muggle science. As the forerunner of his new magical art, Ron is forced to make a universe-altering choice-one that spits in the face of magic, science, and logic. With a magic-generated Tipler cylinder and a dash of exotic matter, the world's first Technomancer travels back in time.

** Hmm...it's not the same thing, but linkffn(6428997) is a one-shot that's...it's basically just the author discussing the causes of Ron's actions and motives, using quotes from the books, disguised as a fanfiction.

Nonetheless, you may enjoy it. It's short, readable, and is a decent character check on Ron that's bash-free.
