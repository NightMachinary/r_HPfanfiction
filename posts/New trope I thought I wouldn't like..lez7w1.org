I recently read a female Harry fic for the first time and I found it was a nice change of pace. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to any female Harry fics that they like.

Also please don't judge but I'm a fan of TMR and Harry so if you have one that also has that pairing that's preferable to other pairings.

Preferably long fics. Maybe a bit of smut too.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (deviation from canon is exponential, but slow to start). See first chapter for preface discussion of background/differences from canon. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated.

** Pasted from a previous comment I've made.

Fem!Harry is my favorite! All of these are either complete or ongoing.

This is the most canon-compliant Slytherin or fem Harry I've read. Everything she does I can see Harry doing. Also super well-written. The literary allegories are to die for.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822]])

Darker version of the one above. Harry is not a good person. The ships listed are less ships and more of how these men affected her life. (The Sirius one broke my heart.)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820]])

More of an AU. Ongoing. It's absolutely hilarious, has a great plot, and features the most awkward and self-sufficient Harry I've ever met. I legit scream-laughed at the ending to the latest chapter.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317]])

Very AU, but a pretty canon Harry. She's a total tomboy who is super into quidditch and collects snakes. Multiple horcruxes are running around, Voldemort is running the government through the shadows, Sirius Black has a daughter that was raised in a nunnery, and Snape is just trying to keep Harry alive.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
