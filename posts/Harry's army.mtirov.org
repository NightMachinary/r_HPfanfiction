Any fanfics where harry trains the DA as his army (or any sort of army) against either Dumbledore, Voldemort or the ministry Mabey against all


** linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

My fic has the DA as emphatically not Dumbledore's Army. (They're jokingly calling it the Dragon Army instead.) It also has Harry vs: Dumbledore, The Ministry, Voldemort, and several other factions. He's certainly building up a real army right now, but until he can fight everyone at once, he's trying to avoid attention. Poor Harry though , 'Potter Luck' is a thing in my fic.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.

** In my crack fic Harry Potter is the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos. And in the fifth chapter he wages war against all permanent members of the United Nations with an endless army of robotic guards.
