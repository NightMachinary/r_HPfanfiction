*** Or the slave marriage contract trope, where Bellatrix is magically compelled to do all the bad stuff she did. Of course, Azkaban then breaks that slave bond.

It can make for a good plot, certainly, but it's not very easy to write. I've read a number of stories where the author fumbles trying to justify it.

**** In my sketches of it, Bellatrix is very pragmatic when joining the Death Eaters. Its what her family wants, she really doesn't like mudbloods and its a way to power within a hierarchy that is mostly made up of skill and usefulness. Plus she does have a sadistic streak, combined with a certain ruthlessness. I assumed Azkaban just twisted that pragmatism into fanaticism.

So, she isn't innocent - but she also isn't quite as fucked up as we see her in later books.

***** My thoughts were along similar lines as well.

I do think canon Bellatrix was far saner before being put into Azkaban. But also, she didn't renounce Voldemort when on trial in 1981. She didn't cry Imperius. This indicates that she either wasn't sane, even then, or has a bravery streak. I've seen some stories say it's a bravery streak, and then use it to argue she could also be brave - in a /good/ way. Then that slave bond marriage contract comes into play in those stories.

JK actually left Bellatrix fairly open ended. She doesn't have much of a backstory, and what little she does have leaves many interpretations of /how/ she got there open for debate. I think Bellatrix, even canon Bellatrix, is one of the few batshit crazy characters that has any potential for being redeemed.

Of course, it's far easier to write a Bellatrix that is similar to canon Bellatrix. By using her canon characterization, you don't need to make up a fairly detailed backstory on how exactly she was good, and then turned Dark involuntarily. I enjoy reading both characterizations, even more poorly written ones.

****** Bellatrix was obviously a fanatic, and like Ginny, were willing to do pretty much everything for their 'hero'.

Both were aggressive and powerful warriors who were reasonably intelligent.

The key differences were their upbringings and the cause they decided to follow.

The Blacks might be more prone to mental instability, while the Weasleys were more prone to temper tantrums.

Ginny's Wand had Yew wood (same as Voldemort's) and highly likely Dragon Heartstring core (not confirmed). That was a dangerous combination.

It does leave /how/ exactly they became so fanatical open to one's own favored interpretation.

I think the Bad!Molly/Ginny trope came from this idea. If Bellatrix could be magically compelled to follow Voldemort, than could Ginny be magically compelled to like Harry? I wouldn't be surprised if both tropes originated around the same time.

I actually hope JK never really expands on this. The nature vs nurture debate when it comes to Bellatrix and Ginny is a very interesting and compelling one.

Then of course she, being so delicate, uses up all her strength giving life to their child, and dies. He either turns back into a curmudgeon, leaving the child to be raised by servants until it reaches a certain age and manages to reignite the spark in him, and he becomes a proper father and learns to smile again.

Or he raises it to be just like Luna, and takes it on Nargle hunts.

We actually knew something about Astoria Greengrass and Susan Bones. Astoria was not a pureblood elitist, and could be characterized as a second Sirius. Her rebellious streak came later and she was still sorted into Slytherin though. Susan Bones was a CORE DA member, her family suffered deeply under Voldemort, and these two facts alone could give writers a lot to work with.

Daphne was the only OC in that pack. Even then, of the Slytherins in Harry's Year, she appeared to be the ONLY ONE who had never attacked the Trio verbally or physically. If my impression was true, then this fact alone would be quite indicative.

**** Well, the point is that in this society, much like in modern society, very few women are /just/ 'the wife of X'.

That wife of a dirt poor tenant sheep farmer could be a world-class lawyer or doctor or artist or scientist in her own right, while her husband pursued his career just out of passion, or as an aside while being a house husband. Or, they could both be poor, and in love, and happy - this is a universe where magic is possible, and some of our happiest canon characters have no money or social standing to speak of.

Another one had preternaturally mighty wizards and witches, and harems (here in the proper sense of "household", rather than "sex commune") were how witches who weren't mighty in this way could find protection of a mighty wizard, while men had to fend for themselves, or, like the Weasleys, act as a sort of clan. That story was much better but I can't remember either title.

Yeah, there's no way witches wouldn't have equal rights when they can hex the bollocks off anyone who dared say otherwise.

On that note it should be every witch's right to have a harem composed of whomever they can seduce irrespective of gender, just like a wizard!

Remember, Voldy was convinced that this was a Tobias Snape situation where Riddle Sr. abandoned the pregnant Merope to die in the gutter upon learning she was a witch.

**** Actually, there is one way I see Hermione/Draco working.

Imagine Draco actually thinking about blood purity between years 1 and 2 and he comes to the conclusion that it is wrong because a muggleborn is outscoring every pureblood and that is nothing unusual. His halfblood, bloodtraitor cousin actually has an increadibly rare magical talent (metamorph) while half of the purebloods are rather stupid (Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle).

So therefore instead of calling Hermione a mudblood second year he befriends her (maybe in secret to keep his family at bay). That friendship slowly grows into more (maybe by the Yule Ball).

In the end Draco goes against his father and blood purity when they come out (and I can see Narcissa liking or disliking it, that could go both ways).
