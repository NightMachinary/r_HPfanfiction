Just as the title says. Also I don't care if it sticks to canon (pairings, Horcruxes, or otherwise), but since I recently got turned off of Harry/Ginny, I wouldn't mind a story that makes me like them again.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

** It's Harry/Hermione not Harry/Ginny, but one of my all-time favorite stories actually uses the OOCness as a plot point. Not the PotionMistress!Ginny sort, but forces Hermione (and Ron) to realize their behavior throughout HBP is just unacceptable, especially given Harry just lost Sirius and needed them then more than ever. My only issue is that the initial motivation for Hermione's conscious interest in Harry is a bit ham-fisted, but it develops nicely.
