My favourite fanfictions to read are Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Tom. Preferably with a darker Harry rather than Voldemort being nice. Anyone got any recommendations?

And I'd /love/ one with Harry as a Death Eater - can't seem to find anything good there.


** linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries) is a great "darker Harry" TRHP. It's my favorite.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works?fandom_id=136512][The Fictionist]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1363088/brainstorm1001][brainstorm1001]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Athy/works?fandom_id=136512][Athey]] are good writers of TRHP/LVHP.

To add to CrucioCup's wonderful link, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/30y5jh/does_anybody_know_good_lvhp_or_tmrhp/][the whole thread]] that it is in is excellent. Nice to know there are so many TRHP/LVHP shippers on reddit.

*** Even though it's super-duper long, I read "Their Verdict of Vagaries" twice because I just missed being in that story. So good.

Also, Brigade's fics aren't shipping fics (yet...) but they do feature Harry as a death eater =D never tried this before so let's hope I do it right... linkffn(Enveloped in the Darkness by Brigade)

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.
