Dumbledore managed to get one of Tom's old essays with his signature to enter him in the tournament so that he'll lose his magic if he doesn't come to Hogwarts.

This one-shot chapter has something similar, Harry unearths a binding magical artifact and uses it to exterminate his enemies. It's crack.

**** But it gives you room to play: You can have breaking the contract do nothing (or cost money or something), but have Tom think he is at risk for his magic if he doesn't come.

Or you can have everyone think it will do this, and be disappointed when it does nothing. Queue an angry Harry "Whatta ya mean I didn't have to face a Dragon!"

Honestly, it is a bit hard to believe that the wizarding world has a way to remove magic and A) they don't use it as punishment when they have a soul sucking prison and door of death and B) It is used as a 'boogyman' in the final books to warrant mass murder of those accused of being able to steal magic.

I know a lot of stories go with 'it is only the Goblet that has that kind of power', but then you get into the whole 'And you use it on children??'

***** What can I say? Wizards are stupid.

Magic degrades the mind, according to my headcanon. The older and more pure the line, the worse and faster the effect. That's why halfbloods are op.

*** I think the words "binding magical contract" were used. This was two books before the Unbreakable Vow was explained to us, but you can see why people jump to that conclusion once we learned about the latter.

  Hermione realizes that some nonsense will inevitably befall Harry on Halloween 1994 and decides to soften the blow by inviting two more unwilling Champions to the Tournament: Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle. [Parody. Crack. Oneshot. Ron, Dumbledore, and Fudge bashing.]
