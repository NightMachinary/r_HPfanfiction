Not quite the same, but a mad scientist he is.

** Listing all basilisk eyes Harry which I can remember for anybody interested.

Neither of the fics I am listing give Harry killing curse eyes by ritual but by other methods. And in these stories, they are plot points but not a very big part of the stories.

Linkffn(Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews) is a WBWL story where Harry acquires basilisk eyes by becoming an animagus.

Linkffn(Basilisk Born by Ebenchild) has Harry getting basilisk characteristics because of his heritage. The author based his magic system on the fact that magic is acquired from magical creatures.

Throwing in another similar OP power just because you seem to be the kind of guy who will like it. (This is a relatively short but enjoyable one shot.)

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Harry Potter had always been told he was extraordinary. It was his capacity for love according to Dumbledore, and his incredible luck according to Voldemort. But what if it was neither...? Witness the true Power He Knows Not...
