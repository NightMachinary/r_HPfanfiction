I've re-read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021]]) for the nth time and I've re-read Concentric Wavelengths ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths]]) so many times that I've lost count. So I'm looking for pics that have Grindelwald in them, either as a mentor or an influence or something like that. My only request is no slash (apart from the Dumbledore/ Grindelwald pairing, of course). Thanks!

Before you ask/ comment, I don't care if you're homosexual or bisexual or a trans-sexual alien from Mars, but Harry having Voldemort's lovechild is just WRONG.

I don't give a fuck if I'm offending your PC/ social justice loving sensibilities. Some things should not exist and reading about Voldemort "possessing" Harry and calling him "pet" or something is an insult to any person who likes to read. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir]] - I actually read all of it and its sequel. It had good ideas, but I just couldn't take the MPREG BS anymore. So no, I'm, not talking out of my ass).

And before you say anything, a good friend of mine is gay, another is bi and I have nothing against the LGBT community. I just despise yaoi fangirls and think that they should do us all a favor and die in a fire. You want to write about Harry and Draco boinking? Fine, but how about you take a few intro to fiction courses first?

Finally, sorry about the short rant, but whenever I ask for recs without slash, (on this site or otherwise) I'm always asked if/why I don't like gay people. So yeah, this rant was a pre-emptive thing.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** I have trouble opening the first link for "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" I have registered successfully and waited for the Sorting Hat forum post to be approved, but it says that I can't access the "Work By Author. You will first have to contribute to the community before you gain access" Any way I can find the story w/ another link or if I just have to lurk around the forums until my time comes?
