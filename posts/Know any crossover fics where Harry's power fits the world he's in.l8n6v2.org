Or just general new crossovers, I've seen other posts like this but they're all 2+ years old

For example shadow of angmar and the last avatar (I think it's called) are some of my favourites that make Harry's magic fit the crossover world

I don't mind about any kind of pairings

Thanks :)


** There's a crossover with Final Fantasy XV that maybe fits this? Harry ends up in Eos during the fight in the DoM.

So, spoiler: in it, Harry's ancestors, apparently, were Lucis Caelum who traveled to Earth. I don't really know the game's story, if this sounds weirdly explained.

It's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18501823/chapters/43844539][Hated You From Hello]] if you want to take a look. I /really/ liked this one. (The second part is ongoing still.)

  Harry Potter meets Cor Leonis. He is not impressed. Neither is the young Insomnian.   The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3”.  He hated him immediately.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!
