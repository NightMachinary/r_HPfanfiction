I remember reading this story on FF but I don't remember the title. Basically it's a Dramione story post DH where Draco is friendly with Potter and Hermione compares all her dates withe her ex Charlie Weasley saying, "it's not Charlie", until Draco.


** Found it, it's Heavy Lies the Crown by luckei1 on FF. Man I forgotten how dark and dramatical this story was.
