I'd quite like if it explores Harry using darker magic like unforgivable curses but doing it for good, not because he's turning evil. Ron struggling with that but still covering for him.


** linkao3(Tales of the Death Hunters: Shades of Anger)

No unforgivables from Harry but still some line crossing or near line crossing at the end.

Is almost exactly what you are looking for except Harry isn't an Auror.

#+begin_quote
  Sun Hunters are soldiers, dedicating their immortal lives to preserve balance on earth. They can never infect humans. While humans are their allies, they must swear loyalty to the Ancients, or spend eternity in exile. Two security officers, a bitter survivalist and his coworker friend prepare to face the strigoi outbreak in New York. Noticed by the Sun Hunters, they must make life-changing choices.
