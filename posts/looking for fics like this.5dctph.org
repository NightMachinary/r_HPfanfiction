Looking for fics like Aethay's Rebirth. One of my favorite unfinished fics.


** Maybe say specifically what aspects of it you like, since many people may not have read it, but if you say the parts you thought were good they may have read other fics with things like that.

** I love that fic! You might like the author The_Fictionist, who wrote linkffn(Fate's Favourite) (which has a really rough first part but then gets really, really good). They've got some other HP/TMR fics that are also pretty good in various stages of completion.
