** My favourite interpretation, which I believe I came up with myself (I've never seen anyone else talk about it), is that the Master of Death thing wasn't a prize that you get for uniting them, it was a prophecy about the person to do it. Harry is the only known survivor of the Killing Curse, and he technically “died” in DH, but was able to return to life via shenanigans. He bested Death twice over.

In short, the one to unite the Hallows won't /become/ the Master of Death, the one to unite the Hallows /is/ the Master of Death.

** It's a myth perpetuated by a children's tale and people feeling there /must/ be something special to it.

  "You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying." - Dumbledore, DH, Chapter 35

I've always been a little baffled at the popularity of supernatural, even God-like MoD!Harry fics, because the meaning of "master of death" is spelled out so clearly in the text (and that meaning is so important to the core values of /Harry Potter/).

*** Well the problem is that that's neither granted by the hallows nor remotely interesting or even a good moral.
