I've read pretty much everything everywhere, and I'm looking for angtsy stuff that isn't that popular. I've read Bex-chan already and a lot of others (I'm terrible with name) I wouldn't mind betrothal fics. (I've read presque toujours pur) I also like Pureblood!Hermione and Slytherin!Hermione and prefer darker fics.


** Have you read Almost Perfect, Almost Yours? My go to fic for literally any Dramione. Would kill to find another fic like it. It's pureblood!Hermione and it starts light and then gets dark and angsty by the middle of the fic.

** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544208199][Water]] was pretty angsty.

I've take it you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][The Bracelet]]? That one was very angsty too.

** If you haven't already read The Fallout by Everythursday, I would go for that. It's really long but well worth the time. One of the few fics I've reread several times.
