Read what's been published of whispers of a raven (WIP) where the apparent pairing will be harry/narcissa

I understand there is a lot of nsfw content for that pairing out there but I was wondering if there might be some actual stories out there that are actual stories not just wank material

*** It is a simple creature, designed to key off of certain keywords like 'nsfw', 'wank', and 'smut', the last of which appears in the word 'transmutation', which triggers false positives more than most. You actually referenced 'nsfw' even though you were aiming to avoid the idea.

  Going back in time was meant to be relatively easy. A sacrifice, but by all means not a big one. Instead, Harry finds himself crossing paths with a Narcissa Black who is so far from what he'd expected that he wonders if he arrived at a different universe rather than a different time. The answer, of course, is that one should never doubt Hermione's spellcasting abilities. Which just might mean that his life is in for some surreal changes.Also, Harry might possibly never recover from having Voldemort flirt with him.
