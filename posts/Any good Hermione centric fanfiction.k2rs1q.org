Hi! I've been searching for good Hermione centric fanfiction for days but I couldn't find any, so here I am. My favourite fanfiction is The Confectionary Chronicles, and I loved Hermione Granger, Demonologist, The Green Girl, The Arithmacer and New Blood. I want: _a magically and intellectually strong Hermione _no Hermione/Snape or /Adults _no Mary Sue Hermione, I want to see her struggling _possibly no Harem _at least 20 000 words. _possibly not a lot of bashing

Supernatural, Sherlock and Marvel crossovers are OK.
