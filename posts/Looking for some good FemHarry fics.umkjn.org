So I joined the Miss Potter Community over at FF.net about three months ago and have since developed a passion for well-written, well-plotted Fem!Harry fics.

Slogging through the interminable dross of self-insert Mary Sue fem!Harrys can be challenging, so I just thought I'd ask the HP reddit crowd for any recommendations they might have.

*What I'd like to see:*

- Readable, grammatically correct English

- A decent plot

- A Fem!Harry born as a girl

- Adequately British terminology

- If romance is included, please make sure the pairing is HP/Fem!HP, or any Male/Fem!HP Female/Fem!HP not listed in the last group of criteria below.

*Things I'd rather not see, but can tolerate:*

- Moderate Mary Sue-age

- Crossovers

- DM/Fem!HP, YoungTR(LV)/Fem!HP

*Things I absolutely don't want to see:*

- Blatant self-inserts

- Hardcore Sues

- Muggle culture zealotry

- Extensive Americanisms

- Canon!Harry is somehow transformed into a woman

- TeenFem!HP/Adult!Males or TeenFem!HP/Adult!Females (i.e no pairings with Dumbledore, McGonagall, Arthur, Molly, Lupin, Sirius, Snape, Lucius, etc etc... You get the idea. Young versions of these characters are fine. Also acceptable if Fem!HP is an adult. Basically, no pedophilia.)

*And that's it really.*

If you need a reference as to the level of quality I'm looking for:

- *Equal and Opposite*, by Amerision

- *A Butterfly Effect*, by SlyGoddess


** I just found [[http://www.patronuscharm.net/s/536/1/][this]] fic, which was started two days ago. It's only one chapter in, but Taure is a very good author, so I'm confident it will turn out quite good.

*** Interesting. Very well-written first chapter, but it's much too early to pass judgement. I'll keep an eye on it, but I do hope Alex develops some character flaws at some point, else she's on the fast-track to Sue Town. Pretty, smart, a metamorphmagus, AND a legilimens (all depicted in the first chapter) will be difficult to swallow without a few negative traits / plot setbacks to balance her out.

I'm guessing it's by the Taure who posted above?

** Yeah, there really aren't any, at least that I've found. The two you mention are the only ones that I'd recommend, particularly Equal and opposite. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly_Evans_and_the_Spiral_Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] would meet your requirements in terms of writing, but it's also one of the most fucked up fics I've ever read so I wouldn't really recommend it.

** There are none that fit your requirements, unfortunately.

If you were to drop the desire for an original plot, then Keiran Halcyon's Girl Who Lived series is a massive canon rehash with moderate Sue elements.

If you're willing to accept a genderbender with a very slow pace and a fair amount of hair tearing moments of emo frustration, then you can go with Effects and Side Effects by Pheonix Dawn (yes, Pheonix, not Phoenix). It has some half decent fem!Harry femslash smut, but you have to wade through an awful lot of shit to get there.

Otherwise, discounting Equal and Opposite, there isn't really anything (a Butterfly Effect seriously annoys me).

*** Canon rehashing is a big no. I don't want it anywhere near me. Ew... get it off!

I'll check out Effects and Side Effects. I don't mind emotional fics much, so I'll probably enjoy it. Thanks.

You personally may not like it for whatever reason, but stuff like Butterfly Effect is /exactly/ what I want to see. That story has got some flaws here and there (just like every other multi novel-length fic in existence), but it has everything I can realistically hope to get out of fanfiction: great writing, an original plot, and engaging characters.

***** Actually, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] (used to be "Fate's Bitch" before the FF.net admins started their little freakout) is a damn good fem!Harry fic in itself despite involving a time travel-induced gender bender.

Beware of triggers though. Rape is mentioned. Some people die. Weird shit happens. It's a pretty good fic otherwise.

*** You're a DLP author aren't you, Taure? Well, no wonder you don't like Butterfly Effect. For the most part, it's a sappy Harry/Ginny love story, and if I recall correctly, DLP members and sappy fics involving Ginny generally don't mix well.

**** I have a number of Harry/Ginny fics on my favourites. I left a number of reviews for Butterfly Effect when I read it, here they are...

Ch15

#+begin_quote
  I think you make Harry and Ginny far too naive. 11 year olds are sex-obsessed little buggers. They would certainly know about the existence of homosexuality and masturbation etc.
#+end_quote

Ch17

#+begin_quote
  Well, that chapter dragged on endlessly. You probably should have ended the Diary!Riddle plotline in the corridor when Dumbledore showed up. Not everything has to devolve into melodramatic mindscape emo crap, you know.

  Also, please stop using the word "bubbies". It's quite possibly the least attractive word for breasts that I have ever heard. I literally want to punch something every time I read it.

  Also, for all that the Dumbledore hating crowd diverge from canon, the idea that Harry is an emotional wreck is even more AU. There's virtually no angst in the Harry Potter books at all. You've been reading too much bad fanfiction (see the aforementioned emo crap). Harry in canon is mind-numbingly boring in how normal he is. He is the definition of "typical teenage boy" - even when he has no right to be, given the circumstances of his life. JKR is quite bad at characterisation with respect to that. She desperately wanted to write a story about an everyday person stuck into situations far beyond them. The problem is that, realistically, an "everyday person", after finding themselves repeatedly stuck in extraordinary circumstanes, would not stay everyday for long.

  Which is kinda why we have fanfiction.
#+end_quote

Ch19

#+begin_quote
  The idea that the wizarding world would have any prejudice about homosexuality is absurd. It's a result of Muggle religions. Note that in Ancient Greece homosexuality was perfectly normal. The wizarding world has a vaguely Victorian feel, but the similarity is skin deep. They have a very different cultural history. For example, gender discrimination doesn't appear to exist in the wizarding world. The whole point of Blood discrimination was to show how a world without the discriminations that Muggles make will still find ways to be bigots. But they're bigots about different things.

  As a result, a lot of the conflict of this story feels artificial.
#+end_quote

Ch22

#+begin_quote
  he greatest problem with the story is pacing. A story that is continuous dramatic twist after dramatic twist desensitises the reader to them, and is disorienting. A story needs structure - especially a long multi-year story like this. There was a reason that JKR kept to a certain formula for the books, with minor deviations. It allows the reader to orient themselves in familiar territory. Once they are oriented, that's when you provide twist.

  With all the constant drama of this fic the reader never knows where they are. Drama is so dramatic because it is juxtaposed with normalcy. Without normalcy, you can't have drama. You need to write more normalcy, because as it is your drama has me rolling my eyes and saying "not again". I should be gasping.

  Learn the merits of restraint. Less is more. We didn't see Voldemort until the 4th book in canon, which meant that when we /did/ see him it was all the more dramatic. We didn't see the Emperor until the 3rd Star Wars film. Don't have terrible tragedy constantly afflicting our protagonists and when tragedy /does/ strike we will care about it more. You can't just shove terrible things in the reader's face and expect them to care, unless there is a well paced story leading up to it.
