A common trope, particularly in Muggle wank and Edgelord! Harry fics is that the Statute of Secrecy is in imminent danger of collapse and/or desperately needs immediate revision. Usually, this trope is used to facilitate a Malfoy Rant Fest (TM), to allow the Muggle wank to seem viable and not complete hooey, or to allow Edgelord and Edgelady Harry and Hermione to teach a "new, updated, compulsory Muggle Studies" course where they teach Purebloods how to wear V-necks and skinny jeans. The premise, especially as regards Muggle wank fics, is that technology is advancing too far, too quickly, and that the ignorant, self-delusional Wizarding World (or occasionally just Wizarding Britain) is on the brink of Doomsday. Specifically mentioned are the proliferation of CCTV cameras in public areas, the burgeoning Internet, military/intelligence organizations' spy satellites, and international news television programming. Supposedly, all of these technologies will soon destroy everything Wizarding, and the wix themselves will become nothing more than Muggles with Wands. However, this concept completely ignores another technology, one which was growing rapidly during Harry's school years and which was almost universal by the time of the Epilogue; the concept of animations and deep fakes as well as editing software like Photoshop.

Here's my analysis of the integrity of the Statute of Secrecy.

Say a CCTV camera captures a wizard using a charm to clean his boots as he enters the building. The person who controls the system is going to do one of two things; one, he's going to laugh it off as a wicked (though odd) prank by someone with way too much time on their hands, or two, he tries to report it and is laughed at for being a wacko. With relatively commonplace and user-friendly software, it would be child's play to fake that. Who the hell, outside of a few nuts, would believe that that neat boot cleaning trick was real (pretend, for a moment, that there's no such thing as Flat Earthers)?

A lot of people don't understand what a spy satellite DOES. I'm no space geek myself, but I at least know that spy satellites are not common enough to be used willy-nilly. I can only imagine that any government with a single ounce, a GRAM of sense would have their satellites pointed straight at their enemies or at trouble areas that could threaten their security; in no logical universe does that include a random, isolated section of the Scottish Highlands (Hogwarts) or an isolated (and invisible) mountain range in New England (Ilvermony), or basically any area where you would find a major Wizarding school; those areas are NOT a priority for observation, no one cares enough to waste the fuel or time a mission to scan those areas would cost.

The concept of no one believing in the truth of magic caught on camera also applies to the news and the internet (both in 1998, when the final Battle of Hogwarts occurred and now in 2021). We just have too much crap shoved in our face, so much of it obviously fake as hell or too minor to care about, a video of a flying broomstick wouldn't even penetrate our collective incredulity. Hell, I tentatively believe in aliens, and yet I would shrug and move on if I saw a dragon yawning a fireball (animatronics and pyrotechnics make it too easy to fake).

Discuss.

We don't exactly know how that works, TBF. We know it's hidden from muggle's sight - but the exact mechanics are not in the books, and so the interpretation of it is a bit up for debate.

Given how bad wizards are at understanding muggle technology, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some faults in the spells that would let increasing technology catch them.

** You raise a valid point about photoshop, animation .. etc but what it does not cover is cases where widespread evidence of some abnormal activity exists or there are real world consequences of actions by magicals. If some lone CCTV operator saw one record of magic, he may ignore it but if he/they keeps seeing things like that in different areas then it becomes a problem, he sees some cloaked people shooting lights into a house and it catches fire and later fire department has to put that fire out then it no longer is a prank but some experimental weapon being used & a police case and those cannot be explained away by gas explosion or freak electrical fire if there is a video of some masked man pointing an object at that house and shooting some sparkly stuff.

Say you are a muggle walking down the street and you see a person using a stick and doing a light show or shoot a green light at someone else and that person drops down acting dead, what do you do? you take out your phone and record it as some cool performance, live stream it or upload it to youtube/instagram and then after a few min you find yourself home or on the road still and don't remember what happened last 10 min or thought nothing happened and then you go home and see your phone isn't working and your instagram/youtube account has a video which you don't remember taking or your video recorded another person seemingly teleporting and pointing a stick at you ... it's a weird experience, you go and post it somewhere, write a blog about it or visit a doctor saying you are missing memories .. etc. Now imagine more and more of these things happening to people, it becomes a pattern and people notice.

*** Live streaming is the real danger here. Imagine popular live streamer ______ going out on the town doing live stream when an escaped dragon flies overhead roasting cars and building on the street. The streamer is going to get all this shit on video. Then the dragon wranglers show up, and the dragon is under control and the obliviators are on the seen and the stream ends with a strangely dressed man approaching the streamer.

Now you've got potentially hundreds of thousand of people who literally just watched a dragon rampage live. They might be willing to believe it was planned and cg or something. But would they still believe that when the stream starts back up and the streamer starts apologizing for the interruption because there was a gas explosion and completely ignores the dragon?

That's best case scenario for an obliviation event. What if the streamer caught the actual obliviation on live? What if the streamer filmed people die to a magical creature or wizard? What if the streamer died themselves?

There are better ways to handle obliviation events that could protect the statute better. Like if the obliviators adopted a strategy of implanting memories of performances, pyrotechnics, and cg rather than wiping memories completely. But when most people talk about the threats of technology to the statute they are talking about it as enforced in canon. There's not much indication that the wizarding world cares enough about muggles to keep track of their capabilities.

Mix in a bit of British Imperial Dogma: The Muggles are Savages, we must be the ones to bring them civilisation.

Those are the two parallels I use for Grindelwald and Voldemort. Where Grindelwald is an imperialist along the lines of The British Empire and its dogma, Voldemort is more of an explicit fascist/ psychopath. The whole purification angle sort of supports this, so does the Muggleborn Registration Commission.

You don't understand it either and here's the thing: you're wrong. Many satellites, not just spy sats with extremely high resolution (the Trump fiasco pointed out something like 10cm/pixel which is bordering on the limitations of physics) but also scientific ones are flying around the earth and /constantly/ making measurements and photographs that are then transmitted back to Earth, and quite a lot of them are in private hands now. Scientists routinely have computers look for and aggregate differences on planetary scale, e.g. to account for forest health, human encroachment into nature... or even determining what kinds of trees grow using infrared emissions.

Some of these satellites are transmitting unencrypted, meaning anyone with a 20$ repurposed TV stick ("RTL-SDR") and a somewhat decent antenna can listen to the signals and decode them.

Add to that that the UK is party to the Open Skies agreement where the Russians have the right to fly over the country with planes padded to the brink with cameras, radars and other measurement devices to detect secret activities...

And it's only going to become worse with cell phones. These days, if there was a big beach of the Statute, tons of muggles would start recording or streaming it on their phones. And obliviation will just end up causing more confusion when the muggles find those videos again later.

  However, Unplottebilty doesn't make a hole to the core of Earth. It makes it unnoticable inconspicious. It doesn't hide the evidence so that you know something is being hidden, it hides it by making you not want to look at it. If magical structures don't have Notice-Me-Not Charms scatterd, something is amiss.
#+end_quote

I think you're mixing up muggle-repelling charms, which keep muggles from noticing magical locations, and unplottability, which makes it impossible to put a location on a map. The former might make the satellites only capture pictures of empty fields (although there's no real evidence that satellites couldn't see through those charms anyway), but the latter makes it impossible to plot the location on a map. And that's the sort of thing that someone, even if it's just a Google Earth computer, is going to notice eventually.

Really, magicals would be better off if they got the muggle governments to claim that their hidden locations were secret military bases of some sort. No one would be very surprised if they can't get a good look at Area 51 on Google Earth, and while that would attract the attention of actual spy satellites, the governments doing the spying would almost certainly have their own magical communities, so they'd be able to figure out what was going on and ignore those locations pretty easily.

Amusingly, I then wouldn't put it past some government to disguise an actual top secret military base as a magical location of some sort just to keep the spies from looking too hard.

******* There's no evidence that the obsessive pureblood inbreeding is a phenomena that occurs outside of Britain. America (given its size in population and geographically) likely has a much higher population of magical than Britain does and can support itself just fine. Sure, half bloods and Muggleborns exist but they're probably still raised as witches. Immigration may help support the population but this too would cause the culture to begin evolving further from that of Muggle Americans. There would be of course some cases of magicals interacting with non magicals but since there's such a huge social stigma against it (to the point of threatening execution) it's probably not super significant statistically and cultural impact would be limited as a result of wanting to avoid being seen as someone who interacts with muggles. Additionally due to magicals having access to near instantaneous travel, Sally from her tiny mining town is essentially still living in the same community as the rest of the magicals in her state and quite probably the rest of the country. I'm sure you could have small towns where magic is an open secret, but you'd need to put a bit more work into explaining why they know about it, how the knowledge hasn't spread further, and why the government hasn't done anything about it.

This is all assuming that MACUSA even actually has power over the entire United States - I believe it's quite possible that the USA could be home to several smaller magical nations within it.

JKR didn't really put any rules to how magic work and the books mention very few boundaries or things that are impossible even to wizards, and the movies are even more flexible in that regard. The reader can decide for himself how the magic works.

In my view, magic can do almost everything. There's no price the wizards have to pay for using spells, no limits to knowledge and power (no magic cores), so I believe wizards and the Statute of Secrecy are in no danger from muggles. As good as muggle technology will get, the magic will always be better.

Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor ---/ " from this quote from OoTP you can conclude that the Reductor curse is not the spell used, as these wood shelves only swayed, and it required five of the curse to do so, sure the shelves may be magically reinforced but shouldn't that mean the prophecy orbs are too? The Harry Potter wiki also states that it can reduce singular targets to pieces, but never mentioned what kind of targets. Using those two things you can conclude that the Reductor curse is insufficient in firepower to demolish a few feet deep hole in the ground with a large area, so the spell used is most likely either a Bombarda Maxima, or a Confringo, Confringo being more likely. In the HP wiki page for the Blasting Curse (Confringo) it states that it /is/ the spell used by Peter " /Pettigrew used an extremely powerful blasting curse to decimate a street and kill twelve Muggles at once/ " " /The explosion was so fierce, it left a massive crater in the street, with the pipes showing./ " and that the gas leak was merely an excuse created by the MoM as it is one of their usuals " /The Ministry gave an excuse of a "gas leak" to the surviving Muggles./ "

#+begin_quote
  I'm no space geek myself, but I at least know that spy satellites are not common enough to be used willy-nilly.
#+end_quote

True that, but that is in regards to specialized satellites. According to Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  On 28 August 2013, it was thought that "a $1-billion high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below"[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite#cite_note-LATimes-Rocket-2013-7][[7]]] was launched from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base using a Delta IV Heavy launcher, America's highest-payload space launch vehicle.
#+end_quote

So, in 2013, if the sight line was good, you could recognize a car. Not very impressive in regards to our hunt for a wizard. Unless the spell used comes with a bright beam of light that could be captured, the wand would be invisible. As would be the grime on the boots.

Now, let's say we're looking for a wizarding district... And my response is: have you seen a wizard using a broom in one of those? If not, who is to say that the whole thing isn't in expended, underground space with a magical ceiling? Or even simply in a stable pocket dimension anchored to the space?

That said, most threat of satellites is not in looking for things, it's in transmiting data. Take the problem with Death eaters destroying a bridge, Giants rampaging, Dementors breeding? Explanations provided would not fit the data from weather satellites. There was no storm in that area. What? Ah, well. Maybe the system malfunctioned. Record the event, reset systems, carry on.

#+begin_quote
  Say a CCTV camera captures a wizard using a charm to clean his boots as he enters the building. The person who controls the system is going to do one of two things; one, he's going to laugh it off as a wicked (though odd) prank by someone with way too much time on their hands, or two, he tries to report it and is laughed at for being a wacko. With relatively commonplace and user-friendly software, it would be child's play to fake that. Who the hell, outside of a few nuts, would believe that that neat boot cleaning trick was real (pretend, for a moment, that there's no such thing as Flat Earthers)?
#+end_quote

They don't need to believe. They just need to think it's cool and share it. One means nothing. Thousands, millions across the globe? A pattern. A human might not notice. A machine might. And it would persistently demand clarification, because anomalous data points would interfere in its workings. Even if you catch and Obliviate 90% of the incidents, enough would leak. Again, there are ways [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7957228/1/Who-Needs-Obliviators][to play this]] - but they are not used in canon material.

I agree that the wizards have means of averting the threat - a simple SEP field charm would do, a muggle - repelling charm that could propagate through media. Unplottable charms might already work - if the location of a place can't be recorded, then existence of Hogwarts doesn't matter.

Like, an animation charm on a big dynamo sending energy prices down - that would affect the little man and make them unwilling to rock the boat too much anles they knew precisely how easy that is to do (then [[/r/EntitledPeople][r/EntitledPeople]] comes into play ).

The problem is in the Whistleblower Scenario. Obliviators, Death Eaters, Dementors... "Gas explosions". If such a thing goes to the media uncontrolled and unmoderated, the people will panic, and panicky people are stupid, dangerous animals ready to trample anything in their path. It would be easy to see the wizards as "evil Illuminati" manipulating things from the shadows and preying on honest folk. Someone *would* panic, commit an act of war, and send it all to hell in a crapbasket.

//////

If I was going to do the reveal thing, I'd probably take over a third world country, preferably a small one with an ongoing, bloody civil war and implement a 'totally secret' military ESP empowerment program. Cue some paperwork magic: the program, after years of fruitless torture and many dead has a breakthrough! There is an extremely painful, dangerous and mostly lethal procedure to give people superpowers! Since it's a secret, it gets 'stolen' by other countries (with magicals in place to infiltrate). The programs worldwide start churning out muggleborns, while press worldwide condemns the whole practice as inhuman and violation of every human rights law out there. Because the whole thing is painted as "most people die a horrible death", there are not many volunteers. Non-magical volunteers can be sent away n basis of their genetics. Risk too high, sorry. Those who undergo the procedure are depicted as victims of Big Bad Government. Other governments blame the need of it for the military buildup of magicals in Country 0.

Finally, it's 'discovered' that the procedure is easier on consecutive generations. The children born that way are also sturdier and less likely to get cogenital defects. Possibility of awakening powers without a shady givernment program is also nice. The Shipping Era begins.

During all that time, all the anger, distrust and paranoia is pointed squarely at the Dictator X (a man bribed with despot-grade lifestyle to take the fall later. No actual power, just the perks) and his sciencists (mostly homeless, hopeless people with terminal diseases and no family). Wizards are in place to prevent military action by some hothead.

Finally, the dictator is deposed and publicly executed. The Legions of Terror hadn't at that point participated in any campaign. Additionally, they have a selective amnesia from the 'unsuccessful' attempt to have them re-brainwashed and prevent mutiny.

​

That way, Church would not be able to speak out against it, because it would be victim blaming. Nuts and conspiracy theorists would be pointed at a TYCM. Economic and lifestyle advances would be tested in an environment where explosions would be normal. All wizards in contact with muggles (I prefer to use a native term. And boy, do I have a rant on that too!) would be presented as victims of Big Bad Evil Guy- but be mostly well adjusted and well educated - and prime dating material. BBEG would be, of course, dead. The traditionalist enclaves would be kept hidden - and become magical creature reserves and magical tourist resorts. Old bloods would keep their mansions.

If 5 muggles managed to get the dragon yawning a fireball on smartphone from 5 different angles that'd be discussed and dissected for how real it was in Reddit within no time.

We have a lot of internet detectives for everything these days. If magic were real, wikileaks would have something on it, and some conspiracy theorists would go crazy with it, while Reuters would have a breakdown while trying to verify it.

Edit: also, Rowling did bad research. The witch trials in Europe went on from 1450 till 1750.

The International Statute of Secrecy is a wizarding law which was instituted in 1689. That means it took another 60 years to convince everyone magic wasn't real and to stop being silly and burning people? There really wasn't any magic to stop all that earlier? There'd have to be a hundred ways to plant the suggestion in the lawmakers minds that weren't the imperius curse.

The Other Minister chapter of book six and The obliviation of the campsite muggles in book four paint a very clear picture of how the Ministry handles muggles, and it isn't the smart or correct way. If they had any level of intelligence or understanding of muggle society they could have given the campground muggles false memories or explanations that there was a big reenactment/larping event going on, and only obliviated the camp person as needed (or better yet convinced him to leave for a while and paid him for use of the land). Instead they popped in and fucked his brain every three minutes if he so much as thought that something strange was going on.

Also for how many people are in Diagon ally and other magical hotspots they would give off heat and it would be quite weird if they did a surface scan (although I don't think they would do that for shits and giggles) and they picked up heat signatures of magical animals and people where there shouldn't be heat.

And what about on the ground say non-majis decide to dig for pipes under the area of Gringotts we know that the vaults are right under the building so imagine the builders surprise when they come in contact with some heavy metal (snicker snicker) when they start to build? What if they decide to take down the remains they see of Hogwarts (still not really likely but it could happen) and build something else only to find out that the castle was a huge unbroken building (Merlin forbid that it is during the School year)?

Oh let's not forget America would shoot down almost ANYTHING they see flying that is unexplainable if it were to go over a military base as most magical people are ignorant about that stuff.

And as being a Conspiracy theorist myself we already question a lot of things if theorist would get there hands on CCTV footage that shows something interesting. We will flock to it like hungry birds to an old lady giving bread in a park, yes it wouldn't really matter as most people believe conspiracy theorist are flat earthers (we are not, well some are) and therefore will discount a lot of things we say, people would start to question things when it pops up more times than once.

I agree with you that the statue probably wouldn't be destroyed... well actually I don't know about that anyway! I agree with you somewhat, but I also know that if magicals use the same excuses over and over again people will be sus.

Last note, children in the eyes of the government go missing for nine(?) months out of the year and their grades just stop after grade 5 that would be highly alarming, because first gen magis (muggleborns) just pop up after 7 years cause they can't or aren't satisfied with the magical jobs in the magic side of the world, and get a job working with their parents or somehow finding money (from the magical world) to live off of while in the non-magi world well... that wouldn't end well especially if a pure blood gets into some adult fun on the non-magical side (drunk) well let's just say "license and registration please" oh you don't have it? detained. Yes like I said before highly unlikely, but not impossible.

** One of the most important parts of the Statute of Secrecy is that "Muggles don't see nothing, Muggles don't say nothing"

Average Joe sees a wizard in robes with a stick on the street they think "what a weirdo. They see that wizard wave their stick and a car change colors they tell themselves they must have seen the color wrong. They clearly see that wizard disappear in front of their eyes and they don't tell anyone, who is going to believe them?

But that all relies on people not having the concept that magic might be real in their heads, and that no one will believe them. The essential aspect of keeping a secret is ensuring as few people know it as possible. Imagine how many normal people would see oddities like that from day to day. Things that no one would ever think to report to the ministry. That were never obliviated. Now add in security guards watching those cctv footage tapes. Now add in people seeing things on YouTube, or live stream. Now add in weird things caught on Google Street view (since people always find those)

Sure, a YouTube video showing magic is likely to be dismissed as cg or special effects by most people. But then the next time someone who saw that video of a person in robes doing magic sees someone in robes doing magic, are they still going to try so hard to convince themselves they didn't see what they thought they saw?

Sure many people will dismiss the reddit threads and forums discussions as crazy conspiracy theories. But when that person sees someone vanish in front of their eyes are they still going to think that no one believes them when there are dozens of discussions going on about similar occurances?

Once the idea of the existence of a specific style of magic (robes, wands, etc) enters the public perception, via any viral video. Even if that video is initially successfully dismissed as cgi and special effects. The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon will destroy the Statute of Secrecy. Muggles will start seeing signs of magic everywhere.

I mean... /gestures to canon/. Canon doesn't really give any indication that the Ministry or the ICW is paying nearly enough attention to muggle advancement to keep on top of the risks. Neither supposed muggle experts, nor wizards that are supposed to be in semi-regular contact with muggles care enough to learn even the basics. And that's the "experts," average witches and wizards that don't even take muggle studies are going to be even less likely to understand why they can't just carry on like normal.

Like I said in another comment. I don't feel like it's impossible that the statute of secrecy could succeed given what we know is possible with magic. I do feel that if wizarding attitudes of the 90's prevailed without significant overhaul to the mindset regarding muggles, that the damage would be done before the massive issue would be discussed in a productive way.

A proactive approach to maintaining the Statute in the face of increasing technology could work. A reactive response to modern era breaches of the Statute would fail due to the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon and the Streisand Effect. The damage done every further hour a viral video stays in the public consciousness grows rapidly. The damage done if the ministry follows standard obliviation tactics would ensure that the damage is unrecoverable.

As in, if the magic fucked up electronics on Charing Cross, it would be magical-only train station. Muggles would eventually move. The minimum of 300 years from Statute to canon (and at least 50 where magic would be a potent problem) and mountains of corpses would make sure of that.

Even if not electronics, muggle repelling charms distracting train conductors would get the place labelled 'bad for business' and abandoned as far as important infrastructure is concerned. Add electronics, and you got a recipe for empty place.

****** I'm thinking that the Leaky Cauldron would act as a barrier between the muggle buildings/tech and diagon alley on top of having some sort of charm over it. Like with King's Cross if all magical children were coming through the station that would make sense for it to distract train conductors but it seems like most don't come through the barrier at Kings Cross (i have a theory on the barriers being a portal to a different part of London away from muggles) just like most don't come through the leaky cauldron. If anything it's always implied that only muggle borns, harry, and the weasley's use entrances like the barrier at kings cross and the leaky cauldron. Because remember there's a floo network for wizards to go directly to diagon alley (book 2). And in book 7 they make mention of people having to stagger their entrance/exits with the ministry of magic so there has to be some type of barrier that completely hides even a trace of magic from people on the other side. Something like the protective charms Hermione did in book for but more powerful because remember if you were on the other side of the barrier you couldn't see anything inside and couldn't sense anything on the other side either.

** Vlogging and mobile phones became a thing long before deepfakes did, and livestreaming makes this even less viable as a defense. Also spy satellites aren't the only ones up there taking pictures, there's an absurd number constantly getting surface data of everything they can and continuously updating it in computer databases.

If something did get out, the “it's an elaborate fake” defense would work.... the first time. Maybe. What happens the tenth time an incredibly detailed nearly flawless video of supernatural occurrences shows up online with no explanation and no apparent connection or creator tied to them? What happens when HBO tries to get their hands on whatever CGI program was behind that viral dragon video a few years back? What happens when HBO finds out that that CGI does not exist?

What will people think when those YouTube videos of these things get deleted and the accounts that posted them start swearing up and down that they never posted those videos, and haven't ever seen anything like that? Having an active Obliviator presence trying to remove the information would just make the conspiracy theories go even MORE insane. Look at how people reacted to the Hunter Biden laptop story. A news source rejecting it for being unreliable information was enough to spark a conspiracy theory about an elaborate cover-up.

** Yup.

I think there would be a period (roughly 90s to early 2010s) where statute could be slightly more vulnerable, but add together:

Ministries.

ICW (personally, i think it's them handling SoS and obliviations - otherwise you'd get leaks whenever some contry decides to have a dark lord or something. It also explains why national ministry workers can be Arthur Weasley levels of oblivious)

How governments actually know about it.

How magic works on conepts and not actual physics.

If somehting can't be seen by muggles, it can't be seen by muggles - be it in person or on a photo or video or livestream.

If someone decides to go "Noone can perceive strange things in London today", then noone can perceive strange things in London today. Then obliviators go in, do some work on catching everyone who saw that weird livestream with dragons burning down the London Bridge, they fix the damage, and noone remains the wiser.

If some video becomes to popular... they just get some techies, replace the original with edited version that makes it look like CGI under scrutiny and call it a day. There is propably a movie franchise or two started based on such timely switches.
