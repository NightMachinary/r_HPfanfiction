** Gonna agree with the blue menace over there. What do you mean by "learns takes to Muggle drills"?

I feel like the other information kind of makes me think of a fic where the British military is involved? I'd have to ponder about it to remember the name of that, but because of that Muggle drills statement, I'm pretty sure I haven't read it, unless you clarify more...

*** Sorry, I was so out of it when I posted this! I meant that Harry is sent to some kind of military hospital after he loses his magic where he gets introduced to standard military drills and devotes himself to physically preparing for war. I suppose this is pretty standard "Harry brings the Muggle military to the Wizard war" territory--the only thing that really makes it stand out is that it's Snarry-centric.

**** Ah crap, because this is really ringing some bells here.

Is Harry disfigured/really injured at one point? And then tries to break up with Snape because of it? Gah, now I've really got to think, because I think this was before I got to marking my fanfic reads down.
