** You would always get both probably and if you look at a story from their perspective remember that nobody is the villain in their own story.

**** People don't see themselves as the bad ones or normally don't.

So you could look at it and from their point of view it probably wasn't bullying, but they had an explanation for their behavior

****** If it's from the perspective one of the 4 they won't acknowledge they're bullies and consider themselves in the right.

Any shitty fic with pranks that are closer to hate crimes against slytherins would fit the bill.
