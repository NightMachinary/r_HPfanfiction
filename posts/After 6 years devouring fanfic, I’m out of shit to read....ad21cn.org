I'm a huge fan of the super!harry and grey!harry and independent!harry fics and I'm in need of a good one. also I'm a big fan of dramione. or fics where Harry grows up adopted by someone else and is loved and reaches his full potential. Please help

These are fics I've loved that I'm looking for similar ones to: - Harry Crow (robst) - Poison Pen (genkaifan) - To Shape and Change (blueowl) - Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is (tsume yuki) - Simply Irresistible (bookworm1993) - No Hurry At All (robst) - Roundabout Destiny (MaryRoyale) - Harry McGonagall (witowsmp) - Harry Potter and the Spiritual Heirs (Phoenix Burst) - The Heir of the Founders (TheColdTurkey) - Summer of Independence (redfrog) - Time to Live (loralee1) - Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny (wheezy1)


** Well here. Have a link to my all-time favorite fic's community. It's not all HP and some is rated M, but happy hurting all the same...

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** I see a lot of you OG Fanfiction.net guys say that exact same thing.

I'd just filter by kudos and then cut out the draco/Harry tag because it dominates (unless you're down for that ship, in that case it's a gold mine) and then you'll see the top rated stuff. It's what I'm slowly working through now

My personal fave series is The Secret Language of Plants, my fave of all time. The first in the series is The Meaning of Mistletoe

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]])

And I just recently read Hogwarts, to welcome you home and loved that.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531]])

For a truly interesting set of What If fics, check out the Boy with a Scar series. The author takes a simple question like "what if Ron was the BWL?" or "What If Dudley had magic?" And rewrites the whole canon according to that.

The Ron centred one is particularly amazing. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447]])

For some funny cross overs, check out: Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020]]) for the Avengers And linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568]]) for Bleach

I realise these aren't really tailored to what you set out but these are what spring to mind when thinking of good fics from Ao3 that I'm fairly certain aren't on ffn (though don't quote me on that, usually authors say when they cross post but not always).

Another tip for ao3, is find a niche tag and sort by kudos through that. You like super Harry? Use the super!harry tag. Grey Harry? Slytherin harry? Independent Harry? Time Travel? Obscure ships? That One Trope That Just Does It For You? There's a tag for that. It's why I love ao3, super easy to find my niche.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  Ichigo's been ordered to go undercover at a magic school to bodyguard a kid named Harry Potter, and this would be fine, except that he's about as good at bodyguarding as he is at magic. And he considers it a good day, magic-wise, if he hasn't set anything on fire.

**** Sometimes the way to go is to search bookmarks rather than works. Bookmarkers can add their own tags that authors may not bother with. So for instance if you like indy!Harry you'd get [[https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Independent+Harry+Potter&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_type%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_date%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarker%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_notes%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bdate%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=&commit=Search+Bookmarks][this list]] - and some of the bookmarkers might add a good amount of commentary. Or find one really good fic, see who bookmarked it, and look at their other bookmarks.

You can also try browsing the Collections to see if there's one on a topic that works for you.

*** 17 years here. Always moving on to a new fandom/ships. After a year or two you can go back to your fav's and see what new stuff has been written. Right now i am in a Marvel phase (never read marvel before!). It's exciting discovering a brand new world :) My primary fandom has always been harry potter though, and i never run out - just be open to try new things - if it is well written, it quite often doesnt matter about the ship etc.

Maybe you'll like this one. This is by far the best indy!Harry I've read, but the author stopped it at a strange place - you can technically take it as a vague ending, or consider it abandoned. But my goodness, it is absolutely /riveting/.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included.
