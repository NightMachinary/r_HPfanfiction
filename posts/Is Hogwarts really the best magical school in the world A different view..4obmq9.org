I don't know that it's ever specifically claimed in canon, but I know it's been brought up in a hundred thousand fanfics; Hogwarts is the premier magical school in the world.

And I think it may be, but not for quite the reason that it would appear.

See, I believe Hogwarts is the one school in the world that focuses entirely on magic and almost nothing else, with History and Muggle Studies being the exceptions. Everything else involves some sort of magic, from the obvious Charms and Transfiguration, to the more applied domains of Herbology, Potions, and DADA, and finally to the more theoretical and obscure fields such as Arithamancy, Ancient Runes, and Divination.

So what about other schools, then? Shouldn't they be teaching similarly? I don't think they do, I think all the other schools in the world have much less focus on teaching such a wide spectrum of magical ability, and add a lot more secondary and tertiary topics that focus on living in the world, not using magic. Examples could be Political Science, Finance, Business Management, etc in a distinct counterpoint to Hogwarts' purely magical curriculum.

When it comes to magical education and these other schools, I suspect they would have a curriculum that started out as broad, then quickly sorted students into tracks that played to their strengths. Remember how there were a number of witches and wizards in canon that were stated to be rubbish at certain things or good at others? The other schools would cater to those differences and probably push them far beyond NEWT level teachings due to the tighter focus, instead of Hogwarts' approach of creating students with a broader but shallower skillset.

That's my idea, anyway. What do you all think about it?


** We know too little about the other schools to judge anything, really. The most we know about any other school is about Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Now think about how little we know about those.

My personal headcanon is that "Hogwarts is the best school of magic in the world" is a slogan influenced by patriotism and ignorance, much like Voldemort and Dumbledore being the greatest wizards ever on the world since Merlin. I simply don't want to believe that Voldemort was the most dangerous Dark Lord to ever exist, because frankly he was a failure from day one if his end goal was World Domination. He couldn't even get complete control over Britain, even though he got close two times. I'm willing to believe that in terms of power and knowledge he was among the top, but he still was barely more than the General of a guerilla revolutionary force.

And just like that, I'm unwilling to believe that Hogwarts is objectively the best school in the world. At the very least its current state doesn't reflect its reputation. For me, making potions got to be more than complex cooking, and we haven't seen much more than that in Snapes lessons (next to his constant belittling of his students). Divination /got/ to be a more complex field, seeing as prophecies are real. Trelawney fails to teach that completely. And the DADA course... basically non-existent.

My headcanon is that the other schools are on par with Hogwarts and currently outperform it due to the ancient schools struggles through the Voldemort induced crisis and the mismanagement of it by a, frankly, completely overloaded Dumbledore. I actually wrote a fic in which Hogwarts, led by McGonagall, faces the fact that they are decades behind the other schools because there was simply no time during the wars to modernize it.

Also I think the part with the potions isn't in that yet, but you get glimpses to what I imagine true seers to be. Its just the fic I mentioned in my last paragraph.

Though Dumbledore and Voldemort were the greatest wizards in the world since Merlin. When Grindelwald was rising to power, the entire world turned to Dumbledore. Not anyone else, just Dumbledore. Meaning that Dumbledore was the only person in the world at the time of Grindelwald that could defeat Grindelwald.

Obviously Beauxbatons has Flamel and Durmstrang had Grindelwald, but other than that, Hogwarts is outright better than every other school purely off of Dumbledore and Voldemort. Ollivander is considered the best wandmaker in the world by even foreign wizards so its not as simple as patriotism. Given the Triwizard Tournament, I'd argue that Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are the three best magical schools and the other eight are just average. If a witch or wizard turned out to be exceptionally great, odds are they came from Hogwarts, Beauxbatons or Durmstrang.

To be fair, the only reason Voldemort failed was sheer dumb luck. If it wasn't for the Deux-Ex-Machina (DEM) known as love, Voldemort would have took over Britain back in the First Wizarding War, then attempted to take over other Ministries slowly but surely. Assuming he managed to kill off Dumbledore, there wouldn't be a single wizard in the world who could defeat him without resorting to dumb luck.

The fact that Voldemort never legitimately lost goes to show just how powerful he was. Grindelwald lost because Dumbledore was 'a shade more skillful'. Voldemort lost because of several DEMs along the way (the Love Sacrifice, Wand Master/Owner BS, and of course the twin cores) and never lost due to being overpowered or outskilled.

Harry never defeated Voldemort of his own merit once. As a baby it was Lily's DEM love sacrifice. In first year, he couldn't even get down to the Mirror without Ron and Hermione (and the Mirror would have stopped Quirrelmort so the Trio weren't even needed). In second year, Harry had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat sent to him. In fourth year, Harry had the wand connection and also Voldemort's Plot-Induced Stupidity was needed otherwise Harry would be dead. In fifth year, Dumbledore saved him from Voldemort (and Bellatrix would have crushed Harry if she wanted to). Seventh year wasn't even Harry's victory, it was Dumbledore's victory since the entire events of DH went to his plan in the end.

Hogwarts from 1956-1998 probably wasn't "the best" magical school, but that was purely due to Voldemort's interferences. Even despite that, I'd certainly argue that it was still in the top three. Though I think from 1956-98, either Beauxbatons or Durmstrang would have been considered the best school simply due to their comparable reputation and being apart of the Triwizard Tournament.

But Potions was more than glorified cooking. I'd argue that GoF and HBP perfectly demonstrated the more advanced side of Potions. GoF had the Potions to give Voldemort a small body and then the Potion used to revive Voldemort in his full, original body. HBP had Potions used not as cooking fodder but as a defensive measure to protect a Horcrux. I imagine that most of the supremely powerful Potions stuff would be related to the dark arts and so not taught at Hogwarts, or perhaps it would be taught to trainee Aurors/Healers but we just never see that. I think that seeing everything from Harry's POV limits our understanding of Hogwarts and also of the entire wizarding world, since if Harry never learns it, we don't as readers.

Voldemort certainly screwed Hogwarts over with the DADA Jinx along with the two wars, and if it weren't for both of those things, Hogwarts would have been outright the best school in the world. I imagine that under the Voldemort crisis, Hogwarts was barely holding onto 3rd place, after Beauxbaton/Durmstrang in any order you want.

But considering that the Marauders, Lily and Snape were better students than the 35-40 students we actually see in Harry's year, it might simply be that past generations were better than the current generation, even despite Voldemort's DADA Jinx.

*TL;DR: Hogwarts is the best school of magic in the world as per canon. No wizard in the world could defeat Dumbledore. No wizard in the world could beat Voldemort except Dumbledore. I'd say Durmstrang and Beauxbatons would come 2nd and 3rd in the world, and wouldn't be that far off from Hogwarts generally speaking. The remaining 8 schools would be much worse than Hogwarts/Durmstrang/Beauxbatons.*

Sorry, I'm not really up to date with Pottermore/extra material and it's been a bit since rereading. Could you suggest where to read further into what you've said in those sentences? My knee jerk reaction is that it's their patriotism/natural bias to think their hero is the most heroic and their villain the most villainous. And that the most of the wizarding world outside of wizarding Europe and Britain didn't give much of a fuck about Grindelwald. What's a European jumped up dark wizard mean to a reclusive temple wizard monk?

This is the type of stuff I wish JKR expanded on, not Cursed Child. I'd love to read in universe essays and articles about this

***** I forget exactly where it was specifically mentioned, but if I recall, Dumbledore didn't want to confront Grindelwald because he feared the truth regarding Ariana. Nobody else was able to stop Grindelwald so Dumbledore had no choice but to do something.

The closest thing I can find regarding that topic is something Dumbledore said:

#+begin_quote
  "...while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him... It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister... I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could."
#+end_quote

It suggests that if there was a wizard capable of defeating Grindelwald other than Dumbledore, then Dumbledore wouldn't have bothered going to confront Grindelwald. I imagine that Grindelwald would have conquered a good amount of Europe at the very least, given what Viktor Krum said in DH about Grindelwald's reign and how it affected the lives of Krum and his family. If Dumbledore didn't get involved, I think Grindelwald probably would have tried to spread his influence to America/Africa/Asia.

Kinda like how if Voldemort had took over Britain and had any British threats (e.g. Dumbledore, Harry, etc) killed off, he probably would have tried to expand his influence to the rest of the world. pExcept that Voldemort, unlike Grindelwald, never got to expand as wide as he hoped to due to his untimely downfall. I imagine that people outside of Britain don't really care about Voldemort anywhere near as much as those in Britain did. Voldemort would definitely have international fame, but I imagine those in Europe would consider Grindelwald to be more threatening than Voldemort.

** Honestly, Hogwarts seems pretty bad. They have mentally unstable teachers like Snape and Trelawney and incompetent ones like Hagrid. The DADA position is cursed and the DADA teachers are usually psychos (Hello, Lockhart, Quirrell, Umbridge, Barty!). There are also a lot of dangerous things in the school like basilisks and three-headed dogs.

If this is the best magical school in the world, I would rather be educated at home.

** I see lots of muggle logic being applied here. It's like you guys don't understand HP at all.

I think it's important to keep in mind that muggles (the fandom) apply different criteria in determining what makes a good school.

Take every fic that makes a big freaking deal out of Snape's behavior or what would be considered in the muggle world unforgivable violations of health and safety rules, like three-headed dogs, or the deadly forest on school grounds, or hosting the Hunger Games in GoF.

These are wizards. Each of them wields the power to bend the rules of the universe to their will. They can heal broken bones in a flash, they can /regrow missing bones overnight./

Maybe enduring life-threatening adventures is, in fact, considered to be a vital part of wizarding education. Maybe foul people like Snape are supposed to teach them important Life Lessons.

And let's not forget, it's not all about just teachers or the curriculum. Harry's major achievement in PoA had nothing to with class. He learned the Patronus Charm to keep away the nightmares about his mother.

Hogwarts produced Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, arguably the greatest wizards in recent history.

I can totally see why Hogwarts is considered to be the best school of /magic/ in the world, even though I'm a muggle.

*** I doubt lethal adventures are something most parents want for their children, but that's just me.

My own opinion:

As we know basically nothing about the magical world outside of Hogwarts, we really can't compare Hogwarts in any significant way. There's just nothing. Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, we know jack shit about either of them. Forget anything about minor schools. And don't even /think/ about mentioning the afterthoughts that are the new foreign schools.

So maybe, look at it this way: Hogwarts is the best school for magic because it is /the most magical/ school. It is a thousand years old and /steeped/ in magic. It has numerous hidden passageways, and rooms that aren't always there, it has staircases that move according to their own design, it has plenty of mysteries to be discovered. It sits next to a vast forest full of multiple magical species, as well as a lake with the same. It has an enormous library stocked with a diverse collection of books, as well as, presumably, multiple thesis' done by graduates and teachers. That same library has an entire section devoted to what I can only assume is borderline illegal material, or at the very least material that isn't meant for consumption by the average person, either because it's too difficult or too disgusting.

Other minor schools might teach you practical material such as cleaning spells or trade skills, but Hogwarts is for the academic. It teaches you the core branches of magic, and it teaches you the theory behind the magic you learn. You don't just learn the summoning charm, you learn why it works and how it works, as well as the history behind it. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons no doubt do this too, but they probably don't have the academic resources that Hogwarts has due to its history.

There are a few incompetent teachers, yes, but look at the others. McGonagall is a bonafide Transfiguration Mistress, on par with Dumbledore. Snape is an ass, but he's also a Potions Master capable of brewing hideously difficult potions like Wolfsbane and Veritaserum. Flitwick is an accomplished Dueling champion. Sprout is capable of running and maintaining multiple magical greenhouses as well as the plants within them, many of them no doubt requiring special individual care. She also takes knows how to take care of the Whomping Willow, another rare plant. Vector and Babbling are no doubt competent at their respective subjects, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. These are talented and competent people, and they're teaching children on top of their respective duties.

Wait, what book series were /you/ reading, and can you give me a copy? We never learn any of this crap via Harry Potter, certainly. This can, at /best/, be inferred on shaky ground from the things Hermione comes out with on occasion in the books, but Rowling's ability to explain the academic side of things was poor at the best of times, because she was very decidedly /not/ an academic.

I'm not sure if this is fanon creeping its way in, but it seems likely. If these mystical 'Harry Potter and the Actually Explained Things' books exist irl, I want them now. If not, at least give me some of that stuff you're smoking.

I've heard this more than once, and I don't think it's quite true. I doubt anybody in that time would be able to consume information like Hermione does. It's all just different skill sets, is all.

The Patronus is charms magic, and requires happiness and willpower, something a spoiled kid like James wouldn't have even begun to have.

Animagus is transfiguration, which James was talented at, and a group of people can accomplish a lot when they all help each other. When was the Marauder's map even made? OWL-NEWT years? Hermione did the Protean charm in fifth year, that's NEWT material, so making something so complex with five to seven years worth of knowledge across four people with multiple years to accomplish it... not /extraordinary/, per se. Unusual, yes.

Snape making his own spells is a single example, so we really have no idea exactly how difficult it actually is. Maybe Hermione could do it if she were so inclined? Or perhaps Snape's instinctual knack with potions -his creativity, maybe?- helped out there. Speaking of creativity, aren't the Twins basically doing the same thing? Creating spells and potions to make their joke products? The Twins aren't stupid but they're not geniuses either, so it can't be /that/ difficult.

I like that, very dramatic.) but I'm fairly sure they do teach all the theory. The kids have homework, don't they? Twelve inches on cheering charms, or werewolves, or such? Rowling just never elaborated on it, which is probably just as well. In a funny-not-funny way, Rowling's reticence about world-building is what made the series so available to so many people.

******** I would have thought that, had they learned the things they were purported to learn about magic, that these things would come up a trifle more than they do in canon. I don't know... I think I should admit that I was wrong about it contradicting canon. It's been a while since I read the books, and I think part of forgetting that they did anything theory-wise was that it was quite rare for magic to be shown to be complicated enough to need theory work. While we are told about people learning things as magical theory, it's very rare for that learning to have any useful effect as shown. In fairness, the thing about werewolves was kind of important, but only because Snape fucked with the curriculum to drop hints, and it didn't help much even then. So... what on earth could they be learning? Anyone would think all there was to magic was pointing a stick at things and saying the right funny word! Or, if you're particularly advanced, saying a funny word and feeling a warm, fuzzy feeling in your chest.

Then again, it's a childrens' series. That there's any worldbuilding at all might be a small miracle. So yeah, I was wrong, sorry about that.

Part of the reason I was practically able to forget they even did theory classes was that this stuff is never important. Plot relevant things are always old secrets, or things that work in very specific and rarely explained ways, like the Sorting Hat and Gryffindor's Sword (plot devices, in other words), and basically never things that were previously name-dropped as stuff they specifically learned. It's... kind of frustrating.

Like if Devil's Snare had previously been name-dropped in Herbology class, and you only realise it's important when they fall into it. Because what we get in canon is someone desperately trying to convince the reader that there is more to magic, by telling you that 'magic is really complicated, yo', but never actually showing it meaningfully. If I got the impression she even knew /herself/ how some of the stuff worked, and it was consistent, it would be nice...

  Plot relevant things are always old secrets, or things that work in very specific and rarely explained ways, like the Sorting Hat and Gryffindor's Sword (plot devices, in other words), and basically never things that were previously name-dropped as stuff they specifically learned. It's... kind of frustrating.
#+end_quote

And that is why we have the wonderful world of fanfiction, so we can hash this stuff out and find an explanation that's consistent and reasonable.

But yeah, Rowling... I've long since concluded, and had my conclusion reinforced by Cursed Child, that Internal Consistency^{^{TM}} is a completely foreign concept to Rowling. It's one thing to be bad at math, but everything else...

********** I firmly believe that admitting when you are wrong is a very important part of a discussion. Helps with humility, and also shows publicly that peoples' opinions can be changed by reasoned debate, which is something sorely needed in a world so divided by knee-jerk emotional responses.

And yeah, she really doesn't. I tend to think like a scientist, so once I stopped suspending my disbelief, canon became positively infuriating to read. I always wondered why Mrs Weasley bothered with cooking, since Wizarding society is officially post-scarcity when it comes to food. As in, if you have some, or the raw materials for some, you can transfigure it into more food than you started with, at least according to Hermione's recitation of the first exception to Gamp's law. Which is weird, and runs a bit counter to the way Rowling wrote the books, but it's there if you look. Get hungry? Just transform something into food, done. Still hungry? Keep a crumb, and turn it back into more dessert! Which does nicely wrap up those worries about where the magical world gets its food, I guess. Which means they can totally be a secret community in futtbuck nowhere, and don't need to know anything about muggles for day-to-day living, even if that flies in the face of Rowling's 'wizards next door' thing she sometimes tried to pull. Food for thought, certainly :D

Edit: Oh god, I just realised that magical society is almost completely post-scarcity. The fact they still have a government at all, let alone one as byzantine as the MoM, is something of a wonder. People can settle wherever they want, eat rocks if they get hungry, and the only person who can object are other magicals. The Potterverse, as presented, is /fucking insane and nothing like the society we live in/. There may just be wizards living on the /moon/, by those standards.

Ok, looked it up on the wiki. Apparently it's an Exception to Gamp's Law of Transfiguration, one of five.

#+begin_quote
  Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration is a law governing the magical world. There are five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law, one of which is food.

  It should be noted that while food cannot be outright created from nothing, it can be multiplied if one already has some food to multiply, it can be enlarged or the food can be summoned if one knows the approximate location and is fairly sure the food will still be there.[1] It should also be noted that while food cannot be conjured, consumable liquids such as sauces[2] and potable water can be.[3]

From the wiki, though who the hell knows how accurate /that/ is. But yeah, basically post scarcity. Only have to buy one of each thing and then multiply it and enlarge it.

And anyway, the moment you begin with something that dubiously counts as 'food', you can multiply it endlessly, or turn it into other food, as presented. So you begin with a grass seed and turn it into... a nearly unlimited supply of whatever you feel like, provided your stick-waving arm doesn't get tired after a while.

********* Yeah, so it makes me just wonder what Hogwarts used to be like.

Because Hogwarts is a pretty good school, outside of the... unfortunate circumstances, politics and the rotating door that is DADA. There are only four suspect teachers that are on the permanent cast: Binns, Trelawney, Hagrid and Snape. However, I think the issues with the last two aren't related to their teaching abilities.

Hagrid is poor at putting together a curriculum (flobberworms, starting with hippogriffs [though that should have been fine, maybe only have one hippogriff?], blast-ended skrewts should have been a NEWT creature) and the fact that the student body doesn't seem to respect him outside Gryffindor and /maybe/ Hufflepuff. Snape is a bitter, irredeemable asshole who should not be near children, but utilizes a very self-motivated teaching style that used to be prevalent in US Grad Schools in the 40s-60s. Binns is a waste of a teaching spot, and I can't help but wonder how he grades things. Trelawney seems incompetent at teaching, and has a fixation on bad events that leads her to misinterpret many things, though her predictions are usually pretty good (outside of Harry's multiple death predictions).

** *Short answer:* I hope not.

*Long rambling answer:* The answer is both. Hogwarts has existed for a millennium, in that time it has no doubt waxed and waned. So I'm going to try and answer is Hogwarts the best school circa 1990's.

Lets take a look at the last three Headmasters. Dumbledore, Dippet and Phineas Nigellus Black.

*Phineas Nigellus Black* is shown to be a caricature of all the worst traits of Slytherin, and from what little we know of him seemed to hold his students in contempt, or at least thought of them as beneath him.

*Dippet* is a more subtle case. To me he represents the ideal of lawfulness, sort of similar to Percy Weasley. His brief appearances in canon show him talking of honour and oaths as well as appropriate behavior. He also allowed for harsh punishments on his students. I feel that Dippet cared more for the idea of the school, then the students within it. He is also rather easily manipulated by a 16 year old boy, but this is suspect as it is shown to us through the Horcrux Diary.

Then we have *Dumbledore.* Hagrid claims that the only thing that kept Hogwarts safe during the first war was Dumbldore's tenure. Again suspect. Hagrid, though wonderful is biased. Albus also has many other duties that distract him from his work as the Headmaster. He also seems to harber few reservations about using Hogwarts as a staging area for his fight against Voldemort or as bait as seen in PS. In book 6 he is often absent from the school entirely.

In short Dumbledore never prioritizes the running of the school over his own machinations, well intentioned as they are. He likely got the job because he was a great wizard, but in the HP universe 'Great' has a duality too it, see Olivander for further details.

So Hogwarts the institution has had to suffer the consequences of three consecutive leaders, who for various reasons were bad Headmasters. It is not currently the best School in the world.

Mahoutokoro was lightly referenced, but was at least way older than Hogwarts.

While as Bill Weasley was pen-pal with a student from Castelobruexo.

Now you know there's a Wizarding School in Brazil. The name Castelobruexo may not be canon, but the school itself is canon according to the books.

If you're going to say that Bill's penfriend was a Wizard going to a muggle school. Just think about how Bill would end up being penfriend with a foreign Wizard that wants Bill to go on an exchange trip.

The 8 Magical Schools in the Entire World means the 8 Magical Schools that are officially recognized by the International standard of the ICW.

There are Smaller and less well-regulated institutions were rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry and are difficult to keep track of. But they're probably shitty ass third-rate schools.

** We just don't have enough information to determine that. Hogwarts certainly looks pretty bad in canon, mostly because it was the focus of a civil war, and, you know, the designated site for a series of adventure books, who wouldn't be so adventurous if the school wasn't so flawed.

Then again, the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons champions don't come off as that impressive, and we have no evidence suggesting that Dumbledore and Voldemort aren't the greatest modern wizards. The knowledge taught at Hogwarts might seem basic to you, but really, we have nothing to compare it to. We don't know what the extent of common magic is, and Rowling certainly treats Hogwarts as if it offers the best education (in one interview, when asked how Dumbledore became so great, she answered that he had studied at Hogwarts and had the best teachers).

About the subjects of "Political Science, Finance, Business Management"... this really made me laugh. This is a series of books for children about a school for magic. Of course it wouldn't have those subjects.

** What bothers me about Hogwarts supposedly being the best school, is that there's no mention of non-British students going there. Seeing as it's a big fucking castle, they would definitely have the space to accommodate other European/world students. As it's a boarding school, and ~magical~ travel is pretty accessible, distance shouldn't be a problem. Being Dutch myself, English is a lot easier to learn than French or Russian (which is what I assume Durmstrang teaches in). So why are there no European kids at Hogwarts? Were there any pre-Voldemort's first reign and were they pulled out because of that? Or is it because if you're going to send your kid somewhere far away anyway, you might as well go for the best one there is (and it's not Hogwarts)? Of course, another way to compare schools is the Triwizard tournament: even with the help of their teachers, Fleur and Viktor were both bested by Cedric and Harry. However, as far as I can see, Cedric thought out of the box and Harry got it spelled out for him. Then in the second task, both Cedric and Fleur went down the same route, but Cedric was better able to defend himself from the grindylows. Are grindylows native to France though? Did Fleur expect them to be there? Krum did quite well in this task, although his transfiguration was incomplete. I wonder whether that wasn't on purpose though, as this allowed him to use his hands&wand. Harry got a lot of help and was still an idiot. In the last task, Krum got attacked from behind and Fleur got attacked by Krum, so both got sabotaged. In short, the Triwizard tournament is not really ideal to compare schools.

As a side note: why was Voldemort trying to work his way from England out? Did he not manage to gain support in Europe? Grindelwald seems to have had a lot more success in comparison, and we don't know whether there wasn't some wizard on the rise during Genghis Khan/the Roman empire/the Cold war. for example. (Going by the trend of Muggle and wizarding history to be semi-parallel.)

** I disagree!

Hogwarts is not the best school (at least not anymore!).

The teaching is inconsistent (Defense!) and slow (people like Hermione (and to some extent: Harry - at least in defense!) get slowed down because of people like Goyle etc.).

The school itself is unsafe (partly because of Dumbledore's decisions, but also because of stuff like trick-stairs, doors that lead to other places depending on the time/day etc.)

The professors are, to put it midly, either bullies or accessories to bullying (those badges during the tournament, the heir of slytherin stuff, the abuse by Umbridge and Snape etc. etc. not to mention returning both Harry and Tom Riddle to abusive environments!)

Some classes are needlessly dangerous (Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class for example and potions (I mean Snape doesn't bother with basic instructions - he just spells instructions on the board and that's it!)

It lacks a lot of classes from languages to stuff like enchanting (are people who want to learn that supposed to do that in their own time? or do you only learn that when you start at some company?) and politics/law!

The grounds aren't great either (not much to do if you don't play Quidditch and if you don't like to hang out in the library!)

Not to mention that you need permission to leave school (come on with the Floo and Portkeys the students shouldn't even have to stay there!), I mean I took the bus to the next city regularly at 11 (so restricting Hogsmead is kind of stupid) and that's not within walking distance (Hosmead is)

Also: The teachers are over-worked (7 years of students and one teacher has to handle all of them for multiple lessons every week (and it's only 2 houses per lesson so it's double that in lessons for the 4 houses!) and some of them are heads of a house in addition (and deputy headmistress in McGonagall's case)? That's not such a great idea, a lot of stuff will fall through the cracks!)

Not to mention that Dumbledore is even more over-worked (Headmaster, Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock)...it's no wounder he doesn't regularly teach anymore (which IMHO every headmaster should still do, even if it's only for a few lessons a week - otherwise the headmaster will lose touch with his students and fellow teachers!)

Also: With that many unused classrooms there were either additional classes once (enchanting, warding, duelling (maybe even fencing - in the old times!) etc.) or more of the same (meaning more staff and less overworked teachers) - or even both!

** I don't think so. Hogwarts' curriculum seems to be as bas as they come, with the ministry trying to leave everyone as helpless as possible. Then there are (some of) the students undertaking deadly adventures without the professors so much as trying to hinder them and Dumbledore hiring not only incompetent, but outright dangerous individuals for teaching. We've never seen the full scope of Hogwarts' library, but if hearsay is anything to go by, it should be massive; especially the restricted section. If all schools were like Hogwarts, I think the wizarding world would have died out centuries ago. The only possibility is there being better school in other countries. Durmstrang for example. While having a bad name for teaching the dark arts, it seems the students are more than competent. So probably you got better teachers, a better curriculum and this all without Britain's bigotry against anything classified as 'dark' by the ministry.
