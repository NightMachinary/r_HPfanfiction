I think it could be really interesting and and something different for the hp fanfic community

Edit more magical China based questions/speculation

Ok this question adds to the discussion. Could the great wall be magical? If so how and what would it's purpose be?

The taracota(spelling) army is magical what is its purpose?

What does Shangri la truly contain. It's got to have something special right


** The author needs to have a good understanding of traditional Chinese culture, which is something rather rare in English-speaking countries.

China has its own brand of literature dealing with supernatural abilities, mostly in the form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia][Wuxia Genre]]. Its most famous author is Jin Yong (or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong][Louis Cha]] in English), whose books have sold for several hundred million copies so far. When I was working in China as an expat, I had the opportunity to watch several adaptations of his novels on TV. They were generally entertaining, but highly violent, at least far more so than the canon HP Books, and parents mostly let their children watch them. One movie adaptation, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsman_II][Swordsman II]] starring Jet Li, was also shown in English movie theaters.

--------------

I have no idea about how Communists are going to deal with magic. Historically speaking, China never had a state religion, and was never hostile to magic or other supernatural powers based on religious grounds. Its rulers would promote or persecute groups depending on whether they supported or opposed the Imperial court.

So my speculation is that Chinese Magical population was split and fought a long civil war, with factions supporting and opposing the Communists. However, China has made huge progress in recent decades, which leads me to think that the regime had made peace with hostile Magical factions in its own country, and could focus on becoming a superpower once again.

***** I feel the same, though I would go further and say all the martial artists are actually wizards. 'Chi' or 'inner energy' is their wandless magic. Qing-gong (scaling walls, skipping on water) is much like flying wandless which is a feat that Voldemort and Snape were capable of. (Maybe Voldemort learned it from the Chinese?)

Anything Jin Yong is my jam. I especially love 'Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils'. In that book there is the art of 'Six Pulses Excalibur' which is like a wandless Sectumsempra - invisible cutting spells directed by the hand.

*** JKR did her research well. Cho (秋), or Qiu in modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin][Pinyin]], is a common Chinese girl name and means 'Autumn' in English. We can further deduce that Cho was from Canton region because this pronunciation of the character 秋 is standard Cantonese.

Her last name Chang is pronounced [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_(surname][Zhang]]) in modern Pinyin. It's the third most common family name in China, and a census in 2007 identified 87.50 million bearers of that name.

I need to point out that MANY Chinese characters have the SAME pronunciation.

As I explained before, Cho in HP was Cantonese, and it would be pronounced differently in main Chinese.

** Completely unfounded ideas to enjoy:

- The Great Wall was made as planned- a barrier to defend the realm from barbarian invaders. The souls of the slave labor who died in its construction and whose bodies fill the deep spaces between bricks also defend the Middle Kingdom from the barbarians, specifically the sorcerers of those tribes who may otherwise have chosen to magically sap those walls.

  #+begin_quote
    Later dynasties used the enchanted aspects of the Wall as their local version of Azkaban. Criminal sorcerers were implanted into the wall for their imprisonment. For the length of their punishment they walked alongside the defender spirits, labouring to rebuild a never-ending segment of the wall.
  #+end_quote

- The terracotta warriors and surrounding necropolis were constructed so that they could be transported into a Hidden Realm of magic, enabling a sudden presence for the first Emperor and his host to establish a stronghold in the foothills of this fairy land. What was left behind were the shells of their muggle-side presence.

- This is the land sometimes called Shangri La, Xanadu, Nirvana, Hy Breasil, Avalon... the city of clay is only one gateway to this promised land, an unearthly paradise only open to magical beasts and beings.

The Age of Sail and the growth of European imperialism forced the hand of the Asian wizards- many were uninterested in living lives of secrecy and chose to migrate to the Hidden Realm. A substantial drop in Asiatic magicians may have accelerated the success of the invaders, making the lesser portion who had stayed unable to resist the imposition of European Confederacy rule.

In modern times, those few new wizards who arise in the populations from the western edge of the Himalayas all the way to the Pacific coastline are offered the simple choice; stay with the muggles, living an inconsequential life with strict control over when and how magic may be used, or migrate to the Hidden Realm.

Easy way to handle it in fanfic is to introduce several characters of that culture and be respectful of them (aka not writing them as willing to drop everything to teach The Mighty Whitey).

This fic uses Korean magic and culture in a respectful and fascinating way through an OC Korean-British magical immigrant family. It's also a Sherlock crossover and Christianity themes come into play later in the fic. Linkffn(a study in magic)
