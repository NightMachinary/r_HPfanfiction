Should be self-explanatory


** This would be amazing... oh gosh. Can you imagine?

- Harry has contacts throughout the entire magical world
- Accompanies Slughorn to festivals, concerts, quidditch matches
- potions?! Actually becomes proficient at potions
- Slytherin-ing. It would actually be really interesting to see a Gryffindor Harry accept that he's got Slytherin tendencies

I feel like this Harry could be really 'Healthy' in the psychological sense. He'd grow up unbiased of the houses and he'd be really socialised. Oh gosh I want to read/write this.
