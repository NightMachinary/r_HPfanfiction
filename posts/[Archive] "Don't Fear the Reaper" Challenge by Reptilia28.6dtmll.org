"Dont Fear the Reaper" challenge, by fanfiction.net user Reptilia28

This challenge was originally posted on Reptilia28's user page. However, the user has since disavowed and removed it after, I infer, high levels of message spam related to the challenge. I have since used the author's notes of several different pieces written for the challenge to compile the text and reproduce it here for posterity. Considering there are dozens of stories on Fanfiction.net based on it, I felt it was a piece of history to be perserved. Feel free to use this as a discussion thread for your favorite stories written as part of the challenge!

"STORYLINE:

*) Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.

*) Harry's Death (who can have a human name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting perilously close to getting this particular one fired.

*) When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl...") and lived to be a centennial age. But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.

*) Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.

*) Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.

REQUIREMENTS:

*) Harry must have died at least three times before this one

*) The memory keeping contract must be included

*) Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant

*) Obviously, must be H/Hr

*) Have fun

OPTIONAL:

*) Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises"


** The hhr is inaccurate. It was orginally a hhr or any pairing without ginny. When it was thought of tho the harmony movement was at fullswing.

Also, Harry's age was never specified. Everything else was good tho!

*** Thanks for letting me know! I'll see if I can find anything else on that. Its difficult to find it's most original form cause not even the Wayback Machine has an archived copy.

** I despise these challenges. I really do. They sound like the author of the "challenge" was too fucking lazy to write his own damn story and decided to ask other people to write it for him.

This is a prompt:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
#+end_quote

The entire rest is a commission. It restricts every bit of creativity the author could push into it, but hey - /puts cynic cap on/ - that is probably why so many fanfiction authors like it.

*** It reminds me of a pseudo interview Burnie Burns (Writer of "Red vs Blue") did. "For starting authors, I say give yourself constraints. Too often we're told writing is an open canvas where we can do anything we want. We get overwhelmed by choice and stagnate. I had two forts in a box canyon, a couple of vehicles, and a skull. It forced me to be creative with what I had."

And I think that's the appeal. It gives direction in the endless void of possibility.

**** And the HP universe isn't enough restriction already?

Add in:

#+begin_quote
  must not have fanon concepts
#+end_quote

There you go. Restrictions applied. More than 99% of the people who do these challenges could actually deal with. But telling people what girl Harry /must/ date and how often he had already died and /parts of the plot/ is not positive restriction, its simply setting limits to a contractor.

*** Maybe... it provides enough of a framework to work with, in a 'constraints are good' kind of way?

#+begin_quote
  Harry has an annoying habit of dying before his time. After one death too many, the Soul Reaper assigned to the case decides to take matters in hand and train the Boy-Who-Lived up to scratch. Good thing he's already dead; 'cause this just might kill him!

Cant stand that character, even in AU settings.

I'm pretty sure that's not rational.
