Everybody's always talking about Snape and Dumbledore when it comes to constantly-different portrayals of characters in fanfiction, but something I've begun noticing is that there are wildly different trends when it comes to everyoen's favourite dogfather, Sirius Black. The options I've seen:

- He's a generally friendly guy who usually acts like a less inhibited Harry, except for having had the worst past 12 years in the histroy of Man.

- He's a positively /insane/ man-child (though in a likable way), possibly because the years in Azkaban stunted his maturing (but not always).

- As a possible corollary to the above, Loony Sirius may be rather dirty-minded with a penchant for pretty woman and strong spirits. This will generally be used for comic relief.

- He's an impulsive, borderline-unlikable man who is more concerned with killing Pettigrew in as painful a way as he can devise than he is with winning the war. This version's attempt to kill Snape is played up to its full potential, and Mean Sirius may try again in the story's present-day if given the chance.

- He never ougrew his Marauder self and serves as an older equivalent to the Weasley twins; his pranks can be over-the-top but are never mean.

What do you think is the best way to go?


** Deeply damaged by his ordeal in Azkaban, but holding it together for Harry. Quipping and joking and making lewd remarks, as well as pranking - all that's as much a facade as it is true. He's also quite cruel and brutal, though he tends to want an excuse to let that shine through. He's not as impulsive any more as he was, but he's brooding if he lets himself, and as reckless and foolhardy as he was as a teenager, possibly also subconsciously suicidal.

** From what we see in OOTP, Sirius has always been a little on the moody side. He likes fun, for sure, but has a habit of taking it too far - perhaps speaking to his tendancy to be a little self-absorbed. He also seems to greatly admire James; there's suggestions that their humour played off each other a lot as a little comedy act. What they perceived as friendly banter may have been regarded by others as ganging up and bullying.

His characterisation is a major reason I find most Wolfstar fics unbearable. They often turn him into a sugar-high, effeminate, gushy stereotype with no basis whatsoever. Perhaps this is to highlight that Azkaban changed him, but honestly I don't think it did - I think it froze him in time and never let him grow up from the immature young man he was.

** Clearly the best way to go with Sirius is to have him live up to his family name. Dude grew up with people like Walburga and Bellatrix, planned a murder by werewolf at fifteen (or thereabouts), went after Peter with murderous intent and came out of Azkaban after twelve years still harboring that murderous intent.

Sirius is my favourite canon character, but admittedly more for the potential than his actual portrayal.

*** He's my favourite character too (probably on account of me age). I think Rowling could have developed him much more than she did. I think she was a bit frightened of him.

*** Damn straight. Even if you play him as jokey and bright, he should no matter what have the aura of a dangerous man underneath. That's the razors edge.

** Sirius is actually a complex enough character, not to mention bipolar enough after living through Hell in Azkaban, that ALL of those characterisations might fit him to a bigger or lesser degree; they could be said to be five different sides of his character and which of them is in charge depends entirely on the mood he's in on that particular day, or who he's talking to.

If Harry or someone he cares about is feeling troubled and in need of support, Friendly Sirius is there to lend a sympathetic ear or treat them to a Butterbeer.

It the person he's talking to is Snape or Kreacher, or he gets antsy from being cooped up too long, Mean Sirius is front and center.

With the Weasley Twins, or if he just gets a case of the sillies, Marauder Sirius or Loony Sirius comes out to play.

And when time comes to action, Insane Sirius leaps into the fray with no thought for his own safety or for anything but the thrill of the battle.

All these sometimes self-contradictory moods are perfectly Sirius, and any fic portraying him as either has at least part of his canon characterisation down. It's just that these fics focus on one part of him to the exclusion of all the others.

** I prefer the last one, with some added responsibility. This was a man who lived on rats in a cave an entire year fior the sake of his godson. That he propably walks down memory lane a couple of time isn't something I'd blame him for.

I think ShayaLonnie captures him well in Misplaced Moony, and I'm quite a fan of the "overprotective dad" Sirius (who's still got a sense of humour) in the Unknown Relations series.

** I think slightly bipolar. He's a person who escaped an abusive insane family and had great friends. He escaped Azkaban and gets to see Harry and Remus again. Things to be hopeful and happy about. Sirius also fought in a war where his best friend died as did several other friends and one of his closest betrayed them, as a result he spent over a decade rotting in Azkaban and while the Dementors didn't affect him as badly as the others they still did get to him. He escaped only to be imprisoned within his former home with a portrait and a house elf for company both of which hate him.

Something to note about Sirius is he has a very odd sense of priorities and view on mortality. Look at Snape and Mooney, not saying he wouldn't hate Snape but that was too far and worst of all Remus would be the one to live with the consequences. Then there is the whole baby Harry vs Peter thing and how he tries to compensate for that in Harry's fourth year by living in a cave and eating rats. I don't know quite why he couldn't apparate around nor did he seem to use magic to improve his situation, maybe he couldn't or perhaps he felt he deserved to live like that after all that happened. Maybe he'd just gone round the bend.

*** I think it took him awhile to get a wand. Plus, he likely couldn't apparate without splinching, you do need focus, and he was fairly insane.

** Sirius was never fully sane. No child would be growing up rebelling in the House of Black. He was a stubborn, impulsive, and dark humor driven child who lashed out at anyone he didnt think was kosher. He was a lazy, brilliant student who excelled at everything without trying. He was the pretty boy in the second row who would goof off during the lecture, and then preform the spell within the first ten tries. He was the idea man of the maruaders. He was the ambitious one, the wild card. Lupin was soft spoken, and a calming voice. Peter was the weaklink; the little brother that everyone found slightly annoying but loved anyway. James was the leader, the one who reigned in Sirius from crossing the line; by force if necessary. When I think of Sirius' decision making before Azkaban and Harry's birth it comes down to this line of thought: Is it funny? Will it harm my brothers? Does it benefit me or my brothers. It explains how he justified the attempted murder of Snape by werewolf. Snape would get cold feet before he even got close to Moony after all, and the look of fear would be priceless! No harm no foul right?... Then they graduated... and he had to grow up a bit... people were dying, disappearing, the War was on. He learned to love the fight... the /rush/ the /freedom/... the cheering with James, Lily, Peter and Remus after a good fight! Nothing compared.... then Harry was born... this little bundle of life... this beautiful child... as Sirius held him, something in him grew. By Merlin nothing in this world would Harm Harry Potter while he still breathed! And that was why he switched secret keepers.... he would protect Harry and James and Lily, and that was final.

When he saw James' body... I think something inside Sirius snapped. He only had two things running through his mind... secure Harry. Well Hagrid is here... and I fought with Hagrid, he's a bloody hard bloke to kill. If I put him on my bike, Hagrid will take Harry to Dumbledore where he will be safe... I have to exterminate the rat... the other threat to my godson...I must avenge James and Lily...

Those thoughts were what drove him to chase Peter, I bet. When Peter blew up the street, I honestly think that Sirius thought he killed himself. He started to laugh, knowing his world was crushed, his friends dead, the aurors surrounding him and then he was in *hell*.

Azkaban is not an easy place. It holds no remorse, pity or mercy in its stone walls... As Sirius sat in his cell for 12 years, his worst moments were replayed over, and over, and over. Every failure... he should have known Peter was the traitor...every flaw...if he had visited James and Lily earlier maybe they would be alive.... and most importantly... he abandoned Harry.

He breaks out... fuelled by the thought of protecting his godson from the threat of Pettigrew he some how powers through a mental and psychological trauma that has no true equal in the world of muggles. He finally sees Harry... most likely flying in the Quiddich match against hufflepuff... He most likely momentarily switches from Padfoot to Sirius to watch jam- no Harry... he's Harry... he just looks like James... fly... oh Merlin the boy can fly!

He would switch back abruptly... emotional overload, or maybe a lucid moment of understanding that he could not be seen there... not if he could save Harry.

this continues all through out Harry's third year. He becomes more and more lucid, and coherent. He mentally slowly applies Harry, oh he looks just like James, to James' place as his mental anchor.

It explains why there is always that vibe that Sirius is never healed... he never grieved. He was forced to relieve the death of James and Lily for 12 years. Remus we see has slowly moved on, as has the rest of the world... but not Sirius.

Azkaban, and his childhood, both left him with the pathological need to be free. He could have cleared his name if he really really wanted too. All it would take is some bribes from the Black fortune, and some Truth Serum after all. He remained a criminal because he was /free/ as a criminal. Until Order of the Phoenix, where Dumbledore ordered him to stay in his first prison...

Sirius is a guy who craves the rush, and never healed from the death and betrayal of his closest friends. He has a darker, wilder side than the other Marauders because he is a Black... each one has their obsession and Dark tendencies.

He did not look past his circle of personal friends... and Merlin help you if you harmed someone in that circle. That vendetta would never die.

** I'm not going to go indepth on Sirius characterizations, except I will touch on one thing.

Sirius has an edge to him, both pre- and post-Azkaban. Pre-Azkaban he gave Snape just enough metaphorical rope to metaphorically hang himself via werewolf. Post-Azkaban, well, that should be obvious. Even if you have him joking or moody or whatever, there should be that dangerous edge of a dangerous man lying underneath.

** If there was a Sirius Black fandom I'd be there rather than here for sure. No other character in HP has caught my interest so much. I think he was pretty self destructive from early on, before Azkaban, even before he knew James -- and not a happy person. But this is part of what I wrote about him on my ffn profile.

#+begin_quote
  . . .. Haunted by the demons of grief and guilt, clever, impulsive, mercurial, charming, broken. And he's a dog. What's not to like?

Edit: And I kept looking but I was quite disappointed not to find any recs on the recent characterisations thread. Not surprised though, because when I asked for recs quite a while ago I didn't get any then either.

** I would kind of lean towards the insane man-child, but subdued. Like the mental instability is lurking underneath the surface. He tries to keep it together but it pops out sometimes - his easily changing moods, how he's very restless, etc. I find that most realistic.

** As fr myself, I prefer the fifth, "Marauder" self, with just a hint of the second one. I don't like lewd humor in general, hence my dislike of Sirius #3, and while Sirius #4 could be an interesting character, I can't bring myself to like him at all, making it hard for me to feel particularly concerned about whether or not he escapes Azkaban.

** I always found him to be stunted (with good reason) and immature, with poor self control. A compelling character in a lot of ways, but not an admirable one. He's a hothead; he goes after Peter for revenge immediately and gets himself locked up, doesn't think for a minute about how a drop of veritaserum or a touch of whatever flavour of mind reading would clear him to take care of the orphaned child he is now legal guardian of. He throws off responsibility in favour of revenge. Harry says that he doesn't think his dad would want his best friends to become murderers, but I personally think James wouldn't have been too impressed with Sirius anyway at that point. He and Lily entrusted their son to him and he blew it.

** I always found him to be an asshole, an insane one at that.. what its shown of him in cannon makes him to me rather unlikeable, even James looks like an asshole.. and best not talk about Remus, that guy has some serious problems.

Honestly though, most of JKR characters have some mental issues. Poor Luna is the only sane one.
