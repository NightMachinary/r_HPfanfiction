Not necessarily because of some weird Harry/Dumbledore sex scene, I mean some very dark fics

** Linkffn(12838231) *Warning it is very disturbing and not for faint hearted.

I don't remember the name of another fic. I think that was a crossover, and Harry's sperm has power to bring dead back.

**** Maybe it's bad that one of my stories was given here? Honestly, though, I don't think Sparky's Surprise is well-written at all. I tried to change it to make it an easier read, but found that I couldn't.

** The casual darkness of the main cast of Pygmalion by Colubrina is disturbing. It's strange and unpleasant to see characters like Harry, Hermione, and Neville going casually into dark magics like sacrificing children. Especially since the fic is written from their point of view as it they were right and Dumbledore was wrong for distrusting them.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

** I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] series. It is by far the best Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter I have ever read, and it contains some truly memorable parts. Its second volume, linkao3(1143960) has incredible combination of “Orwell with dementors”, and talking about the most disturbing fic linkao3(3721315) made me problems with sleeping for some time. Everbody have probably their own triggers, but for me this kind of behaviour made me really sick.

** I won't link it lest I run afoul of Rule 8, but /Dashed Hopes, and Good Intentions/ by Catsintheattic on AO3 fucked me up real bad. Mind the tags.

/These Walls Stand Silent/ by celestineangel (also on AO3) is pretty disturbing too. Again, mind the tags.
