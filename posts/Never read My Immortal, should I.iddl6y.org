I have never read My Immortal but I've seen some reddit posts on it. And from what I've seen it absolutely sucks. But should I read it or is it a waste of time?


** If you want a good laugh then give it a read.

I've never been able to finish the fic though, it's a difficult one to get through.

**** It makes no sense, which is why it's so funny.

It's poorly written too, which adds to the comedy.

** My Immortal is the Harry Potter version of those old classic movies everyone says you should absolutely watch, but then you do and they're quite unappealing by modern standards.

It's not a story you're going to find your life changed by, reread when you feel sad, and/or enjoy thoroughly. It's more of a cultural touchstone you should flick through just to have read it and experienced that... phenomenon. Like The Room, or Troll 2. :)

** I'd say it depends on your sense of humor. If you are/were into or aware of that 2000s gay/emo/weeb fanfiction.net kinda stuff you will probably find it entertaining for the nostalgia alone. That said, I agree it is very hard to read and wouldn't recommend it if you need to be able to think or write in the next 24 hours. I love this reading of chapter 17, should give you a taste for what you'd be in for:

** My Immortal is a story that became as big as it did due to the mystique that surrounded it. Functionally, it's just a very badly written, earnest in it's awfulness, self-insert fic. However, it has such wild interpretations of the canon characters that it almost circles around to seem intentionally comedic. The fic gained a lot of traction because nobody could tell if it really was written by an goth/emo teen named Tara, or if it was someone who was writing as a character named Tara, in an effort to parody all the edgy self-insert wish-fulfillment fics that existed during that time.

For me, I find it hilarious, but I've never finished it. It gets to be too much after a while, starts becoming more boring than funny. However, I highly recommend any videos on YouTube which do dramatic readings, or anyone who goes into the history and lore of the saga around My Immortal, and the people who claimed to be Tara.

Edit: Also, depending on your age, you might miss the context of how nearly everything in the story is a reference to early 2000s goth/emo culture. So it may seem funnier to us old beans because we lived during that time. There's a video by a Gen Z YouTuber I follow who researched My Immortal from the perspective of not having lived through it if you're interested.

** It's just a meme story. There's plenty of meme stories. No reason to read this specific one just because it gained some notoriety outside the fandom. There's plenty of other stories that could have easily been in its place, and I wouldn't subject yourself to it just for that.

** My Immortal is a parody, a comedy. It's poorly written deliberately as a parody on the mistakes authors do /without/ realising. You have to take it as humour, but if you do, it's a great laugh.
