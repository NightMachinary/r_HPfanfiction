I remember reading the first chapter on ff.net long ago, then someone on here mentioned further chapters but I could never find them (or the story again when I went looking for it).

If memory serves it takes place 5th year

Edit: I remember a bit more. There is an Order meeting at Grimmauld in the beginning where Dumbledore talks to Fleur.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

Also explains why I couldn't find it.

How does DLP work? What do you have to do to be able to read the stories there?
