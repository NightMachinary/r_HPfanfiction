We all know that the Dursleys treatment of Harry was not the best, and I doubt they would have given him the talk aside from ordering him to keep his freak hands from girls.

Without Harry being really much different from canon, are there any fanfics where Harry never got The Talk from anyone and so does not know Tab A fits into slot B, so to say ?

It would be funny to read if he does not know what to do beyond kissing as that is all he has seen his classmates do or has had done to him, or what to do with girls in general.


** He's, uh, 10. Surely he would pick it up at roughly the same time as the other kids.

Though it would be funny if Hagrid or even Molly /assumed/ he didn't know because of his upbringing, and tried to explain it to him.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

That scene (what brief part we're shown of it, and the immediate aftermath) is one of my favorites in any fic to date.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** Harry shares a dorm with four other boys his age. I can believe him being the last of the group to figure out the mechanics of sex, but there is /no way/ he manages to remain completely innocent of it. (Seamus in particular seems to be frequently characterized in such a way that would lend itself towards running his mouth on the subject.)
