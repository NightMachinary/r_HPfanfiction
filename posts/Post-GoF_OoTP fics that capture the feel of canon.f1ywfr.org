Time to get back to basics. The type of story that really drew me into fanfic were those that emulated the magic of Hogwarts and was a "typical" Harry Potter story, but managed to explore the world/characters in a way canon didn't. Does anyone have some good fics that fall into this category? A little bit of romance (pairing doesn't matter) wouldn't hurt either.


** I've really been feeling the nostalgia lately, so I'd love to find some too. Haven't read any though.

** Oooh... I know some fics that capture the early-canon feel amazingly well, but I can't think of any that do that with late canon.
