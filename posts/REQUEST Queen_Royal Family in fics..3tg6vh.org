I'm weird and I like seeing the Royal family in fics. All fics welcome, as long as they are well written. I've probably read a good amount of them already, but I haven't gone specifically looking for them.

I'm not the biggest fan of muggle military in fics, but seeing the Muggle Queen and Prime Minister and such are absolutely delightful.

Now that I'm thinking of it, I don't think I've seen a next-gen fic with the Royal Family....

  A seventh-year saga that begins one hour after Dumbledore's funeral. Harry gets some unexpected and unexpectedly useful help from the Muggle World...so much that wonders whether the power he knows not is actually the British monarchy! HHr, RWLL

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
