**** Note also that self-inserts have a bit of a bad name because so many authors (particularly young ones) just use them as a more explicit mary-sue/peggy-sue power trip- "the author pops in to the start of book 1 as an 11-year-old (or as the DADA teacher) with knowledge of how everything went down in the books and makes friends with everyone and fixes everything!"

When done well they're a peggy-sue story without the angst.

(mary-sue- unrealistically perfect main character.)

(peggy-sue- character pops up with knowledge of the future, tries to fix things; usually time travel is involved)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all. (Formerly titled 'Gilding the Son of Lily').

** This is the first self insert I've gotten more then 2 paragraphs into, so it's already got that going for it lol.

It's a pretty good story, well written, and the passing is quick, which I like in my fanfics. It's a bit too crack-y for my liking though, but I guess you really can't do a si super seriously. In saying that, would recommend.
