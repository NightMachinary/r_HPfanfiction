I'm about to start reading a fic on fanfiction.net and it's a really long one but I have no idea how to see if it is completed. Does someone know?


** Usually the author marks it as Complete. On a desktop, it'll say so around the summary.

Example (bolding my emphasis): "The Power of the Press by Bobmin356 reviews\\
Forewarned Harry makes his escape from Britain, leaving the tournament in shambles. Protected by family, Harry sets about to fulfill his destiny free from the bigotry and manipulation of others.\\
Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Romance/Drama - Chapters: 9 - Words: 235,257 - Reviews: 658 - Favs: 5,556 - Follows: 1,810 - Published: Dec 25, 2012 - Harry P., Hermione G. - *Complete*"

On mobile, there is a little scroll icon with a C in it, near the top of the page in the open story, or on the first line of the summary.

** If there's a C on the Scroll/Parchment then it's Complete. You can also set your search to only complete fics. Sometimes more fics exist that compose a fanfiction then you have to look under the Authors own page (what fic are you reading).

** You can never be sure.

For example, on FFN some authors mark a work complete when it's actually abandoned; you get to the end and it's just unresolved. On AO3 the work might be complete but end---again unresolved---with a note that a sequel will be "coming soon" but it's been six years and nothing else was ever posted.

You pays your money and you takes your chances.

** On FFN the most recent reviews tend to consist of 'I hope you update soon' if a fic is incomplete.
