I'm looking for one where Harry is thrown to the marauder era. But in the body of someone there. I.e he is already in a family, but still has his future knowledge. I don't care if he is fully raised, i.e he goes to a 3 year old body. Or if he basically takes over some guys body. But he goes to school with the marauders and co, preferably from year 1


** “The Last Peverell by animerocker646” linkffn(12744735) ... very active WIP; the “takes over some guys body”, except it is some gal. It is fem!Harry, but it is not a cheap copy of Harry with boobs and not a lemon, so it is as good as somebody completely random.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)
