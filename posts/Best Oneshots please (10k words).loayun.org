What are the best oneshots - Something that was really thought provoking or funny or tragic or well written. Something you could really sink your teeth into and kept you thinking of it for ages.

Any style or genre. Any plot or era. Preferably less than 10k words if possible.

I just like little short stories that I could almost discuss at a bookclub.


** I really like "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8592676][pretend you don't have one]]", a non-linear, Severus-centric AU that depicts his life and relationships at Hogwarts and how they shaped him and lead him to make the choices he did and live the life he does.

"[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431269][Saturdays are for Football (The Rest of the Week is for Everything Else)]]" is something I've read recently and enjoyed too. It's set after the second war and is about Blaise Zabini and Dean Thomas. They're distantly related and bond over football and Blaise is confronted by what the inaction of people (purebloods who weren't death-eaters but also didn't object to what was happening) like him led to during the war.

Then my last suggestion is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7681432][blood will tell but it often tells too much]]". It's a story about Percy Weasley that's set right after the war. It's about him struggling to help the Ministry get back in order, with what he did during the war, the ways he failed and succeeded, and reconnecting with his family.

#+begin_quote
  In 1996 Dumbledore contracts a fatal curse. He had always considered himself ready to die, but when he considers the burdens he's leaving for those who remain, at the onset of the Second Wizarding War, he is faced with a dilemma.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.” The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. “I've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.”“And I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats.
