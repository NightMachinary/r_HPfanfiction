** OP/BASHY prompt: Remus approaches Harry after his first Dada Class. After a few weeks Remus asks about if Harry had gotten into any adventures yet jokingly. Everything about the first two years comes out. Remus is horrified and gets Harry to take him to the Chamber.

Carcass is claimed, money is made, compensation is paid and Ron becomes a jealous shit. Harry and Hermione break it off from Ron becoming closer.

Boom, fireworks go off and Harmony is born!

Non bashy prompt. After the Dementor game Harry is stuck in the infirmary for a week. Hermione spends every spare minute beside him just as he spent all his time beside her last year. Sparks fly and Boom! Harmony.

*** Your ideas give me an idea! I keep the bit about Remus learning of the previous two years adventures and being horrified and becomes a father figure to Harry. Harry then struggles to cope with having a father figure and confides in Hermione for help

** Canon intro of who Sirius is, and Arthur warning Harry not to go looking for him. Harry tells that bit of info to Hermione, Hermione some way gets an idea to find out Harry's family connections to the Blacks, finds some sort of legal paper copies to allow Harry into his parents vault (without emancipation) so that he is able to see all legal paperwork signed involving him only including their will. Which would state Sirius as his godfather and the two take off from there, where Harry finds this new light in Hermione and he starts having these feelings pop up but because he doesn't have a parent figure it takes him a while to sort through them and comes to find he's starting to fancy her ? (This is on the fly but if it's remotely interesting I can perhaps go into more detail)

**** Request copies of the documents from Gringots. It never hurts to ask. Request a statement from them, and while doing so, ask for the copies. You could even wait a week and send it again. Have a goblin show up at the school. Remember, he's not getting ANY fan mail. Mail redirecting ward. They take their banking seriously.

Hell, they could write to the Department of Records in the Ministry after the fact.

***** Then also could have the cliche trope of Harry befuddled on the fact the Gringots has been sending him months invoices and Annual account details and he's not once gotten a single letter

I think all this would be fun to do in hiding, and not necessarily become a dumbles bashing story but a slytherin action worthy one? And then reveal it to dumbles at the end or towards the end how they knew these things all along and had been gathering evidence on dumbles interference and all other adults who may have been interfering. Or all of this gets told to Sirius and his non trial and he starts putting the pieces together that dumbledore is not the all seeing greatest force that everyone worships him to be

****** It doesn't even have to be Dumbles bashing. He could have genuinely forgot. Or wanted to save him from the Durseley's ire.

We do need more inner slytherin Harry fics.

** During the Firebolt argument Harry questions how it could be cursed/jinxed. After all, he suffered a cursed broomstick in his first year but it wasn't magic pre-applied to the broom itself. This leads to being told, either by Hermione or McGonagall, that the sort of magic that makes brooms requires upper level Runes and/or Arithmancy.

 

Given that it was the broomstick flying by itself that was as much or more of a release than Quidditch was, Harry therefore has a reason to be interested in one/both of those subjects. (Not uber competency at it, but it would be the first time, at Hogwarts if not ever, he'd have a subject he wants to learn about that isn't partially motivated by self defense/not wanting to die;. I could see a 6th/7th year Harry tinkering with/fixing the infamously shoddy school brooms as an enjoyable activity to clear his head/work through some of that Angst. He was always better with practical than theory. And it's a nice opportunity to make Madam Hooch an actual person rather than just a rarely mentioned referee)

Cue either Harry transferring to those classes (since for the Firebolt to have been sent in time to be useful it had to have been rather early in the year) or someone tutoring Harry to transition into transferring classes. Hermione volunteers her own time to dedicate to this as well, but McGonagall is hardly going to assign her to tutor a fellow third year, especially given the schedule Hermione is already running (Perhaps Harry, upon getting just as irritated as in canon from having his terrible death predicted and looking at an even heavier schedule, drops Divination?)

 

In between greater interactions with Hermione (either via extra classes or tutoring) and greater interactions with students that share Hermione's other classes (especially since the electives are by their nature smaller classes sizes than the core curricula where the throw multiple Houses worth of kids together), the ever oblivious Harry has a much greater chance to catch out Hermione either on a logical inconsistency or it notice much sooner how she's running herself into the ground.

 

Cue time travel reveal, and Harry's concern over her burnout, maybe (apart from all the other bonding opportunities up til now) add him marveling that even with her time traveling mess of an overloaded plate she's still trying to dive through centuries of legal minutiae to save Buckbeak. Not all that hard to go to Harmony from there.

** Why don't they give Hedwig a workout? If it's a a Hermione pairing, have Hedwig ordering books, requesting documents/information from Gringots/Ministry.

â€‹

Buy her parents an owl for her Birthday.

â€‹

Do you want Sirius freed after the fact? Get books on how evidence/Criminal Law works. Submit memories to the DMLE after the fact.

â€‹

This is Hermione we are talking about, so lots of research. Have her work on Harry not applying himself. Remember, the Durselys punished Harry when he got better grades than Dudley.

â€‹

Remember Crookshanks? You can have the Ron/Hermione blowup happen in diagon alley. Give Harry/Hermione a reason to float around different shops there too.
