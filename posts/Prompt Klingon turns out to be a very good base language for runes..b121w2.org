** Base language in what sense? Canonically, Runes are literally just like a foreign language study. Anything about "using" them for creating rituals, wards, etc. is all fanon.

*** I interpret this to be, if you're a super-nerd and can read/write Klingon, then "ancient runes" are familiar to you. They have enough similarities that it's not hard to learn the new rune language.

Basically, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Okrand][Marc Okrand]] is a muggleborn wizard who transformed "ancient runes" into the written Klingon language.

** I would think that using an absolutely unfamiliar language for spellcasting might give some advantages, particularly if the Klingon incantation changes the magic. Maybe that stunner comes out green enough to mimic the killing curse, for example.

Of course, this leads me to wonder how a Klingon-raised Harry would fare.
