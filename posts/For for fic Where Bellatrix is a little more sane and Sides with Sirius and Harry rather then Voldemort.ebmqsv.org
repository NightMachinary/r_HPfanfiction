I love stories with Voldemort's top Lieutenant is actually fighting for the light or Bellatrix may not. Necessarily be good but she is loyal to family above everything and fights like hell to get Sirius out of Azkaban.


** I remember, there was one fic where Bellatrix broke out of Azkaban in third year instead of Sirius; she was a panther animagus, and crazy-crazy rather than monster-crazy. She confessed that she hadn't tortured Neville's parents into insanity, but rather placed a specific curse on them that gave that impression, but could be reversed.

Hmm...I haven't read it in years, though. I wonder which one it was?

**** Another thing I remember about it was that Bellatrix in her panther form slipped into a muggle zoo. One of the zookeepers got a bit confused as to how they got a panther exhibit and how it kept disappearing, but he eventually got used to it.

...Oh, and it was on Fanfiction.net.
