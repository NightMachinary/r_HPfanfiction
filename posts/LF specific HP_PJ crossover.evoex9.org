I'm looking for a specific Harry Potter and Percy Jackson crossover. It was one of those twice blessed ones but was actually pretty good. There's a rewrite of it called Pandemonium ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]] ) which has been abandoned. The original is called Glorious Chaos and is a lot longer and was actually better. Just wondering if anyone downloaded a copy or something, thanks.


** I've written to the author asking for a copy. No idea if they'll respond, but if they do, I'll share.
