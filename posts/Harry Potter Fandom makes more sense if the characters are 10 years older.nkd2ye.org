So, Harry Potter as a cannon book series is filled with plot holes and things that don't make sense, which is partially why we have such a vibrant Fandom. Great world, not the best writing. However, most fanfictions have everyone acting likw their in their 20s. 11 year Olds are children who should be taught 0 combat, Noone should trust a 15 year old to lead a militia. Like, consider the people you have known irl at those ages. So, most fanfiction makes more sense if hogwarts starts at like, 20.


** Most of the 11 year olds I know irl could and would kill you if they wanted to or had reason too.

** Yeah, agreed. Been wanting to actually write one where Hogwarts starts at 16 and goes to 22. Basically high school-college combo.

This features character who, because of the age difference when starting hogwarts are almost ocs but there it is. unfinished but interesting.

** I mean we're used to teen novels where they go on this huge adventures and shit. But yeah, agreed. Things like the challenges in Philosopher's Stone is kinda easy to see.

But the basilisk? No shit. And the Tri-wizard Tournament? Why the fuck would you even let teenagers compete in something like this?

And how can a 15 yo teen be more knowledgeable than his older peers? Like Cho, for example and Fred and George and Lee. No matter how much stuff he went through, he doesn't have the sheer knowledge. He can't even do non-verbal spells.

Anyways there's a lot of shit that would have been way better if they were older.

** Alexander the Great started his campaign at 16 so considering that the Wizarding World is a little behind with the times, that's not so strange if you think about it. Agree though that children don't get taught much combat in first year. Harry doesn't cast a single spell on page.

** I disagree. First, it makes no sense waiting until their twenty to start their magical education, but I think the pacing is right as is. Harry doesn't get taught how to fight until second year, and even then (had Lockhart been competent), all he would've learned is Disarm and Block. In the wizarding world, that's vital. Of course, other students learn more complex spells around 1st to 2nd year. Hermione paralyses Neville, and Draco summons a snake, but considering their characteristics, that makes sense. Hermione wants to learn more; Draco has friends who wouldn't mind teaching him how to summon a venomous snake.

As for the later stuff. Sure, it doesn't make sense for a kid to go through the tri-wizard tournament, but he wasn't supposed to anyway. JK Rowling could've been more specific as to why he couldn't join, and fanfictions which make the GoF more powerful and dangerous fix that imo. And Harry starting Dumbledore's Army... that's more like a tutoring gig than an actual militant organisation. As much as it sounds like they're training for war, they're not really. They're not learning how to be soldiers, they're learning how to protect themselves from someone who had to protect themselves. Harry just turns out to be pretty good at it. And yea, no adult would trust a kid to lead a militia, but adults aren't, other fifteen year olds are, and zi don't know about you but teenagers tend to be idiots, so them trusting Harry makes a lot of sense.

** A good solution is to write the children as actual children and make the stories match. On that note, can anyone suggest any stories with absolutely no politics of any kind?

** I started to take an interest on post-war fanfics because of this actually, I just found a decent one where Draco comes back as a DADA professor, it's Draco/OFC where she's 18 on her 7th year and he is 19 (not so creepy).
