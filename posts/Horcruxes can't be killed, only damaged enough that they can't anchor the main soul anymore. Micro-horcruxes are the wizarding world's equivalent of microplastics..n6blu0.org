As a result of industry, there's tiny pieces of ground up plastic ending up in everything. Occasionally enough will collect in one place to cause obvious damage, like making fish starve with digestive systems full of plastic dust, but mostly they're just around, probably making everything a little bit shittier but not doing anything blatant enough that you can prove was their fault. You can't have as many kids as you want? There have always been people with low fertility, and you can't prove that you specifically have been affected by hormone mimics from microplastic...

So what if destroyed horcruxes fragment into dust instead of moving to the afterlife, just like how plastics break apart but never break down? What if evil soul dust hangs around, causing subtle, insidious changes? Of the babies born right after the war, there's a few more than there should be named Tom. A few garden snakes are found claiming to be Lord Voldemort, but are easily put down. A few specks of black dust rise from each dead snake and disperse in the wind. Children learn blood purist attitudes a bit too easily, and learn tolerance with a bit too much difficulty. Harry's scar doesn't hurt anymore, but it never feels quite right, either. Everything is just a little bit shittier than it should be, but it's hard to put your finger on.

** What if every time you kill any living creature, you shed a microhorcrux, like microplastics are shedded when you do the laundry? Kill a fly? Microhorcrux!

And creating a legit (macro)horcrux is actually like, uh, recycling the microplastic?

*** You know what's worse than doing laundry? Putting nylon clothing into a blender, making a plastic smoothie, and dumping it in the ocean.

Creating a macro-horcrux is using spare energy from your washing machine to tear off a sleeve from your shirt. Fiendfyring or basilisk-venoming the horcrux is like blending the sleeve and dumping the smoothie in the ocean. No recycling here. Just extra microplastic when someone finally gets around to killing your horcrux.

** Er...is this an actual prompt or a disguised effort to raise awareness of the effects of plastic pollution and encourage use of proper biodegradables and/or proper disposal of conventional plastic?\\
 \\
...Heh, now I'm imagining campaigning against toxic microhorcruxes. Don't be an irresponsible Dark Lord! Make your horcruxes psychodegradable! Make the world you murdered innocents for a healthier happier place!

*** An actual prompt. I want to see people dealing with something pervasive and insidious in a story, and I keep wondering how characters in fics actually know they've gotten rid of all the horcruxes.

**** ...Come to think of it, how /do/ characters in fanfic tend to know how many Horcruxes there are? I think in Luna's Hubby, Luna and Harry were able to triangulate the locations of all the horcruxes using Harry's scar, and in canon it took an estimate and a memory from Horace Slughorn where Tom got excited about 7 being the most powerful magical number...
