** There's always jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight The Coming Darkness]], although it's not as good as his later fics IMHO.

Edit: wait, Susan is a redhead?

*** Ah, To Fight The Coming Darkness. This fic suffers from Jbern's early writing problems, and it /really/ shows in his newer work. Just basic concepts like gigantic paragraphs, run on sentences, and the like. Also the random plot elements (Harry just magically transports himself into the middle of a battle and is far more powerful than we /ever/ see in cannon?).

It might be enjoyable if you read this /before/ his other work, but not the other way around unfortunately.

*** Her appearance is not described in the books other than that she wears her hair in a long plait, but the actresses cast for her both had red hair in the films.

*** Yeah, she was filmed as a redhead, so naturally all the fan fiction writers portray her that way
