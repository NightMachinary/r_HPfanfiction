So I'm in the middle of writing a scene in which the Twins get roaring drunk in the Leaky Cauldron. But it's not the Twins - it's Fred and my Slytherin protagonist Polyjuiced to look like George. They do this at the same time genuine George is doing a Potterwatch broadcast. It's part of a plan to deflect Ministry suspicion that the Twins are behind them. As she puts it...

  "I don't know if anybody else who fought the Dark Lord did so by means of hanging about in a bar. Possibly the Order might have had more recruits if that was all that was wanted. "

I figured the real and fake Weasley needed to sing a drinking song as they want to attract as much attention as possible. So I did this for them, heavily inspired by Terry Pratchet's "Hedgehog Song".

#+begin_example
  Bestiality, 'tis said, is a fine thing to do
  But I have to say this as a warning to you:
  With almost all dragons, you can have a ball
  But the Horntail can never be buggered at all.

  If you got the knack, then bugger a Black 
  Though if you're not careful he'll make you a snack,
  The Swedes say a Short-Snout is plenty of fun, 
  But buggering a Horntail just cannot be done.

  You'd best not be seen, doing a Welsh Green
  The spectacle's said to be very obscene
  You can bugger a Fireball, though he's very tall 
  But the Horntail can never be buggered at all.

  If in Norway you choose to bugger a Ridgeback
  The dragon reserve will give you the sack
  In Romania a Longhorn should satisfy
  But a Horntail can never be buggered, don't try.

  At the end of the day, when you've had your rough way
  With all of those dragons, you'll just have to say
  "That lizard from Hungary's been my downfall -"
  For the Horntail can never be buggered at all!   
#+end_example

This is the point Molly Weasley shows up, and things get more complicated.


** Okay, this is great. The syllable count and stress in the first lines of both the third and fourth verse are a bit awkward, but given they're supposed to be drunk and the rest is stellar, you should be dandy. Thanks for the laugh.

** Is this perhaps a song they learned from Charlie?

***** I'm afraid nothing's up yet.

But a brief synopsis.... I'm midway through a series of five, covering the period of Book Four to the year after the Voldemort's downfall. They follow a half-blood Slytherin girl who was in the same year as the Twins (they're the canon characters I use the most) Harry is strictly an unseen character but Ron and Hermione (very) occasionally appear. She likes the Muggle world, happily views herself as half-Muggle and despises the blood-purity nuts, but yet is completely Slytherin in character - cynical, ruthless and ambitious. She thinks Harry is an idiot, dislikes the "Gryffindor arseholes", but crushes big-time on Fred.

Winds up (reluctantly) working for the Order. During the Thickness era, she's on the run from the Ministry. Becomes the only Slytherin aside from Slughorn fighting at the Battle of Hogwarts (involuntarily) and post-war joins the reconstituted Aurors (very unwillingly) .

** This is pretty funny. I wonder if there are any Harry/Hungarian Horntail fics out there.

Voldemort buggered a certain Bitchy Black. Knowing him he probably buggered the entire family, guys and girls.
