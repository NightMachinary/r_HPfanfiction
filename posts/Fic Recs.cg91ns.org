(Hello, first time posting on reddit... sorry if this isn't quite right)

I was looking for any recommendations including an abused (by dursleys) Harry. The Dursleys (or Dudley) - realize this is messed up and try to stop or apologize for past behaviour - or something along those lines. . .

Sorry about the wording in this... ik it sounds a bit odd

Dudley helps Harry.

There are also fics where Dudley's child(ren) happen to be magical and he has grown up to be decent and apologizes to Harry. Are you after those too?

*** Thanks, and sure, I'd be open to reading some decent Dudley's kids fics.

I'm sure there are more but my list of fics I have read is not very good for navigation.
