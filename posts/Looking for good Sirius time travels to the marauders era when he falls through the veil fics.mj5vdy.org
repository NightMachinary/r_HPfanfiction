Been looking for a while and only found one really good one (forgot what it's called)

Preferably complete or still being worked on (not discontinued ): )

Preferably not much focus on the golden trio and focusing more on the marauders and Sirius being depressed and freaking out cuz he was in Azkaban for 12 years and is now seeing his best friends again who are none the wiser to his plight (also angst plz?).

Ya'know

Self-promotion welcome ðŸ˜Š

Thanks


** I would be interested in something along these lines as well. Sorry for no fanfic.

** If you're okay with NSFW Wolfstar, this one is a classic:
