I think it's with Daphne. I remember that Ginny cheats on Harry with Cormac and Harry punches Cormac and gets put on probation with the aurors. He doesn't tell anyone the reason and is slandered in the press. If anyone could help that would be great.


** Linkffn(days to come by chris400ad) fairly positive this is what you're looking for. I really enjoyed what's come out so far.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
