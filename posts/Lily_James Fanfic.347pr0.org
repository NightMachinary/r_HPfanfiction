I'm just looking for some good 'ole Lily James fanfiction where yes they end up with each other. The longer and better written, the better. Looking for some new recommendations.

Thanks!


** Wellllll, technically they aren't together yet, but I feel like somebody has to mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]]. It's very long, so you got that going for you. She hasn't posted in a really obnoxious amount of time (year and a half), but as far as I can tell from following the author's Tumblr, it's not "abandoned".

*** Technically they do get together in chapter 37, just not for very long.

**** I meant in the sense of being in a relationship. SOMETHING happened in chapter 37, but they aren't fully together yet at the moment. It's a horrible place to leave a fanfiction. It's very unsatisfying.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anotherdreamer/PTD00a.html][Prelude to Destiny]] is probably my favorite. I just reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4330083/1/Penmanship-Smitten][Penmanship Smitten]] and that's pretty fun. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4756204/1/Disillusionment][Disillusionment]] is crack, but it's very fun crack.

** I really liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/][You Want To Make A Memory]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/][Promises Unbroken]] which is a brilliant trilogy.
