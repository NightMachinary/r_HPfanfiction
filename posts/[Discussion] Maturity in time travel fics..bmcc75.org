I've recently started reading and enjoying time travel fics. But for some reason so many stories of an older Harry traveling back ends up with him becoming a moody little wanker...

I don't wanna see an experienced, maybe even war veteran, Harry suddenly "seething" or "seeing red" over the slight injustice of point deduction in potions class. What's the point of time travel if his mental reverts back to a teenager (this goes for adult self inserts aswell btw)

Anyone else have similar experiences?


** What typically bothers me more is when the butterfly effect isn't managed properly. I recall a particularly egregious example where, despite massive changes, Harry still thought it was necessary for Wormtail to escape so that Voldemort could be reborn and defeated.

Which stories do you think are done well?

*** I like to think of it kind of like the Doctor Who angle on time travel. Time is malleable, but not entirely changeable. There are a series of set events that will happen no matter what you do, while anything else can be modified. And if you try and change one of those set points, the universe just makes it happen using a different method.

**** I'm actually fine with the universe conspiring to restore the original timeline. That shows creativity and has potential to thicken the plot.

But in the case I referred to, Harry /deliberately/ freed Wormtail from prison because he thought that the original sequence of events needed to happen, nevermind that everything was totally different by then.

**** Now I want to read a fic where Harry eventually noticed the degradation caused by the "time travel" where his neurons slowly burns out bit by bit due to huge amount of increased activity... Eventually slowly going crazy so he tries to circumvent it but its just his brain finally adapting.

The problem is the damage have been done and we now have someone who was one a bright you man becoming crazy around sixth year looking for a way to save his life, thus immortality while a dark lord is on the loose creating havoc in the background. Slowly but surely his attempts to keep himself alive works but his mind in tatters. A new Dark Lord hell bent on punishing everything that is deemed Dark and Evil like a Purifying flame that sweeps through the wizarding world.

History Repeats itself as well as bad things happen to wizard who messed with time. Time punishes Heroes who think they can circumvent time to change what was once was. He was not the only one. December is the seventh and last of seven months to have a length of 31 days, Tom Riddle is born as the seventh month dies. In the original timeline, He was once a chosen one meant to kill a dark lord. The one meant to bring forth acknowledgement that muggles are a danger since Dark Lord Grindelwald triggered a nuclear winter. But Time is not to be trifled with and will make do, those who wished to create paradoxes will be dealt with. When Grindelwald was dealt with Tom never forgot what muggles did. Just like how Harry will never forget what Purebloods and the Dark did.

History repeats itself and bad things happen to wizards who mess with time.

**** Here's a quick way to get a early elementary child character:

Make that child a savant about everything related to one thing a kid might be interested in, be it model rockets, star wars, ponies, giraffes, or dinosaurs, and let them know everything you can find in your research.

Then make them complete dunces at most every other topic, and have them do their best to work their favorite topic back into the conversation.

Bam. Instant child.

** If they bothered to at least handwave it, I would be okay. Something like, despite knowing better, the constant hormonal changes in his brain make it very difficult for him to focus and retain his mature mind. He brings knowledge, but the maturity is buried.

Ninja edit: What bothers me way more is the stories that have mental time travel but don't acknowledge how fucking creepy it is for a 20+ year old adult male to hang out with and eventually date children aged 11-16.

We have a word to describe somebody with the mental age of an adult (especially a 20+ year old) establishing a relationship with somebody who's mentally an adolescent. We call that grooming.

Yes, but what we /don't/ have is any kind of established set of rules for what constitutes acceptable non-creepy behavior for someone who has literally sent their mind back decades. If they attempted, while still physically a teenager, to date someone of their own mental age, then the law as it stands would prosecute their /partner/. What would you consider to actually be ethical dating in this scenario?

Of course, there's always the fallback of "wait until you're physically 18 and mentally 40", but even then, how many people would be OK with them dating a 40-year-old? How many people who knew their mental age would be OK with them dating an 18-year-old? It would be legal, yet it would still cop a lot of flak, no matter which route they took. And is it really fair to make them wait that long, when you have already made it clear that for dating purposes, you think they should be treated as an adult?

And what about cases where the time traveller doesn't simply replace their younger self, but merges with them in some fashion, so their memories of childhood are doubled up and fresh? What is their true age then? What can or should they do about it?

What about scenarios like Nightmares of Futures Past where the time traveller is undercover, and thus has interacted with his peers - including his prior girlfriend - and built up friendships with them in hopes of preparing them better for the coming war and thus /saving their lives/ from what he knows will otherwise kill them? Is that, then, "grooming"? What would be ethical?

Judging from comments I've seen on this sub, "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" is another fic that delves into the idea of grooming, though not to such a depraved degree.

** I really fucking hate the “preserve the timeline” thing. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Anyone who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head.

There's no need to let Moody suffer even a single moment.

There's no need to let Voldemort gain a body.

They know where Voldemort is hiding during the TWT. They know Voldemort is still very weak in that homunculus body. A raid led by Dumbledore will see both Voldemort and Wormtail captured, and Nagini destroyed.

Then they would be able to:

- Force Voldemort to spill all his secrets, his Horcruxes, his minions, his resources, his plans, and just about anything.
- Obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy. Even if he should escape in wraith form, he would wander the mortal plane as a confused and harmless spirit until the eternity!
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.
- Exonerate Sirius by putting Wormtail on trial.
- Arrest every Voldemort minion that are still free, beginning with Lucius Malfoy.
- Begin Horcrux Hunt and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- If the above is successful, execute Voldemort.

** It's also a bit tiresome when every little thing triggers flashbacks for him, particular negative ones that put him into a panic attack or cause him to lash out and draw attention. I get it, things had to be bad in the future for him to end up in the past. But when he starts crying every time he sees Hedwig, has long and drawn-out nightmares every night of each named character in the series dying gruesomely to betrayal, instinctively tries to curse Ron the moment he sees him for becoming a future Death Eater, or enters the Great Hall and relives the Battle of Hogwarts and nearly kills the first person to tap his shoulder...

I'm not here to read about a Harry who's so broken from his experiences he has trouble staying anchored in current times. Or if he was, he should start getting better now since he's in a safer time and making positive changes. I want to read about him making use of a second chance and trying to fix things.

**** I like that one, but it's also the ancestor of a lot of modern fanfics. I can give it a pass on things everyone does because it did some of them first. And Harry does become less of a mess over time, which is nice.

A main character that can't progress the plot because they're too broken to cope with their environment is a slog. If Harry keeps tearing up every time he spots Cedric, people are going to get some strange ideas about him. And if the author keeps stopping to write flashbacks of some brutal death every time Harry runs into them or sees a tapestry or something, the story isn't going to actually progress very much.

** I think that more than what is right or not, tha author needs to decide a course and acknowledge it. Let them be mature but thus unable to connect to those physically their own age, whose differences might be played up for contrasts sake. Have them regress and be afraid when they notice it. Have them be naturally be regressed but not have all the skills and knowledge at 100% available, exactly because they mentally regressed and can't handle that.

** My headcanon for age reversal like in Peggy Sue is that the person truly does regress in maturity, but keeps his memories. Basically, similar to one getting a vision of the rest of their life.

I have nothing against fics portraying it this way as a result, nor with any age "discrepancy" in dating/etc.

** This isn't HP, but for a really interesting exploration of mixed-up age and maturity levels, you might enjoy linkffn(Shinobi: The RPG).

It's a gamer fic, with an adult being reincarnated into the Naruto world, with his memories intact and a Fallout 3 interface - except that the world doesn't work like a game for anyone else. There's no "guy at the mission desk just repeats the same words every time you talk to him until you accept the quest"; no, he's dealing with real (well, story-real) people, who care about him and work with him and get angry with him and are sometimes frankly terrified of him. Teammates who get upset if he time-skips an hour while sitting next to them, supervisors who worry about his mental health if he runs off to kill monsters and farm EXP, teenage girls who can't understand why an apparent 13-year-old (and one with the matching hormones) is reluctant to date them. And he dumped Charisma to give himself more Intelligence and Luck. Oops.
