:END:
This story got deleted off F[[https://fanfiction.net/][anfiction.net]] a few years ago but i havent been able to stop thinking about it nor find it. If i remember correctly it's about Harry being adopted by the kaiser of the German magical empire which survived the ww1. Making him the Crown prince. That fanficiton had the word Kaiser in the title, it was rated T or M. But unfortunately i dont remember much else. Big thank you if any of you manage to find a copy of the story and link it to me.


** I went through all the fanfiction I have saved over time and searched for the word "Kaiser" in a title. I only found two, but they didn't match your summary at all (I read them, both were short). Do you by any chance remember something else? Are you sure the word appears in the title?

*** I am 99% sure the word Kaiser as in the title, and unfortunately i dont remember that much. Tho i do think Harry wasn't adopted as a child but around when he was a teenager, and that there was no blood relation and that the kaiser only made him his heir because Harry was famous due to being the BWL so he would be a popular heir. Since the kaiser's son died during WW1. (I think)

** Is this the one were Harrys grandfather from Lillys side or something was the Kiaser and Lilly was like his long lost niece or something as his brother disappeared and was Lillys father/ grandfather and after finding out about it he found out she died with James and then he took Harry in ehen he was able to track him down (Vaguely remember so not sure which it was)

If so I remember it but don't know where it is.

*** I dont think so, but i might be remembering it wrong. I'm pretty sure there was no blood relation and that he only adopted Harry because his own son died around WW1 and Harry is the BWL so he would be popular.
