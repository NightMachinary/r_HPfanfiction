Looking for a HP fic that has Harry exploring the world with either no goal or just a goal that is the endgame but Harry just goes with the flow and enjoys himself. Anything similar to stuff like One Piece or Hunter x Hunter.

"Make A Wish" by Rorschach's Blot.

One of my all time fav's. It's mainly a bit of a comedy but there are some serious bits that tug at the heartstrings.

*** Terminal Justice with the Justice League is a continuation of Make A Wish and well worth the read. Not sure who the author is though. Only read it once.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
