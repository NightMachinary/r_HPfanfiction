It was an SS/HG fic on FFN. They were working together on wolfsbane. I think it took place after the war and Hermione was still at Hogwarts. I believe Remus had a club or something of werewolves and there were kids, too. She became an animagus to help the werewolves when they transform.

Thanks in advance


** Problem of purity?

** It could be The Problem With Purity by Phoenix.Writing as [[/u/glylittleduckling][u/glylittleduckling]] suggested.

Another possibility could be Care of Magical Creatures by Arsenic - I think this was hosted on The Petulant Poetess, which seems to be gone, but you might be able to find it on another archive. It was SS/HG/RL, postwar, and Hermione started another school/community for werewolves with Remus Lupin and some other adult werewolves. (There is another story with the same title that is completely unrelated and is SS/HG.)
