All I remember was that Harry was expelled from Hogwarts with the Dementor fiasco thing and stayed at Grimmuald Place with Sirius.

Lunas dad died so she stayed with them at Grimmuald place and so felt lonely so she started to paint her room.

Please help me find it!!


** No idea which fic you are talking about, but I do know some good Harry/Luna fics.

  I had an idea to take Harry into a new future, one I hadnt tried before, anyway this story is how after a rather traumatic event in his young life he got to be more than just a wizard. H/Hr again.
