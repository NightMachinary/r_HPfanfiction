Yeah, yeah, the Firebird goblins are pretty fucked up, but think about this. A known, previously hostile race of sentients with a griphold on the wizarding economy? There's so much room to work with here!

Lehman Brothers goblins, Nazi goblins, Scrooge goblins, etc. etc.

Oh and by worst, I mean evil or incompetent. If it's the latter, them goblins better be fucking useless as fuck.


** My own personal headcanon, which everyone is welcome to use if they like it: Goblins prefer to live deep down beneath the earth. At the surface they're prey to altitude sickness, psychological and emotional disorders (phobias especially) and at the very least homesickness for the tunnels and caverns below.

As a result, Gringotts is Goblin Siberia: a hardship posting for the guards and a penal colony for the bank staff. They don't care about escapees, like Gnarlak or Griphook, because as long as the miscreant is gone from goblin society, they don't care what mischief they get up to - or misfortune they may encounter, as with Griphook - in the howling wasteland of bizarre extremes of temperature that is the surface world.

It also explains the bad name goblins have: the only ones humans ever interact with are their criminals and dissidents.

*** That's actually really cool, especially the altitude sickness bit. Nice!

**** The altitude thing is also my theory for why Mountain Trolls come off as so stupid and smelly. They're adapted to being at 10,000ft or more: bring them down into the lowlands - Scotland's highest point is 4,400ft - and they're suffering from oxygen toxicity and sweating buckets. Meet one in his natural habitat and he's a lot smarter and you won't smell him coming...

***** That reminds me of the trolls in the Discworld books. Simply put, they're acclimated to very cold conditions and when they're out of their home environment, they overheat their brains and become quite stupid. There's a troll on the city watch that wears a helmet with a fan that keeps his head cool and allows his natural intelligence to come through.

****** Temperature alone wouldn't work for HPverse trolls, though, since they're not described as living rocks like Sgt. Detritus. Atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen, however, affects anything that breathes. At 10,000ft it's 70% of sea level, enough that prolonged exposure to nearly half as much again would result in oxygen toxicity (that level in humans is safe for short periods only): symptoms include disorientation and impaired cognitive function. As well as damage to the eyesight, which would leave the poor troll blundering about, reinforcing the stereotype of stupidity to the uninformed observer.

Source: not a diver, but related to enough of the lunatics that I've picked up knowledge by osmosis.

******* I was reading over Detritus's wiki page and I'd forgotten that their brains were made out of imperfect silicon--a poke at computer processors and the cooling they need, I'm sure.

The oxygen toxicity reminds me of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight books--"airsick lowlander" is a frequent insult.

*** Hmmm. I'd wonder how they react to sunlight. Would it be like the Drow of Faerun, who have to spend time acclimating to working in the sun?

**** One suspects that in a magical context, PPE for working in disagreeable environments is less obtrusive and nowhere near as much of a pain in the arse to use as compared to the nonmagical stuff.

** The goblins in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] are not nice at all, including timing their rebellions with ruthless efficiency.

The goblins in Harry Crow are also terrible, but in a very different way.

**** I know, it's one of my favourite fanfics and the whole goblin conflict is one of my favourite parts. After so many 'helpful' goblins it was very refreshing to have them so antagonistic.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
