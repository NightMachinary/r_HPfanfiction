Hi sorry to be a pain, I was reading a next gen hp fan fic where four children born after the war go to hogwarts and the sorting hat refuses to do any more sorting until the houses all become friends. The fic follows Pansy Parkinson's daughter, cedric's brother, cho Chang's brother and teddy lupin... any links would be great!

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
