A trio rise up against an unchecked, violent Master of Death "Lord" Potter and his wives, an overzealous, dictatorial Minister Granger, or whatever other fanfiction cliche you can think of.


** Auror Task Force safehouse. 2018.

The international wizarding community should have seen it coming. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, installing a shadow government ruled by Minister for Magic Hermione Granger. While the new Ministry appeared normal at first glance, people knew any form of rebellion against Potter's regime would result in swift action taken against them. At first the wizarding world ignored it. It wasn't up to them to deal with a fractured nation after the fall of Voldemort. Harry's radical changes to the British Ministry was largely seen as a progressive move that would move them past the pureblood supremacy act. It was when prominent purebloods started disappearing from other nations that people started to become uneasy. British purebloods affiliated with Voldemort was one thing. Targeting others simply based on blood status was no different than what Voldemort tried to achieve. In response to Harry's machinations, several wizarding nations formed a secret task force of Aurors to deal with the situation covertly.

"Are you sure this is the right course of action?" asked Azarov.

The American nodded in response. "I'm afraid it is. The British Ministry is essentially sanctioning assassinations on wealthy purebloods in other nations."

Azarov sighed. "Never thought Potter would become the next Dark Lord we would have to deal with."

"Given his upbringing and what he had to go through during his time in Hogwarts, I can't say I'm surprised. He was essentially forced to martyr himself for the greater good."

"I should've seen it coming," sighed Azarov. "I trained him after the fall of Voldemort to help the British Ministry and Aurors recover post-war. The warning signs were there."

The American shrugged. "He's charismatic and believes he's doing the right thing. Every psychopath in magical or Muggle history believes that their cause is just."

"You sure this plan of yours is going to work?" asked Azarov. "It seems a little too.... I don't know, obvious?"

"I do, thanks to your knowledge of how he thinks. We'll create a legend of another resistance, spearheaded by another trio. Potter won't take it lightly that he's being challenged in Britain. He's become the Dark Lord he killed back in '97."

Azarov gave his American counterpart a skeptical look. "I still don't see how this is a valid strategy."

"Well, Potter still has some humanity. He still desperately craves the need for a father figure. He has friends of course, but not someone that he can confide in. According to you he grew attached to Sirius Black for the reason of being his father's best friend. Perhaps creating a legend of a distant relative would be a good idea as bait to draw Potter out. He still could want validation that what he's doing is the right thing."

"Sounds like it's worth a shot," said Azarov. "Antoine, Ramirez and I can take care of Potter's inner circle. We'll need to find someone who can pose as this relative as bait then. Who do you have in mind? We're stretched thin as it is, and you're handling Weasley already."

"I know just the person to handle it."

"You're confident this person can pull it off?" asked Azarov. "We can't afford any mistakes here."

The American went silent. He was confident that he could hold his own against Potter. While he operates under a series of aliases, the American was a descendant of the original twelve Aurors in MACUSA and as such, he was no slouch in magical combat. And as the descendant of Abraham Potter, he knew he wouldn't even have to lie to get Harry to take the bait

"Trust me," said David Potter. "It'll go off without any complications."

*** Lord Potter Headmaster of Hogwarts smiled after giving his protege's a quest. Yeah, at least they'll be out the castle where the paperwork wasn't his problem. First holiday in a while...

Dictator minister Granger sighed as she "went into hiding" as she hopped on a plane to Majorca.\\
Head Auror Ronald Weasley sighed as he "went into the field to ensure the safety of the Minister".

Dear God but why! Why did it take spending five years creating a national crisis for her husband to take a vacation for two weeks with his two best friends? (The fact that all three held the three most powerful positions in the British government not withstanding). Luna Lovegood gave Susan Bones, Penelope Clearwater and a de-aged aMcGonagalls they made their way to the lavatory. Their Husband didn't have much time for them lately, and although that would soon be remediedthey had never had sex on a muggle plane.

Luna giggled.

** Lord Harold Potter-Black was sitting at the Head Table, watching this year's sorting. He had reluctantly taken up the Defence Against the Dark Arts position at Hogwarts, due to pressure from his wives who loved him dearly but were borderline emotionally abusive. Not that he would mind, since he was beaten with a tire iron daily for the first eleven years of his life until, on his eleventh birthday, he was saved by Merlin, Morgana, the entire goblin nation, every single girl in his Hogwarts year and above, a veela and Draco Malfoy. After he had defeated Lord Voldemort with the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not, which involved him sueing the everliving shit out of Dumbledore then killing Voldemort with an /Expelliarmus/ because he was a deep, emotional guy who couldn't live with himself if he knowningly took a life, despite going ahead and pretty much leaving every single suspected dark wizard homeless and starving afterwards. Hell, he needed intense therapy and lots of sex with his twenty-six wives to get over it as it was.

Ah, but this year, one of his many daughters was starting Hogwarts! He had already spotted her in the crowd of first years, chatting happily with a pale haired girl and Draco's son!

"POTTER, HAYLEY!" Hermione, who had become the Muggle Studies professor/deputy headmistress despite it being an absolute waste of her brilliant mind called out.

Hayley bounced up and sat down on the stool, Hermione put the hat on her...

"SLYTHERIN!"

/No... It couldn't be.../ His daughter, HIS daughter, in Slytherin! He must calm himself, not become another Walburga Black... Oh, can this day get any worse?

"RIDDLE, DELPHINI!"

...and that was the girl Hayley was talking with. WAIT, TOM HAD A DAUGHTER?!

And as he watched the daughter of his nemesis get sorted into Slytherin, as the girl went to sit down next to /his/ daughter, she shot him a glare that made it clear that she was aware that her mother was part of Harry's harem.

--------------

That's sadly all the time I have to write, but a trio of Delphini Riddle, Hayley(or whatever name, I just don't really like the epilogue children) Potter and Scorpius Malfoy going through a canon-like adventure in a dystopic world ruled by an independant!Harry would be pretty amazing to read.
