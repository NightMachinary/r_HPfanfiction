Hey all, I'm looking for good quality alternative trio fics, e.g. Harry/Neville/Hermione, Harry/Draco/Hermione. I prefer stories starting in Year 1, but more importantly, are complete, long, and good quality.

Thanks in advance!


** Are you just looking for fics that replace Ron or are you open to others as well?

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom isn't finished, but it fulfills the rest of your criteria, including having Draco replace Ron in the golden trio.
