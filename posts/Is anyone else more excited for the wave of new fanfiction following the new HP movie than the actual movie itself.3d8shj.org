Don't get me wrong, I'm pumped for the movie. But the fandom seems to be declining, compared to how it was back before the series ended. I think that this movie, considering it takes place in a different time and place, will spark a lot of interesting new fanfiction. Thoughts?


** It should be interesting to get a new, adult protagonist. Harry is a good character to write, but sometimes the limits of his character can constrain you.

That said, Newt is going to have to do a lot to become Harry's equal.

I do wonder what tone the film is going to take, given that its main character is an adult, and given that there are now far more adult HP fans than kids. Will they shift the tone to something more mature to age along with the main body of fans? Or keep the "children's fiction" tone to try to win over a new generation of kids?

Of course I don't expect Game of Thrones sex, violence and rock and roll, but some increased maturity would be interesting.

I think a little of both, but i'm erring towards attracting a newer generation. There are going to be school age characters in it and it probably makes more sense to attract new viewers as existing fans will go and see it regardless of what age it's aimed at.

**** The character Newt himself feels a fairly lighthearted. I think you've got it right, in that it will be a mix. Certainly there will be action, probably some death, but it won't be gritty. Unfortunately none of these will probably make an appearance: stark portrayals of most wizards' disdain for muggle life, magical fighting in WWI, taxidermy of Galapagos Pixies or rendering grindlows to their constituent parts for potions ingredients.

I think the HP book series probably has a lot of new-ish fans who will be excited for the movie Series like LOTR, Redwall, Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, etc stay popular. With how many copies of her books JRK has sold (around 500 million I think) I don't think it is in danger of losing popularity. The old farts (25-35 yr olds) who grew up going to midnight showings will be introducing their kids to the boooks too.

****** Agreed. Overall I think the new movie will be good for fanfiction. It will just be more wood for the fire.

Ever read the oneshot /Mandragora/?

*** She has gone darker in her other books, and Deathly Hallows went there too, so I would imagine a darker tone. But probably tamer than GoT because of the theme park tie-ins and things. I'm thinking a Marvel movie level of violence. Happy adults, happy kids.

**** It's a prequel so doesn't do much in the long run. It will give more back story and bring in more $ for an eventual(?) continuation of the main series. I suppose this could be one big litmus test for JKR to see if there is enough interest in writing more.

Would JKR greenlight movies taking place after HP & the Deathly Hallows without writing it in book form first? Maybe in 50 years when JKR is gone Disney will buy up the rights and have Brian Sanderson Jr. produce a new HP series.

******* “Although it will be set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world,” said Rowling, in a statement. “The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but Newt's story will start in New York, 70 years before Harry's gets underway.”

** It will definitely hurt/help fanfiction. One negative being what *StudentOfMrKleks* mentioned in this thread: the world building of some fanfics will clash with the newly revealed canon. The historical, political and geographical background of stories like Alexandra Quick or Bungle in the Jungle could be made non-canon compliant. Not a big deal, we'll still love those stories and there could be a new tag like AU denoting it a fanfic is disregarding the new film.

The film with give new characters and material to work with and more structure to the world. It will also give us new plot holes to fill and cliches to create/hate. It will most importantly give us new canon to distort, mangle, parody and throw-through-apparently-abundant-time-portals. Someone will make Newt will spend time pranking famous muggle botanists or something. One of Luna's NextGen, L-themed sprogs will travel back in time to save/destroy/accidentally-marry their great granddad Newt.

Or the gritty end of life view: It is 1996 Newt is old, will be dead soon, and reflects on his life. He sees the his world's careless destruction of magical species. His books led potion suppliers to untouched areas where they drove the wildlife to extinction. He helped create the Werewolf Registry in the 1940's with good intentions, but now he sees it being used to persecute and hunt down Lycanthropes (maybe a close friend is 'disappeared' by the ministry). The ministry warns him to be quite and play the part of a cultural icon. With the clarity of age he sees the oppression of sentient magical species that he did not do enough to change.

*** Totally agree. For the story that I'm currently working on, that new weird London play might just wreck it...but I've put a time stamp on it so people will know that it was written before the play/FBaWtFT. It's a little hard to find the motivation to write when I know it probably won't be 100% canon (I'm one of those weirdos who can only write canon), but I'm working hard.

It's very bittersweet. The child in me is excited beyond belief and the adult is a little angry that I'll have to change the worlds I've been living in for so long.

** That's a good point that honestly hadn't occured to me. I think because, while the fandom has declined, it's still going fairly strong with stories been updated/begun everyday.

But yes, it will be good for the fandom as it will bring more people to it and there will also be lots of new plot points for inspiration and a new time setting.

** Not more excited, but yeah, def very excited for a new surge in the fandom and fanfiction. I've read some luna/rolf fanfic that was pretty nice, so more scamander stuff would be neat!

But yeah on the other hand, what has already been mentioned.. some of the rivalry between the scamanders and lovegoods might not even exist and the scamanders could be very different. It'll be interesting, to say the least. And it depends a bit on how the movie actually is as well.
