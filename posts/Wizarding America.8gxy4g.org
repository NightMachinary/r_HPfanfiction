** American magical society:

- Only rich kids can afford a higher magical education. There's a lower caste of wizards who have to leave school early and do multiple menial day jobs for the rest of their life, dreaming of a better future by working hard.

- Black Wizards are frowned upon and segregated. American Wizards are wary of muggles and the civil rights movement never leaked over. Occasional lynchings and other racially motivated outbursts of violence are downplayed by the media.

- The school nurse is only available to students who can afford a prohibitively expensive privatized health care plan

- American Wizards are obsessed with blasting and maiming curses. It's not unusual for parents to proudly teach their child their first lethal curse at a very young age, while also insisting on proper "wand safety". Wizarding School shootings are a somewhat regular occurrence.

- Sexual education is frowned upon and schools teach an "abstinence only" mentality. Lots of witches drop out of school early, because of teenage pregnancies. Child marriage is the culturally approved solution to this issue.

- The traditional family is idolized. In general Wizards are expected to be the breadwinners and Witches have mandatory school courses about homemaking, home economics, cooking, nursing, etc.

*** I would actually quite like to have a story which did this ... I admit I'm prejudice, but I find the America-is-a-magical-paradise trope incredibly irritating.

** It sounds very unappealing, but you don't seem to understand that Rowling created a fantasy school of magic set completely outside the real world. You seem to be labouring under the---frankly bizarre---misapprehension that the world of Harry Potter is somehow an accurate and realistic representation of real life in the United Kingdom.

** He opens several such threads every day, just to laugh at the answers. After a few hours, the thread is deleted again and he opens a new one.\\
It's not worth your time to give meaningful answers here.

** All of the changes you're suggesting sound far less interesting that what JK gave us.

*** Rowling's world building is lacking either way. Just look at how little she said about mainland Europe. The statute of Secrecy went into effect when Europe was a very different place. Prussia, the HRE and the Ottomans were still around, a lot of other countries like Belgium, Finland, Bulgaria were not. This results in a myriad of unanswered questions regarding administration, nationalities, education and so on.

** I think you're wrong about the educational system. I'm pretty sure the UK has a better educational system than the US.

Also, why no robes? We do have schools that require a uniform. In fact I'd say most of the schools in the US have a uniform or some sort of similar dress code regardless of it's a public school or a private one

I doubt American schools would be teaching children how to practice the dark arts, but I'm sure there would be a huge emphasis on Defense Against the Dark Arts (since our gun laws are so lax)

About the contact with muggles, I /highly/ doubt it would be any better than the magical vs muggle relations in the UK. The US has a history of having backlash against people who are deemed different/unholy/unnatural, such as gay people, minorities, the victims of the Salem witch trials, trans people, etc. If anything, I think the relationship between muggles and wizards would be worse

Also, technology and magic really do not mix. Magic tends to make technology very glitchy and buggy. However, magic powered devices do sound cool

** My thoughts are that I would have never picked Harry Potter up if it was this.

What are your reasonings about why it would be that way? you're making it sound like English wizarding world is just a shit hole. The American school system isn't exactly fantastic so why would you think wizarding America be so much better than the wizarding England?
