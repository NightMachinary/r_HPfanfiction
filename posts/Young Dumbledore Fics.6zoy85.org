Looking for good stories about a young Dumbledore (maybe up until 1945.) I don't mind if they involve Grindelwald/ his family etc. Just so long as they're good quality.

Thanks!


** /The One He Feared/ by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] is a classic, but it's on hiatus? idk hasn't been updated in a long time

*** He's made it clear it's very unlikely to be continued due to how he ended the first act (all that is written). It reads well enough as a standalone piece that it's acceptable to leave as is.

Not that I wouldn't like to read more, but I can see where he's coming from, he rather wrote himself into a hole I think.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

He acts a lot younger in this one! Features a time traveling Harry that's trying to kill a young Tom Riddle who Dumbledore now has to protect.

  Young Albus Dumbledore, in desperate need of a proper friend, devises a spell to bring powerful wizards to him---only, he just might have been a tad overzealous. Result: the temporal displacement of Harry Potter and Tom Riddle to the year 1912.
