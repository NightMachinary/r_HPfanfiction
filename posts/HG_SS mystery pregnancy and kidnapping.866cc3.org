** Lots of similarities (but not exact) with Ramos's Hinge of Fate. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/1/Hinge_of_Fate]]

Also possibly Dyce's Accountable: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3245929/1/Accountable]]

And if neither, there are a whole bunch of possibilities listed here: [[https://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/140591.html]]

Thank you, though. Most of those are pretty good stories.
