:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In it James and Lily had survived, but they thought that Harry had died, I do not really remember why they thought that. Because of the fact that they thought he had died they moved to America and had anther kid.

When it comes time for that kid to go to school, they go to Diagon alley and they run into Harry.

That is all I remember.

I know that I read it on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

If you know what fic I am talking about I would really appreciate it if you would give me a link in the comments.


** That kind of happened in a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha/, called /Reinforced Magic/

** The only story I know of that had James and Lily surviving and going to America without Harry has been removed. I don't think it's likely to be the one you're looking for, because I think Harry was married in it. It was called The Meaning of Betrayal, and it was by Aileen8703.

There is one that sounds similar to the other elements you describe, but I'm pretty sure they don't go to America. They wake up outside the cottage without memories and live as muggles until their memories start coming back when their daughter receives her Hogwarts letter. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10427729/1/Blank-Slate][Blank Slate]].
