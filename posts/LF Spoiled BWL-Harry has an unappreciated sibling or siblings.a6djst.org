So, basically:

I am looking for a reversal of all those WBWL-Stories! So Harry is the BWL, his parents (or one of them!) survived, he grew up magical and spoiled through no fault of his own and he has a sibling (or siblings) who (justifiably) resent him (or their parents/surviving parent) because it's always about Harry and seldom about him/her/them!

Does something like this exist? I've only always found the reverse (Harry is the brother of the BWL who resents his brother because he gets treated badly (or ok, but doesn't receive a lot of attention and love))

So, the stage is yours!

As always: Please no slash and only very well written Harry/Ginny


** I don't know any such fics, but I know how to acquire one:

1. Swing a dead cat to locate a WBWL fic.
2. Download said fic using any of the many available mechanisms.
3. Load up the fic in a text editor or word processor of your choice.
4. Run a global search-and-replace, replacing name of the WBWL with a placeholder, like "Asdfg".
5. Run a global search-and-replace, replacing name "Harry" with the original name of the WBWL.
6. Run a global search-and-replace, replacing the placeholder (like "Asdfg") with "Harry".
7. Save the file, and enjoy.

This technique should work well, because neither Harry nor the WBWL in vast majority of WBWL fics have a recognisable or even distinct personality, and the authors don't generally think very hard about who would adopt whom under which circumstances.

The reason for the placeholder in steps 4-5 is that if you don't use it, you'll end up with "Harry" as the name for both the BWL and the WBWL. This, while it won't significantly reduce the quality of the fic, will make it a tad confusing to read.

** I'm just commenting to add: if this premise does exist but it is slash, I'll happily take those recs anybody might have.
