:END:
Okay, so a while back I came across this Fanfiction and now I can't remember the name, but want to read it.\\
points in the FF that I remember:\\
Dobby got himself dismissed from the Malfoy's before Harry was placed on the door step of Number 4\\
Dobby switched Harry and Draco on the doorstep, altering Draco's appearance to make him look like Harry.\\
Dobby raised Harry, and Harry never went to Hogwarts.\\
Harry was a powerful wizard under an alias.\\
It was a Hinny and it takes place slightly after Ginny would graduate from Hogwarts.\\
Harry had a calling card, to which Fred and George use, as they want him to track down Percy, who is looking for clues about the Deathly Hallows, if I recall correctly.\\
Ginny works as a broom tester and that is where Harry and her meet, outside of his alias.\\
If any of this rings a bell and you know the name, which I think starts with a "T" let me know please!
