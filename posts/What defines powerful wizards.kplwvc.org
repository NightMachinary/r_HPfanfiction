I want to understand how powerful wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald stand out from the rest of wizardkind.

Is it their skill in casting spells more efficiently than others? Is it their vast knowledge of spells? Or is it their magical power(like their stunners would have a much larger effect than a normal wizard's)? Or Is it all of them?

I refuse to believe that all wizards have same amount of magical power when they are born and become powerful by practice. It is true that some people are born with a good brain or with a good memory similarly it must be wizards like them must be born with special amount of power. I am not saying that it is the only factor. But I believe that being born with more magical power than the rest of the society doubled with a sharp mind added to years of practice and developing skills is what makes wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald stand out.

Please share your views regarding this.


** Personally, I believe it's all of the above. Knowledge is Power, after all. If you learned shortcuts that cut half the time out of doing a task versus someone who took the full time, you'd certainly be at a higher standing if the end products were the same. Tack on if the end product of yours was more powerful than the others, that would be even more bonus points. And then being able to do things not many other people could? That's just icing on the cake.

Sure, pure magical power or pure shortcuts could work, but combine everything together and you'd be pratically unstoppable. And that's not even taking into account their actual followers/supporters and political standings.

** I don't believe there's anything in the text that says wizards aren't born with equal magical power, unless you have a genetic defect from inbreeding, which the Gaunts seemed to imply. There might be exceptions, like maybe if you're born a metamorphagus or a parseltongue, then you have an extra advantage than other wizards have. Harry has his mother's love sacrifice that protects him, so there are enchantments and traits that give an edge in survival, but power level itself is the same.

I believe it's more along the lines of how talented a wizard is. Talented wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort fine more ways to become more powerful, like the elder wand and horcruxes. You can't just say Dumbledore is only powerful because he was born that way.

*** I want to listen to your opinions frankly because I am confused. What I mean to say is I cannot imagine Neville having the same power as Dumbledore with his own wand at age 17.

**** Neville isn't talented as spellcasting, mainly because he doesn't have much confidence in himself. It's not power, it's knowledge and skill. His skills and expertise lie in herbology.

He also didn't have his own proper wand until after Order of the Phoenix.

The only thing I can think of that can contribute to his power level is my theory about inbreeding in pureblood families.

****** I understand. It wasn't me who downvoted you either. Just think, what's the difference the average students and the wizards like Hermione, Mcgonagall, Flitwick, the Marauders, and Dumbledore? You can say that got to where they are because they have higher power levels, but don't you notice that none of the average students are as knowledgeable about magic or apply themselves as much? Do you think Neville studies as hard or Dumbledore and Hermione did, or has their confidence and ambition?

** Well it really depends on the world that you envision. In your world is a magical just someone who has "magic genes" that allows one to manipulate energy/reality? (I have it as at least two genes as you need to explain squibs. So one gene you're a squib, two genes and you're a witch/wizard and no genes you're a muggle). If that is the case then the "strength" of their magic mostly comes from their knowledge, skills, intent, practice, and wand (how closely it matches you). So your power is due to your practice of magic and the knowledge of spells. As everyone has access to the magic in the world around them.

If in your world a magical is someone who has a magical core/storage then your power is mostly defined by how much magic your body can hold, how much magic you can cast (at one time), and how quickly you replenish the magic inside you. While knowledge, skills, intent, practice, and wand does play a part it is more minor as you could have all of that but if your "core" is very small and takes a lot of time to replenish you won't be anywhere near as powerful as a witch/wizard who has a larger core and less knowledge (eg if you're too tired/magically exhausted a simple reducto will kill you).

Now I'm not sure if this is fanon/canon bleedover but assuming the books had Harry at different points be magically exhausted where he had to rest before he should cast more magic, the world I envision is that there is a magical "core/storage". If it doesn't act like that then how can you become magically exhausted and how does rest fix the problem?

To me that suggests that you store magic somehow and replenish over time and that the amount you store and how fast you replenish it varies between wizards/witches hence identifying who is more powerful from a raw magical power perspective. (Then knowledge, intent etc kicks in to enhance that).

The only other idea IMO is that magic is a muscle that you have to exercise in order to strengthen it. And you become exhausted when you over use it (like muscle fatigue). But that suggests that everyone has the potential same amount of magic when born and then your dedication to strengthen that "magic muscle" determines how powerful you become.

** I think it has a lot to do with sheer force of will and concentration. When Harry is learning the Patronus spell that's what it comes down to- forcing the spell to happen, and concentrating hard on a certain memory. When characters cast magic is a half-assed way, their spell can go wrong because the will to complete the spell wasn't really there, or they were distracted. Rote memorization is also a key factor, as in the case of Hermione, but the drive to make the spell work is key.

** HP is a soft magic system where the rules of magic are not explained ... so if you are writing a fanfic, you can make something up per your convenience.

What I understand a 'powerful wizard' according to cannon is a Wizard who performs powerful magic .. what it means is very vague, is the magic completely theirs? do they use powerful magical items? creatures? own allegiance of other powerful wizards/witches? are their spells strong? knows esoteric knowledge? .. it's not very clearly defined in books.

** Knowledge and finesse.

Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald are all extremely knowlegdeable about ancient and arcane magic, and with such in depth knowledge comes the ability to trim down the time needed to cast and the cost of magic required and suddenly you're able to cast the spell with a drop of magic instead of a ocean's worth.

I imagine ones magical core to be like a muscle, with practice and patience, you can expand it and increase what you can do, combined with increased knowledge and this is where our powerful wizards and witches come from.
