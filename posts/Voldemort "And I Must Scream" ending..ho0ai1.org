Any fics where Voldemort achieves immortality, but instead of the hero's defeating him and killing him through his immortality, Voldemort ends in a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream][And I Must Scream]] situation?

For those not aware, this is basically getting immortality to find yourself stuck in a Body Horror situation, spending an eternity say, fully awake and alive but stuck as a stone statue thus unable to move, speak, etc.

The TV Tropes page has two that fit in this catagory, one was Wind Shear where Voldemort's soul is trapped in a crystal with no senses or movement forever. The other is The TriSchool Tournament, where Harry messed with the resurrection ritual so Voldemort revives as an immortal lump of flesh that could not eat, move, speak,not die. It was then studied by the unspeaksbled for the next three hundred years.

Looking for others that fit this mold.


** I've read one where Harry bargains with Death to grant Voldemort true (relative, I guess) immortality, but move him forward in time to a point where there the sun is dying so there's no life on earth. It's still hundreds of millions of years before the planet (and Voldemort) is destroyed so Voldemort is trapped on a barren earth with no escape and no one to rule over.

This is really the most memorable part of the story so I don't remember the name of it.

** Faery Heroes definitely has this level of nightmare fuel for an ending of 'ole Voldie. Not quite frozen And I Must Scream, but definitely "I must scream and run away for eternity".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]]

Oswald the Ottoman is kind of a crack fic version of that idea.

  In the depths of Aperture Science's Enrichment Center, GLaDOS has devised a way to ensure that no one will be able to corrupt her emotion cores again. By creating a single emotion core that would contain all of those human emotions that the personality spheres embodied. A single human core, melded into her own mainframe and matrices. An independent and yet wholly inseparable part of her. Aperture's greatest experiment to date. Well, except for her, of course. She would need a framework for that core, though. Materials.Where better to start than with the green-eyed infant delivered straight to her door?

  Renamed from 'The Big Box of Silliness', due to complaints that not all the stories were silly. Of course most of them aren't Thrilling either, but you've got to admit, they are Unusual...
