** I always thought it would be funny for Draco to end up with Ginny. Romione is my fav canon pairing and Ginny/Harry is in comparison weak. they were a terrible pairing in the books. their romance was... weird. non existent I would say and with all those conspiracy theories that Ginny used love potion on Harry, well, I actually believe that. he ended with her only because JK wanted him to be a part of the Weasleys.

but if Draco ended up with Ginny... imagine the faces of their fathers. lol. that would be precious.

unless you thought we give our own weird pairings and don't just vote you list, then here are my weird pairings: Neville/Draco, Neville/Snape (some fics with them are really good if they don't include the sex, and are more made platonically, but still with the love love, and not just like(as in a mentor or whatever). however, most of them are really bad, so you would have to find a good one with this pairing. also, if it's actually a good one, it has a 50/50 chance of ending sadly and I don't like sad endings. I like them cause their relationship can be make very melancholic... hence the high amount of sad endings.), Ron/Draco is actually preferred over Drarry to me, but not very fics have them. I like how they always insult each other, while Harry is really just the bullied kid, Ron has a temper, so the fics are also made like that; Harry/Luna, mostly in fics where the romance isn't the main focus; Snupin is also one of my favs, but I think that couple isn't so weird, there's lots of fics with them.; I also like Snarry, if Harry is at least 16 or if it's time travel....
