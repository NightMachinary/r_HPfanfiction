I am looking for a fanfic where the characters are reading a fanfic (thinking it is the future preferably). I would really appreciate help. Thank You!


** Don't know if you have a ship preference, but Soul Searching by Quillusion fits the bill. This features SSHG, wherein Snape has a WIKTT book of short stories that references real fan fics and authors.

** There used to be lots of that type of fics, but nowadays I could only find one: *The Trio and Ginny Read Fanfiction*, linkffn(3679134)

  One fine day at the Burrow, Harry and Ginny relaxing on the couch, and Hermione is reading something on her laptop. 'Hermione, what are you reading,' Ron asks. 'Oh, just a bit of fanfiction...' she says lightly. Therein lies the tale. DH spoilers.
