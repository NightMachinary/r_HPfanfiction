I like these ones as they usually give a slightly better excuse for our protagonist to power up fast.

e: another, as in extra. so two people sharing a body.


** Really short for now, but absolutely amazing is *The Lesser Sadness* by Newcomb, linkffn(10959046). Just read the summary, and you can tell how awesome it is.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** *Roundabout Destiny*, linkffn(8311387): adult Hermione got into the body of James Potter's twin sister. This is not one of my favorite stories because I disagree with author's pureblood worshipping.

*The Evil Overlord List*, linkffn(10972919): young Tom had a voice in his head called Jerry (Harry?), who was supposed to be from the future.

*** I really liked Evil Overlord List, and I see its been updated since I last read it. This is exactly the type of fic I was asking for. Too bad that one isn't finished!

I'll be checking out the other tonight. Thanks!

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
