** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4717594/1/Harry-Potter-Meets-the-BabySitters-Club]] Have to say I was not expecting this when I searched Mrs Figg in the search bar XD Well, it does fit the request? (Note I haven't read too much but so far the grammar and stuff isn't horrid but they're telling a lot more then showing which annoys me generally in fanfics)

** The only one I know of where specifically Mrs Figg intervenes ends up with Snape raising him, so likely not what you're looking for. I could track it down (don't recall title but I have it saved somewhere) but it was kinda tropey.

  Mrs Figg has enough. 7-year-old Harry Potter cannot stay with the Dursleys any more. Severus Snape thinks everyone is better suited to raise the future Saviour of the Wizarding World. Harry dreams of being taken away by a tall man who scares even Dudley.

** this sounds like the most cliched bullshit ever, you probably could find a hundred fics with this exact plot by doing a filter search in ff.net

Now what i would like to read is one where someone (like, for expample, Mrs. Figg) 'rescues' Harry but everything goes to shit because Lily's protection fails because it didn't recharge (as Dumbledore said), they get gaught and he ends up with the Malfoys because the minister thinks harry wont be safe with some muggles and his closest blood relative is Narcisa, so he grows up as a blood supremasist when Voldemort returns he kills him a Voldemort wins

It's why we come to the reddit, dude. For personal recs from like-minded folks. All the sorting in the world and you'll still end up finding shit. Then again, TDR gets rec'd here every other freaking day, but we can't all agree all the time now can we?
