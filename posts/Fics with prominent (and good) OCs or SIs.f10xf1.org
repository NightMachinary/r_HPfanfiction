I recently finished a 1940s era fic abt an OC in Tom's year- and it was fantastic. Not to mention WHNiH recently updated, but I still want more. Does anyone know any other good ones?

Preferably no weasley or dumble bashing, and no crossovers plz


** Obligatory mention of linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff), which has an SI just doing her own thing. Canon? What's that?

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** The Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity is excellent. It's set in the wizarding world we know, but with in the US and in the early 2000 IIRC, so pretty much all characters are OCs. There are four completely posted books, and the author is currently posting the fifth. You can find it on FFnet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity]]

The same author also has a really fun story called Hogwarts Houses Divided, featuring Teddy Lupin and his school friends (obviously all OCs too).

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** This one is good, but if you're not a snape fan you might not like it. OC/SI of a bellatrix/snape daughter that has a depiction of snape not being a monster while still being in character. 2 sequels, so very long. Lots of character development, the OC is really fleshed out and feels real.
