** Sure, plagiarism is bad. However...

#+begin_quote
  I'd personally say that "expanding" or "adopting" someone's fanfic without their permission is stealing their content.
#+end_quote

That's not plagiarism. That's just writing fanfiction of a fanfiction, so the author of the first fic really has no moral high ground. Unless the expanded/adopted version contains text lifted straight out of the first fic, of course. But an "unapproved sequel" is perfectly fine.

** "Every so often there pops up a crowd of people in this subreddit who seem to think that plagiarism is ok."

Give you give some examples ?

*** The big one was the fanfiction orphanage idea: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/isodc3/introducing_rfanfictionorphanage_a_home_for/]]

And then just today there's this guy: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k4riky/fics_worth_continuing/]]

Those are 2 examples of threads about it, I've seen plenty more in the comments of plenty of random threads.

**** This is slightly over the top. The first is possibly the incitement to plagiarism, but the second one just lists unfinished works, nothing worse. I have wrote my sublist as well (yes, and I continue couple of stories mentioned there, always with the permission of the original author, where available).

***** The second one, the OP says in the comments that he wants people to "expand" on the unfinished fics. Even when they're still being actively updated!

** Its cute that you think anyone else other than jk rowling actually owns anything here.

On a more serious note. I think anything other than blatantly copying someone's fic and claiming it as your own is fair game. I mean fanfics, on it own is already “expanding” or “adopting” rowling's intellectual property and to be salty for someone doing the same for a fic is hypocrisy. I do believe a line has to be drawn somewhere but if it's something like me reading a timetravel fic, then thinking i could do better and writing it with my own twists, then there shouldn't be anyone other than rowling with moral highground to call me out on that.

*** Of course fanfic authors don't own their works in the way a published author does. That doesn't mean its ok to act like you can use their work however you want without their permission.

Basically this is okay for JKR only.
