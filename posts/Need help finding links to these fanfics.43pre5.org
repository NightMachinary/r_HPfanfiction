Ok the first one is called Harrys Last Task. I read this probably 10 years ago and at the time it was unfinished. I can't find it anywhere online. It used to show up in Google searches when I would check for updates but one day it stopped showing up. It was on an old fanfic site called Veritaserum.com which is gone now, but I'd seen it on other sites, that's just the site the writer used to update

The other one I don't know the names. It's a 2 book series that starts after OoTP. It involves harry learning how to control the elements, specifically air. It ends with harry fighting Voldermort on the great lake as its frozen over.

I can provide more plot details if need be


** I haven't heard of either fic, but for what it's worth, this might be helpful: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2c66tq/how_to_find_a_fanfiction_if_you_dont_remember_the/]]

*** Thank you, found them. They were "HP and the dangerous choice" and "HP and the elements of Valor"

As for the first one I don't think it's on the net as far as I can tell. Only links I can find goto Veritaserum.com a d that places closed years ago

***** The only links I can find are people commenting on other sites. The actual fanfiction doesn't come up at all on Google.

*** Thanks, couldnt find anything though. The best I have is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/reviews.php?sid=12224&chapid=14738][a mention here]] , [[https://techjourney.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-book-7-fanfiction-edition-download/][also here]]

[[http://z15.invisionfree.com/Silencio/index.php?showtopic=26][but this one actually has a link but is dead]]

actually now i just remembered that you couldnt find it on the fan fic section on Veritaserum, it was in the forums somewhere

found a torrent for it but 0 seeders

EDIT: [[https://archive.org/stream/HarryPotterFakeEbooksUpdateMarch2014/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyFanFiction_djvu.txt][ok I found it]]

that was a bitch to find, its missing 2 more chapters that I know the author added after this, but from what I can tell she never finished it which sucks
