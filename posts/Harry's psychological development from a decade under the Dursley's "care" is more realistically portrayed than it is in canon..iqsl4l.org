Alternative Title: Harry gets replaced by Shinji Ikari's Manga counterpart prior to the arrival of the first of many Hogwarts Acceptance Letters.


** Well, here's my version of what I think a more realistic Harry would be, given his canon treatment and what we see of his personality. I think he would learn to not be so external with his defiance, would internalize a lot of anger, and lack people skills.

Hogwarts was wonderful, Harry thought, like it was out of one of the fantasy novels Dudley had left in his "second" bedroom.

That brought a spike of anger in Harry, the memory of that, of all they put him through, a cupboard while there was an unused bedroom, only the scraps when he himself had to cook.

He /hated/ them, and hated himself for being weak, he had a plan to leave as soon as he was able, he would rather live on the streets that stay like that, he never adapted to what they wanted, being meek, submissive, it just wasn't him, after Vernon tried to beat it into him, he learned to be quiet, but every word he didn't speak, every reaction he stopped, it became anger, an anger so deep it scared him sometimes.

And then he learned he was a Wizard, that his parents had loved him, and that he had /magic/, and that's one of the reasons they hated him so.

It only made him hate them more.

He read about magic, what one could do with it, it was marvelous, it was power, it was /freedom./

/"Magic will set me free."/ He repeated that, it had become his mantra, his hope, but for that to happen, he needed to learn, and Harry had never had the opportunity to actually study properly, his aunt didn't like when he outdid his stupid cousin in school, so Harry purposely did average or bad, while trying to learn what he would need to get a job.

But now, it was a whole new world, and his relatives weren't there.

When he received his wand, it was one of the most freeing and even happy moments he ever had, because it confirmed he was Wizard, that he had magic, and that he wasn't /them./

And now he had money, lots of it by the look of things, his family was old, and apparently he was famous too, really famous, fat lot of good that did him.

But now he could use those things, he saw the news, famous people could open doors that would stay closed for most, and having money helped a lot too.

And Harry would use that. He also bought every book that seemed useful, the bookshop worker was very helpful when he asked him about the best books to learn spells from, and even magical fighting, which was also known as dueling.

Hagrid told him he didn't need all that, that the list was enough, but he was ignored.

Harry had read almost the whole ride, he had been trying basic spells when a girl looking for a lost toad appeared, she saw him do the levitation spell, and then repaired his glasses, he then thanked her and continued reading, she left soon after.

The boat ride had been great, and on the door he met a blond boy who said he could guide him to meet the right sorts of people.

Harry was a lonely kid, so he had lots of time to watch people, he sometimes left their house to go to the park and watch people interact, it was painful to watch happy families, but he learned things too. How a smile made people trust you more and not feel threatened, how to speak to get things, he used some of that on /them/ and it worked somewhat.

He also learned how to identify certain types of people.

Like this kid, for example, his clothes were brand new, his accent and forced poise indicated a rich background, as did the way he looked at people, judging them.

Harry guessed he was also not that brave, but that was just a guess.

But the guy was rich, and probably had connections, the way spoke his surname also implied it was from an important family. These were the guys who held power.

Bad people to antagonize, even if Harry thought he would be annoying, and a bully, but he was treating Harry as an "equal", so he saw an opportunity.

He put on his quiet smile, and shook the guy's hand, he had little idea how to talk to a kid his age, with adults quiet and polite worked almost all the time, so he went with what he had.

"Hello, er, Draco, can I call you Draco? You can call me Harry. If that's okay?

The boy smiled, as if he won the lottery, jeez so even rich people thought him famous, he really had to learn to use that.

"Of course you can, Harry, I think we will be great friends."

Harry quickly went back to what he learned of conversations, so he could ask about his family, he remembered reading about old families and rich people /loved/ to talk about family.

"So, Draco, Malfoy, that's an old family, right?" It was a bad question, but it looked like the guy was waiting for it, because he began to regale Harry with his whole bloody family history.

And the Malfoy family is old, really old, like Willian The Conqueror gave us lands and we still have them, old. And his father was a politician who spoke with the Minister.

This Draco guy was the definition of old money, so Harry had hit the jackpot, and old money knew old money.

"That's great, Draco, I don't know much about my family, but I am told they are old too."

And Draco told him, after Harry made an excuse about living with relatives who didn't know much so he could be hidden, but Draco loved to hear himself speaking so he told him that the Potter name was old too, like more than six centuries old and he was related to some bigshots Peverells who were kind of legends.

Crap. He really needed to get himself a family tree.

Soon, it was time to enter the hall, and Draco said that Harry would fit right in Slytherin, which Harry guessed was the old money House. He had read about it, /ambition/ /and cunning,/ one Harry had in spades and the other he had a need of. Hagrid had said something about evil Wizards being in it, but it sounded more like when someone talked bad stuff about politicians.

Yeah, Voldemort had been there, but so did /Merlin/ apparently, and lots of important people according to a book.

If his 'relatives' had taught Harry anything with the way they acted, is that you needed to know influential people to be influential.

Harry resented his lot in life up until now, but apparently it had given him the tools to succeed and opportunities definitely weren't lacking.

Soon his name was called, after Draco, to the surprise of no one, had gone into Slytherin, and that girl from the train to Gryffindor, his parent's House, and House of the Brave, they seemed nice, but, not what he needed right now.

He sat in the stool and the Hat was placed, and then it /spoke/.

"Ah, Mr. Potter, I...,oh, well, you selection is different that I thought..."

Harry sighed, "Is that bad?" apparently the Hat could read minds.

"Not at all, I am not here to judge, only to place you in the House that fits you better, and I find two Houses would be good for you, and you seem pretty determined, so you can choose."

"It's not Slytherin and Gryffindor, right?"

"What? Oh, no! You are brave, yes, but...not in the way of Gryffindor, I am talking about Ravenclaw, and Slytherin."

"Ravenclaw?"

"Yes, there you will be able to get the knowledge you want so much, it's the House of learners and scholars..."

"What about Slytherin?"

"Well, personally, I think it would be the best fit, you have great ambitions Mr. Potter, and your desire for power and freedom fits right in there."

"Would I be able to learn in Slytherin?"

"Certainly, Slytherin values knowledge too, but more in the sense of applicable knowledge."

"Would I be able to...become powerful, to become great."

"Mr. Potter, Slytherin is the House that will put you on the way to greatness."

That sounded really good.

"Well then, Slytherin it is."

The Hat laughed, "Heh, this will be interesting, I look forward to see what you accomplish there Mr. Potter, and give you my best wishes in SLYTHERIN!"

*** The last part was shouted out loud, and the Hat was removed after a moment and there was silence...

Crap, had he done something wrong, was that house seen that badly...

Suddenly the Slytherin table exploded in cheers, they went really wild, it shocked Harry.

"We got Potter, /Potter/!"

The other tables started clapping too, but some people were really confused, and throwing glances at the people on the Gryffindor table, who were clapping, but looking to be in shock.

Wow, they really had him pegged for it, he hoped that wouldn't cause trouble, at least not big trouble.

Professor McGonagall gave him a little push and he went, he had to really hold himself to smile and not to flinch when he was /swarmed/ by well-wishers wanting to shake his hand, some looked weird, as if relieved.

"All right people, let the guy breathe, hello there, Mr. Potter, I am Cassius Warrington, Prefect of Slytherin House, welcome to our house, let me sit you with the other students in your year."

Soon he was sat beside Draco, who looked to be over the moon, and proud, very proud.

"Awesome Harry, I knew you would be here, let me introduce you to some of my friends."

He was introduced to Crabbe and Goyle, who were big, and didn't seem to be very smart, but followed Draco. Bodyguards then. Lovely.

Then Pansy Parkinson who looked torn between being confused by his reception and trying to be diplomatic.

Blaise Zabini, that guy had look Harry sometimes saw in the mirror, of determination, but then he placed a much better practiced smile than Harry's and greeted him warmly. That one would bear watching.

Then Daphne Greengrass, a pretty girl who looked Harry over, nodded and greeted him formally. Apparently it had been a good idea to splurge on robes, or she had seen something else, he would need to learn how to deal with girls.

Tracy Davis seemed to be the most normal of the group, shaking his hand and saying she was happy he was there. It was either a very good act, or she was truly like that, good, he liked honesty in others.

The others he would have to remember later, but he was impressed at how good it was to be well received.

It was a good start.

Harry later learned his Head of House, one Professor Snape, who also taught Potions, disliked him, but was content in being formal, if only a bit caustic, he could deal with that.

Some people in the House weren't happy, by their glances at him, but they were far fewer than he expected, if he counted by those he could perceive at least.

Harry then received the best bed he had ever seen, he would have to share a dorm with the other boys, but they seemed ok with it.

They also asked questions, lots of them, uncomfortable questions, so Harry decided to use something he saw people use, make people speak of themselves or what they knew and make them forget their questions.

"Er, I really don't know how to answer that, I was raised by /muggles./" he tried to inject the same inflection he had heard his housemates used with that word.

It worked, because they scowled, "What! why?"

"Security." he deflected, ignoring Blaise snorting, "So, er, there are some things I don't know, maybe you guys could help me?"

Draco's eyes shone.

-

It took less than a full day at Hogwarts to realize the Wizarding World worked similarly to the Muggle One, only with magic.

Money and Power, and the influence they bought, ruled. Only that it was much more clear that people with money and influence ruled.

Also, to some people blood was important too, Harry learned he was considered a half-blood, because his mother was Muggleborn, and to some people this was bad, because they didn't talk too much about it with him, but seemed to be holding themselves.

So, a form of racism, only weirder, apparently his name, fame, and money, /compensated/ for that, assholes.

And Magical Power was important too, very important, sometimes it compensated for a lot of things, the Headmaster, Dumbledore, not from a rich family, and a half-blood, was very important, and had a lot, a /lot,/ of political power because he had beaten a very powerful and scary guy all the way back in 1945. He was also considered one of the most magically powerful Wizards alive. Even some of Harry's housemates(including Draco) who disliked him still admitted he was not to be trifled with.

Harry needed to learn and practice magic then, because this is the kind of power he needed, he knew fame could turn both ways, especially in Britain, and that he wasn't the richest guy around, so he needed to get an advantage with magical power.

No one would ever hurt him again.

School however, seemed to be, a bit slow, his first Charm class, was about the levitation spell, the one Harry had learned in the train. He had to really work himself up and remember his stupid aunt wouldn't know if he did well, and he would be out of her house soon anyway.

So he demonstrated the spell, on the first try.

It was the right thing to do.

"Oh, splendid, Mr. Potter, splendid, 10 points to Slytherin."

Draco looked surprised, but /smiled, "/Brilliant, Harry!" he then looked confused and whispered, frowning a bit, "I thought you said Muggles raised you."

Shit.

"I learned this on the train, it's in the second chapter and looked useful."

Draco's eyes widened, and he just nodded.

Harry decided to tone down a bit until the first months were over, he didn't want to overdo it and call too much attention.

Harry learned that being on Draco's "group" had it's pros and cons, they were just regular kids, only with magic, well, most were, he had his suspicions with Blaise. The problem was that Draco liked to be a bully, and Harry had no idea how to avoid that, he didn't know what to say. Draco especially liked to bully people due to money. Apparently blood too, but he would glance at Harry and stop himself.

Which left money, and one of his targets was some boy from Gryffindor called Ron Weasley, who according to Draco came from an old family, but they were 'Blood Traitors' and poor, and that made them bad, for some reason.

It ticked Harry off because he still considered himself poor, even if he had a fortune(he would need to write the Bank and ask for a statement.)

So, Harry decided to use the age-old excuse of studying, except he really went to study, and he talked with Tracy and Daphne too, who talked with Pansy, but didn't seem to like her very much, and Pansy didn't seem to like Tracy, but talked with her. Girls were weird.

He tried to be present in the group, and he was glad he didn't need much effort because Draco spoke enough for everyone, he only agreed or made noncommittal noises. He also used the opportunity to learn a lot, even if he realized many things were biased, Draco was well-read and knew magic and especially Potions, like the son of a noble, and liked to teach Harry, if only a bit patronizingly, but he could deal with that.

Harry preferred the clinical way that Daphne explained with, it was comfortable being around her because he didn't feel the pressure to /act/, or start conversations, they just sat down, studied, and talked about coursework or magical trivia. Tracy was harder, but he guessed it was good practice.

**** Harry learned to what to say to make people happy, when to smile, when to laugh, even if he didn't think it was funny.

He sometimes was disgusted at himself, but it was all for a goal, and he was learning, and learning fast, one thing he made sure he knew how to do well, was read and write, Dudley had plenty of material for both he left abandoned, and his aunt didn't notice Harry hadn't thrown the Caligraphy books away.

And Harry was surprised at how good it was being recognized for good work, he tried to write good essays, and he practiced magic a lot, sometimes well into the night when he could(he wasn't used to sleeping much).

And it showed, the only student who did better than him was the girl he met in the train, one Hermione Granger. Who seemed to study just as hard or even harder than him, her written and theoretical work was without peer, but Harry could match and sometimes even surpass her with the practical applications. Professor Flitwick said he was gifted.

He had been really relieved, and just more determined.

Harry then learned about Quidditch, the most famous sport in the Wizarding World, he wasn't a sports guy, scrawny and always chosen last. But one thing he learned is that people liked to talk about sports, so he read about it, and learned they didn't have Tellies to watch games but heard them through some kind of radio called a Wireless. It was a good way to have things to talk about.

And he learned he wasn't a bad flier, the lesson was a breeze, so much he was approved in the class after it, and Madam Hooch, along with Draco, said he may have a talent for Quidditch. Which was a big surprise. Draco also bullied a Gryffindor guy, Longbottom, and tried to take something from him, only for a group of Gryffindors to try and stop him, Harry really didn't want to find to defend a bully, but he would have to do something.

Thankfully they kept posturing for long enough for a teacher to show up and take the glass ball away after they started shouting. Harry wondered what he would have done if a fight had broken out, he never had that much sucess with his fists.

His Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor wasn't good at all, he stuttered and seemed to be afraid of his own shadow, and Harry felt really weird in his class.

So, self-study then, he learned from one of the older students he could order books, so he went against his instincts and asked Professor Quirell for recommendations, at least he could say he went to a teacher when he went and just bought dueling manuals.

Boy, was he surprised when Quirell recommended some really good books, and pointed him towards Professor Flitwick, who had been a /dueling champion./

Professor Flitwick smiled when Harry asked about dueling, saying he was too young but did recommend him beginner books and manuals 'so you have a good start'.

Hedwig came back with two other owls and a lot of books.

"Harry, are you sure you aren't a Ravenclaw?"

Harry shrugged, so interested in the books he spoke distractedly "The Hat offered that too, but said I would fit better in Slytherin, it would put me on the way to greatness."

He didn't notice the raised eyebrows, or whispers that emerged when he said that.

In the Halloween, where Harry tried to forget about his parents and enjoy the night, mostly by eating a lot of candy, he had never had many chances before, so he the best with what he could.

It was all interrupted when Professor Quirell ran into the Great Hall screaming about a Troll, he then fainted. Typical.

After the initial bout of panic, where Harry learned Draco screamed like a girl, they were ordered to go back to their dorms.

Harry then frowned and said, "Isn't that where the Troll is? The Dungeons?"

That was the wrong thing to say becaue Draco screamed again and Cassius came over and Harry said that to him, he spoke with Snape, and the teachers spoke amongst themselves, and decided to keep them in the Great Hall, some teachers left, and Professor Flitiwick cast a spell on the Great Halls door that made them flash golden and lock themselves.

If they could seal doors like that why move lots of children through the castle instead of just reinforcing the door.

Some students were crying, others couldn't eat, Harry who was used to eating while distressed wasn't going to waste the opportunity, many in his table followed him.

After an hour the teachers returned, they looked a bit worried, but still relieved, Dumbledore said the Troll had been dealt with, and they could go back to their dorms.

Harry spent the whole way hearing Draco go on and on about how he was going to tell his father and how Dumbledore was incompetent, and how could a Troll get inside one of the safest buildings in Britain.

Harry wanted to know too, maybe Quirell was involved, but honestly, he already had too much on his plate.

​

The other day he learned through Pansy that the Troll had injured two students, among them that 'know it-all M-/Muggleborn'/ ah, the racism again, at least they didn't do it in his face. He hoped the girl was well, she didn't seem be as nonsensical as some of the others. But by what Pansy said it wasn't bad and she would be out of the Hospital Wing in a week or so.

I am going to end it here, boring I know, and I stopped before some of his big issues came forward, this is already too long, basically I see Harry would be withdrawn, lack social skills, and try to fit in, kind of like a social camaleon, I also see him as very jaded. And not interested in looking for trouble, with a determination to never be hurt again.

He would be the guy that stayed quiet in the background, and Draco would be good for that because he seems like the guy who likes to talk a lot.

You can see ignores much of what happens around him, and doesn't care for other stuff(the announcement about the Third Floor corridor) this is because he is almost full time focusing on his act.

Harry's anger and hatred would be significant, but by this point he would have suffered enough to internalize them and become a bit cynical and uncaring in the process, going forward he would become more confident and get out of his shell more, his anger issues would come forward after the luster from the new world faded a bit, and people got used to having him around and would not be so afraid to approach him. He's also eleven and some of those issues become more glaring when people get older.

I see him as having sometimes an explosive anger, when things didn't go his way, but being able to bear with it most of the time, and having trust and self esteem issues. This Harry is practically playing a role right now, because he had som much positive things(magic, money, fame, being treated well) that he felt a bit more confident acting without some of the burden of his childhood, almost like when you change places it feels like a fresh start.

When Draco grows up a bit and wanted to up his game of bullying, and got more confident, issues may arise, or Harry would just ignore it.

Events would force Harry to come to the forefront, and this would make him even more desperate for power, Second Year would solidify his Slytherin position(he would not involve himself with the Philosopher's Stone), and he would start to see people villanize him, making him isolate further and seek those who supported him.

** Wait. But the thing about Harry is that he is defiant, he has all those things happen but he still wants to fight and isn't afraid to do it even if it's going to hurt him, he has been like that ever since he was a kid.

It's part of his character to be like that, and there are people like that, they hit back, despite the odds.

A "realistic" Harry with his canon personality would be Tom Riddle 2.0, only he's more violent and brutal IMHO.

Shinji's personality was much meeker, even when he was a little kid, and way before all the psychological manipulation his father put him through so when the time comes he chooses Instrumentality(only Gendo didn't count on Yui, Lilith, and ADAM intervening and convincing Shinji to reverse it)

And Manga Shinji IIRC is much ballsier than anime Shinji, similar to Rebuild!Shinji, that only gets down when he's betrayed by practically everyone and wrongly accused of destroying the world.
