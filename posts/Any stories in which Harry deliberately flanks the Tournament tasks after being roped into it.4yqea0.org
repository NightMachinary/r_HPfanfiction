I don't see how even a “magically binding” artefact could make him not merely participate in it but aim to win as well.


** Do you mean "Flunks"? Because "Flanks" gives me the impression of Harry completely bypassing the Tasks altogether.

Or shivving someone. One of the two.

*** He maneuvers to attack the tasks from the side. He tunnels under the lake, runs around to the back of the maze... I thought the same thing and wanted to make a joke about flanking.

Tis sad said joke lacked wit.

  What if Harry's rebelliousness started a year earlier, because Dumbledore wouldn't let him go stay with Sirius in the summers? What would a rebellious teenager who was entered into the Triwizard Tournament do? H/G

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
