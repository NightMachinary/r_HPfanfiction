So I know there have been many [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3e4vnj/looking_for_threads_three_tips/][fem!Harry posts]], but I couldn't find any good, recent threads on a *dark-ish* fem!Harry.

Otherwise, if you don't know of any Dark Fem!Harry, talented Fem!Harry would also be fine.

Any suggestions?

(I'm thinking of something along the lines of linkffn(Equal and Opposite by Amerision))

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

Rumor Has It is abandoned but it was fun while it lasted. It's about a fem!Harry who talks to Voldemort through the connection between them and she gets gradually darker while they repair Tom's soul (intending to leave only one Horcrux)

Princess of Blacks is very popular at the moment. It's about a fem!Harry who is the sister of the Boy Who Lived (Not a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived). She was left with the Dursleys because they thought she was a squib and she uses a lot of Dark magic. The story itself is quite dark.

Knock 'em Dead is about a a fem!Harry who can see ghosts and the spirits of the Peverells teach her to harness her necromancy. It (as far as I'm aware) is abandoned too. But you never do know with Tsume Yuki, it might just be on a really, really lost hiatus.

I'd like to hear some more Dark Fem!Harry's. Those are my favourites and there just aren't enough of them.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.
