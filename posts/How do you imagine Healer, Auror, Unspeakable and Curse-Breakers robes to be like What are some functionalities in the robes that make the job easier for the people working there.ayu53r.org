** Unspeakables' robes, I expect to look quite a bit like clich√©d mad scientist lab-coats, except black instead of white. They also wear dragonhide gloves made of Hebridean Black hide, identical to the usual black rubber gloves. In terms of practicality, they would, of course, have space-extended pockets and all sorts of protectice spells on them, but any more details than that is strictly classified. As is everything else about the Unspeakables and what they do.

Healers would have clean, white robes; I don't think there's any more to it than that in terms of cut. But they might have some charms on them to protect from contagion and repell bloodstains, perhaps.

Curse-Breaker robes wouldn't be a general category, I feel; going by Bill's example, curse-breakers are pretty eccentric, individualistic fellows. Definitely a lot of protective enchantments, a lot of pockets, a lot of medals and pendants and knicknacks, some of which are cursed, some of which may just be keepsakes from a previous adventure.

Auror robes I have always imagined to be plum-colored --- though a different shade than the ones used on the Wizengamot. My thinking is that at one point the Minister for Magic was /really/ into that color, and made an edict that any and all official Ministry uniforms have to include it somehow, and considering how wizards are with traditions, no one ever seriously tried to have it repealed later. (The Unspeakables don't follow that rule, but they don't follow /any/ rules anyway, and everyone's too creeped off by everything about them to object.) The Aurors just got used to it, and obtained the right to wear a pretty /dark/ shade of plum if nothing else. In terms of functionality, they, too, would be magically toughened, and may even reflect some weaker curses like a weak Shield Charm. A lot of pockets, of course.

** My headcanon has always been the following:

...

*Unspeakables:* Robes contain many hidden compartments with extendable pockets and are lined with armor and enchantments. Each robe comes with a built-in emergency mini one-time use time turner that can go back up to 5 minutes and an emergency port-key. Each robe comes lined with extremely comfortable material like Acromantula silk.

- Regular everyday Unspeakables who go out into the world wear Grey robes (No Trim). This color is low key and they blend in to the world around them.

- High level and secret research Unspeakables wear Black robes (silver trim).

- The Head Unspeakable wears a Silver robe (Black Trim).

--------------

*Healer:* Robes are charmed to clean themselves constantly, and project an aura of calmness about the area. Each contains a hidden strip of pockets where the belt is that contains emergency potions and things like Bezoars

- All healer robes are pure White, but each type of healer has a different color trim on it. So for example, healers dealing with spell damage would have blue trim, while healers dealing with poisoning have green trim.

--------------

*Auror:* Robes are set up very similar to unspeakables but without some of the fancier enchantments and "luxury" aspects like the lining. Auror robes would also contain a variety of hidden holster types for weaponry beyond just a simple wand. They are also cut to allow much easier movement of the wearer and come with things like retractable sleeves.

- Everday Aurors on everyday duties wear lighter Red robes (No trim), like a Crimson or Ruby, or Scarlet.

- HOWEVER, if an Auror (of any level) needs to remain low key or is on some sort of more secretive mission, Red robes can be substituted for pure Black robes (but with red trim marking their station).

- Higher rank Aurors such as ones in command of a unit wear very dark Red robes, like a Burgundy or Maroon, or Rosewood color, with the head Auror's having gold trim.

--------------

*Curse-Breaker:* Robes setup more like a tactical vest system with tons of functionality and pockets. Robes can also retract like an Aurors but to a much greater extent, becoming almost formfitting if need be. Heavily layered with enchantments and each Curse-Breaker is allowed to customize their Robe fairly heavily as needed for their current assignment.

- All base-line Curse-Breaker robes are Moss Green, but charmed with the ability to change color as needed, along with other elements such as thickness and more. As stated, Curse-breakers can customize to a great degree.

** I imagine healer robes are white and are designed to repel bacteria, blood, etc.

Auror robes I imagine to be a deep red and are absolutely covered in protective charms. I also imagine they have dragon hide as armor as an additional level of protection as well as some kind of wand holster. I also imagine they have extended pockets with different potions they may need.

I imagine cursebreakers to be more individualized and basically just be layered with protective spells as well as extended pockets filled with different magical items they may need.

** Curse breaker robes are leather trenchcoats. When they open them up it's like those stolen watch salesmen from the 80s movies

** I think unspeakables is white. White because it would stand out, which may not be what they go for but shows status? Then curse breakers would be green or purple because the colors remind me of curses, author is plain black and very normal. Authors shouldn't stand out especially in crowded places with potential suspects. Healers would be white I guess I don't know about healers

** I imagine robes as something which evolved out of something resembling monk's robes, or the kind of clothing that medieval university students were expected to wear.

Something like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Philo_mediev.jpg][this]] or [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Meeting_of_doctors_at_the_university_of_Paris.jpg][this]].

I imagine that healers wear white or blue robes in a modern cut, but that neither unspeakables nor curse-breakers have a standard uniform.

I imagine that the hood has disappeared entirely in modern robes and that they've gone from wool to silk or cotton, with the robes of witches having become something in between a dress and a poncho, with the robes of wizards being distinguished by being slightly longer.
