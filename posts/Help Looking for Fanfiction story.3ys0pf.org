I've been trying to find this Fanfiction story I remember being really good but I can't find it anywhere! From what I remember at some point Harry creates an all around shield fuelled by emotion I think and it can block even the killing curse. Also at some point Harry takes a group of first year Slytherin and Gryffindors under his wing and eventually he becomes the Defence Professor at Hogwarts.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!


** I'm almost certain this is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/semprini/HPATVOM.html][Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery]] by Semprini.

There are two sequels as well:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/semprini/HPATROR.html][Harry Potter and the Ring of Reduction]] which is nearly as good.

And [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/semprini/PI.html][The Phoenix Intuition]] which I didn't like as well.

** The shield reminds me of linkffn(The Refiners Fire by Abraxan)

If it's not that one, it's definitely a very old one.
