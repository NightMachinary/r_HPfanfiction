Im looking for the best fics where Hsrry is immortal, either as owner of the Hallows, because of the wording of the prophecy, (either must die at the hand of the other) creature inheritance, (such as phoenix) or any other such ways. Crossovers and crackfics are welcome, oneshots too, but prefer lenghty fics. I dont care if they start just as he becomes immortal or after a long time. Dont care about slash as long as Harry is straight. (Bonus if Harry is in a relationship with another immortal)

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

*** I tried to read this before, but i just cant take it seriously. The first chapter is just wierd. How and why is muggle!Harry captured?(-sarcastic) If he still had magic there is no way he would be there.. and then suddenly he uses magic.. wtf? It starts off as unrealistic as Harry without magic wouldn't be there like that.

**** Spoilers ahead!

His spirit is broken. He saw his family murdered right in front of him and he simply doesn't care that he's been captured. He doesn't care about anything. iirc, he doesn't really care that he might die, he only uses magic to save the people around him.

It is a fantastic story when you get into the meat of it.

** Linkffn(chrysochlorous) has a MOD!Harry in a relationship with Rosalie from Twilight. The romance is very gradual and believable. Also Harry in there has an interesting relationship with Death, who for once is not happy with having a master. Now don't run away because it's Twilight crossover, I happen to hate it, but I loved this fic, so perhaps give it a shot.

Is there news whether the author is planning to continue the fic, or is it abandoned?

  femHarry/tom. the girl who wanders in and out of space and time. (Tom doesn't need to see her to know she's there. As if a part of him intrinsically feels her presence when it shimmers in the air; matter and energy emerging from time and space. He knows nothing of her transient, peregrine existence, but she is still the indomitable center of his universe)
