  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Linkao3(Azoth)

This is one of my favourite fanfics!! It has plenty of potions + chemistry that ties into the plot and it's brilliantly written.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Since the ministry had confiscated the Malfoy vaults Draco was required to find a job though no one would hire him. After saving him from an altercation in Knockturn Ally George Weasley offers him a job at the joke shop as a potion master. Harry doesn't approve and checks in often to make sure that Malfoy is not up to something.

** The now-deleted Snape/Hermione fic 'What E'er Therein Is Promised' features Hermione doing experimental potionmaking under Snape's tutelage. It, uh, also involves a seriously dubious consent situation, and I'm guessing the reason the author took it down is because they were tired of people thinking it was a true love romance fic instead of the wickedly complicated exploration of Stockholm syndrome and Faustian contracts it really was.
