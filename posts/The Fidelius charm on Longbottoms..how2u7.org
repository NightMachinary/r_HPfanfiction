I don't think the books or movies ever mention Dumbledore giving any extra protection to the Longbottom family. Neville was a candidate for the whole "Chosen One" business, but we only ever hear about Potters going under the Fidelius. And if there was a Fidelius on Longbottoms, how did the Lestranges break through? To my knowledge, it was never mentioned or explained. The fact that Voldemort chose Harry over Neville might be just because of the extra protection - if Dumbledore wants something hidden so badly, it must be more important.


** The simplest explanation is that the Longbottoms lowered their guard after Voldemort's downfall.

** At some point after hearing the prophecy, Voldemort decided that it referred to Harry. At that point, Snape decided that he cared for Lily too much to let her die, so he betrayed Voldemort by telling Dumbledore. It was after that point that Dumbledore suggested that the Potter's hide through the use of the Fidelius Charm.

Since Voldemort has made his choice, the Longbottoms probably didn't feel the necessity of going into hiding, although as members of the Order they probably had some measure of security on their house.

Then, after Voldemort was defeated, my guess is that Crouch and the Lestranges wanted to make members of the Order suffer as much as possible. The fact that the Longbottoms were both members of the Order and had potentially been who the prophecy referred to made them good targets.

lmao that's pretty dumb ngl. Voldemort decided to go after Harry first but he fully intended to kill both of them.

** I think it's pretty much implied that they were also under the fidelius because it was presented as the highest level of protection at the time. If they weren't I can't imagine how they outlived the Potters.
