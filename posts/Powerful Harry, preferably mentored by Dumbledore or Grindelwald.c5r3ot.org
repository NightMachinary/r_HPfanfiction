  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is exactly about Grindelwald training Harry and spreading the â€˜Greater Good' across Europe, by accident. It's canon pairing with a quite bloodthirsty Ginny and a quite unhinged Hermione.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

**** I won't spoil too much, but Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore's death at the end of HBP. It's actually canon compliant until that point.

This story is written from Grindelwald and Harry's POVs.
