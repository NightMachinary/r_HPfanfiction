** Linkao3(The Meaning of Geranium) is the 3rd story in the 4 part Linkao3(The secret language of plants) (although the last story is more of an epilogue) and it is SO good. The entire series is fantastic and one of the more unique tales I've seen on HP fanfiction. I definitely recommend starting with the first story though otherwise you'll be a little lost.

  Percy goes back in time.He doesn't do it to save the world, doesn't do it because he is a Gryffindor, doesn't do it to help the Order of the Phoenix defeat Voldemort.He does it because Ginny died and his shirt is still drenched in her blood.He does it because he's selfish, because he's the last one standing in a world destroyed by years of war.He does it and he succeeds.His family, however, doesn't understand why his behaviour has changed so much.

  In the minutes after the Battle of Hogwarts, the Weasleys' own prodigal son brings another shock to his family: a wife. How will she adjust to her huge new family, and how will they take their new daughter and sister? What other secrets is he hiding behind those horn-rimmed glasses?
