:END:
Hello everyone, I came here to seek help in finding a fic. I would really appreciate any help I can get.

This fic was for the Hermione/Ginny pairing and was the most popular fic out there for them. I reread it often but somehow can't remember a title or author! I decided to reread it today but I can't find it anywhere. I'm positive it was on Ao3 but it could have been on Fanfiction.net as well.

Let me describe it:

Post-war, McGonagall is new headmaster of Hogwarts, Hermione is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and Ginny was the star player for a famous Quidditch team (maybe the Holyhead Harpies?),however, Ginny gets hurt and is forced to retire prematurely from her Quidditch career. She then becomes the Quidditch professor at Hogwarts.

The story revolves around the repair of Hermione and Ginny's relationship. McGonagall gives Hermione the task to research Dementors. The Dementors are running rampant post-war and Hermione needs to research and figure out a way to create a new spell or enhance the Patronus spell to get rid of the Dementors.

In the beginning, Ginny returns to Hogwarts and Hermione avoids her and immediately has flashbacks to their blossoming romantic relationship during their time as students at Hogwarts and at the Weasley home. Ginny struggles as the new Quidditch professor due to PTSD from her injuries. It is also brought to light that Ginny harbors resentment towards Hermione, Harry, and Ron because they did not include her in their endeavors to stop Voldemort. I remember one part of the scene vividly, where Ginny says, "You left me!"

At the end, they work it out, and they end up creating a new type of Patronus spell and they're Patronuses change, all through the power of love and forgiveness.

something tells me the title is one word and it may be Latin based for the new spell they create in the story, maybe Ignatious...idk? Thing is I had this story saved/bookmarked but it's not appearing there or in my history. I've tried searching for it but I'm not getting anything. Its baffling! I'm worried that the author may have deleted it. I know it's stupid, but I feel like a family member died. lol.

Anyway, I would appreciate any help I can get in finding this fic, maybe it's archived somewhere?

Thanks!
