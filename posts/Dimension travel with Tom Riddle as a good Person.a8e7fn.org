Title says practical anything. I would like to know Fics that have the Canon characters (preferably just the main persons) being dragged into an AU that has Tom Riddle being a Good Person....and possibly famous. In fact, i would like the Fics to have him possess his Canon good traits, but choose a different Route (the good one). So now, he is a good Person and possibly famous, whether he works as a Politician or Businessman doesnt matter.

Not necessary, but it would be also good, if Either Harry or another character is irritated by this "good" Image of the Man and dont buy it...so he is skeptical, but during the Progress accepts, that this version is indeed good.


** That's fairly accurate description of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]]. linkffn(4025300) With Britain stuck in a tyrannical regime, Riddle is leader of the failed rebelion. Hermione, the dimension traveler in this fic, doesn't trust him but has to learn to work with him.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

#+begin_quote
  Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change time. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC
