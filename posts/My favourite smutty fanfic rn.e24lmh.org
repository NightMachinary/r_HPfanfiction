I am really loving this one right now. Just smut tbh and it stars Hermione and Luna and I love it. Author (icantdream) stopped posting updates but has started posting them again. I wish it was regular so I could anticipate the next chapter but people have lives I guess lol


** The dialogue feels like generic porn writing, the scenes feel rushed and the behaviour is utterly awful (see point 1).

I can forgive a certain degree of OOC behaviour in such a fic, but there's nothing resembling their canon characters. It reads like a transcribed porn video with HP nametags.

*** Agreed, I could not get past the 2nd chapter because it was obvious that none of the characters are even based on their canon personalities.

I think that's why "It could only happen to Harry" is pretty much mentioned immediatly when someone is requesting smut. It has great writing that would even stand out in normal fanfiction, has characterization that makes sense in a canon context and is just a VERY fun take on the often used "Harry needs to fuck a bunch of people to perform a ritual" trope. And of course some of the best written smut scenes I have come accross.

**** There are a few others which are good. "A boy and his cloak" probably has the best "in character" depictions, "The Power of Seven" is basically "It could only happen" but a touch darker and more serious.

Most smut is pretty awful, and OP's fic is just one example, but there are a few decent ones around, which make the deficiencies of the bad stuff more obvious.

***** Yea, you probably know, but "A boy and his cloak" is actually by the same author as "It could only happen to Harry". So no surprise there that its also good.

Also agreed that "The Power of Seven" is another good example of smut done right. Or at the very least not wrong :D
