NEED RECS

Husband is going away for the next two weeks. Must do ALL THE READING.

Looking for Snamione or Dramione fics NOT found on ffnet. Must be complete and over 20k words (preferably over 40k), and have decent spelling/grammar. I'll read anything but my preferences are:

Not too OOC, I love overcoming the snarky a-hole parts and the witty, sarcastic arguments. I'm a big fan of dark fics, not a big fan of lemons. The ending can be happy, sad, whatever.

I have completely exhausted ffnet, soooo.... Get at me.


** [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com][SSHG Review]] has reviews of various SSHG fics. Some are very historical to the ship and are difficult to find online so she's linked to her downloaded copies or the actual website.

** Have you checked out [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]]? All the Snamione you can handle! Honestly there aren't that many fics there that aren't written at the very least decently.

*** I used to LOVE Ashwinder, but now that there are so many fics they need some major filters added on there lol. I feel like I scroll through 20 pages and only find one fic!

** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels). Not sure if this fits since it does have a fair amount of smut and a weird premise, but it's good. The plot gets kind of crazy at first, but this fic has surprisingly good and well thought out plotline so things that don't make sense may actually make perfect sense later. Definitely gets quite dark, and has some dubcon and some messed up parts and does have a good amount of explicit smut scenes but the plot is really good. Everyone is very in character (Snape is very canon and dark, with his sarcasm and cynical attitude) and the writing is good.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607120210/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html]] Fire and the Rose. Due to a potions accident, Hermione and Snape end up switching bodies and have to live as each other without letting anyone know. Really well written and has some seriously funny moments. It has great characterizations as well.
