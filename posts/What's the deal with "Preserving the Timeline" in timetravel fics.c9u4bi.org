There's a common trope in timetravel fics where the MC goes back in time, usually to the 1940's or the 1970's, and a major part of the story's conflict is them trying to blend in while trying to make as few waves as possible, to "preserve the timeline". They keep their info to themselves, watch people die and suffer because they died and suffered in the original timeline, and convince themselves that it's necessary for the greater good.

From an outside storytelling perspective, preserving the timeline does the following for the story:

- Automatically gives the MC a compelling internal conflict: "Should I stand back, or should I help? But it feels so bad, waaah. :("

- Provides an overarching plot and motivation: "I have to keep things the way they are to defeat the bad guy in the end."

- Allows MC to interact with past timeline characters without having to adjust their characterization as a result of changed decisions. Eg, Timetravel!Harry doesn't warn Snape about following Lupin and friends down to the Shrieking Shack in 1976, resulting in Snape's hatred of the Marauders and his life debt to James. If Snape hadn't gone, he'd probably have made better decisions later on in his life.

- Allows author to coast on established timeline events (stations of canon) instead of plotting out an expanding butterfly storm.

But looking at it from an in-story perspective, preserving the timeline just sounds so goddamn stupid. What's the point of introducing timetravel to the story in the first place if the characters aren't meant to do anything? Obviously there's a nostalgia farming aspect to it, wringing out all those emotions from Harry getting to see his parents fall in love, Sirius in his prime, Pettigrew before he went evil... But it feels so dissonant for the MC to have access to a device as powerful as timetravel, but be so powerless against the villain that they basically condemn themselves to narrative bench warming.

Is there a reasonable explanation or example of how the "Preserving the Timeline" trope can be used in a way that makes sense for the plot? In the fics where I've seen authors try to explain it in-story, it's always been Harry or one of his friends trying to re-roll the dice, or re-load a savegame, with a coldblooded, utilitarian "It's for the greater good" ultimate goal. A bunch of people along the way are allowed to die, as long as they set up the exact circumstances for Voldemort's defeat.

And that just makes me mad.

This post is kind of inspired by Cursed Child, because it's one of those +fanfics+ author-endorsed official sequels that uses the trope.

It's /canon/ that Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, and their kids stood by and watched James and Lily be murdered by Voldemort. Because they needed the AK to rebound and Lily's sacrifice to kill Voldy 17 years later. I think it's the crowning example of the "Preserving the Timeline" trope being used in fanfic.


** Several possibilities:

1. Authors have an unhealthy attachment to canon plots, or are incapable of developing their own plots.

2. Authors like contrived drama and want to see good guys suffer, because in their mind, suffering leads to ‘good' stories.

3. Time travel mechanics disallow changing the outcome. Time Turners are such examples.

But honestly, I really fucking hate the “preserve the timeline” thing. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Anyone who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head. That's why I hate fics such as “Debt of Time” and “Cursed Child” with so much passion.

I personally can't stand the Wizard Jesus analogy any longer. Grooming a child to become a sacrifice, despite his tremendous personal power, is totally FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond Any Recognition). And he didn't even properly prepare his sacrifice adequately for the suicide mission! Only through an overdose of Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope did the good guys score a pathetic Pyrrhic victory.

Poor Voldemort, who gets handed idiot balls whenever the plot requires it, never had chance against the 4 most powerful weapons in literature.

#+end_quote

They really aren't. Time turners don't allow users to change *what they know happened*. Which could be right about as little as jack-fucking-shit, hence H&H managing to save Sirius, since they didn't know his fate. It's actually the single most interesting time mechanic I've ever seen in HP fics, yet nobody ever uses it, since it allows for great changes, but still imposes limits. You can also easily setup closed loops.

Example: Harry is running around the DoM, he's getting rekt by the DEs. Finds a tt in the time room, goes back in time to alert everybody. Boom, suddendly an apparently lost scenario becomes a victory because outside the whole and well prepared ootp just apparated into the DoM. You could even use it to justify Snape's "delay" in alerting the order and Sirius's /extremely convenient/ unreachability right after the history exam.

Granted, this gets harder to do on longer timeframes (but not *that* hard, between a teen's ignorance of the world outside school and all the players' tendency to control and distort information as much as they're capable) but then tts were meant for hours long jumps canonically.

**** I do quite like the perception based time travel, but it's still very abusable. For example, what's stopping, for example, Harry from going back in time during the fight in OOTP and doing a Switching Spell on Sirius to replace him with a convincing dummy? He immediately falls into the Veil, so there would be no time to recognize that it wasn't actually Sirius that fell in.

Although, now that I think about it, I'd love to see a fic where the MC alters the timeline in more and more absurd ways to match what they had perceived happen, but get a better overall result.

It's not like it would be impossible, but as an author you have to manage suspension of disbelief. In regard to abusability, well I guess? It's not like it's a multiplayer game, it's a fic.

*** We have very similar opinions on the trope, I see.

The only explanation that I originally thought made some semblance of logic was the coldblooded "Greater Good" approach, where a painful and suffering-filled Pyrrhic victory was decided upon by the MC to be better than the possibility of Voldemort winning.

It's certainly possible to write a story with that premise, but my personal problem with it is how often it makes the MC who decides to Preserve the Timeline unlikeable and unsympathetic, and its dependence on a perfect sequence of external contrivances to produce a successful end. And depending on your standards for good storytelling, this trope drops a lot of fics outside enjoyability, and the suspension of disbelief.

**** Imo, that premise only makes sense if the TT was unwilling, otherwise why would the person risk going back at all, when they already have their Pyrrhic victory?

I could see a story with that premise with Dumbledore as the unwilling TT, forced to choose at every junction whether he should leave the timeline as is or interfere. He's the only character eccentric enough (except for maybe Moody) to get away with the odd behavior that would result and he's already the go-to character for a coldblooded "Greater Good" approach. But the quality of the story, as you said, would hinge on the writer's ability to write a Dumbledore-centric fic that's light on action (because we've seen it all already) and heavy on character development, keeping him interesting as MC when he's not making decisions the readers would agree with; that's a LOT to ask of any writing, let alone fanfiction. Maybe if the story was just done as vignettes covering the major plot points of canon?

*** Yeah, I hate it because it just sounds so goddamn dumb, in terms of logic /and/ morality.

To stand by and allow people like the Longbottoms to get tortured into insanity, because you need Neville to grow up with the same wimpy childhood that results in him manning up and killing Nagini, the last horcrux, is just... weird. Even if Neville does grow up the same, and ends up killing Nagini the same way, wouldn't that make the time traveler something of an accessory to the crime? It's not the same as setting a house on fire, but watching someone burn down a house, then walking away whistling.

I guess the part I hate most about the trope is the MC's mental dissonance of telling themselves (and the reader) that their time travel plot isn't stupid, because it's doing an ultimate good.

Though it's a toss-up with the trope being a mandate of "narrative impotence", where the MC loses or gives away their agency for reasons of the plot. Similar to McGonagall telling Harry the problem's out of her hands and there's nothing that can be done, or Dumbledore telling Harry "I'll tell you when you're older", it takes away or lessens the MC's ability to resolve conflict.

It was a /Worm/ SI or pseudo-SI fanfic with the working title alleged to have been 'Insecurity', where I felt that the MC was so stressed that he came to believe this even though he should know that it was false, so as to be assured that everything would go fine.

** It's the same reason why we see so many canon rehashes. It's the reason why there are so many damn fics that have plot divergences whenever, wherever - such as Pettigrew getting captured - but still have the graveyard scene take place.

People are not really imaginative enough to write out new scenes or new plots in a way that retains the reader's interest. There are a few that do manage it, but the majority of the ones that I've read that do venture into AU territory end up reading like something else, and it does put me off reading them slightly, and I give up somewhere down the road.

The "Preserving the timeline" nonsense comes from that -- authors aren't really sure if their AU ideas will be well recieved. Either that, or they're not really interested in writing AU scenes and just go with the flow. Canon is there for them to just write their little plots and people recognise and expect certain stuff to happen, which is easier, I suppose, for authors to work with.

This is highly debatable. Snape was hanging around people who used Dark magic, and defended their actions, as we see in his own memories. By the time Lily tells him to go fuck himself, she's pretty much given up on trying to stop him from going down that road. In her own words, she'd been making excuses for Snape for years by that point. He's devising his own dark spells at that point - he couldn't wait to join Voldemort. He doesn't even deny it when Lily accuses him of that.

I mean, he supposedly "loved" a muggleborn, but that didn't stop him from calling every other muggleborn a 'Mudblood', or from joining an organisation that aimed at the annhilation or enslavement of all muggleborns.

There are Three major types of Time Travel.

Fixed, Dynamic, and Alternate

In a Fixed timeline, You Can Not Change The Future. You can change the Past, but everything will still turn out the same. Kill Hitler and you become him, or someone else does what he did.

In a Dynamic timeline, every change that's made to the past effects the future, and a Paradox is Easy. Kill your dad before he meets your mom, and you're not born to kill your dad, so your dad lives to meet your mom, and you're born to kill your dad... That Is Why You Don't Mess With The Past, there's no way of knowing which it will be until you change something (or try too) to see.

However, in an Alternate timeline, you come from one timeline, go back and make a change, and now you're in another. So you can kill people with impunity (or atleast until you get arrested for murder).

X-x---

The Harry Potter Canon BEFORE Cursed Child is Dynamic, or atleast that's what everyone believes. The Cursed Child is Alternate, though, so Clearly They Do Not Take Place In The Same Universe. Unless it was Alternate all along, and nobody knew, anyways....

In /Cursed Child/, the reasoning is that they already know that if you change the past, the Butterfly Effect /absolutely will/ mess up the present, such that when you return them there's a fine chance that the love of your life will never have been born or something like that. Are you prepared to erase potentially millions of people from existence, even if the brave new world created through your actions is "better"?

That aside, the main justification I've seen in stories is that the timeline must be preserved /up to a point/ by the main character if they want to use their advantage; e.g. they know where Lord Voldemort will be at the end of the 1991-1992 school year, but not before that, so if they end up in 1989, they must lie low until the Mirror Confrontation to make sure that the Mirror Confrontation /does/ happen so that they /can/ use their foreknowledge effectively. If they risked the timeline by changing things early, Voldemort's plans might change to such an extent that the foreknowledge is no longer useful.

Because, within the /Harry Potter/ universe, we know that whatever people died in the original, normal timeline didn't "fully" die --- their bodies were destroyed and they ended up in the Afterlife. Whereas we have no confirmation that people erased from existence by time manipulation survive in /any/ form. So best not to risk it.

"The future is unwritten" is a significantly debatable statement in a world with Prophecies and stable-time-loops.

**** *Graham's number*

Graham's number is an immense number that arises as an upper bound on the answer of a problem in the mathematical field of Ramsey theory. It is named after mathematician Ronald Graham, who used the number as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the problem he was working on in conversations with popular science writer Martin Gardner. Gardner later described the number in Scientific American in 1977, introducing it to the general public. At the time of its introduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof.

Between Back to the Future and Star Trek, it wouldn't even occur to me that it would be a responsible characterization to change the timeline. "City on the edge of forever" from the original Star trek is a pretty formative experience for me. I've never written a time travel fanfic but I probably would have stuck to the trope just because that's the way my brain says is the correct way to do time travel. I'm not disagreeing with you-- your post is certainly food for thought. I just do want to defend writers from charges of laziness or fear of having an AU.

** Shitty writing.

That's all there is to it. I suppose there's quite a few methods of time-travel. Canon seems to imply the whole fixed point in reality such that any actions have already occurred. Multiverse theory is stupid, because someone could burn breakfast and change everything.

** I actually love "preserving the timeline" when it's done well. Unfortunately, it basically never is.

You can do it well, I think, under a few different frameworks, none of which are the near-sociopathy that is some sort of bloodless utilitarian calculus like you're describing.

First, you can do it under the "it's literally impossible" framework. That is, early in the story you have the time-traveler(s) attempt to change the timeline, only for some sort of intervention to stop them. This could make for some crack-y laughs as the sequence of events that stop them gets more and more outlandish. In a more serious sense, you could have some sort of "time cops" that will show up and FUCK SHIT UP if you try and "break time."

Second, you can do the "we actually /did/ intervene" framework. This is the one I most want to see done really well, but never have. The idea here being that you can explain a lot of the weirdness and "plot holes" in canon by saying something like "the original timeline was a fucking disaster of globally dystopian proportions, so we came back and we interfered and through our efforts, Voldemort was defeated at the impossibly early date of 1998, instead of 2153 like he did originally." This would be REALLY hard to weave around canon without changing it, and constructing some sort of mythos that makes it all make sense.

Third, you could do the "not really a time-traveler" framework (or more generally, the "doesn't want to" instead of the "can't"). Have the protagonist be a ghost, or someone with a way to view the past but not intervene, or a dimension-hopper who has seen so much shit and is so hardened to atrocities that something as minor as a couple of Longbottoms getting tortured doesn't even ping the sonar.

I'm sure there are many others I'm not thinking of off the top of my head.

It's like anything - it's ALL the execution. There's no such thing as bad premises, only bad executions.

** This annoys the heck out of me too. I came here to kvetch about The Debt of Time, but I see that's already been handled. Sheesh, if a writer wants Hermione, Sirius, and Remus to have a threeway, there's no need to create such a ridiculously contrived plot to make it happen.

I've seen something like it done well, where it's literally impossible to change the timeline no matter how much the protagonists try. Fred and George give it a try here, but wind up engineering the exact problems they tried to prevent:

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** It's valid if the character is planning to return to their future, so they don't return to something wildly different / so they have anything at all to return to (if the worst case is the total collapse of all existence.) It's a rough choice when the choice is to be with your wife and children again and let your parents die or vice versa.

But preserve the timeline fics hardly ever delve deep into scenarios like that. And they hardly ever acknowledge that it's almost impossible to do it in practicality.

** I think a lot of people already explained "why" fanfic authors do this, so I'll just give one example of why the hero of a story could try to protect the timeline.

Let's imagine the hero comes back in time at the end of 3rd year, when Pettigrew escape. During this night, the hero could maybe some Pettigrew escape, use him to (maybe) proove Sirius innocence, and then let Sirius become the official guardians for Harry and all his well.

But the hero is not sure it would work like this, Fudge already proved that he could ignore the law if he thought he had to, and nothing say that, if presented with Pettigrew by Black, he would not just decide to have them both Kissed and then make Pettigrew vanish rather than admit the Minister did a mistake. And even if he doesn't do this, there is still Voldemort problem. Nobody even know his location, except it's around Albania.

So another thing the Hero can do is let Pettigrew escape. Thanks to the previous timeline, he knows that Pettigrew will find Voldemort, and then return to Britain. It could then give him a golden ocasion to capture not only Pettigrew, but a weakened Voldemort. If he manage to capture Pettigrew, it also gives him time to plan how to reveal him so Fudge can't try to bury the story while Sirius is safe abroad.

​

That's pretty much the only time in canon where I think a hero could want to preserve the timeline. Except that is only works if the hero comes back in time this precise night (because if not, the hero has no excuse about why he did not capture Pettigrew the second he saw the rat, not to mention each day passed in the past is a day spent differently than the 1st time, risking to change the events every time), and the hero only does this for a month or so. After this he can go all out to try to end Voldemort.\\
Oh yeah and in this scenario the hero better be Harry or Dumbledore, or at the very least Ron, Hermione, or maybe Snape. Anyone else would lack the informations needed for this kind of plan.

** I agree with OP. One of the best fanfic's I've ever read is a my little pony [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/16358/my-choices-twisted-tales-through-time][one]]. The main character goes back in time and changes ALL the stuff. It's awesome and mysterious because you see the story develop from the past and changed future perspective. Sadly it was never finished.

** I still have this idea in my head where the Weasley twins travel back in time to the Marauders' time.

​

First they are not as emotionally connected to the characters and second it would be a reaction on death eaters traveling back in time to kill Harry's parents before they are born.

​

So while they want to preserve the timeline to have Harry around and have a fighting chance in the future, they have to protect the timeline from somebody else but themselves.

** The best way I've seen it used was in Six Pomegranate Seeds where the reason hermione goes back is because something/someone at Hogwarts destroys the fabric of time and space during the final battle so she has to keep things more or less the same so that it happens in the same time and place and she can stop it. But even then she changes lots of little things and prepares for the battle rather than just sitting around reliving things

When it's just about killing Voldemort or something then I don't see why they need to preserve the timeline unless it's a fic where they're absolutely following the ‘if we do it we'd remember it happening' rule from PoA, like I read one where the Dursley's killed Harry as a child and Dumbledore and Snape and probs others saw the body so when they time travelled to save him they created a realistic golem to trick their past selves then hid him until the time travel happened to maintain their history.

** What's up with this question? This is like the 5th time I've seen it in just a few months. It's a ridiculous question to begin with.

​

The first and most obvious reason for trying to maintain the original sequence of events is that so long as those events continue to happen as they did before, you have the advantage of knowledge.

​

The next is ethical. Sure, you can come back and change whatever you like, but the result of that is entirely unpredictable. Things will not occur as you want them to - that isn't how things works. Even though you lived these events once, you do not have anywhere near a full understanding of how things played out originally. You only have your own perspective of how things occurred. There were events and conversations and relationships that you did not experience the first time, and changing one thing that you did experience will almost certainty change 100 other events that you did not.

​

Your actions could make things better, or they could make them worse, and for many things you would never know if they turned out for better or for worse.

​

Whatever occurred the first time around, could be made much worse with a single mistake.

​

These characters often go back years. You have time to think things through. You have times to carefully weigh each and every action. Why rush? Why ruin your advantage from the get-go?

** To be fair, there is a good scenario where "Preserving the Timeline" is a good choice for MC. However, it's very specific and I can't think of any interesting stories that can be created from the premise, maybe that's why I haven't see any fanfiction that uses it.

The time travel must happen accidentally, the MC already has a happy future, and it's not Peggy Sue (MC time travel with his whole body, not only his memory).

For example, canon!Harry accidentally goes to 31 July 1991 from 2050 and already has a happy life with a wife, children, and grandchildren. Will he tried to stop Voldemort and risk the good life he already had? He already understand that his victory against Voldemort is mostly based on luck, what will happen if one thing changed and Little!Harry can't remove the horcrux without dying? It will destroy his future and his many grandchildren can't be born.

Of course there's the question of whether he's doing the right thing by letting hundreds of muggleborn suffers during 1997 only to safe his family, but remember that canon!Harry sends Remus back to Tonks instead of using Remus in the Horcrux Hunt or sending him to do some Order business.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7644616/1/Hallowed-Time-Twists][Hallowed Time Twists]] is really close to this premise and runs over MC's justification for preserving the timeline, but in the end they actually goes with 'fuck the timeline' anyway.

I think this is the reasoning behind the mentioned scene of CC. Harry already has a happy future, even if he has a complicated relationship with his son. However, if he stop James and Lily being murdered by Voldemort he can't control the future past that point, maybe Voldemort will take another chance at his life and ended up successful. He can't kill Voldemort at that point since he will be resurrected sooner or later and Harry doesn't have any time to hunt the Horcruxes.

I won't comment on the other time CC uses time travel though, it's a mess I won't bother with.

​

There's also the infamous 'awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time' from Hermione. I think this is the reason for preserving the timeline in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143][Turning of the Times]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13010260/1/The-Second-String][The Second String]]. I haven't read both past the first few chapters though, I have no idea how things finally turn out.
