I'm looking for good Harry and Katie Bell. I don't really want all three Chaser's but I will take them if they are good.


** Funnily enough I wrote a one shot with this pairing about two years ago. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12753828/1/Hard-As-A-Broom][Hard As A Broom]] and it is strictly a Harry Katie pairing, Angelina and Alicia are at home for this one.

I always wondered why Harry never experimented with any of the chasers it never really made sense to me. They were always there and the chemistry in a team environment is already pretty high, all it takes is one glance in the changing room to change the relationship from friendship to more.

Anyway if you like it let me know.

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.

  Looking back, Harry had to admit that he might have missed a cue or ten. But to be fair, some of them might have been a little unusual.
