There was this Hp/Marvel cross where Harry was an immortal!MOD time traveler when suddenly the universe gets combined with the Marvel Universe with the MCU movies also happening. I remember that he's an old man and that he loves it. He sometimes acts senile and crazy because it's fun.

  Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change time. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC

**** It has potential. I like the character interaction and the unique take on the MoD trope. The plot doesn't really start until chapter 3, and so far the story feels like it's laying groundwork before events pick up steam. I'd probably hold off on recommending it until the fic gets more chapters to feel substantial.
