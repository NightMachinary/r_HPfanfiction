**** No. Obviously this guy is more evil. It happens. We thought Batman was tough until we met his father's version in Flashpoint after all

** I've long thought the best duelists would be the ones who used simple, quick spells most of the time. Obviously some situations would call for something more advanced/specialized (like a Patronus against Dementors), but mostly... Why waste concentration and time on casting some complex spell when you can do the job with a simple stunner or body-bind or blasting spell? Especially since so much of Potter dueling seems to come down to reflexes, dodging, etc.

*** I read a Tom/Hermione fic once that did this really well - he weaponized household charms to use against enemies (e.g. scalding people with hot water from a dish scrubbing spell). Ministry doesn't track it and you have a decent amount of plausible deniability depending on the situation.

** He captures an Auror and tortures him with stinging and tickling hexes. Silently the Auror casts a Finite Incantatem on himself and while still pretending to be tortured he stuns the Dark Wizard and sends him to Azkaban.

** Sounds like Harry, Ron and Hermione grouping up together to come up with that because they have gone insane from Voldemort's aura or something
