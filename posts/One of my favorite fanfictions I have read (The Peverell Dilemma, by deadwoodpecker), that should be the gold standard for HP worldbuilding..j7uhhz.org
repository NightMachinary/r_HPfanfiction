The Peverell Dilemma, by deadwoodpecker, is one of the most interesting explorations of HP worldbuilding I have ever come across. I wanted to recommend it to the sub because the summary really doesn't tell readers what they are getting.

It's a post-war Hinny AU where a disillusioned Harry is trying to find a purpose in a corrupt and divided Wizarding World. To do so he joins an underground newspaper of which Ginny is a member dedicated to exposing the true nature of the Ministry and the WW as a whole to the public.

The fic explores a fleshed-out wizarding world that is seems larger, fuller and darker, but maintains a vibrancy that fits with the original world. It features magical creatures and smaller magical communities in a way that no other fic I have read can compete with and really makes the whole world of HP feel fresh. I never felt like the darker tones took away from the magic of the world or the story like other works can do, they were so well integrated into the story.

It is still ongoing (began Jan 2019, last updated Jun 5, 2020) and is currently just under 350,000 words.

The reason it came to mind is the new HP rpg in development and how this is the perfect fleshed out world I would dream to see in a HP videogame.

I really just wanted to talk about this one, for me it only can be compared with Northumbrian's work and the Changeling series in overall quality and the worldbuilding with noahphantom's Albus Potter series (though AP certainly had more/broader development I feel this one has more bang for its buck).

Anyone who reads this, feel free to give recommendations of other great examples of HP worldbuilding, I think that has become one of my favorite parts of HP fanfiction recently.

Wow. That might be one of the least useful summaries I've ever seen. I know I've scrolled by it a dozen times because I assumed it was just slow burn romance fluff that I wasn't particularly interested in.

*** Thats part of why I wrote this. Spent like 25 minutes trying to find it again yesterday nad the summary did not help. The other part is that it is just so good.

*** I opened it like two days ago with about 60 other tabs (which then were closed since 60 open tabs was killing my computer) but didn't get into it. I will now though.

** Does the pairing play a big part? Bc, I really dislike Hinny but the fic seems interesting!

*** It plays a significant role in the plot >! They are reporting partners of a sort!< but I felt like it was very natural and the relationship was likeable. But I also have no issue with the pairing so your take might be different.

That said, the changes the author made overall really change the way the relationship works compared to Canon (Ginny is several years younger than the trio). Both Ginny and Harry are adults and Ginny is more knowledgeable and experienced than Harry in the professional setting, so there isn't the shy crush of the early books. Really the characters are what they come out of the series being (mature and capable rather than awkward and teenager-ish) so the entire relationship structure changes and is very consumable. I would say go for it, cause there is some build up to the pairing and you might get invested in the other parts of the story. Worst case you just drop it and move on to your next fic.

**** Yeah...well, that doesn't really make her Ginny I suppose. Although it sounds more like an OC, I don't think I can handle it haha\\
Idk, maybe I'll give it a try, I'll see\\
Thanks anyway! I wish there were other interesting stories with similar themes like this one.
