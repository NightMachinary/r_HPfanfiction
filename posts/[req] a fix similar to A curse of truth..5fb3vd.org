Self explanatory, an oc or self insert or time traveller who shakes things up. Witty banter and fluff and emotional pull and tragedy is appreciated. Slash is tolerated as long as Snape, harry and Draco aren't involved.

Any decent Luna / oc or harry pairings are also much appreciated.


** There are not that many self insert fics out there, and even fewer good ones or completed ones, unfortunately. Time travelers, absolutely, but they tend to be characters already in-universe for the most part.

With that said, here are a few:\\
linkffn(Magical Me by Publicola)\\
linkao3(Faith and the Devil)

Those two I've personally read, neither are complete but the Gilderoy Lockhart one is quite long and pretty darn good, and Faith and the Devil is very entertaining and still actively updating, even if nothing much has happened as far as plot.

These next two are recommended a lot, I've read them both but for some reason wasn't really fond of either. Don't let that throw you off though, I tend to value character development and good writing over plot and my standard for funny quips is probably too high compared to a lot of people's.\\
linkffn(In Bad Faith)\\
linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

And the rest I haven't read:\\
linkffa(1754)\\
linkffn(10721004)\\
linkffn(Nobody Told Me the Rules)\\
linkffn(The Reader by Frodo'sPen)\\

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
