I love HP fanfiction,now that I may die in 3 days ,I'm asking you guys to recommend me some fics that I should read just in case I die so rec me some fics that you should read before you die


** Sorry to hear about your situation, I had to go through the same thing twice in my 20s. Got a wicked chest scar and a robot heart (well mechanical heart valve) to show for it now though. What your going through right now is bloody scary, but remember that the surgical team know what they're doing and will do their best for you. You have my best wishes and hopes for a successful operation and easy recovery.

Some fics for you: The Kyle Side, a favourite hp/star wars (EU aka pre-disney canon) cross [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/0]]

Ice Cream, light hearted Haphne short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/0]]

Stages of Hope, warning that this one is dark, but not completely. May make you cry [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/32/107]]

**** Yep, twice over. First operation/replacement was using a biological valve unfortunately it degenerated fairly rapidly, had some fairly bad luck there. Second was when they put in the mechanical vale.

Now just have to deal with some externally audible ticking like an off-tempo watch, but I'm all good these days.

**** A few short ones to start with. Most of these are fairly in character and older fics:

- linkffn(The Thinking Cap by Andrea13)
- Angie Astravic was one of my favourite writers. She wrote mostly during 2000 so her stuff was fairly in character considering book 5 hadn't come out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9000/Angie-Astravic]]
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer)
- linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday)

If you do get stuck in recovery I recommend some longer fics:

- linkffn(A Second Chance at Life) and it's sequels linkffn(Changes in a Time of War) and linkffn(A Magical World) even though the latter isn't finished.
- linkffn(Harry Crow)
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny)
- linkffn(Passageways)

** I'm not sure if any of those were already recommended, but those are my favourite HP fanfictions, ranging from Crack to Angst or simply those with insanely good plots/plot ideas:

1. No Competition by Evilgoddss

Summary:

What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/No-Competition]]

1. Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort by Kevin3

Summary:

A tale of illusion and deception - what better bedtime story could a magician tell his son than when he managed to pull one over on the entire wizarding world?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10129276/1/Dangerous-and-Deadly-Lord-Voldemort]]

1. Harry's Wand Gets Around by Kevin3

Summary:

Harry's Wand just can't seem to make up its mind on who it belongs to... resulting in a world where Gilderoy Lockhart stops Pomona Sprout from ruining Albus Dumbledore's chances of killing Lord Voldemort. Humor one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10733615/1/Harry-s-Wand-Gets-Around]]

1. The Prisoner's Cipher by Ecthelion3

Summary:

AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher]]

1. dead things by EclipseWing

Summary:

Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice. Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]]

1. Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One

Summary:

When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel]]

1. Wind Shear by Chilord

Summary:

A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]]

1. Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19

Summary:

He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]]

1. October by The Carnivorous Muffin

Summary:

It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

1. Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama

Summary:

Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort. VII Ch.8 In which someone is dead, wounded, or kidnapped in every scene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

1. The Pureblood Pretense (+ Sequels) by murkybluematter

Summary:

Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

1. Heir Apparent by MonsieurClavier

Summary:

When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous---and hilarious---assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best.

A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one.

“You are mine,” Voldemort said gently, and smiled when Harry flinched. So the boy did know Voldemort, after all. He knew Voldemort was to be feared. “I will look after you, my own.”

“I don't belong to you,” Harry spat, despite his fear. Oh, what a delight he was! He was no cowering, simpering sycophant, like Voldemort's other followers; no, this child had a spine of steel. Not many could stand before Voldemort without quailing.

“You are my son,” Voldemort declared. “Of course you belong to me. Your every cell, your every fibre, your every heartbeat. You are mine in flesh and blood and soul. You are mine in magic. And you will not deny me.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25010857/chapters/60562639]]

1. The Untouchable by TreacleTeacups

Summary:

When he's little, Harry discovers something Very Special: he can make his wishes come true. Literally. Cue the chaos.

In which a young boy discovers a way to slide under the radar and the profound consequences that follow. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable?

Tone changes from childish to mature as Harry ages. Rated M for a lack of moral conscience, the occasional murder, and a graphic dark theme here and there (because why not?). Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14371158/chapters/33178122]]

1. The Spellmaker by SonnyGietzel

Summary:

Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick.

Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be.

All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386]]

1. Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB

Summary:

Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** As someone who has had several surgeries in the last year I recommend you look up some fics that have been read out loud. Meds make reading hard the first few days. I believe they are called podfics.

Also recommend the 'stuff you should know' podcast. Years of content that is interesting but not presented in a way that will interrupt sleep with loud noises if you drop off.

*** The Changeling is amazing and is almost as satisfying as reading the original series. I particularly appreciated its focus on Slytherin as something other than just an incubator for Death Eaters, plus the story continues after Voldy's downfall and explores the first few years afterwards as everyone grapples with PTSD.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.

Summary: Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. This fic covers years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Ok, so, this likely isn't your type of story, but it is my favourite piece of writing ever. It's just the right amount of crack and seriousness, sexual tension, and (oblivious) pining. How that's possible I have no idea.

But anyway, it's tomarry. 17-year-old Harry (he's of age, by wizard standards, don't worry) time travels to about 1963, I think. Voldemort is 37. Voldemort thinks Harry is his son. (Black hair and a parselmouth, sooo) Harry goes along with it.

Now, Voldemort really seems to adore Harry. Like, blind adoration. Spoiler alert, but he just looks on fondly as Harry declares he will pull apart Voldemort's regime until they aren't blood purists anymore or something like that. It's adorable.

Also, this is all in Voldemort's point of view, which is strange in tomarry fics. So we see bi!disaster Harry getting flustered as fuck because Voldemort is a little too touchy-feely. And Voldemort is a demisexual!disaster that doesn't understand why his stomach flutters in Harry's presence all the time.

It's adorable. They clearly like each other and Harry is still obviously light. And Harry gets pulled in during the horcrux hunt, but he has no idea what he is.

The whole story is amazing. The writing, the plot, the characters. I can barely describe it. Please give it a read. Here's the link:

Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

This one is really good, short but good. Harry is somewhat op, but the focus of the story is on him being a nice big bro. The end is also quite satisfying, the way he deals with Voldy.

Ps: In advance, I wish you an easy recovery!

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]]

WIP, but 131 chapters in (3 mil words) Very long, dark, with gore at parts. Basically, Ron can see the future and and it fuck his life up. Badly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]

In a post epilogue world, Harry Potter is head auror and executioner for the ministry, and Ron Weasley is the minister of magic. Both of them are also divorced from their wives. What happens when these two find themselves in their fourth year bodies?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/The-Resistance-of-Azkaban]]

It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]]

Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

I've seen a lot of people think that Harry is too OOC in this, but if you don't mind OOCness too much, you'll love it.

** Damn bro that really sucks. Best I can think of on the fly is 'Bound With Silver Threads', but it's kinda long. I can only read long fics. Main character is Lily Luna Potter, set in her 3rd to 7th year and a little bit beyond. Multiple pairings but Lily/OFC is the main one, OFC is Draco's daughter (Scorpius' sister).

Actually there's also 'Grow Young With' me, I don't remember all the details but I remember it being a really nice fic about adult Harry meeting a muggle woman and them getting together after some time, very fluffy plot.

** Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about what you're going through, I can hardly imagine how you feel. I would recommend 'The Dark Roses' by Herald_of_Dreams on AO3, it's an amazing fic with a not-all-that-bad-Dark-side-of-the-War, and a Dark!Harry, James, Regulus, Sirius and Remus. It's amazing, and I've read it so many times!

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/775472/chapters/1458678]]

I genuinely hope that you get better, and will live to read many, many more fanfictions.

** I too love fanfics, here you go:

This series is complete, and is one of my favorites. Hope that it is your cup of tea. It's also on AO3. Warning, the first few chapters are quite depressing, but it gets better.

Alexander Dantes - linkffn(13497859) and its sequel The Riddle Coins - linkffn(13557024)

These are ongoing/incomplete, but I like them all the same:

Harry Potter and the Artificer Legacy - linkffn(13435630) - This one is feel good fic, Harry is focused on enchanting.

Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer- linkffn(7866134) - Harry Potter discovers the secret of magic after Ron does a prank.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament - linkffn(13140418) - Harry Potter learns the power of rituals.

Spells in Silence - linkffn(13510736) - Fem!Harry learns magic on her own before hogwarts, and breaks wizarding rules left and right. It is quite well-written.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]] - It is one of the top fics of mine that I want to see get completed, but one can only wish.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386][The Spellmaker]] - Sporadically updated, Harry Potter discovers the power of Latin. Hope to see it get completed.

Best of luck for your upcoming surgery!

Edit: linkffn(13710451) - The Slow and Silent Ways of Fish. Complete AU. But it is captivating.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

** The Seventh Horcrux is a funny Harry Potter fanfic with the idea of the Horcrux basically causing Harry to be Voldemort, but follow roughly the same path as canon.

I just checked and it's longer than I remember it being, though, so I can't say it's short like I thought it was.

** Good luck on surgery.

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) It is the best HP & Firefly crossover, also best outer space & "Earth that was" story, and I've not really found anything better than it. I reread it so many times and it's tops.

Linkffn(The Girl Who Loved) It's like a straight crack fic, disturbing, hilarious, and a crossover between Ranma 1/2, Sailor Moon and Harry Potter. It had me gut laughing out loud and I've reread it tons of times too. The sequel, linkffn(Violence Inherent in the System) is an equally fantastic read that comes to a satisfying conclusion.

Linkffn(Harry the lazy Hufflepuff) It's short, with sequels, and I find it really entertaining. In summary, Harry hears 'lazy' growing up and it shapes his personality. He's not ambitious, not really brave, not very studious, but Helga said she'd 'take the rest' so to Hufflepuff he goes. He goes to lengths to learn to avoid hard work so it's more than a little hilarious.

Linkffn(Almost a Squib) They almost succeed at "beating it out of him", but he's still a prophecied hero and this fic shows a really cunning Harry meeting his destiny. It was really enjoyable, and a decent shorter length.

Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) Not all of Harry died that night, not all of James died that night. Lily did something to preserve her two most important people in her life. Features a really interesting TriWizard tournament and the Sorting Hat, with a potty mouth and who's been on probation for years for mentally scarring a child.

** I hope your surgery goes well.\\
These are some of my favourites:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans by dirgewithoutmusic]] - What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?\\
Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).\\
Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.\\
(An amazing look at what Harry's life could have been had Petunia chosen to love him instead.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18505909][they'll turn out to be heroes by Nicnac]] - Placed with the Dursleys Harry will be safe, but Dumbledore would still like to have someone nearby to keep an eye on him. Someone mild and unassuming and unlikely to upset the Dursleys. Really, there's only one good choice. (Rather than Mrs Fig, Remus is assigned to watch Harry.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14787410][east, west, home's best by taizi]] - You can never have too many brothers, Ron decides, for the very first time in his life. And there's always room in the Burrow for another Weasley, even if only an honorary one.\\
(I also recommend Best Served Cold by enchanted sleeper, which was inspired by and is a follow up to the above fic, and is therefore linked at the bottom of the page.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4608288/chapters/10502271][Proud by WinterLeighEnd]] - Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.\\
(An interesting take on what Vernon and Harry's relationship could have been without all the History that Petunia brought into the picture.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8136625][Deepest Fear Revealed: one-shot version by Potterworm]] - After Harry's boggart appears as his Uncle Vernon, Professor Lupin takes him for a chat with Headmaster Dumbledore, and then everything changes. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22624558][The Girl Who Thrived by imaginary_golux]] - Voldemort didn't think a girl could be his downfall. Harriet Jane Potter begs to differ.\\
(A look at what might have happened, had Harry been born a girl.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7811107][you'll go the same way by LullabyKnell]] - Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the /other/ side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... /Family First/, after all.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other by dirgewithoutmusic]] - When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.\\
This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.\\
When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated.\\
And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18468001][And the Unethical Binding Contract by justafandomfollower]] - AU. What if the Triwizard Tournament took place in Harry's first year, not his fourth? (Author's note: Basically, it's an AU if the tournament happened Harry's first year, but the other champions were the same (and still 17). There were a lot of different ways to interpret that kind of AU - Quirrell vs. Moody!Crouch, Wormtail - so I hope you don't mind the way I did it. I wanted a happy(ish) ending.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24500287/chapters/59141077][who discovered your secret by LullabyKnell]] - *Pre-Canon AU*: On the street named Privet Drive, in Little Whinging, Surrey, a man lived alone at Number Eight, supposedly.\\
It was apparently difficult to tell. (A Regulus Black lives AU)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23636302][Parents' Evening by bikelock28]] - Petunia Dursley attends her son's parents' evening. Unfortunately, his teacher wants to discuss Petunia's nephew. (Set before the beginning of the first book, this is an interesting look at the justifications Petunia gives herself for her treatment of Harry.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23168287][disguised as something else by aloneintherain]] - “I used to sleep there,” Harry snaps.\\
He's breathing hard. He feels like he's run a marathon, even though he's just sitting there uselessly, staring at a perfectly ordinary cupboard.\\
“What?” Sirius says. ( Set in a fix-it AU where the war ends early (though definitely still happens), and Sirius and Remus make it out alive and manage to gain custody of Harry, this fic looks at the aftereffects of the trauma Harry sustained while living at the Dursley's.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4993657][Welcome Home (under orphan_account)]] - After escaping Azkaban, Sirius goes to find his godson. (A Sirius puts Harry first for once fic.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15068012/chapters/34933661][The Child of Azkaban by LonelyHarvest]] - Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them.\\
...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths. (A very AU, extremely well written and highly enjoyable novel length fic. It is part of an ongoing series, but the first fic is complete and very worth the read.)

** Hey, I hope your surgery went well! I hope you enjoy these in your recovery. I recommended a ton [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/js05k9/fic_recommends/][here]], but there are frankly a lot there, so I'll just post the ones here that I have reread at least once.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.

2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.

   Here are the rest, unranked. Again, I have reread each of them and recommend them.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks. This is in a series of oneshots and I recommend all of them.

#+begin_quote
  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. #1 recommended fic on this sub. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
