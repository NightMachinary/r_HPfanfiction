I'm looking for an abandoned fic that I read a while ago, though it's possible it may have been two fics I'm combining in my head.

Harry and Luna were meeting each other in their dreams as children an Luna seemed to know that her friend Harry was coming to see her soon. The Dursleys decided that they had enough of Harry (who was like six) and took him for a drive before drugging him and abandoning him in the woods, where he was found by Luna and her mother (Xeno having died instead of her)

Harry and Luna grow up together before Harry finds out that Luna is part Fae. When they go to Hogwarts they meet others like Daphne and Neville. Harry is discovered to be some sort of changeling that can mimic the magic of other creatures like Luna. His return to the wizard of world starts the renewal of creature blood in people who Harry gathers together. Neville and Daphne are part High Elf and I think Ron is part Leprechaun. They all meet up on the train and someone draws a picture that shows them all in their true forms which they had kept secret.

Any idea what fic or fics this might be?


** Did you ever find it? I'd be interested in reading that.
