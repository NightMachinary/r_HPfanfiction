** It's second year.

Harry's belting out 'Defying Gravity' while Daphne is in the other room singing 'Let it Go.'

Hermione's had her Polyjuice Potion accident and is singing 'Memory' from Cats.

Ron's nicked a Numbus 2001, and favorably evaluating it to the tune of 'Greased Lightnin'.'

Pansy is defending Slytherin from suspicion by singing 'Everyone's a Little Bit Racist.' Malfoy in the background is thinking about how much influence Harry has amassed, singing 'Wait For It.'

Colin Creevey is trying to convince people he knows Harry Potter and singing along to 'Sincerely Me.'

Ginny and Riddle are singing 'The Phantom of the Opera.'

Luna's pretty fed up with her bullies, and comes up with 'This Is Me' on the spot.

Sirius, still in Azkaban is thinking about Pettigrew, singing 'Hell to Your Doorstep.'

Dumbledore is looking over his pictures of Grindelwald, singing 'I Dreamed a Dream' to himself.

Then Riddle kicks in the door and challenges Harry to a rock-off, to the tune of 'Beelzeboss.'

*** How does an underaged group of seekers, chasers and beaters

Somehow defeat a mass of death eaters?

How do they emerge courageous from the secret room ?

Leave the battlefield to fight Dementors and gloom?

​

Oi, turns out they have a secret weapon

A herbologist you know and love who is scared as hell to step in

He's over being terrified, hiding from Voldemort's Death Corps

Everyone give it up for Hogwart's favourite fighting Gryffindor!

**** Good lord I never new I needed an Orky Harry.

The entire “shit works cause they believe it does” would be hilarious applied to Harry. His “wand” is just a tree branch with flames painted on it. The Invisibilty Cloak is just a bedsheet. Voldemort tries using Legilimency on him and gets a full blast of WAAAAAAAAAAGH! Dumbledore having to constantly stop him from “improving” things by painting it red/adding flames/skulls.

Hell, isn't that basically magic all the time? I'm not entirely sure wizards aren't all orks anyway.

I can see it now, (or not) Harry under his purple bedsheet Invisibility Cloke (you never see a purple ork, they's being too sneeky) a flaming branch-wand with a skull endcap in one hand, a tricked-out Choppa of Gryffindor in the other.
