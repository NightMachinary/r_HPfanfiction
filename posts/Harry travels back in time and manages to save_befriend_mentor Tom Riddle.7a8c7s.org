** Almost every Harry time travel to Tom's era ends up with Harry befriending/raising/shagging him, such as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]], linkffn(3155057).

The one time he was really trying to kill Tom, Dumbledore showed up to derail his plan, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/][Realignment]], linkffn(12331839).

I would greatly appreciate if someone can LF a decent fic that has Harry (not Hermione) successfully killing Tom.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
