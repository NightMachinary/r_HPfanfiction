A friend and I have been discussing Patronuses in relation to something they're writing, and I'm curious what you all think.

Let's say we have two Patronus casting people. Person A casts a rabbit, person B casts a crocodile. Person A and person B then, through some magical means, swap bodies. They then each cast a Patronus. Which form does each take?

Basically, my friend is trying to find a way to have person A cast the Patronus of person B without further magical interference. But we're not sure how/if it would work, because producing one is meant to be drawing on an inner reserve. Also, Harry thought he saw Dumbledore's phoenix leaving flying away during his funeral, but it's unclear if this was correct or not:

#+begin_quote
  White smoke spiralled into the air and /made strange shapes/: Harry thought, for one heartstopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.
#+end_quote

/But/ he'd been dead for a while already. His soul had moved on. This was purely the burning of his body.

What do you all think? Is the Patronus linked more to body or soul?


** I am pretty sure that, in canon, Patronus are linked to the soul. Patronus take a form that has a meaning for the caster, something strong (and probably safe).

Dumbledore's patronus is a phoenix (and probably even Fawkes), Harry's is a representation of his father, Snapes is a doe (because it was Lily's, or because he knew that James is a deer and she was his wife, no idea), and Tonks in a wolf (or a werewold, for Lupin).\\
We also know that Patronus can change (as with Tonk, we don't know what was her first form, but it was not a wolf).

So, in case a person A swap body with a person B, I believe the patronus would either be form A, or a form C because swapping body influenced him enough to change his form. But I see no reason why his patronus should take form B.

*** I believe Tonks' original Patronus was a jackrabbit. Lily apparently always had a doe, because they were "made for each other". Bleh.

And yes, that's pretty much my thinking as well. - Though I'm not sure any description specifically says soul, hence the question. Patronuses also defend against other things that don't consume souls. Still, they may have to have something else influence the form.

** In my headcanon, the Patronus (and Fidelius, AK) charms are unique in interacting directly with the soul. A bodyswapped person keeps his original animal guardian (and Secret Keeper position).

If your Patronus is inherited from a loved one, their soul has imprinted on you to the point where even their death doesn't fully remove them from the living realm. This is why the Resurrection Stone "ghosts" was aware of what was going on with Harry; James could watch over him from the other side whenever he wished.

** I'm pretty sure that the Phoenix in the excerpt is referring to Fawkes, and not Dumbledore's patronus, flying into the pyre, and not away from it. I could be incredibly wrong though. I haven't read the books in quite some time now.

*** I think Fawkes leaves at another time? Circles, cries and flies off? I'm pretty sure they knew it was him when it happened.

**** I'll have to reread the chapter when I'm off work later to be sure. Again, I'm working on a decade or so old memory.

I also just realized I didnt even answer your question. I feel that since a patronus is based on your personality and behavior, simply switching bodies would change what the patronus would be. So after the switch, Person A, in the body of Person B, would still produce whatever Person A's patronus was before the switch.
