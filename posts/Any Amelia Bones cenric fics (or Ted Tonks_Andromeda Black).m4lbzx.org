Like her as a cop dealing with wizards constantly breaking the statute or just her in gerneral. Also (long shot here) looking for any Ted Tonks/Andromeda Black stuff out there cause that is a cool 'forbidden love' type deal.

Im sorta in a mood of fics about the old farts of the wizarding world...


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]] is a great Amelia Bones centric fic, also very popular here

**** I will say that I tried to read that one and eventually got tired of the characters just...not talking like actual humans. Like if a 15 yo kid has had zero therapy and lots of trauma, they aren't going to meet a stranger and suddenly spout out exactly why a certain behavior made them feel XYZ. Then the other characters very robotically answer, "Oh, I didn't know that. I will completely change all of my behavior! Thank you!"

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.
