I know it's a vague title but I read that fic about 6 years ago and have forgotten most if it.

No, it's not that fic where Harry is sent to an AU where witches are dominant and everyone has swapped genders except Luna, I know about that fic already.

This fic already starts in this world. I do have a vague memory about Harry travelling to a different school and turning down some sort of marriage proposal from a popular girl there.

If anyone can help me out I would be eternally grateful!

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Well... it's not the one you were talking about because I only started writing this last year, but... I'm writing one. It's called "Holly Potter and the Witching World" and takes place in an AU where 90% of the magical population is female. linkao3(12861492)

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
