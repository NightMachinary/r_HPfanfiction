Its about Harry and Hermoine, they die ( i think they were betrayed) anyways they meet death and go back in time to the maurauders era, and Hermoine ends up as Sirius Black, i can't remember who harry is. Theres a thing about compulsion webs and Hermoine/Sirius does a fake ritual so the blacks think the compulsion net went away and thats why Sirius is acting more like himself again.


** Lol Hermione is Sirius? I really want to see this let me know if you find it

*** I found it, its called Black Phoenix, by Sarah Blake on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Its incomplete though, hasn't been updated since 2012, probably why i couldn't find it easily.
