Title pretty much says it all, H/F that doesn't have anything to do with harry's fourth year and/or the triwizard tournament.

decent writing is a must and i prefer the fic to focus more on the relationship. smut is nice but it isn't completely necessary. no time/dimension travels and harems, i want the relationship to be solely monogamous.

Oh and i think it's best to say that i've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]]


** I'm casually working on linkffn(12048876). It starts the summer after GoF with heavy HP/FD. I've been at the beach though, so I haven't had a chance to really write for it yet.
