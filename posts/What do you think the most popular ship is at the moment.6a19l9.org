I don't like slash, just isn't my cup of tea, but it still weirds me out that the favourite pairings always seem involve people that should by all accounts hate each other.

I get that redeeming people with a good hard dicking seems to be a common plot line and all but I would assume things like Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville would be as common.

Hell its not even restricted to the HP fandom lots of other favourite slash pairings seem to involve mortal enemies giving it to each other.

Those three ships in question... someone else said it as good as I could. You have to go absolutely out-of-character to even write a story with those pairs. Harry and Hermione loathe Draco and Snape. There is absolutely no plausible way they would consider those two as romantic partners... even if Harry was attracted to men... when he isn't.

***** Exactly, they are either seriously OOC (so whats the point in them being named characters, and not just original characters), or its a third party forcing them together (Marriage law, stuck in a room together, head girl head boy in the same dorm). or there could be completely arbitrary concepts (like veela draco with hermione as his mate).

The problem is that Draco is a terrible person, and to have him in character removes any chance of him being with hermione. He literally called her the magical equivalent of the n word. Draco is repulsed by the very idea of hermione, and would happily see her die cause that's his beliefs.

One could argue that he turns around in the seventh book, but I don't see that being good enough to warrant a romantic interest.

****** I could imagine Draco redemption arcs post-DH that ignore the epilogue, just haven't seen any that were super convincing. It would make sense to me that Draco could lose all respect for his father after DH, leading to him re-evaluating his world-views. Hermione would be a big enough person to give him a chance is he makes a real genuine effort to right his wrongs.

The main problem with such stories is that authors that write them are already in love with the character and don't really see their flaws or any need to truly redeem them. Similarly I have a subjective/personal problem with most H/G fics, because they already assume I understand their eternal love, while instead I'd need to be convinced that they are right for each other.

"A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy" is kinda a step in that direction in regards to Dramione, but it's still not really convincing (Draco is immediately a super likeable guy). At least it sorta acknowledges that Draco used to be a bigot and abandoned that lifestyle. Kinda depressing that even such a token effort is so rare for Draco-centric fics.

****** I'm ambivalent towards Drarry, but I do dislike Dramione. I also think it goes against Hermione's character to associate with Draco - while Harry is Down To Fight, Hermione (who has no problems with confronting peers), wants to stay as far away from Draco's business as humanly possible. I also don't like the trope of Female Character Feels Obligated To Redeem Male Character Who Is Awful Towards Her (unrelated, but this is how people misinterpret /Beauty and the Beast/; Belle only warms up to the Beast once he stops being awful).

I like redemption stories, but they often gloss over the character's flaws. I think I would like Drarry more if I found a Draco portrayal I entirely agreed with - the character's wizard racist (and that needs to be addressed, especially since Hermione is so important to Harry), cowardly (please tell me why so many people headcanon him as an Auror with zero explanation), and a Human Trainwreck.

They brand him with the cliche of "misunderstood antagonist" and while the ideas he spewed weren't originally his own, that doesn't mean he didn't share them. And while I don't hate Draco, people always put him with people he hates and has made their lives hell. He screwed with Harry every chance he got, always acted superior to Ron (and conversely Ginny), and and was openly racist to Hermione.

**** This is a weak argument. One could say the same about Daniel Radcliffe. He's handsome--he'll, so is most of the cast, and if people relate to Hermione so well, one could ask why there isn't more fanfic of them? Or Bill and Fleur, if they're so attractive and relatable? It has more to do with the characters than the actor's looks.

Personally, I'm a fan of Dramione because I enjoy the challenge of writing these two opposing characters and finding a way to breach the gap between them. I like coming up with ways that Draco might turn into a more sympathetic or good character and band with the good side. I think he is a very complex character that we didn't get to see much of so I like wading into those waters and seeing what I can do there, and I think it's insulting and trivializing when someone sweeps all that aside by just assuming we do it because we think the actors are hot. This is the number one accusation I see every time Dramione is mentioned. Even if that were the case, it's just as much a valid reason to write fic because it doesn't happen exclusively to this ship and we all know it.

Let's not continue to trivialize a pairing just because you don't agree with it or even like it. I'm mostly silent in this sub because I feel like my opinion isn't valid since there seems to be such a problem with pairings that go against the collective hive mind here.

****** And there's nothing wrong with that. Young people will form attachments to characters and view the actors or characters themselves as role models or inspirations. It's just the way it goes. Not everyone is writing fan fiction for the purpose of writing great literature. This happens to just about every single fiction character, too, so I don't understand why girls relating to Hermione is such a bad thing. Lots of writers compare or write self inserts of them as Harry, and there's a ton of those harem fics going around, yet they're fairly well liked around here.

I know the leather pants thing is a popular stereotype but I rarely see those kinds of fics anymore. Each pairing is going to have their own tropes. In my case, I think they can be well utilized if it has a good purpose and it relevant to the story. If not, I move on.

Lumping the fans of this pairing into a clump of "young girls" is a little unnecessary. There's going to be that age demographic in any fanfiction community, and whether they are good writers or not shouldn't matter if they're doing something they like, and developing skills. I know plenty of mature authors who write some of the best fics, but that doesn't mean younger authors don't write well, either. I started writing fanfic when I was sixteen and I wasn't very good, but I did it because I wanted to explore the characters and the world more than the books did, and if I thought the actors were hot shouldn't matter because in the end I wrote stories that I was proud of and that others liked. I'm twenty-three now and I like to think I've gotten much better and I get a lot of comments and questions from younger users asking for writing advice, and how better to write believable characters etc., and I find that really great and I wouldn't turn them down because of their age. If they have an interest in advancing their skills and becoming better writers then I'm happy to help.
