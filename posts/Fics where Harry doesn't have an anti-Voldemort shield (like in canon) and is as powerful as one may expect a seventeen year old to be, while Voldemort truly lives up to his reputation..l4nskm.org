Basically I'm looking for fics where Harry is neither overpowered, nor the luckiest boy alive and Voldemort doesn't throw all logic out the door when it comes to hunting down Harry. Also in order to escape a Voldemort that truly lives up to his reputation, Harry has to rely on a stroke of luck, quick thinking on his feet and help from others.

Harry has a savepoint-type resurrection ability where he goes back in time to a certain point after he dies. And he dies a lot...

** Hmm...

Dumbledore would probably be a lot more proactive in that case

** In a world where Harry has no plot armour, he's completely fucked. He's probably gonna get cursed in the back and thrown off the Astronomy Tower by some Death Eater's spawn within his first week at Hogwarts.

** [[http://www.hpmor.com][www.hpmor.com]] HPMOR's Voldemort is the best I think I've ever read. Not entirely canon accurate, but still very enjoyable.
