Hey, so I'm looking for Drinny or Harmione fics with the other ship as a side ship. I'd prefer no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing because I love them. Long fics would be appreciated, finished or regularly updated ones. Please leave your favorites.

Goyle plays a lethal joke on Harry that Draco saves him from as a result of being turned good by Ginny.
