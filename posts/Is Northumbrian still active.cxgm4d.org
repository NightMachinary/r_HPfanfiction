It has been almost exactly a year since Strangers at Drakeshaugh has been finished. Since then there hasn't been any new update.

On their profile is a link to some original fiction on WordPress, but that hasn't updated in 6 months either.

Does anyone have more information?


** On his profile (Northumbrian is a guy), where? There doesn't seem to be anything on FF.net.

*** Oh, you mean FictionPress? Yes, [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3328948]] makes me sceptical that James and Me will be ever finished. Sob sob. I have been dreaming about the large legal battle in Wizengamot as a finale. Oh well.
