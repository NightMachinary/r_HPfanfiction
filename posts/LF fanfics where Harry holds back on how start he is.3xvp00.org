EDIT: I read the first chapter. It's extremely well realized and I will continue to read it although the premise is not very interesting.

EDIT 2: Second chapter done. This is /very/ fucking good.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** I really don't like a lot of things about that fic. I'm gonna copypaste my rant from the last time I saw it:

#+begin_quote
  First off, before I start ranting, I'd like to say that I actually enjoyed it as a break from fics with actual conflict. I'd also like to say that despite how much I dislike the flanderization of some characters (like Hermione), the story has relatively few grammatical errors and it's dialogue is actually quite good most of the time which is an area that a lot of stories are quite lacking.

  HOLY SHIT I hate that one just for the way it goes about its fucking premise. It has the whole goddam wizarding world go "Oh, hey, you know what I'll do today? I think I'll let a column from the Wizarding Worlds equivalent of [[/r/conspiracy]] shape my opinions because I, being an inferior British sheeple have never thought about them before." I mean seriously, /nobody/ even thought to compare scores from Hogwarts to schools abroad?! What the actual fuck? I don't know about what you think, but I'm pretty sure that the parents of actual Lords wouldn't be stupid enough to funnel their children through a expensive death trap without at least doing some fucking research into alternatives.

  AND THEN there's that weird shit where suddenly EVERYONE is reading the Quibbler just because of how edgy this one writer is and EVERYONE knows this guy's handle and EVERYONE is suddenly questioning EVERYTHING the ministry has told them because obviously, being the magical sheep they are they've never thought to question ANYTHING the ministry has told them about their precious school.

  Oh, and as a side note, I hate that stupid fucking practice of appending the names of every fucking house that anyone happens to accrue onto the end of their last names. If they actually followed that practice pretty much everyone would be Lord Percival-Potter-Malfoy-Greengrass-Hufflepuff-Weasley-Macnair-Pettigrew-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Dumbledore-Prewett-Gaunt-Lestrange-Black-Ravenclaw ^{^{^{so}}} ^{^{^{mote}}} ^{^{^{it}}} ^{^{^{be}}} just because of how bloody inbred they all are.
