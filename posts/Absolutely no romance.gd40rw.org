I'd love to see any interesting Harry Potter fanfics with NO romance between the main characters - established things like Lily and James or Tonks and Remus in the background is fine, but nothing that actually matters to the story. Over 100k if possible, but if it's really good but short I'd like to hear about it too. Thanks!


** I just have an aversion to badly written fanfic romance, so this is something I've spent some time looking for as well. Any sort of first year AU is probably good for you here. But this category fits a bunch of my top-10 fics.

The first couple books of linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) have no romance.

I'd recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) - the premise makes it hard to do romance here, considering the AU society and the protagonist's situation. Through the 4 current books there has not been foreground romance.

There's no romance in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) but there are sexually provocative scenes and a lot of violence. One of my favorite fics though.

IIRC linkffn(Forging the Sword) was abandoned before any romance subplot happens - one of the very best fics out there.

linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) is a first year story, so it's pretty aromantic as well.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Very special circumstances of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] and a lot of paranoia make the main heroine not dating anybody. Highly recommended for other reasons as well, it is generally really good piece of writing.

** Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them and its sequel both feature a Harry who's convinced he's a forest elf and lives outside of society, and it covers from when he's six to the end of third year, so no romance really occurs.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
