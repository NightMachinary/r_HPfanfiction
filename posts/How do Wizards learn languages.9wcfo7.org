Alright: We know it is canon that a few people have learned a multitude of languages. Barty Crouch Senior spoke more than a hundred. Dumbledore himself was apparently fluent in quite a few too.

However Rowling never went about to tell us how exactly they would go about learning that many languages.

I have had the discussion with a few friends and some suggested, of course: wizards live longer, then it is plausible that they learnt the languages without magical aide. - I refuted the statement that while certainly some wizards do learn languages the 'hard way', someone like Crouch Senior speaking more than a hundred most likely had magical help.

- So. How do you think people learn languages in (canon) Harry Potter-Verse?


** Well, for Dumbledore, he was aged 115 when he died, so I don't think it's far fetched at all to say that he had a lot of time to pick up on languages. The fact that he was a genius in every right as well hardly deters his case.

** I just chalk it up to Rowling's nigh-magical ability to make anything involving numbers not work and ignore it. There have been plenty of fanon ideas for wizards to learn languages, but it generally boils down to something you wear, often a piece of jewelry, that translates for you and teaches you as you go, or a consumable that instantly teaches you the language (language lozenges got oddly popular for a few years).

** I think its interesting to set a foundation for whats possible without any aid of magic - without even having magic.

Polyglots, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs][as this link shows in a TED talk]], are a reality. There are people out there that speak dozens of languages fluently. Fun fact: Once you get into the swing of learning languages, any average human could reach ~10 languages easily. Its like a muscle you train.

So using that as our baseline, its possible that Dumbledore speaks all those languages because he learned them. Given that he is described as a genius, he may even had an easy time doing so.

Barty Crouch is, of course, a different matter. For a first, the top 100 most spoken languages on the planet are getting quite /obscure/ once you reach around the 50 mark (inlcuding several types of Italian, for example). We can also add to his repertoire that he probably speaks languages like Mermish. My headcanon for him always was that he is a magical polyglot. Like some people are parsemouths, metamorphs or what have you, he is a magical polyglot. I added this because for me it explained why nobody else seems to be fluent in several languages, making me think that it does indeed take a comparable amount of time to how long muggles take to learn a language.

*** I like the idea that there are some people who are basically born with the ability to learn languages rapidly via magic. Essentially, it would be like "once they hear so much of it they're fluent."

And there have to be hundreds of magical languages, we know about Mermish, Troll, Gobbledegook, Giant (which probably has a lot of different dialects, and I suspect that Mermish does too since their appearance is so different based on where they live). So I always assumed that most of the languages that BCSr. knows are magical ones.

** Probably the same way they manage learning /anything/ to competency with only 2-4 hours a week of each class. There are obviously memory enhancing potions or charms or /something/ that's used to improve the rate at which the children learn. If they didn't, there just wouldn't be enough time for them to cover the important things, and the grand majority of /all/ subjects would be self-study rather than actually being taught.

** My belief is that most learn languages normally, but there is probably some sort of magical technique not unlike Pensieves to transfer knowledge of a language from one person to another. (Presumably, the Gift of Parseltongue is a variation of that magic, rendered hereditary.)

** I remember one fic where a time travelling Harry ran into Lucius Malfoy while Harry was getting something for languages (ring, earing, book something) and Lucius sneered saying that there were darker ways, by stealing the language skills from the less fortunate, but I can't remember the fic.
