Looking for stories written before all the books came out. I'm wondering where a lot of the fans thought the books were heading? I would prefer it to start pre GoF. preferably completed fics. Thanks!


** Star Trek.

Oh, you meant in HP? No clue, but you can find the oldest FFN fics by sorting By Update, no other filters and checking the last page.

*** Technically, I think the Cthulhu mythos had the first fanfics, except they made money off it.

It's been a wild ride. Some fics that I have read are older than current fanfic writers. The scene didn't really explode until the 2004-2006 era IMO, by then we had 5 books and 3 movies worth of material for authors to borrow from and expand upon. Vox Corporis is probably my favorite fic from this era.

*** I dunno. I always kinda thought it exploded between GOF and OOTP. There was so much time between the two books and it seemed like everyone and their mama were writing fics to make up for the lack of new canon.
