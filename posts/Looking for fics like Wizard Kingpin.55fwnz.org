I'm looking for a similar fic in the sense that he runs a gambling business, expanding business, and having fun stomping on politics.

Over 70k+ words please!


** Not gambling, but Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus. It's an absolutely bonkers fic, but it can be and usually is fun.

Crime fics (I haven't read all of these, but the ones I haven't are meant to be good):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9729235/1/Wand-Knife-and-Silence][Wand, Knife and Silence]] is a little predictable, but still ok.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11790110/1/Gabriel][Gabriel]], a little bit angsty.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]]. I really like all of Epic Solemnity's stuff, and this is no different.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11638197/1/Getting-Away-with-Murder][Getting Away with Murder]]. Haven't read, but heard good things.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11750859/1/Rise-Of-The-Phoenix][Rise Of The Phoenix]]. James Spookie's stuff is normally pretty good.
- If it can someone other than Harry, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is awesome.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/221782][Be not defeated by the rain]] is pretty good too.
- There is also the series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/388051][The Weasley Mob]]

On the right side of the law is the awesome [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] from [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] and one I haven't read, but updating regularly is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11704617/1/Undercover-Auror][Undercover Auror]]. Draco is the boss in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7955050][I'm Glad You Came (Because Otherwise It'd Have Cost You Your Ugly Mug)]].

  “I only came here to know when the new bed's arriving. Just couldn't remember the gosh darn date.”Harry and Karkaroff stare. Draco merely looks back, an expression of polite expectation on his face.“You mean you're not here to... you're not here to rescue me?” Harry asks, shock written in every feature.An exaggerated expression of surprise takes over Draco's face, “Not at all! I know you can take care of yourself, darling.” Harry groans.ORThe one where Harry is a precious baby who doesn't thinks he needs protection (SPOILER ALERT: he does) and Karkaroff and his disgusting teeth kidnap him. But BAMF!Draco will mow down the person who dares to touch his fiance. Not without throwing a melodramatic bitchfit, though.

  Harry is an Auror assigned to go undercover to capture a murderer. The catch? Harry has to use himself as bait through a gay dating service. It seems like a good plan until Harry starts to fall for one of the men he's supposed to be investigating. Is he falling for the murderer or the next victim? MxM Drarry

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

#+begin_quote
  The Weasley family has been rising through the wizarding criminal underworld for years now, defying any of the Ministry's attempts to bring them to heel. When Michael Corner is given the assignment of infiltrating the Family, it seems like the chance of a lifetime to get Ginny Weasley, the girl who got away, out of the life and away from her criminal family, but in Tom Riddle's Britain nothing is quite what it seems.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
