The battle is waged over breakfast where the elves who like freedom try to outdo the ones who don't, and now everyone else is jealous because the Gryffindor meals are almost always better. The freedom fighters are called the "Socked Ones", and the rest of the elves are torn between hating them or admiring their guts. The Socked Ones of course proudly wear Hermione's hats and socks as symbols of their revolution.

When the house-elves finally gain freedom and rights, their official insignia is Hermione's kidney-looking socks.


** Interesting idea. What if dobby was the lone freedom fighter.

*** Nah. I think I prefer that more elves join him. That way they actually manage to express agency regardless of their bondage. I've never liked the "house-elves liked being slaves" idea - it grosses me out. So having a small but significant faction of freedom fighters suits me better I think. We can explore the brainwashing that the elves experienced this way.

**** He'd definitely be their leader though.\\
His symbol of office is the extra inch of height the sheer quantity of socks he wears gives him.

***** Oh definitely. And since he's already free, he can freely communicate aspects of elf culture that the bound elves may still be under orders not to disclose. I really love the idea of Dobby serving as Hermione's mentor (of a sort) in activism.

Edit: And the mental image of Dobby towering over the other elves by virtue of his socks is wonderful and hilarious. I'm keeping this image, thank you.

** As Kreacher shows us, a few kind words and a nice gesture is enough to make House Elves like you. The Hufflepuffs, due to their proximity to the kitchens and the Ravenclaws, due to their ability to understand the direction in which the whole situation is going, adapt to the whole thing. Soon it's only Slytherins, who are far too arrogant to consider being nice to House Elves, that receive shit food. Amongst those Slytherins there is an orphan boy who loudly complains, "I didn't escape the orphanage just be fed the same garbage in this place. I knew it... it's all that mudblood's fault. I swear that I will kill every single mudblood and put those fucking house elves in their place even if that means tearing my soul into seven pieces."
