linkffn(Choices by random-fruitcake04)

I don't remember it perfectly but I remember really enjoying it as a Seer!Ron story. Not to mention it was one of the inspiration for another great story linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

Guess it's time for another read for me.

Fair warning, I remember Ron having a serious case of selective amnesia when it came to his visions

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Great. Now I look forward to another Ron centric story.

Fate is true a banger tho, if you haven't read it then please do.
