I once read a fic with a redeemed Barty Crouch Jr. I did not care for it much, but it gave me an idea that has intrigued me since.

Is there any fic where Barty Crouch Jr is very much a Death Eater (so not redeemed in the traditional sense) but who genuinely does a great job teaching and loving it? Basically, it is clear which side he is on, but he still manages to be the best DADA teacher regardless. Perhaps he even survives GoF and comes back to teach DADA in DH?

** Coming back aside, isn't this basically canon? He was probably one of the best teachers Harry ever had.
