There was a lot of sympathy in the Wizengamot for the small, frightened girl who was on trial. Unfortunately, not enough. The poisoned pen of Rita Skeeter had been telling tales about the spoiled seventh child who thought she was above the rules, who somehow obtained a dark object and took it to Hogwarts, then used it to spread fear and mayhem. There were sympathetic portrayals of the petrified students, some of whom would have months of work to catch up with their cohort. Worst of all, her crush on Harry Potter was proclaimed as the motive for her plot - to be the damsel in distress for her hero to rescue her at the end of the year.

Not even Harry Potter's testimony could save her. Clearly, the boy was still confunded by her act. Not even Albus Dumbledore could save her. He wasn't even at the school when she lured Harry Potter into the Chamber.

Ginny was sentenced to three years in Azkaban, she gave her mother a frightened look, then gasped softly as the Dementors drew closer. The mercy of unconsciousness followed almost immediately. The dark creatures drew her out of the room in chains.

Her family had plotted a rescue at the docks, but they didn't realise that the Azkaban ferry was for visitors and guards. Prisoners were taken by portkey. By the time they arrived, Ginny was already waking up in her cell.


** Putting innocent elven year old girl to Azkaban finally broke one of her cellmates, Sirius Black, to action. They left together and now they are on their bloody path of revenge, getting to Harry Potter, and killing all rats!

**** I didn't get the path of revenge correctly: there should be something worthy of eleven-year-old girl, like “protecting all fluffy kitten”, “making small wreaths of forget-me-nots”, or something of that kind. See linkffn(12407442) for more inspiration.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** I could see this going a different direction entirely. Ginny gets imprisoned next to a prisoner who asks her all about her experiences having the true Heir of Slytherin in her head, controlling her actions. During their downtime when the Dementors retreat for short periods, the two discuss the diary Ginny found, and as they discuss, she learns more about where the diary came from and that perhaps a certain Lucius Malfoy wasn't Imperiused all those years before in the first Wizarding war. Instead, she learns he was actually one of the loyal servants who escaped detection by his lies and money in the fallout after Voldemort disappeared.

As time passes, the two discuss Ginny's family and friends, lighting on one Harry Potter, who Ginny has had a crush on from the time she first met him. Her feelings towards him now border on hero-worship for having defended her so heatedly but also disappointment that he was unable to secure her freedom with his celebrity. They discuss her brothers and the way her parents smothered her in affection for being the only girl and the youngest, and Ginny lets out her fears that her parents have bankrupted themselves trying to hire someone that can represent her in the hearings and help her. All the while her newfound confidant has listened and let her get out her fears and failures, while paying particular attention to the relationships Ginny mentions.

Meanwhile her family has poured every last cent into championing Ginny's innocence, spending every penny of Arthur's winnings from the Ministry on finding good representation, petitioning for her case to be heard again, and even greasing palms as needed to try and open the right doors. With Lucius Malfoy directly against them, however, their efforts are in vain, and rather than take a big trip to Egypt to visit Bill, they spend their summer in a frenzy of tried and failed avenues for releasing her.

As Ron and the twins prepare to go back to school, a reporter from the Daily Prophet asks for an interview, promising to share the Prophet's view that the family and Ginny have had a bad go of it. The boys line up in front of their Hogwarts trunks with their too-short robes and Ron's still-broken wand front and center for a photo. Peeking out of the picture, perched on Ron's shoulder is a particular rat called Scabbers. When the article comes out, on the day the Hogwarts Express chugs its way out of the station, the reporter, a nasty piece of work who apprenticed under Rita Skeeter, has instead dragged the entire family through the mud, going so far as to interview certain Hogwarts personnel like Filch and Professor Snape, who both denounce the returning Weasley children as menaces to the school. The reporter ends her “article”, such as it is, with a scathing call that perhaps the three Weasley boys and their friend Harry Potter need to take a trip to Azkaban to join their sister for some shock treatment.

This, of course, leads to an enraged Molly Weasley attempting to storm down the doors of the Prophet. But more importantly, it leads to a certain Minister sharing a good laugh with the human Azkaban guards on his visit, whereupon he leaves his copy of the Prophet with notorious mass murderer Sirius Black when the prisoner expresses interest in it.

Black quickly reads through the entire edition of the Prophet, including the “Did Ginny Weasley Have A Co-conspirator in Harry Potter? Details on Page 23!” Realizing both that he was sharing a prison with one of Harry's alleged “girlfriends” and that her brother was carrying around his ex-friend, Sirius is spurred to action, first spending time exploring Azkaban to determine where the poor girl was locked away. Squeezing out of his cell in dog form, he trots around the prison, narrowly avoiding entanglements with both human guards and Dementors until he finds her cell. Devising a plan of escape, Sirius chooses the perfect moment and pops into her cell with the stolen wand of one of the guards. Ginny at first thinks she's hallucinating, but once Sirius convinces her of his realness and the possibility of escape, she jumps at the opportunity. There's just one hitch in the plan. Ginny demands to take her new friend with them. She's convinced her confidant doesn't deserve to be here, and in her mind, no one deserves to be stuck with Dementors night and day. Ginny refuses to leave without her friend, and given her shrunken appearance and pallor, Sirius feels she won't last much longer if he were to leave her. Torn between his intense desire to escape and his knowledge that Harry would be devastated to lose his “girlfriend,” Sirius reluctantly agrees to release her friend.

Negotiating an escape plan for one is hard. For two, it's imminently more dangerous. But when he learns he'll be letting a third inmate join them, Sirius has to use all his wits to ferry Ginny to the cell her friend is in without getting caught. He unlocks the cell and has his first intense shock when he sees the mass of wavy black hair on the head of the skin and bones prisoner before him.

“Hello cousin,” she croons almost lovingly, her eyes mad. “Fancy meeting you here.” A low chuckle escapes her throat before her dark eyes land on Ginny. “Oh love,” she says, almost gently, before walking over and embracing the young girl. Ginny sinks into her embrace, shoulders shaking as she does, and then the woman says, “Right then,” standing back and meeting Sirius's eyes with a surprisingly steady gaze, “are we getting out of here or not?”

And that begins Ginny's journey with the two most unlikely escapees.

P.S. I can see this being an epic story actually, with a really fun plot playing out between Sirius and Bellatrix (tried not to make it too obvious, but still). Now I kinda wanna write this, but I don't know if people would want to read it.

Also I know Bellatrix's reaction here seems insanely out of character, but I have at least six reasons for it that all wind back to her actually being in character when you get to her motivations.

*** "I will ask you all once more..." Snape began, eyeing the assembled third years in front of him. His eyes moved from person to person with eerie calm, sending shivers down the spines of all present. His gaze finally settled on Weasley, who was standing beside Crabbe and Goyle, surprisingly enough. They were standing off to the side, away from the other students and almost exactly opposite from where Malfoy took his near-fatal plunge.

"What happened to Mr. Malfoy?"

Nobody spoke, and for the next four minutes the only sound that could be heard was the winds whipping around the top of the Astronomy Tower. Weasley looked sick, his face a death-like shade of white. Crabbe and Goyle looked little better, and the latter appeared to be clenching his hands so tightly he might be cutting circulation off to his fingers. The rest of the students seemed to alternate between staring at Professor Snape, staring at the odd trio off to the side, or staring off into the distance and wishing desperately that they weren't there.

Eventually, Crabbe opened his mouth to speak and let out possibly the most unconvincing excuse Snape had heard in his entire life.

"Draco had an accident, Professor. Y'see, he left his wand on the ledge while he was tryin' to find Mars and when he went to grab it he knocked it clean off."

Snape's gaze zeroed in on Crabbe and Goyle immediately began to unclench his hands.

"And how," Snape drawled, "did that lead to Mr. Malfoy plunging off the side of this tower, might I ask?"

Crabbe opened his mouth to respond, but Weasley beat him to it.

"The wind blew him off!" he blurted out, looking somewhat surprised at his own words.

Snape simply stared.

"Y'know... when he... grabbed for his wand..." Ron finished lamely, eyes directed at the floor. That seemed to be his default mode these days, ever since his little sister was sent away. Neither Snape nor the other professors could recall seeing him smile even once that year.

"It's true, Professor." Goyle added helpfully, placing a hand on Weasley's shoulder in support. "Just a bit of bad luck. You know how windy it gets up here."

As if to punctuate that statement, a particularly strong gust of wind buffeted them, sending Snapes robes billowing around him in a rather dramatic fashion. He noted that it was blowing /away/ from the direction in which Malfoy fell.

"Mm. Quite." Snape's face and tone were unreadable, but all present seemed to draw back nonetheless, quite certain that this was going to end rather poorly for all involved.

Snape, meanwhile, continued to stare at the unlikely trio for a moment. Continued to watch as Crabbe glanced nervously at Weasley's down-turned face, who seemed quite resigned to punishment, and then to Goyle's hand, which was still placed comfortingly on Weasley's shoulder as he stared back at Snape, a strange mixture of determination and resignation on his face.

Snape made his decision on the spot.

"You would do well to remember that story when the aurors arrive. Mr. Malfoy's father is quite concerned over his son, as you might expect, and the Ministry will be conducting a full investigation."

All three students in front of him began staring at him in bewilderment as he turned his attention to the remainder of the class.

"It seems what happened here was a simple lapse in proper safety procedures. I'm sure you will all attest as to what happened here tonight. How Mr. Malfoy's lack of caution and disregard for his own well-being led to a /completely avoidable/ incident."

The assembled students stared back at him, most seeming to understand what he was implying. A few would probably have to have it explained to them by their comrades, but that wasn't surprising. This year group was a particularly pathetic group of dunderheads.

"Of course, it is regrettable that the wards around the railing happened to fail at just the wrong moment. One would almost think they had been tampered with." Snape's eyes landed on the trio once more before turning back to the rest of the class. It was Crabbe's turn to look sick, it seemed.

"It is equally unfortunate that they left no trace for anyone to investigate. One can only hope that Mr. Malfoy happens to recall the last few moments before his fall, otherwise the investigators will simply have to accept the word of their witnesses."

The class stared at Snape with a mixture of surprise and, for the first time in all his time teaching, respect.
