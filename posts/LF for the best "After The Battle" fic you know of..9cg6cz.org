One of the my favorite parts of any book is the time /after/ the resolution, when you get to bask in triumph as the story wraps up. One things I loved most about Lord of the Rings in how much time we get /after/ the ring is destroyed. We get like 4 whole chapters of celebration and tearful goodbyes, learning about the aftermath and importantly, cleaning up of the mess. One of my biggest disappointments is how little story there was left after Voldemort was defeated. It almost seems like JKR was in a hurry to be done with it. Obviously we get the little chapter showing us the happily ever after of 19 years later, but the immediate aftermath seemed unnecessarily condensed. I would have liked to see a "Scourging of the Shire" type chapter that took us through some of the efforts to put the Wizarding world back to rights. I think she could've shown us Umbridge's trial, and implied it was one of many that had occured. We could've seen a formal celebration to honor Harry and the heroes who sacrificed their lives fighting the death eaters. Maybe a bit where people find out the truth about Snape, and Harry making sure he got a picture on the wall of the headmasters office. Seeing Kingsley become minister, and McGonnagal being officially confirmed as headmistress, and her prediction of the day of Voldemort's defeat becoming "Harry Potter Day" come true, despite Harry's inevitable objections. There are so many things, and I'm not asking for her to go through everything, but I just wish we could've taken some time to unwind after the final boss fight. Just a brief glimpse of the aftermath, and the efforts that were undertaken to restore order, or the changes made for the better.

Anyway, does anyone know of any good fan fiction that can scratch this particular itch? Preferably one that follows cannon, and picks up where Voldemort dies, or shortly thereafter. I'd also love to see Umbridge finally get what's coming to her.

Thx


** I totally agree about feeling let down by the rushed ending prior to the epilogue. But to play devil's advocate, I'd argue that things were probably so messed up right after the battle that there is no way Rowling could've appropriately addressed these issues in a few chapters. So she kind of threw some stuff together without really needing to contemplate how things would work going forward. You get throwaway lines about how Kingsley is installed as Minister (why him? surely with the death of Voldemort and the defeat of his movement, a massive power vacuum would exist that many would seek to fill). Truth is there would be anarchy in the Ministry trying to figure out who was imperiused, who were actual Death Eaters, and who were willingly going along with the atrocities. Point is after the battle, things could not possibly have been that happy.

If it were me, I'd have written another chapter taking place the following Christmas at the Burrow. You can mention Harry and Ron enjoying Auror training, Kingsley fixing things at the Ministry, the last of the Death Eaters being found, and Harry/Ginny, and Ron/Hermione doing well. Then give a brief summary of their lives up until the actual epilogue, which would have then been more fitting.

** Depends on if you want epilogue compliant fics or not (I assume you want canon compliance until the end of DH).

If yes, I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]], linkffn(4367121;5486257).

If not, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), in which Harry and his friends declared a new war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. In fact, I like this fic a lot more than my previous two recommendations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055), focuses on what happened to Draco immediately after the Battle. It's slightly AU, but Draco is very much in character and I kind sympathize with him here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), is a very unique postwar fic, canon compliant until the end of DH, and things really got interesting after chapter 5. It's also the first H/Hr fic I've found that depicts Ron (and Ginny) as heroes.

** Not sure it's exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] is a very short oneshot that's highly recommended around here.

Seconding the recommendation for War is Over by Pitry, which I recently read and seems to be exactly what you're looking for. The characters and the postwar political landscape are close to Rowling's style as well - it definitely has that canon feel to it.

** linkao3(Lost among Our Winnings by bachlava) - covers shortly after the battle to 19 years later, in snapshots.

linkao3(War Is Over by Pitry) - has Harry joining the Aurors after the battle, and frequently clashing with the ministry; also has a loose sequel, linkao3(Inter Arma... by Pitry), which is set 20 years later.

linkffn(These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo) - from what I remember, more focused on how Harry & co cope emotionally after the war than War Is Over, but there's still plot to be had; also has a sequel, linkffn(Some Cuts Leave Scars by Melindaleo).

if you've read linkao3(The Changeling by Annerb) - which you should read if you haven't - you'll probably like its post-war sequel, linkao3(pick it up, pick it all up and start again by Annerb).

i've also seen linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by cpstabell) recommended, but i haven't read it yet.
