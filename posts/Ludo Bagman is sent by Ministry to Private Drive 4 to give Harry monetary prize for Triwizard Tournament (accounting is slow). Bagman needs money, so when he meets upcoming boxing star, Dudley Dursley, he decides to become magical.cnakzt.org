** Draco wheezed, his hair - normally well-kempt to a fault - in complete disarray. Still, he had to keep running. The music was growing fainter, and if he allowed it to fade from his ears, he'd lose his reputation completely. The melody guided his steps, even as the air burned in his lungs.

Eight months prior, Ludo Bagman, a celebrity of the sports world, had popularized the Muggle sport of boxing. While brawling with fists rather than wands was mostly seen as an amusement for Muggles and Squibs, it was apparently seen as a noble endeavor in the Muggle world, or so it was sold to the pureblood community. Hesitantly, the wizarding community had accepted this new development. With duels mostly illegal, it was a fine way to work off aggression, and with the types of injuries that a Bludger could inflict on an unwary Quidditch player well-known, the risk of harm wasn't enough to dissuade the sporting public.

It had grown, almost overnight, into something of a sensation. Purebloods - never known for being physically-active, were now training at magical boxing gyms, engaging in grueling physical training. Most were in the best shape of their lives. Arthur Weasley was turning heads.

/Arthur Weasley./

Draco's father wasn't ignorant of the need to display ties to the magical community, distasteful as they sometimes were. He himself could remain aloof, as a member of the dignified minority, but to have his son be viewed as one who shirked a challenge? It simply wouldn't do. Which wasn't to say that he'd leave Draco without every advantage possible.

There was a certain man who had once attended Ilvermorny, now fairly famous for turning his back on the magical community in large part in favor of Muggle celebrity, training a champion boxer. A true Cinderella story, or so Lucius had understood it. The elder Malfoy had enlisted his services, flying him across the Atlantic for a truly prohibitive amount of money. The man's methods were... questionable at best, however.

The coach had been /delighted/ to find a birthday present Draco had received years earlier, before he could fly reliably. He was even more delighted when he'd inquired about possibly borrowing it to help with the training, and his dark-skinned face had been positively radiant when he'd ridden it for the first time and heard the small melody enchanted to play while the pedals were pumped. In fact, Draco had concluded that he had no intention of giving it back, something he frequently protested

"Come on, Little Drac! Get a move on!" the large man hollered, riding Draco's bicycle as a simple chiptune blared. "You don't want to let me get away with this nice ride, do you?"

Draco, helpless, could only call for aid the only way he knew how. His steps jarred his words, and - in sync with the rhythm of the song as his pace was - it sounded like he was singing along.

"Mudblood stole my bike!" he yelled.
