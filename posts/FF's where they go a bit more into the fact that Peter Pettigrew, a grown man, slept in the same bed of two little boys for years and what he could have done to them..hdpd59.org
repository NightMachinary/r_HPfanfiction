Harry and Ron learned about the memory charm only last year after all. It could be talked about last year and one of them could have something like a flashback and then think about what Peter could have done to them or any other Weasley.


** The only thing that comes to mind is a fic where Ginny very briefly admits to Remus that she saw the rat doing weird things a couple times like sniffing her clothes and such, and that it creeps her out knowing now that it was a full grown man, but nothing more. And I don't remember the fic's name..

**** Yes, but so much less normal when you think that it /wasn't/ a rat, it was a man. And a man sniffing a little girls clothes is not at all normal.

**** I don't know, never had a rat. But in this fic Ginny was implying a more sexual/perverted situation where it was her underwear. And he was not a normal rat, that's the point. And she was just a little girl.

** I've always quite liked the idea of Peter doing (non creepy, just funny) stuff when they were out, like taking a bath and using Molly's face masks and bath products or stuffing his face with cakes and biscuits. Molly keeps wondering where all her "best" stuff goes and naturally blames the twins.

  The Boogeyman is real. And he has been haunting Ron's nightmares for years. Believed to be the imaginings of an easily frightened child, no one ever believed him. As Fifth year gets into full swing, all the dark secrets Ron's kept locked up are unfolding in the most unexpected of ways and Umbridge is determined to make an example of him.
