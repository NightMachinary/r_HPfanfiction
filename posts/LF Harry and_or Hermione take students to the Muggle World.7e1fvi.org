Wondering if there are any fics where Harry and Hermione take their friends to the Muggle World and have some fun. Go on to a theme park, movie theater etc and have some good times.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/2/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294): they (and Neville and Luna) watched Braveheart during the summer after Year 4. Needless to say, they didn't react well to it.

  Sequel to The Accidental Animagus. Voldemort's back, and this time, he's not alone. Harry and his family are caught in the middle as the wizarding war goes international. Years 5-7.

** In my story "Patron", they go clubbing in muggle London with their friends because Wizarding Britain has become unsafe during the war. It's a rather small part of the story, though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a scene where Harry and various wizards/witches go to see the Phantom of the Opera (to show the magical folk how muggles do stage plays), but it's told in retrospective only for a paragraph or two, so I'm not sure it's what you're looking for :\

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
