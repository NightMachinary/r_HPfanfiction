One of the complaints I see fairly often in reviews is that a character was OOC. In some cases, I have completely agreed. If you're writing a canon compliant fic and you make Snape a fluffy bunny, or turn Ron into a Death Eater, or make Dumbledore evil, well, that's insanely OOC.

But...

What about AU fics? If you change a character's past, wouldn't that have an effect on their personality? If you kill Lucius in the first war, would Draco be such a staunch believer in blood purity? If Neville's parents were never attacked, would he still have so many self esteem issues?

I guess this is partially a nature vs nurture question. How much of a character is defined by their past, their upbringing, the things that they have gone through, and how much is simply "who they are"? For example, Harry is not a bully in canon. Is this because of how he was bullied by Dudley? If he had been raised by Sirius, would he have acted viciously toward the Slytherin? Or is he just a better person than that, and he would have been kind despite his upbringing?


** OOC is alright as long as it is explained, in my opinion. What I can't stand, and try to avoid, is to make some character OOC and never explain why that is.

*** Yes this! In an AU I'm fine with OOC characters but even then I want a reason for it.

**** Exactly, you take my hand and walk me there, and I won't complain. If I wake up with a lump on my head, and I don't know what's happening, and the pairings could be canon-complaint, but I'll be bolting.

** Different life leads to different personality, and that makes sense, but...

- You should try to keep some elements of canon character even with a changed background. Something to show that this character is still this character, even if he is very different.

- The changes should make sense. I've seen fics where being taken by Sirius before Hogwarts resulted in meek and overtly nice Harry.

** If you give a reason for it, OoC is fine with me. If you use the exact same past for characters, but still have them acting completely different is when I find it unappealing.

I think Draco not being as hardcore a believer in blood purity without his father is a coin toss, because his mother is still a blood purist from the Black family.

** Completely agree however do try to stick with their core values, Neville always does what is right even when he doers want to. Harry will always feel guilty but with a better upbringing he'd probably value his own life a little higher. Draco might well be a worse blood purist if his father died as he blames the blood traitors and co responsible.

** There's always some nature and some nurture.

Harry seems to be the kind of person who would not become a bully unless he was raised to become one. On the other hand, he also seems to be the kind of person who'd probably snark a lot if not for his specific upbringing, which might not have made him a bully but definitely would have made him different as he is a reactional character and someone who snarks often probably would be a bit more proactive.

So, Harry minus Dursleyish upbringing equals ... Monty-Python-ish---pun-storm.

** Personally I have no problem with OOC. Maybe I'm the minority (I feel like I am), but as long as the characters are well written, I'll read them.

I read fanfiction more from the world and stories than for "my favorite characters" (mostly because I have very mixed feelings towards the actual series itself).

** There are two types of OOC. Progressive AU, and Abrupt OOC. Progressive AU is exactly that, it starts canon, hits the AU point, and then progresses onward. Cause and Effect. This is extremely acceptable, even when it's not done particularly well, because at least the author fucking /tried/ to give us decent character development. Abrupt OOC defines itself, it is a character that is abruptly out of character for poorly explained reasons. This is not acceptable and is a sign of poor writing.
