Anyone know anything on what happened to kathryn518?" I'm still here' is one fic I'm hoping gets an update in this corona crisis which seems to have resurrected a lot of dead fics.


** Out of all her stories I actually want Powerful Magical Artifact to update the most. I know she has some truly legendary longer fics, but that one really grabbed my interest. I absolutely love the almost buddy-cop style it seemed to be.

** From what I understand Kathryn518 has for a longer time had this slow update-cycle of long chapters rarely.

I don't consider her/their fics dead :P

but this info comes from hearsay, so who knows.

** Well, who knows how long this'll last. But kathryn518 writes massive chapters and it seems to take her quite a long time to do so. Just take a look at the publish date and updated date on her longer works and then divide that by the number of chapters she has for those stories. It gives plenty of evidence on its own that she only does a chapter or two a year, and that's when she doesn't suddenly decide to start a new project like Powerful Magical Artifact or a lengthy one-shot like Not Dumbledore.

** She was great writer but she writes useless long descriptions. Her story moves very slow even it was thousands of words long. But she knows how to write engaging stories. She mostly posts one or two chapters a year.

** I wouldn't be surprised to see an update in a few months. We're due for our yearly update.

*** It's been 3 years since the last chapter. Which was why I was wondering what happened

**** I saw that too, except on I think it's chapter 10, she has something about 2019 at the start of it in bold? Maybe updating pre-existing chapters doesn't count as updating so Fanfiction doesn't show it, but she did say she updated last year.
