*** Hindu branch formed in the 16th century that had a resurgence cult pop up in the US in 1966. They tend to show up and protest at political rallies. They mostly just dance and chant.

If Harry was a Hare Krishna, he would be expected to give up all his wealth to the religious leaders, ignore the outside world and focus only on Krishna, and basically be a generic cult member.

**** They do have these. It's called Dumbledore Bashing.

Dumbledore wants his wealth. Dumbledore doesn't want Harry to interact with anyone he doesn't approve of. Dumbledore wants him to blindly obey him.
