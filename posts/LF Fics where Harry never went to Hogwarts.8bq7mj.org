** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), almost fits perfectly:

- Harry lives with Dursley until he is of age
- He is not an Obscurus, but blind
- Voldemort still wants to kill him
- Dumbledore and Snape might have helped him
- He doesn't necessarily have a pet snake, but he is definitely in the mad scientist mode

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Out of the Darkness by Chim Cheree. Harry apparates at a young age to the homestead of an old squib from the Black family line. It's an interesting read, but it gets very dark and hasn't been updated in awhile.

Edit: hmm. My other post didn't show for some reason...The story is “Out of the Darkness” by Chim Cheree and while there is no Obscurus it is still about Harry surviving and thriving outside Hogwarts. Due to abuse, Harry's accidental magic apparates him as a young boy to the hidden property of a Black squib who raises and teaches Harry. It gets pretty dark.

  Shortly before his 11th birthday, Harry Potter disappears from Privet Drive. Accidental Magic takes him halfway through the country, and while Harry tries to find his place in his new life of magic and mystery, the Wizarding World is left to deal with the consequences of his disappearance.
