So, both Ingenio ab Artifex and Wastelands of Time have a very... unique Harry Potter. A Kerouacian/Salinger-esque James Bond Aloof and Musing (read: Pretentious as fuck) Badass type. The kind of guy who'd unironically say "She wasn't doing a thing that I could see, except standing there leaning on the balcony railing, holding the universe together." or "She smiles a true smile and I fall in love". I'm in the mood to read some more Harries like that. So, any fic recs you've got, please.

Male or female Harry, any pairing, het or slash or femslash, weird stuff, any tropes or cliches welcomed. They just need to be like the ones in Wasteland and Ingenio.

** If you like Harry in wastelands, you might as well try any of his other stories because he's the exact same in all of them, including his non-HP stuff

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography. For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.
