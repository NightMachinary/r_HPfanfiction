** If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon yet, you need to.

Someone described it somewhere that instead of Sirius becoming Harry's James, Harry becomes Sirius's James.

So basically instead of Sirius becoming a father figure to Harry like so many cliched stories, Harry becomes Sirius's best friend.

*** One of my favorite fanfictions ever. It's hilarious in its own right, but it also has a coherent plot to back it up and give it substance.

This is a nifty character piece told in a collection of encounters.

** I really liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/][Roundabout Destiny]]. It is an AU time travel HG/SB fic with minimal slash. Also, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/][Innocent]] is a good start for a Sirius raises Harry fic.
