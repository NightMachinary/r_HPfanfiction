I'm looking for a fanfiction of Harry Potter that doesn't feel like it's his responsibility to save everyone that he'll kill death eaters if they process path but won't go out to save others that he doesn't know or care about. Not that I want him not to help others but only if it's beneficial to him personally to help them I don't want him running out in the middle of a crowded help them because he feel responsible for every single human being on the planet. Also I'm not a big fan of the Weasley any of them They creep me out or Lupin


** To be fair, if someone is being attacked by Death Eaters and you can reliably do something about it, it's always in your best interests to take that battle.

A "self-interested" Harry Potter would almost by necessity have to have /some/ kind of political mindset - not to be confused with a politics-heavy story. If he wants to survive against Voldemort, he's going to need the people on his side. Part of getting the people on your side is inspiring them and showing them that you're willing to stand up for them, if only in appearance.

I wouldn't mind reading a story, though, where Harry doesn't attempt to take /EVERY/ fight, no matter the risks. A General!Potter where he attempts to assess the probability of success of his missions accurately and only moves forward if it's either likely to succeed or he can't afford to not take the fight would be interesting. But, really, at that point, you're almost certainly reading a Political!Harry - not that I mind that.

  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

**** Fwiw. Defenestratable said that this is a re-upload of a story taken down by fettucini. I think it's likely that it will never be updated due to that.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
