/Guess working out isn't so bad after all/, Harry thought.

Harry smiled, then turned his attention towards the staff table. Professor McGonagall gave him a saucy wink.

She called herself Black Owl or Something-Owl, I don't remember exactly.

****** I bet it's still taxing, on some level. You'd need stamina of some kind, be it physical or magical, and you'd still need to train.

I concede your point, you can get out of dodging if you are adept at dueling and/or magically powerful enough to always block or shield or parry. But I think we're making a point about the superiority complex that comes with jogging around a lake for a semester. Surely that'll give an edge against Voldemort himself, who can transfigure large objects in a blink. (Transfiguration being the hardest to master, or so I hear?)

I could see all the running translate to something like this, but not much else (as I myself run a 10k regularly):

/Harry, Hermione and Ron slowed to a stop, huffing and panting, leaning against a large ash tree. As they looked around them, they could no longer see the attackers./

/"Did we... outrun them completely?" Hermione asked between large intakes of breath/

/"Blimey, mate! Those four minute miles sure are paying off!" Exclaimed an out of breath Ron. He could spy half a dozen black figures, small as dots, appearing on the horizon "But let's get out of here for real, all right?"/

/He extended a hand to Harry and Hermione, taking in their puzzled expressions. He shot a glance at the brunette girl that could be translated to "Are you a witch or not" before grasping both of his friends and apparating away./

Running only gives you stamina, but no other athletic skills for dodging, which I rarely see any drills being practiced of. It's either jogging, or target practice, or pointlessly complicated duels that don't focus on immediately overpowering and subduing your opponent. I feel like yeah, to a certain point you'd have to be physically able to take someone down, or at least assist the magical side of attacks with a swift kick to the shin, but then you'd also have to practice being ruthless. Not toying with your opponent by conjuring */birds/*, but sending a cutting curse at them and send them down hard so they stay down.

So, TLDR: Dodge and escape if you encounter an opponent with superior magical capacity. Shield and go on the offence otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  "Society in the United Kingdom is markedly more secular than it was in the past and the number of churchgoers fell over the second half of the 20th century.[64] The Ipsos MORI poll in 2003 reported that 18% were "a practising member of an organised religion".[59] The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Some 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year.[24][65] The Tearfund Survey also found that two-thirds of UK adults (66%) or 32.2 million people had no connection with the Church at present (nor with another religion). These people were evenly divided between those who have been in the past but have since left (16 million) and those who have never been in their lives (16.2 million)."

  Religion in Britain has suffered an immense general decline since the 1950s. Between 1979 and 2005, half of all Christians stopped going to church on a Sunday. Four in five britons want religion to be private, not public, and have no place in politics5. All indicators show a continued secularisation of British society in line with other European countries such as France.

****** "Malfoy can't get into the Room of Requirement?" Hermione said, pacing the common room. "How is that even possible?"

"I sealed the room, but it isn't foolproof. He can still collect the key, which I've broken into seven pieces and scattered across the castle. Once he's gathered them all, he'll realize that he didn't need a key. The true key was within him all along."

--------------

"...and cannot access the room where he's keeping all of his materials until he completes a quest," Lucius finished his report, placing a kiss on the hem of my robes.

"Hm. What sort of quest?" I asked.

"He must retrieve seven keys, hidden in Hogwarts," Lucius said.

I raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure the key isn't already in him?"

--------------

Draco growled at me and, with a burst of light, the pieces united into an ornate, silver key. He stomped towards the door and stuck it into the lock.

The key broke, its pieces disappearing, and the door remained closed.

The blond whirled around, glowering. "It broke."

I hurried forward. "Draco, don't you deserve to get in?"

Draco sneered. "Of course I do. I did all your stupid trials."

"And learned so many lessons," I mused. "If you truly deserve to go in, then why would you need a key?"

"You're kidding me," he said flatly.

I placed a hand on his shoulder. "Draco, open the door."

Young Malfoy turned the knob and the door smoothly opened.

"You see?" I said. "The true key was within you all along. All you had to do was believe in yourself!"

Draco gazed into the Room of Requirement, which was empty save for the pedestal holding Ravenclaw's Diadem. "I spent a year and a half tracking down the key pieces, all for a key that I didn't need."

I chuckled, pushing past him. "Just because the key doesn't open the door doesn't mean you don't need the key."

Whether the life debt caused the silver hand to turn on him for honestly seeking to end Harry's life, or Voldemort put a curse on the hand that was activated by Pettigrew's hesitating due to the debt, it's never fully explained.

Voldemort knew Pettigrew was an unreliable traitor who'd jump ship at the first hint of serious trouble, and I think it's likely that he cursed the hand as an extra form of security.

Monologueing Harry is so very special!

honestly it would be /so good/ if moody in canon just carried around a small spartan cube in which he lived in, just placing wards outside it whenever he goes to sleep and changing his sleeping location up and down england every night (near a pond somewhere, in a welsh forest clearing, in some wheat field in scotland, an inn in bristol, on top of big ben, etc), because you can never be sure when operational security is compromised.

barty could've just intercepted him through the floo when he's going away from some ministry event or something, instead of breaking into his home.

i imagine the floo-interception occurs from a corresponding floo-lane with barty holding a magical shepherd's crook.

If they are more common him having one should be so amazing. If they are ridiculously expensive having one becomes a status symbol. Why live in a Hogwarts bedroom when you can take a whole apartment with all your stuff to Hogwarts?

If there is stigma against them people should be way more wary of interacting with it or look down on him for it.

Be down to read your story. I also like to see a cliche done well. That is why they are cliches.

** "Greetings, Harry Potter. I am called Ragnuk." the goblin at his desk greeted the wizard who had just entered his office and sat down.\\
"Hello, Ragnuk." Harry said politely.\\
Ragnuk gasped before he beamed, "Harry Potter, no wizard has ever bothered to remember a goblin's name until now. You have earned the sworn allegiance of the entire Goblin Nation today."\\
Harry blinked, "Um, thank you, Mr. Ragnuk. Um, I was asked to come here to perform an inheritance test?"\\
"Yes, /Lord/ Harry Potter," Ragnuk agreed, "In fact, it's already been done. A function of the chair you sat down in just now."\\
Harry looked down at the comfy chair he was in for a few seconds. "Neato." he said wisely.

Ragnuk just nodded, "As it turns out, you are the direct legal descendant and inheritor of the estates of Potter, Black, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ambrosius, William the Conquerer, and a few dozen others that don't need naming just now. You are the richest and most titled person in the world as of-"

The door suddenly burst open to reveal Albus Dumbledore! "I confess!" the aged headmaster with twinkling eyes proclaimed, "I sealed Lily & James' wills to keep Harry ignorant of his titles and money so I could steal them all for myself, despite already being Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump and therefore already rich and famous! My boy!"\\
A security troll standing by the door promptly bashed Dumbledore over the head with his club, before dragging the headmaster away to the Gringotts dungeons.\\
Harry raised an eyebrow, unperturbed by the whole scene, "So, I have more than one vault full of galleons now, Sir Ragnuk?"\\
Ragnuk beamed again at hearing his name, before he pushed over a balance sheet towards the young heir with emerald orbs for eyes, "Yes, in fact, you have over a hundred, and quite probably more money than exists in magical Britain."

And that was when Ginny Weasley barged into the room, "I confess! I've been dosing Harry with love potions to make him marry me so mum and I can get control of all his money!"\\
The security troll (which had just come back) promptly bashed her over the head with his club before dragging her away to the dungeons to join Dumbledore.\\
Without missing a beat, Ragnuk continued, "Also, the main Potter Vault has a grimoire that you can use to learn the secret family spells, the Other Secret Slytherin Vault has a grimoire to teach you parselmagic, the Black Vault has a useful primer on How to Learn Foolproof Occlumency in a Day, and the Special Black Vault has a few dozen-"\\
Ron Weasley burst in! "I confess! I've been hanging around Harry to try and leech his fame and money! And shag 'Mione!"\\
Since the security troll wasn't back yet, the red-head helpfully bashed himself over the head with a spare club before (somehow, despite the concussion) Apparating himself to the dungeons.\\
"...Few dozen magically-binding betrothal contracts, which as they are written, essentially gives you a harem of attractive slave girls, including the lovely Daphne Greengrass, photoshopped picture included-"\\
Cornelius Fudge burst into the room next, "I confess! I see Harry Potter as a threat, so I've been trying to discredit and assassinate him!"\\
The security troll (which had finally returned) raised its club, but before he could bash Fudge, Amelia Bones forced her way into the room and slapped a pair of magical cuffs on the Minister for Magic. "/I/ confess to fully supporting Harry Potter despite his de-facto autocratic power over Britain and the magical world's economy!" she declared, before dragging Fudge away to face trial before the Wizengamot, followed by the somewhat puzzled security troll.

There was a pause. "And?" Harry prompted.\\
Ragnuk shook his head, "That's just about everything, Lord Potter."\\
Then the goblin passed over a bottomless sack of galleons from under his desk and smiled at the young wizard who had inherited everything, "I suggest to you that you go out into Diagon Alley...no-no, make that Knockturn Alley, and get yourself a cool and dark-looking new outfit, a custom-made wand that's unbreakable and makes your spells a hundred times more powerful than before, and a trunk like Mad Eye Moody's, except with enough space to store a few mansions."\\
Harry stared at the big sack of galleons that was offered to him.\\
"I also suggest picking up a couple of self-help books on how to be edgy." Ragnuk suggested, "And when you're done, hurry back, in 3 hours or so I'd like to unseal and read James, Lily and Sirius's wills, no doubt giving you even /more/ wealth than you've just acquired today and telling you where all the secret stuff to become a super-animagus and wandless prodigy and stuff is."

*** Harry stepped outside of Gringott's in a daze. He was tingling with the amount of power now flowing through his body, both from the tonic repairing his body and the song of magic now unrestrained flowing through him.

Despite being wrapped in the Cloak of Invisibility, a crowd of witches turned towards him, though all stepping back and kneeling once they faced his general direction. The men bowed instead. He felt a tug on his cloak from just behind him. His pulsing senses identified Luna Lovegood even before he turned to see her there.

"Hello, Harry."

"Luna. How did you know it was me? Can you see through the Cloak?"

"No. I saw the back of your shoe in a gap. No one else has trainers wrapped in duct tape."

"I suppose I should get those replaced."

"Why? Do you not want me to recognise you?"

"It's not that. They're not very stylish."

"Are they comfortable?"

"Sure."

Luna shrugged.

Harry focused his eyes on hers, and found himself inside her mind. It was a bit confusing, but the overall sentiment was passive and vaguely interested in everything around her. He caught a stray urge for some ice cream. "Would you like to go get some ice cream?" he said aloud.

In her mind he heard, 'No, it'll spoil my dinner,' and a moment later she said exactly that.

Deciding that the reverb wasn't worth the headache, Harry retracted from her mind. "Is there something you would like to do?"

"There's always something. What would you like to do?"

"I'm not sure. It seems like I can do just about anything I want. There are a bunch of things which I suppose I should do."

"Do you have to do them now?"

"I don't think so."

"Okay, well, when I'm feeling confused and can't decide what to do, you know what I like to do?"

"What's that?"

Moments later, Harry and Luna were sitting in a pile of kittens in a muggle pet shop. Luna was purring the loudest, but Harry was thinking that with a little practice he might be able to catch up.

** I hate Weasley bashing so much. Sure, Ron and his family aren't perfect- but that just makes them human.

Ron is Harry's best friend for a /reason/. Ron was willing to be his friend the moment he met Harry on the train, and he offered Harry his sandwich- even though Ron's from a poor family without much money, his first act is to offer somebody else his food. Ron is Harry and Hermoine's guide through the wizarding world, providing context and background that they don't have. He also keeps them grounded. Without Ron, Harry would sullenly angst all the time while Hermoine would go completely off the rails on a researching bender. Ron's that laid back, down to earth friend who pulls them out when they get too deep. When Harry blows up and Hermoine storms off in anger, Ron is the one to play diplomat between them.

People who cite Ron's mistreatment of Harry in his 4th year and during the Horcrux Hunt forget that in 4th year, Ron was 14, and Harry had expressed a desire to enter the Triwizard Tournament /immediately/ before his name was called. Fourteen year olds aren't known for their wisdom, and Ron making mistakes is understandable. As for the Horcrux Hunt, Ron already had low self esteem, and then he was wearing a mind altering dark artifact that played on his insecurities. He didn't abandon them. He stormed out in a moment of anger to clear his head for a few minutes and forgot about Hermoine's wards. It's not the same thing.

As for the whole "Ginny uses love potion' nonsense, that's just contrived bullshit. Harry sees Hermoine as the sister he never had, and Ginny is a hot fun Quidditch girl who shares his interests and knows how to support him emotionally. Of course he falls in love with her.

People just bash the Weasleys because they get in the way of the HHr shippers or whatever other dumb reason they come up with. Removing Ron from the equation unbalances the whole dynamic between Harry and Hermoine, and I can't imagine it would survive without him.

**** The problem is that in canon pretty much every time Harry is alone with Hermoine he gets depressed and starts missing Ron and his jokes because Hermoine is too serious for him, and both of them absolutely suck at giving each other emotional support.

In fanfics, Harmony only works if Harry and/or Hemione have different personalities but I can't really see their canon versions having a stable long-term relationship that doesn't fall apart after a few weeks.

This is the same kid whose closest thing to a father just died, and then almost immediately afterward was forced to live with people he hates who hates him, then had absolutely no contact from his friends.

He literally ignored and let Hermione cry for weeks when Ron left them because he had no idea what to do and he was severely uncomfortable. He's always dealt with his feelings by himself (out of neccesity) and just assumed Hermione was the same way.

It has a few. "Mione" pops up occasionally, there's a main Potter family vault firmly out of sight, and Dumbledore initially refers to "Harry, my boy" - although I think he stops that later.

What constitutes "OP" occlumency? NoFP allows second years to keep Snape out of their heads with enough training (most of a year), but it's an obvious block rather than the subtle misdirection Snape was teaching in canon, and it doesn't stop the Sorting Hat, or Veritaserum.

Splitting your soul into Horcruxes 100% sounds like something that would degrade your mind and sanity, meaning that you can have both a charismatic Tom Riddle to build up a movement and an insane but incredibly powerful Voldemort to go on rampages and do nothing but cause chaos. A lot of stories do this, but the thing is that they still KEEP Voldemort as the main challenge to overcome.

** In all of the Dumbledore bashing fics I have never once seen someone call Dumbledore a Tickle-me-Grindelwald.

This disappoints me immensely.

** Lily and James being horrible parents and Snape being some saint. It usually involves some lengthy description of them being described as attractive and wealthy and having good jobs, so that somehow means they must be evil incarnate, especially because Lily chose the smart, attractive guy who grew up instead of the guy who never grew up and joined the magic nazis.. I swear it comes off like an incel wrote it 99% of the time.

Harems

Ron being evil or cartoonishly stupid

Some fancy ass name like Hadrian or Hadrianus or Heironymous. The only time I ever saw it work was a one shot where Harry's real name was never revealed, but the fact that his legal name wasn't Harry enabled him to get out of the Triwizard. Harry does seem simple, even compared to the Weasley's names, but it is his name. And if folks feel the need to create a new one, at least make it something reasonable---Harrison, Harold, Henry, Heinrich---not Hieronymous or Hadrian.

Killing green eyes.

Overpowered adult like 12 year olds.

Slytherin house and Snape easily embracing Harry once he is sorted there. Some of the older kids likely had parents who were put away in prison after Voldemort's first fall, but they just end up loving Harry.

Cartoonishly evil Dudley. He's a nasty little bully, but he's not abusive like Petunia and Vernon and he's a child. People create stories where he outright tortures Harry.

Lordships. There's no sign that heredity nobility exists in the Wizarding world beyond Sirius once sarcastically going "the ancient and noble house of Black." Sometimes people create lordships, which isn't that bad, but then folks go overboard where Harry is Duke Gryffindor Hufflepuff Slytherin Ravenclaw.

** Introducing dozens of minor OCs with complicated names, with the reader left unsure who is who and whether any of them are important to the plot. I appreciate that Hogwarts seems empty, but do we really need 15 new people to keep track of?

*** Actually, I disagree with this one. I think making there be something like 10 or 20 boys Harry's year, instead of the 5 we have, is completely necessary, because he wizarding world is just so damn small. You can just casually throw out names without hem necessarily needing to be important, just like how Dean and/or Seamus have maybe 2 lines in every fic, just to fill out a scene. Alternatively you can do a “war generation” thing to explain the low numbers, which I've seen a lot of fics do, but that usually has a much larger affect on the universe of your story, especially the political situation.

** Shitty descriptions deserve their own spot (or row). You have:

- Questions where the answer is obvious (eg Will Love conquer all?)

- A spam of relationships, half of which appear just once or twice (H/G, R/Hr, Ar/M, F/An, G/Al, NL/LL, DM/LV)

- A lot of tropes ("mocking" names for Dumbledore/Voldemort, bashing, harems, overused phrases)

** Hmm. The "Daphne Greengrass" entry - does that just mean "Daphne is developed as a character" or is it more specific? It doesn't say anything specific, but just fleshing out a minor character shouldn't count as a cliche IMO.

If it's specifically about Haphne or similar, then I think Methods of Rationality avoids pretty much everything. Even the Dumbledore bashing freebie.
