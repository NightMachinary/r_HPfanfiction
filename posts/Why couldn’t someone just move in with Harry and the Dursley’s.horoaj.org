Was there any reason someone couldn't?

Let's see here. Quick check with the trustworthy adults that had free time.

Ok. Alastor Moody. He'd do.


** Pretty sure the main roadblock would just be the Dursleys. There's no way they'd allow another person in their house (let alone a grown witch/wizard) and honestly I could see them just refusing to house Harry if that was required. It could be a very fun idea, though! Would definitely love to see Moody interacting with the Dursleys

The protection Harry is under is premised upon Petunia's freely given consent; I doubt tricking Petunia would permit the magic to work.

** In canon, the "blood protection" need the Dursley (or more precisely Petunia) acceptance. Harry is protected as long as he

In Canon, the only requirement needed for the Blood Protection to work is the Dursleys (or more precisely Petunia) acceptance. It means that Harry would be protected as long as he can call 4 Privet Drive his home (despite the mutual dislike between him and his family), but also that said protection would fall the moment Harry is kicked out.\\
Since the Blood Protection is beneficial to the Dursley and also protect them (which is why they keep accepting Harry back despite several incidents like in PoA or GoF, and why Petunia insist to keep Harry even after Dudley meeting with a Dementor), Dumbledore has some leeway with them, but the Dursley still have a limit. And I'm pretty sure that having a wizard living full time in their home would go way past this limit.

Futhermore, one of the reasons why Harry was placed with the Dursley was for him to grow far away from the Magical World and his fame, and to have a (relatively) normal childhood. Having him grow up with a wizard who would be either starstruck by the "Boy-Who-Lived" or a nutcase like Moody would go against that point. Canon Harry was not the best adjusted child, but I'm pretty sure that a kid who grew up hearing about how he was a celebrity, or who was raised with the "Curse first, ask later" mentality would fare no better.

Finally, in 1981, Harry was not considered important enough to need such a protection. Sure he is the "Boy-Who-Lived", and the Death Eater would love to get their hand on him either to avenge their master or to raise him as a new Dark Lord, but they are already taken care of by the blood protection. In 1981, Dumbledore didn't know that Harry was an Horcruxe (and didn't even know that Voldemort used Horcruxe to ensure his imortality), he didn't know that Harry was "connected" to Voldemort, he didn't know that Voldemort would use Harry's blood to get a new body, which would let him bypass the Blood Protection (main reason why he got some escort in OotP). The only thing he knew was the prophecy, in which he doesn't give much importance, and Voldemort is busy trying to get a new body anyways. And since the Order of the Phoenix had been disbanded (to be reformed in 1995 with Voldemort return), Dumbledore didn't have any "troops" to place full time for Harry protection. So he did the next best thing and put a scout ready to contact him if needed.

​

So trying to have a wizard living full live with Harry would put him at risk to be rejected by Petunia (stopping the Blood Protection), would go against Dumbledore wished for Harry and would be considered an overkill considering the known risk of 1981. I also want to add that Alastor Moody did not have the free time to raise Harry since he was still an active Auror during Harry childhood and went into retirement in 1992 or 1993 (just before Dumbledore recruited him).

​

PS : I could also say that Dumbledore does have some ethics and having a wizard live in a house without its occupants knowledge would go against it, but it's Dumbledore and has been shown going against his own morale code when circumstances forced his hand, so he would definitively have done something like that if he had thought that he had no choice.

** All the points against your idea has merit, sure, but I'm 100% certain that Sirius would absolutely love living in secret in an expanded trunk in Harry's room. While his recklessness may be an issue, the promise of being near his godson, and far away from Grimmauld Place, would be enough to get him to behave. Not to mention, he can't do shit for the Order while he has a Kiss-On-Sight order on him anyways.

Agreed on the Dumbles bashing. If it's reasonable, I don't mind it. He's manipulative and secretive to a fault, no need to make him a thief or a dark lord out of nowhere.

**** I disagree. Whether or not the Dursleys treated him well, Harry was an extremely high-value target; their ONLY chance (as far as Dumbles knew) to kill an ultimate evil which he believed was coming back; even if Voldemort was dead, a target for the guy's followers - Figg is old and has no magic of her own. I say this is like setting a disabled senior to be the only bodyguard of a head of state in a hostile environment.

I read one fic where Harry lived in an expandable trunk in his room with Dobby for a summer. He told the Dursleys he would come in at the start of the summer, leave at the end of the summer, and not see them the rest of the time, and it worked.

But you're ignoring the easiest thing they could have done in the beginning, if they had no morals whatsoever. The protection is based on people who share Lily's blood. Dudley shares Lily's blood. They could have taken Dudley and put him and Harry wherever they wanted, with whoever they wanted, and either killed the adult Dursleys or obliviated them.
