I love the idea of him being a Magneto-like figure, where he has absolutely no interest in heritage, gender, nationality, anything, only thing that matters to him is if you are Magical or not.

In fact take it one step further, he thinks current, mainstream, wizard traditions and culture is the sole culprit for the stagnation and decay of Wizardkind, and his movement comes with a brand new way of life, not just a political statement. Like he says in Fantastic Beasts 2, 'the old ways serve us no longer'. This means Magical Britain is one of the few places left in Europe with a significant Pureblood culture and population.

Bonus points: AU where he won.

Please don't: crackfics.


** Or Magical Britain is actually one of the most progressive places in Europe because after Gridelwald was defeated all the other countries enacted far more conservative policies as a backlash against Dark Lord Grindelwald and all he supported.

If Grindelwald's policies promise equality for muggleborn, I assume a huge chunk of muggleborns also support him. With Grindelwald's defeat, people who suffered at his hands rallied against "muggleborn violence" and life for muggleborns is harder than it was under "the old ways". That's why Durmstrang stopped admitting muggleborn students.

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

** All According To Plan is somewhat like that. linkao3(15294075) It's not exactly the focus, but it does play a significant part. Grindelwald's revolution decimated most of the nobility across Europe, which made Britain's purebloods a lot more afraid. In this fic that's also explained as the reason for Tom Riddle becoming a pureblood supremacist dark lord (can't have a counter-revolution without a revolution after all). Grindelwald is also shown as being very anti-statutarian (against the statute of secrecy), and while he was defeated, these ideals have resurged in continental politics since the 60s here.

It's an incredibly interesting and deep take on magical politics on both national and international scale, and the writer uses mostly the same or similar backgrounds in other stories, usually focusing on a few topics more in some fics than others. But while it is a significant part of this story and has the setup to make it the main plot in the future, it is as I said not the main focus yet (though I guess you could at least call it one of the many focuses). The story has a bunch of different plotlines, and given that the total story is currently over 1 million words (the authors described themselves as "wordy bitches") it is quite the read to get into. Though, despite being so long, it is still active and was last updated just over a day ago. I would genuinely recommend it though, I really enjoy their work a lot, and it expands so much on so many topics that it's incredible. And a lot of the topics they mention and don't expand much on here they actually expand on in multiple of their other stories
