** linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) is what made NTHP one of the ships I like the most.

Mind you, I haven't actually read much NTHP besides this, because a lot of fics do this whole "true form = cheat code to Tonk's heart" thing which I find silly.

*** I feel like the "true form" thing should be the other way around if it exists at all. Rather than something which Harry asks for it ought to be something Tonks only chooses to show people she deeply trusts, maybe because she is embarrassed that she looks rather plain without her abilities.

That being said, I prefer the headcanon that the "base form" of a metamorph is a representation of their selves, which for Tonks means pink hair.

**** I much prefer the headcannon that base forms don't exist at all. They ARE metamophs. Their "real" form is whatever they feel like it being at the time.

***** Some base makes sense though. However, that can very well be flexible as well, meaning it changes when the person changes. For example, Tonks at the start of HBP could be very well interpreted as a base form, which was different from her base before.

**** Self-image?

I can dig that.

**** Base form is basically a default self image, otherwise it would get weird and the base would be a normal combination of parents (boring), something like a Ditto (kinda weird) or some blank slate doll form with completely generic/nondescript features

** I can't link on my phone, but "In the Mind of a Scientist" is a tremendous story, if you don't mind Harry being a bit mad. What makes it so good is the existence of two brilliant crossover sequels that are both even better than the original fic.
