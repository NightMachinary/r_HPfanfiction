A wizard points his wand to another wizard.

Too many authors resolve such situation in favour of their favourite heroes. If the first one is a villain, then it justifies any level of violence towards him, because "he raised his wand first". If the first one is the "good guy", then it means nothing, because he raised his wand just for a innocent prank or Lumos.

For me it seems disappointing, because it's a clear demonstration of favouritism and therefore kills all interest in the story.

What do you think about wands?

Is it a weapon that should be used by children under strong supervision and any pointing it to a wizard or witch without explicit contest is automatic offence?

Or is it just a multitool and no one bothers when someone points a want towards them?


** It is my personal headcanon that pointing a wand at someone is a rather large faux paus in the Wizarding World

As to a wand being a weapon? I would say it is a tool. The vast majority of the time a wizard uses a wand they aren't trying to kill someone but rather perform a harmless piece of magic. A tool can be misused and become a weapon, but it remains at its core a tool. Strong supervision I think cheapens that which is magic; as something whimsical to be explored rather than something with rigid rules and guidelines.

I'd say that wands are similar to Swiss Army knifes. Sure, you can use them to kill someone, but there are better tools if you just want to kill something and most users buy them for the utility and not murder.

***** Something more suitable for ranged combat, like a wand that can be aimed (put it on something akin to a rifle stock to make aiming easier). Staffs are supposedly a thing in the HP world. It would be rather unwieldy, but certainly better suited for combat, especially defensive one like the battle of Hogwarts.

And wands are rather easy to break (thin, long stick), so maybe make them more sturdy or fit them with a protective cover.

********* First you have to understand that any explanation we give is just going to be covering for Rowling's poorly thought out magic system. I can give explanations, you can give workarounds, but that doesn't change that wizards in the story don't do it. We can either say there's a good reason, or say they're horrendously stupid.

Disarming charms and summoning charms are like a physical force applied to the wand, not changing the properties of wand itself. We haven't seen anybody transfigure a wand, for example.

Mending a wand was only done with the Elder Wand so it's not safe to say that it's something that anyone can do at anytime.

You seem to have ignored two thirds of my comment.

********** I didn't ignore any of your comment, it was a short comment so I responded to the meat of it (that spells applied to wands might prevent magic use). The first suggestion (that highly magical things can't have magic easily applied to them) was clearly inapplicable since magic is used on wands in canon, simple magic at that.

Wands can be repaired (repair services for wands are mentioned in canon). The Elder Wand instant was special because of how damaged Harry's phoenix core wand was (the feather was just barely still joined). And the explanation you now have conflicts with the earlier one. Summoning and Disarming are magic obviously, but they didn't make it impossible for the wands to use magic.

If anything, the likely explanation is the the Unbreakable Charm can only be used to stop certain kinds of damage, such as shattering. Like, Hermione cast the charm on the glass container she caught Beetle-Rita within.

***** The three biggest limitations of a wand are Stability, range and durability. It is very difficult to accurately aim something from the wrist, therefore the effective range is very limited, especially since there is no sight attached. And wands are fragile, something you do not want on a battlefield. Magic in HP does not have a limited range per se, so the easiest way to get an advantage would be a way to get accurate, ranged magic.

The easiest solution would be rig the frame of a submachine gun or something of similar dimensions to give you a place for your other hand and at least iron sights. A full staff would be more useful in battle, but also rather bulky.

To be fair canon magic has very strict rules and guidelines and the main purpose of Hogwarts (or any other magical school) is to teach them.

If magic is wild and chaotic, it wouldn't be possible to research it, classify it and create disciplines around it (charms, transfiguration, arithmancy, etc.)

I see the analogue, but also I see a problem with it. For a knife to became a weapon it requires both physical proximity and explicit action.

With a wand you can cast a curse from significant distance and with just several worlds.

I wonder how would you distinguish between someone using his wand as a tool from him preparing to curse you?

****** Hmm, let's say that the swiss army knife has a gun attachment as one of the fold outs. If you see someone load the gun, it is time to go lethal.

In universe 99% of witches and wizards cant point cast anything, they use wand movements and words, i.e. load their guns.

IN real life people are allowed to carry guns and even bring them out with other people around without everyone thinking it's a lethal attack. However if you are arguing with someone in anger, and then one of you pulls our your gun/knife...it's go time. Even if they were never going to shoot you, it is a threatening gesture. Hogwarts is much much to lenient on students attacking one another with deadly weapons.

One of your other examples is everyone is ok with Harry,Fred and George pranking people. I am firmly on the opinion that pranking people is definitely wrong, and should Draco/Slytherins feel threatened would be in their right to attack back. It's just a prank bro is not an excuse.

#+end_quote

A wand is basically a physical representation of a wizard's magic, it seems. Strictly supervising a child's use of it would be a bit like leashing them. Maybe necessary for some cases, but the older they get, the more insulting and humiliating it is.

#+begin_quote
  Or is it just a multitool and no one bothers when someone points a want towards them?
#+end_quote

Seeing as it's the weapon of choice of both militaries and terrorists, it's certainly more than just a multi-tool. Just like many things in the real world, it's dependent on familiarity and trust. If a mother points her wand at her kid, no big deal, she's just going to wipe stray bit of bbq sauce off their chin or cast a warming charm, something like that. If a stranger in a dangerous place points a wand at someone, they'd best treat it as if the next words out of the stranger's mouth are going to be "bombarda".

Think of it this way: is it okay for someone to grab your arm? It's not a yes or no answer, it depends on the situation and the person in question.

Yes that's part of my point, but even so that doesn't mean it's unacceptable in certain situations. For example, it's a bouncer's job to do things like that. It's uncommon, but I've also seen people reach out and lightly grab/squeeze a mostly-stranger's arm in the middle of a friendly conversation.

I'm not talking about just strangers though. Grabbing a friend or family member's arm is often totally fine. Kids certainly do that all the time.

It's rather unlikely that you'd go to jail for grabbing a girl's arm then letting it go. But if you held on as she told you to stop, and others had to intervene? Yeah, you get penalized.

*Edit:* Shoot him dead was a bit flippant. It would be better to say put up a shield, and be ready to shoot him. Or just teleport away, if that's an option.

Or in different words: Not all tools are weapons, but all weapons are tools. Now the wand is probably the most amazing multitool in existence, as it can manipulate the fabric of reality in a multitude of ways. A lot of these ways include possibilities of inflicting harm.

I do think that, in general, pointing a wand at someone is at least rude, and depending on context may be interpreted as possible threat, or benevolent action (healing,...). But doing so without clear intent communicated is something a wizard or witch should not do if they want to be socially acceptable.
