....or something along those lines.


** linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) - Fed up of the incompetence and corruption running within the Ministry's halls, Albus Dumbledore comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against Voldemort and the Ministry, he knows he needs an ally. Someone, who like him, is capable of striking terror in their enemy's heart just by hearing their name.

** There's one called "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure" or something similar, in which an AU!Dumbledore replaces the canon one and absolutely starts breaking the man's habit of fucking shit sideways.

There are often scenes at the end that show Dumbledore being forced to watch as the new guy starts fixing everything, while being taunted by the ghosts he got killed.

Very good, but I don't think it's gotten to canon /yet/.
