***** Not that I can recall; I was quite impressed with the creative solution even /if/ you constrained it to a highly special case of your main character's circumstances.

****** Thanks. I thought it would be a fun way to get rid of him, without completely committing to it. Dumbledore is a really fun character to write, and I wanted to fully utilize him in a way that I thought broke the trend.

**** Though Voldemort probably had more to fear from Dumbledores slayer, her signifiant other, and her â€˜mentor'. Lol it's a really good fic I would definitely read it

** Funny, I am linking to this one fix twice in two different threads: linkao3(Becoming Harriet). Pretty nice story, which is hurt by too much pornography (it would be pretty good story even without it, and no I am not against sex per se, but here it tears continuity of the story). One of the side episodes is that Dumbledore dies and all professors in Hogwarts (and fem!Harry and Neville are on it as well) hide this event as long as possible to prevent too early attack by Voldy.
