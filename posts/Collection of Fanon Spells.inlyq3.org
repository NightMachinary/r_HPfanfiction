Just curious if anyone has put together a list of fanon spells that HP fanfiction authors have created over the years. If no, can you provide some examples of useful fanon spells that can be used in battle or duels?

Thank you.


** I loved the ones from The Tinkerer:

#+begin_quote
  "It's not really a Notice-Me-Not," Becca said. "It's actually a Just-Humor-Me Charm. They think we're wearing silly costumes, but they'll never wonder why. Also they can't really make out what, exactly, we're saying, even though it sounds like perfectly normal English to them. We used to have a regular Notice-Me-Not, but people would sometimes bump into you. This works better in the city."
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  "That's just Our Lady the Saint of Mischief's Why-Try Charm working on you," Becca explained.

  "It prevents people from trying to solve a problem," Tosha explained. "In this case, it's making you think that even with magic you'll never be able to get through this corridor. You probably feel like just giving up and going back to bed, right?"

** Terraeunda, the fire whip, the bread slicer (and everything about the Tweeny Twig's Guide for Young Domestics, ‚Äúa compendium of archaic household spells from what looked like the eighteenth century‚Äù), etc.

There is a lot of /creative/ uses for a lot of spells and transfigurations, really.

(Honestly, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] is my favorite.)

** I just read a fic last night called Love in a Time of The Zombie Apocalypse (highly recommend, if you are Dramione trash like myself), and Harry created a chainsaw spell that Hermione used to split a zombie in half.

** I've recently started both collecting other's spells and coming up with my own. Here's a few that might be cool in a battle:

Combustum Aeros :: The Burning-Air curse. Causes a person's skin to burn on contact with air. Makes breathing rather difficult.

Wrecendes Wind :: The Wrecend Wind spell. An Old English spell that creates a blast of wind that will both drive back an enemy and flay their skin a bit.

Ambulo Quartusum :: The fourth direction charm. Causes the user to walk along the forth physical dimension. Useful to get past obstacles, and can actually be used to sneak into places undetected because you physically don't exist in the standard three dimensional space.

** Anything to do with wards is fanon! For battles and duels, I think the piercing hex/curse is fanon? Not totally sure.

I'd love if there was a list like this, I think it's fascinating to track appearances of stuff like that. Spells, characters, tropes.

*** The term ward is fanon, but given that it is a common fantasy trope, you can say ward and everyone gets it. Or would you prefer if the author used "protective enchantments or spell on a object which in most cases is stationary in nature".

** My favourite has to be the Dire Misfortune Curse. It's described as Malaclaw venom in curse form with the victim suffering non lethal misfortune for two weeks. It won't kill you but you'll wish you were dead.

** Spells? I got some spells...

Spider Touch charm - Arachnitacta - gives target ability to stick their hands and feet to surfaces at will; takes practice to use properly

Cauterizing hex - Exuro viscus - literally burn flesh, it is used to seal wounds, though it does leave a scar

Transcription charm - Legendisce - it means 'learn by reading', in a way

Ragdoll Hex - Mortuus Lacertosus - translated as 'Deaden Muscles'. Unlike a petrify, the body is limp and moveable and can feel everything, but also unlike a petrify the caster must keep the hex on the target or the effect fades quickly (just not immediately)

Zipper-making spell - Obfirma Yoshi - creates a fucntional zipper in a layer (or layers) of fabric; also obfirma tergus yoshi - zippering for leather, which also works on skin to gruesome effect

Animagus revealing spell - Restituo Clementia - restore humanity

Creeping Paralysis hex - Rigor Tergum - 'Freeze flesh', an alternative to Petrificus Totalus better suited to healing. It petrifies the area at the point of contact. The longer the wizard holds the spell on the target, the further the paralysis spreads. Better than Full Body-bind in that a strong and focused wizard could use it to petrify any beast, no matter how large

Blood Clotting spell - siccarus cruor - stops the leak by extracting moisture; siccarus can also be used to make jerky and dried fruit

Stasis charm - Tempus Adversor - Prevents age or rot; usually used on prepared food, but the caster is not informed how long the effect will last

Numbing charm - Torpeo - very useful in healing

Aging charm - Vicis Sarcina - spell to make target appear older, usually around year per twist

Potion-aging charm - Ars Vicis Sarcina - accelerates the effect of a temporary transfiguration (5 minutes per twist), developed as a counter to polyjuice when refinements made it easier to store and use as a lozenge

** Um, I know a couple but a few of them are a little gore, you have been warned!

/cutis filum -/ Peals skin like a ribbon into wire-like strands

/fulmencio/- a bolt of lightning erupts from the wand

/hominum evanesca -/ It is a forced apparition jinx and forces the victim to apparatate to a location of the user's choice.

/Exanimo/ - Suffocating curse

/Obstruco Deripio/ - A mutilating curse used to permanently remove limbs.

/Depletura/ - Bloodletting curse which causes the victim to bleed out from all ouifices.

/Umbrania Maximus -/Modified shadow paralysis spell that causes shadows to rise up and restrain the victim. Counter curse is lumos.

/Cavea Emendo -/ Vanishes the ribcage

/Glacies Trabem -/Enchanted ice is expelled from the wand that can be controlled by the user.

/Iactatus Verse/ - It's a bright orange orb of light that is mostly used by miners and for digging tunnels.

/Duro/ - Turns objects into stone

/Evanesco/ - vanishing spell which vanishes the target into non-being

‚Äã

I hope these help!
