so i recently finished the runestone path and it did something i had never seen in another fanfiction with the rune style magic. it also did so many original ideas that it just left me wanting not the same but something similar. fanfics where harry does unique magic sets like battle transfiguration, parseltongue versions of spells that already exists causing them to differ, or even elemental magic. stories like those. or even stories where harry says 'why does nobody use magic modified muggle tech, like a magic?" i barley see stories like those that are Complete. if any of you have recommendations that would be great


** Well, complete doesn't necessarily mean good either. Just keep that in mind when you ask such questions. Also, I've always thought the term "battle transfiguration" or wizards using battle to describe any branch of magic was rather juvenille and lacking. But anyway, here's some unique magic in fics that are complete.

- Transfiguration, linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning): this is probably the quintessential transfiguration Harry story, even if it does sort of go a bit loopy later on. Still, this Harry remains consistently distant, which is nice. He modifies his own body permanently with magic too.
- Parsel Magic (gross), linkffn(A Cadmean Victory): Harry learns from Salazar Slytherin's portrait. Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is not complete, but is still active and includes the least stupid idea of this magic I've ever encountered. The Samsara spell was pretty cool too.
- Mind Magic, linkffn(The Mind Arts): Harry is loaded with incredible powers here, but his focus is always on the Mind Arts and learning from other sources, not complete but still updating.
- Runes/Curse-Breaking/Warding, linkffn(A Black Comedy; Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): both are classics that include a lot of breaking and entering and the minutia of defeating protections around magical locations in different manner, plus some good fights.
- Divination, linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): this is a controversial trilogy for a lot of reasons, but you can't deny that it makes heavy use of Harry's abilities in divination. It even manages to make a mentor!Trelawney work somehow (my favorite Trelawney in the fandom now that I think about it).
- Elemental Powers, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power): honestly this is just one, elemental powers are extremely common in the fandom (ex. The Mind Arts heavily features this as well), but more often than not they are used to simply overpower Harry in the stories.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]])

It's incomplete, but way too appropriate not to mention. DPSW is incredibly imaginative with existing magic and puts a new spin on it, including all kind of new stuff and expanding on things like necromancy.

#+begin_quote
  why does nobody use magic modified muggle tech, like a magic?
#+end_quote

All these questions and more are discussed in Methods of Rationality:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]])

This sub hates the fic though.

And last but not least:

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]]

It's only season 1, but it's complete, at least in the same way as a single book in the Potter series would be complete. The fic has lots of stuff that you might not like: H/Hr, Weasley bashing, soul-bonds, Lord Harry, OP!Harry, but it also has ritual magic, Parsel-magic, Necromancy, sex-magic, a really in depth magical culture that explains why Muggleborn often have difficulty, insane animagus transformations...
