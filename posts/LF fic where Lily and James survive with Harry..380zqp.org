Hey all,

I've been looking for a fanfiction I read years ago, and was hoping someone could help. Lily and James survive the attack by Voldemort, and somehow Harry and Hermione are bonded to each other. They all go to school, and get sorted into Slytherin, with James and Sirius both being teachers at the school.

If I remember correctly, Dumbledore is the villain of the story, but I could be mistaking that for a different story.

Thanks for the help!
