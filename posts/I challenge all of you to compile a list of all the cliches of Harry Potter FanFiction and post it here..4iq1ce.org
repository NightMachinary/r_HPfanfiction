*** List is pretty much on point. You forgot a few, though.

Draco is suave as hell (at age 13) and can pull any female or male in the wizarding world.

Amos Diggory is a terrible parent and forced Cedric to do everything.

Voldemort is suddenly sane for no apparent reason at all and just allows Harry to live.

**** Hmm, most fan fictions start at the start of Harry's fifth year, so Amos doesn't get mentioned often, in my experience.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

** Slytherins are master politicians at age 11, and plot inside their house as if it was the Wizengamot.

Slytherins are misunderstood noble souls who are bullied by the stupid bigoted Gryffindorks.

Muggleborns are stupid and don't understand pureblood culture or magic

*** Slytherins are master politicians? Generally they're stupid idiots who rape each other.

Only place I've ever seen that was the awesome HPMOR and was very well placed.
