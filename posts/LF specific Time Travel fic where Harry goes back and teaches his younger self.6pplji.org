He doesn't hide the fact that he's Harry and he mentions to "mini-me" that he once had a big black dog that he loved to bits but it got killed because he ran off to do something without thinking things through.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
