I've got a pretty long reading list of fics that I'm looking to read, but sometimes I just end up re-reading Seventh Horcrux, or A Black Comedy, among others. It's almost like rewatching a comfort sitcom TV show on Netflix rather than starting a new drama.

** Oh yeah. Sometimes you need something interesting, but without tension - no wondering if someone's gonna die, if a couple will get together, you already know because you've read it before.

I can't start new long fics (or books) in the evening, because that's how I end up staying up until 2 or 3 because I have to know what happens. Only re-reads before bed, because I can put those down.

*** I've convinced myself countless times over the past year that reading new fics before bed was a bad idea. And yet, just last month I ended up binging though the current chapters "The Reclamation of Black Magic" to find out it was almost 4am. :x

I've got a massive spreadsheet of every story I've read, usually finding them isn't too hard. Oddly enough, the ones I re-read are often not the most eloquently written, but they have a particular something about them that has me returning again and again.

** I basically search for new fics to read so I have more good stories to reread on a rainy day. That's what it feels like anyway. I love finishing a story and favouriting it so I know it's there when I inevitably need to find it again. There's a limited number of times you can reread the same story over a period of time after all. I often stop before getting to the end because there's no pressure to actually finish what I'm reading.

Before getting into fan fiction, I don't know how many times I read the Harry Potter books themselves.

Oh and there are certain stories that I actually enjoy more on the reread than the first time for whatever reason. Maybe once I know where it's going I can enjoy the journey more, maybe things that are revealed later make the earlier sections more impactful or maybe just my expectations were harming my experience on the first read.

** Only ALL the time, lol. I constantly find myself rereading fic I've read multiple times rather than starting one of the 30+ tabs of new fic I've got open. In all my fandoms of fic.

It really is nice to come back to something you know you enjoy and there's some comfort/safety in knowing how it all works out in the end no matter what's going on. Sometimes I just don't want to not know how things will end.

** I have never been able to re-read a fic, from start to finish. The most I got was "The Legacy" and I got bored after around 60% through. Which is funny for 2 reasons. I must've re-read HP, Percy Jackson (and the following series, HoO) The Inheritance Cycle and Red Rising about 10~20 times each, and also because The Legacy is hands down, in my top 3 favourite fics all-time. IDK why I can't enjoy re-reading fanfiction, but I'm happy that at least there's always a new fic to read, even if it takes a little bit of time to find what I enjoy.

** Yes but it's because despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of fics, I periodically run out of stuff to read. I'm pretty focused on Hermione fics or timetravel, and I /need/ it to be relatively well written which cuts 90% of fics, plus I generally ignore Dramione.. Sometimes I feel like traveling through filter after filter or on searching through threads here, but other times I rediscover something. Like now, I'm rereading Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire. It's been years so I've forgotten most details.
