I thought of what I think to be an interesting fic idea in which snape and Harry develop a mentor/parent relationship and I guess it could work as snarry but I hate snarry so..

Basically: During Harry's Occlumency lessons something goes wrong and a sort of mental link is created between the two. Over time this leads to snape learning things he didn't know before about Harry and Harry things he didn't know about Snape. After awhile they find they have grown to care for each other and face off the rest of the war together. If anyone has read a fic similar to this or starts writing one please send me a link in the replies :)
