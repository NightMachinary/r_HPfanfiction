:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I read this years ago and don't know if it's still on the site, but the premise was that after the 2nd war ended Hogwarts was in danger of closing (despite of McGonagall as headmistress) and so Harry took it upon himself to prevent that from happening - by declaring himself a dark lord in the daily prophet. (He wasn't a dark lord obviously, it was just a publicity stunt) As I recall it there was a series of this fanfic. Anyone know of the fic I'm looking for? Don't recall the title, unfortunately.


** You're looking for Lomonaaeren's Charming Universe, specifically Easy as Falling. It's also available on AO3.

  Harry doesn't really like the way things are going in the wizarding world. But who's going to do something about it?...Him, that's who! (Or, how Harry became a Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord).

  HPDM, mostly preslash. Harry really doesn't like the way things are going in the wizarding world right now. But who's going to do something about it? Him, that's who! Or, how Harry became a Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord. COMPLETE.
