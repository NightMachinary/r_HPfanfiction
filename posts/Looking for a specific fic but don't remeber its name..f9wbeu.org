:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I'm hoping that you'd be able to help me find a fic or at least point me in the right direction.

The fic itself is an old one. In it, Harry gets an extremely bitchy snake from diagon ally that ends up being an animangus and harry's older brother, who also reveals that Harry and him are both Voldemort's children. Unsure if it was ever finished or if it was deleted.

Thanks!
