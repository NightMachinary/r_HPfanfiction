Hi everyone,

I'm in the medical field of work and I was wondering if there was a fic which is about Harry in the hospital or just being a healer.

Thanks in advance!


** I remember one in which Harry has some kind of visible white magic he can control, and he uses it to create a cure for Lycanthropy. He becomes an even bigger star because of this, and then goes on to do other kinds of healing. That's all I can remember.

Edit: Looks like its /To Shape and Change/ linkffn(6413108) - I remember it being an okay story, fairly well written.

*** Thanks, the summary looks pretty nice. Normally I'm not into the whole Snape mentoring Harry thing but I like the idea that Snape, a potion master, teaches Harry potions and therefore also introduces him into the world of Wizard medicine.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life.

**** Yeah and the story is really really good it's just that he's not really much of a Healer in the story despite it being his chosen career.

***** I wouldnt say the slash is secondary in these, they are primarily romance fics. BUT the writing is some of the best in all of HP fanfic imo. I would recommend Sara's Girl fics to anyone, nomatter who they ship.

It's Bill/Harry, so if you don't like slash you might not enjoy it much. Although except in a couple of situations, it doesn't features heavily.
