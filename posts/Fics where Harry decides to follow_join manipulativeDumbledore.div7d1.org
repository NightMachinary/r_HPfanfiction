#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Well, if you'd be fine with it being Ron, linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) doesn't exactly have Manipulative! Dumbledore, but Utilitarian, sure. Give it a try.

*** 1.6 million words so far, damn! That's close to half again as many as the series and not done yet... Is it worth the time investment?

**** Honestly, in my opinion, no. It's basically a shitty OP-Harry, but with Ron instead. It has entire paragraphs dedicated to his friends lavishing praise on him and telling him how smart he is.

**** Definitely. It's the best Ron-centric fic I've read, with a fairly unique plot, good writing and characterisations, and consistent updates (like 1-3 times a week, usually mentioned by the author what day they'll update, which I find really nice).

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
