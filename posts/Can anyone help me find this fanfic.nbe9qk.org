** I posted the question elsewhere and someone said this home it helps I know exactly what you're referring to... I've seen it before. What I remember most is the scene where they react to Vane's love potion by having Hermione drag her into the RoR, polyjuice into her and hide her under the invisibility cloak, and then they pretend that Harry's been driven insane by the potion and "forces" her, Hermione then warning Vane in the aftermath not to say anything because the potion was illegal and she could just claim it was an intense RP session (which it technically even legit was), all to scare her off doing that again without getting the Aurors involved (cause then it would've meant Azkaban). God dammit I wish I could remember the name, I've tried multiple times (including one more just now) to find it and can't... please let me know if you find it.
